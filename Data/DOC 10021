'''Eklipse Sports Radio'''  was a Scottish-owned [[independent local radio]] station. It was based in [[Kinning Park]] on the Southside of [[Glasgow]] and broadcast to [[Fife]], and [[Central Belt|Central Scotland]]. All programming was produced in Glasgow.

The station ceased broadcasting on 29 February 2016 after the owners withdrew their financial support.

== History ==

The station was mooted in the Summer of 2013 when capacity became available on the Central Scotland multiplex and a five-year transmission contract was signed with [[Switch Scotland]]. The station's [[OFCOM]] broadcast licence was granted in July 2013 with a licensed format of sports news, talk and [[Classic rock]] music to a potential 2.7 million adults in the station's [[Total Survey Area|TSA]].

The company raised £40,000 in capital under the UK government's Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/management/40k-the-aim-for-new-scottish-sports-radio-station-1-3004440 |title=£40k the aim for new Scottish sports radio station |publisher=The Scotsman |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> although launch was delayed by the sudden death of a major investor in November 2013. In February 2014 the station moved into new studio premises in Admiral St in the Kinning Park area of Glasgow. The founding Station Director was Spencer Pryor. He sold his entire shareholding to a consortium of local businessmen and left the station in January 2015.
