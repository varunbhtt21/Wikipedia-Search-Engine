'''Jesse Law''' is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama ''[[Holby City]]'', played by actor [[Don Gilet]]. He first appeared in the [[Holby City (series 16)|series sixteen]] episode "Battle Lines", broadcast on 22 April 2014. Jesse arrives at Holby City employed as a [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] [[Anaesthetist]] working on the hospital's Keller ward. The show created a rich backstory for the character meaning he already knew three regular characters [[Guy Self]] ([[John Michie]]), [[Zosia March]] ([[Camilla Arfwedson]]) and [[Colette Sheward]] ([[Louise Delamere]]). Jesse and Guy share a professional history and close friendship as it was Guy who mentored Jesse after noticing his talent. He is characterised as a flirtatious, confident and cocky character. Professionally he is a highly skilled anaesthetist and possesses a strong bedside manner. His lack of humbleness has also created animosity with other characters.

Jesse's first romance storyline played out during his initial tenure. He begins a secretive relationship with Zosia. But when Guy discovers their affair he leaves disgraced. Producers soon brought the character back and Gilet was promoted to the show's regular cast. His return featured [[Jac Naylor]] ([[Rosie Marcel]]) rehiring him to work on the Darwin ward. Critics have mainly passed judgment over Jesse's persona during his first year on air. Katy Moon of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' branded him an "irresponsible medic", while her colleagues named him a "mischief-maker" and "brash consultant". A ''[[TV Choice]]'' writer assessed that Jesse has a "gung-ho attitude".

==Casting==
On 11 March 2014, it was announced that Gilet had joined the cast of playing Jesse Law. The character was billed as a new anaesthetist brought into the hospital by Guy Self ([[John Michie]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Stop press!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=15–21 March 2014|issue=10|pages=27|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]}}</ref> Gilet's agent was contacted with an invitation for him to play the character.

==Development==
===Backstory and characterisation===
Jesse and Guy share a professional history. Guy noticed Jesse's talent and became his mentor. The two are similar in their approach to work and have commonalities. Gilet has described Jesse as being Guy's wingman and together they took risks and aimed to be pioneers in their respective fields.<ref name=intone>{{cite web|title=New Holby star Don Gilet: 'Jesse works hard... and plays harder!|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/holby-city/news/new-holby-star-don-gilet-jesse-works-hard-and-plays-harder|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=16 April 2014}}</ref> He later compared their relationship to that of [[Star Wars]] characters [[Yoda]] and [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name=isone/> Jesse was forced to leave his previous job after sleeping with a patient.<ref name=review/> He is already acquainted with the characters [[Colette Sheward]] ([[Louise Delamere]]) and [[Zosia March]] ([[Camilla Arfwedson]]), the latter who refers to him as "uncle".<ref name=knows/>

{{cquote|Jesse is a quirky character. I'd like to think that he has a great bedside manner and he loves all aspects of the medical career that he's taken on. He loves working with people, and he loves the thought that he can help them with their wellbeing and make them better. Jesse has got a passion about what he does and he loves people. He is a driven guy and very much into pushing himself personally.|4=''Gilet describing his character''.<ref name=thedsint/>}}

Upon his arrival Jesse presents himself as "very confident, cocky and sure of himself".<ref name=intone/> His official character biography describes him as arrogant.<ref name=thedsint/> As a highly skilled anaesthetist he can show off his talent. He loves his career and works hard, but he also loves life and parties equally as hard.<ref name=intone/> He is very flirtatious and has a penchant for taking his bedside manner too far. Jesse is also unorthodox in his methods of practicing medicine. Gilet told Katy Moon from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that cocksure Jesse "believes in his own skill at saving lives. He loves his job."<ref name=isone>{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Katy|title=Jesse loves to be controversial!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=19–25 April 2014|issue=15|pages=41|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}</ref> His personality can be confusing as enjoys behaving in a controversial manner. Gilet believed that viewers would never be sure if to view him as dangerous or stable. He added "people try to put him in the box of ladykiller, player, or heart-throb, but he's not that two-dimensional.<ref name=isone/> Jesse's flaws are forgivable in Gilet's opinion. He has a "flip side" to his personality which is "puckish and mischievous" and there is an unpredictability about him. This contrasts to the serious approach he applies to his career.<ref name=thedsint/> Gilet later told [[Lorraine Kelly]] that Jesse is a thrill-seeker and free-wheeler living on the edge. But he warned that his character's ways could lead to disaster and danger.<ref>{{cite web|title=From Albert Square to Holby City|url=http://www.itv.com/lorraine/showbiz/don-gilet-holby-city-eastenders|website=[[itv.com]]|publisher=([[ITV plc]])|accessdate=28 October 2014|date=8 July 2014}}</ref> From Jesse's inception he faces animosity from Deputy CEO [[Serena Campbell]] ([[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]]). Gilet told Daniel Kilkelly ([[Digital Spy]]) that Serena prefers humbleness as opposed to Jesse praising his own professional skills.<ref name=thedsint/>

===Affair with Zosia March===

A reporter from the ''[[Grimsby Telegraph]]'' reported that the inclusion of patient Lindsey Kendal ([[Claire Sweeney]]) in Zosia's storyline would help develop a romance story with Jesse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spoiler alert: Veteran soap star Claire Sweeney appears as patient in tonight's Holby City|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/SPOLIER-ALERT-Veteran-soap-star-Claire-Sweeney/story-21181108-detail/story.html|website=[[Grimsby Telegraph]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]])|accessdate=28 October 2014|date=3 June 2014}}</ref> It begins with casual flirting. But when Jesse offers advise on how to treat patient, Lindsey, they share a kiss in the locker room.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kiss me!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=31 May – 6 June 2014|issue=21|pages=27|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}</ref> Arfwedson told a ''What's on TV'' reporter that Zosia was delighted by Jesse's appointment as Holby's latest anaesthetist. She added that they are already both fond of each other and often flirt.<ref name=wotinterview/> When Lindsey marks Zosia bedside manner low, Jesse teases her. The actress noted "Jesse's the only one who can tease Zosia and make her laugh and he doesn't give in to her demands, which is even more attractive to her." Arfwedson believed there was much chemistry between Jesse and Zosia. But it is fellow character [[Dominic Copeland]] ([[David Ames (actor)|David Ames]]) helps Zosia realise her attraction to Jesse. Following Jesse's tormenting the "predatory" character becomes "very animalistic" and pounces on Jesse, making her feelings clear.<ref name=wotinterview>{{cite web|title=Holby City's Camilla Arfwedson: 'Zosia pounces on Jesse!'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/holby-city/news/holby-citys-camilla-arfwedson-zosia-pounces-on-jesse|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=28 October 2014|date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

The pair continue their affair in secret but it soon becomes problematic.<ref name=zosia/> Arfwedson told Katy Moon (''Inside Soap'') that Jesse really gets Zosia. She is characterised as an "ice queen" but she just "melts around him". When Jesse distances himself from Zosia, she tries to win him back with negative consequences. The actress detailed the scenes in which Zosia sneaks into an important neurological operation to be close to him. But Jesse cannot cope with her distraction and she kisses him. But the move causes "everything to blow up in her face".<ref name=zosia/> The episodes which aired in July feature Jesse ending his relationship with Zosia for good when she becomes too serious about their future. But when Guy finds out about their affair he punches Jesse and he leaves Holby City.<ref name=not>{{cite web|last1=Power|first1=Vicky|title=Holby City's Camilla Arfwedson: 'My parents wanted me to be a doctor'|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/491413/Holby-City-actress-Camilla-Arfwedson-plays-Zosia-March|website=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=([[Northern & Shell]])|accessdate=28 October 2014|date=26 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=bed/> Arfwedson assessed that Guy could not accept Zosia and Jesse because the latter "is such a player" and has been sleeping with his daughter.<ref name=zosia/>

===Return===
Jesse leaves ''Holby City'' following the outing of his affair with Zosia. But an ''Inside Soap'' writer reported that the character would return to the show. They added that his return would be a "bitter pill" for both Jesse and Guy.<ref name=a1>{{cite journal|title=Many Holby returns!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=26 July – 1 August 2014|issue=29|pages=15|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}</ref> Jesse returns during the episode airing on 28 October 2014 and was credited as a regular cast member.<ref name=returnep/><ref>{{cite web|title=Don Gilet|url=http://www.cam.co.uk/_contentElements/Program/Handlers/Fetch.ashx?type=cv&id=100713&name=Don+Gilet|website=cam.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2014|format=PDF}}</ref> Having previously been posted on Keller ward, upon his return Jesse resumes work on Darwin ward.

Gilet told a ''What's on TV'' reporter that the situation between Jesse and Guy should not have ended so abruptly. So Jesse feels that there is "unfinished business there" but foremost he wants to do his job.<ref name=returns/> When Jac employs him, Guy is forced to accept his employment because he knows what Jesse is capable of professionally and wants the best for the hospital. While working on Darwin the character becomes assigned to cardiothoracic registrar [[Mo Effanga]] ([[Chizzy Akudolu]]). Gilet said that Jesse and Mo share the same work related chemistry that he had with Guy. But Mo does not trust him and he tries to earn it. He added that Jesse helps Mo in theatre and encourages her to adopt his risk taking approach to surgery.<ref name=returns>{{cite web|title=Holby's Don Gilet: 'Jesse's back to remind everyone he's good at his job'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/holby-city/news/holbys-don-gilet-jesses-back-to-remind-everyone-hes-good-at-his-job|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=28 October 2014|date=23 October 2014}}</ref>

==Reception==
A writer from ''[[TV Choice]]'' chose Jesse's arrival in their "pick of the day" feature. They observed that Jesse is not afraid to exploit his friendship with Guy to further his career and said he has a "gung-ho attitude".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Today's choice|journal=[[TV Choice]]|date=19–25 April 2014|issue=17|pages=46|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}</ref> Jamie Downham of [[Yahoo!]] called him a "cheery new doc" and praised the "upbeat tempo" Gilet added to the show. But he felt the lady-trilling and singing doctor was not the most original of characters. He also compared Jesse to previous character [[Antoine Malick]] ([[Jimmy Akingbola]]), branding them both "crazy but brilliant maverick weirdos".<ref name=review>{{cite web|last=Downham|first=Jamie|title=Holby City: We meet Don Gilet’s new character, Dr Jesse Law|url=https://uk.tv.yahoo.com/holby-city-meet-don-gilet-character-dr-jesse-194700914.html|work=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=22 April 2014}}</ref> Jane Simon of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' noted that Jesse was completely different to Gilet's previous role, ''[[EastEnders]]'' murderer [[Lucas Johnson]].
