*'''Delete''' I find all the SPA's protesting on the talk page amazing! Should an SPI be opened? [[User:Origamite|Origamite]]<sup>[[User talk:Origamite|\(·_·\)]][[Special:Contributions/Origamite|(/·_·)/]]</sup> 16:49, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - web article of unclear notability, lacking significant RS coverage. The Louis Gray ref is the only independent ref; it is a blog, and too brief to be considered significant coverage. A search turned up no RS coverage.[[User:Dialectric|Dialectric]] ([[User talk:Dialectric|talk]]) 03:41, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
