The '''El Dorado Commercial Historic District''' encompasses the historic commercial heart of downtown [[El Dorado, Arkansas]].  The city serves as the seat of [[Union County, Arkansas|Union County]], and experienced a significant boom in growth during the 1920s, after oil was discovered in the area.  The business district that grew in this time is anchored by the [[Union County Courthouse (Arkansas)|Union County Courthouse]], at the corner of Main and Washington Streets, where the [[El Dorado Confederate Monument|Confederate memorial]] is also located.  The [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003 includes the city blocks surrounding the courthouse, as well as several blocks extending east along Main Street and south along Washington Street.  Most of the commercial buildings are one and two stories in height and are built of brick.  Notable exceptions include the [[Exchange Bank (El Dorado, Arkansas)|Exchange Bank]] building, which was, at nine stories, the county's first skyscraper, and the eight-story Murphy Oil building.  There are more than forty contributing properties in the district.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/UN0226.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for El Dorado Commercial Historic District|publisher=Arkansas Preservation|accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>
