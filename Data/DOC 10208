Title : Aphrodisia
Text : {{for|the settlement|Aphrodisia (town)}}
The '''Aphrodisia''' festival ([[Ancient Greek]]: 'Αφροδίσια) was an annual festival held in [[Ancient Greece]] in honor of the goddess of love and beauty, [[Aphrodite Pandemos|Aphrodite]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀφροδίτη Πάνδημος). It took place in several Ancient Greek towns, but was especially important in [[Attica]] and on the island of [[Cyprus]], where Aphrodite was celebrated with a magnificent celebration. The festival occurred during the month of Hekatombaion, which modern scholars recognize as starting from the third week in July to the third week of August on the [[Gregorian calendar]]<ref> Wikipedia article | ([[Attic calendar]])</ref>. Aphrodite was worshipped in most towns of Cyprus, as well as in [[Cythera (island)|Cythera]], [[Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Delos]], and [[Elis]], and her most ancient temple was at [[Paphos]]. Textual sources explicitly mention Aphrodisia festivals in [[Corinth]] and in [[Athens]], where the many prostitutes that resided in the city celebrated the festival as a means of worshipping their patron goddess.<ref name=":0" /> Though no textual sources expressly mention an Aphrodisia festival in Cythera, Thebes, or Elis, it likely occurred since textual and iconographical sources indicate that Aphrodite Pandemos had a cult following in these areas. The Aphrodisia festival was one of the most important ceremonies in Delos, though we do not know much about the details of the celebration. The inscriptions merely indicate that the festival required the purchase of ropes, torches and wood, which were customary expenses of all Delian festivals.<ref>Irene Ringwood Arnold, ''Local Festivals at Delos'', American Journal of Archaeology Vol. 37, No. 3 (Jul. - Sep., 1933), pp. 452-458 (viewed through [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/498958?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=local&searchText=festivals&searchText=at&searchText=delos&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlocal%2Bfestivals%2Bat%2Bdelos%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff JSTOR])</ref>

== Festival rituals ==

What we know about the rituals of the Aphrodisia festival is consistent with Aphrodite's representation in iconography and text. For example, the first ritual of the festival would be to purify the temple with the blood from a dove, which we know is the sacred bird of Aphrodite. Afterwards, worshipers would carry sacred images of the goddess, as well as [[Peitho]], in a procession to be washed. In Cyprus, participants who were initiated into the Mysteries of Aphrodite were offered salt, a representation of Aphrodite's connection to the sea, and bread baked in the shape of a phallus. Aphrodite's connection to the sea is well-documented, and originates in [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]], where he refers to her as the "foam-born goddess."<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0130:card=173 Hesiod, Theogony, (lines 173-205)], Perseus Digital Library</ref> During the festival it was not permitted to make bloody sacrifices, since the altar could not be polluted with the blood of the sacrifice victims, which were usually white male goats. This of course excludes the blood of the sacred dove, made at the beginning of the ritual to purify the altar. In addition to live male goats, worshipers would offer fire, flowers, and incense.<ref>Lucian, ''Dial. Meret.'' 7; comp. Xenoph. ''Sympos.''</ref> The white male goat is also a consistent symbol in the worship of Aphrodite Pandemos. She was often represented in iconography riding on a male goat, which was known to be a carnal symbol. [[Pausanias of Athens|Pausanias]], an Athenian character from [[Plato]]'s [[Symposium]] wittily remarked, "The meaning of the tortoise and of the he-goat I leave to those who care to guess,"<ref>Andrea Alciato, Emblemata / Les emblemes (1584).</ref> slyly implying the sensual nature of Aphrodite's representation.

== Aphrodite Pandemos ==

In the 4th century, [[Attic]] philosophers drew a distinction between Aphrodite [[Urania]], a celestial Aphrodite who represented higher, or transcendent spiritual love, and [[Aphrodite Pandemos]], a goddess representing earthly, non-spiritual love. Aphrodite Pandemos translates to "common to all the people," and her realm of influence extends beyond sensual pleasures to civic and interpersonal harmony.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Worshipping Aphrodite: Art and Cult in Classical Athens|last=Rosenzweig|first=Rachel|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0472113323|location=Ann Arbor|pages=13-26, 71}}</ref> She also implicitly unites the population into a singular social or political body with the notion of commonality amongst all people. Her worship in Athens in is attributed to [[Theseus]], who was considered the founder of a shrine to Aphrodite and [[Peitho]] in [[Agora]], which he established to thanks the goddesses for their assistance with uniting the scattered tribes of Attica into one political and social body of Athenians in what was known as the [[synoikismos]] ("dwelling together").<ref>Walker, Henry J., Theseus and Athens, Oxford University Press (US 1995)</ref> [[Peitho]], the goddess of persuasion, was also worshipped during the Attic Aphrodisia.<ref name=":0" /> Preparations for the festival may have included the sacrifice of doves to purify the temple and alter, washing the statues, coating the temple roof in pitch, and the acquiring purple cloth. Some scholars speculate that the festival took place on the fourth day of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]] (mid July-mid August), near the beginning of the Attic new year.<ref name=":0" />

== Contemporary Aphrodisia ==

In modern times, followers of [[Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism]] still celebrate the festival of Aphrodisia over a three-day period on the 4th of Hekatombaion of the [[Attic calendar|Attic Calendar]], which falls somewhere between the months of July and August on the Gregorian calendar. Additionally, the fourth day of each month is considered a sacred day for both Aphrodite and her son Eros. These modern day followers of Ancient Greek religion recreate Aphrodisia and other ancient festivals in groups and in solitary worship.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
