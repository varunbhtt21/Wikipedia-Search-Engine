The '''Parsons Studio and Casino''' is a historic house on Parsons Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  The oldest portion of this [[Shingle style]] house was built c. 1903 by Georgianna Parsons, and was originally located near the [[Corey Farm|Maplecote]] property down the hill from its present site.  In 1960 it was dragged by sled up the hill, where it has commanding views of [[Mount Monadnock]] and other area hills.  It was sensitively extended in both 1967-68 and 1973-74.  Its original use was as an entertainment hall ("casino"), and was later converted into an artist's studio.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004058}}|title=NRHP nomination for Parsons Studio and Casino|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>
