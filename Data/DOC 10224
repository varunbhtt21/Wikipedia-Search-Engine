== Description ==
'Cécile Brünner' has small double flowers, developing from high-centered buds to form pom-poms with a diameter of 2 to 6.5&nbsp;cm (0.75 in to 2.5 in). Their pink colour fades from the outside with age, resulting in pale pink edges with yellow undertones and a deeper pink center.<ref name="ph" /> The flowers appear abundantly in large clusters throughout the season and are moderately scented.

The shrub is short but vigorous, with very few prickles, smooth, mid green leaves, and a height of 60 to 120&nbsp;cm at an average width of 60&nbsp;cm. 'Cécile Brünner' tolerates shade and poorer soils, is very disease resistant and winter hardy up to −26&nbsp;°C ([[USDA zone]] 5b).<ref name="helpmefind" /> 'Cécile Brünner' can also be grown as a garden plant or in pots and greenhouses and is available in commerce.<ref name="ph" />

== Sports ==
[[File:Rosa 'Cécile Brünner CL.' Hosp. 1894 RPO.jpg|thumb|left|'Climbing Cécile Brünner', Hosp 1894]]
Several [[sport (botany)|sports]] of 'Cécile Brünner' were introduced, including climbing forms ('Mlle Cécile Brünner Cl.' discovered by Franz P. Hosp of Riverside, California in 1894 and 'Cécile Brünner Cl.' discovered by Richard Ardagh in Australia in 1904), a dwarf white-flowered form ('White Cécile Brünner', introduced by Fraque in 1909<ref name=P&R/>), and deeper pink variants (e.g. 'Mme Jules Thibaud'). The climbing sports normally grow 6 m tall and 3 m wide, but can reach a height of up to 10 m. Their flowers strongly resemble those of 'Cécile Brünner', and appear in a single flush in early summer with a few scattered later blooms.<ref name=beales>{{cite book |title=Rosen – meine Leidenschaft |publisher= [[Christian Verlag]] |author= Peter Beales |pages=74, 227 |isbn= 3-88472-646-3 |language= German |trans-title=Peter Beales - A Passion fFor Roses|date=2004}}</ref> The climber tolerates half shade and can develop some globose, orange hips.<ref name="ph" />

Recently, it was confirmed by DNA analyses that 'Spray Cécile Brünner' (Howard Rose, 1941) is identical with the plants now grown under the name of the cultivar 'Bloomfield Abundance' (Thomas, 1920) and is a sport of 'Cécile Brünner', not related to the original 'Bloomfield Abundance' which was a hybrid seedling of 'Sylvia' and 'Dorothy Page-Roberts'.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Investigating the Identity of Rose Varieties Utilizing Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) Analysis |author1=Angela Lewis |author2=Mary Caroniti |author3=And Nancy Morvillo |chapter-url=http://fshs.org/proceedings-o/2004-vol-117/312-316.pdf |title=Proceedings of the Florida State Horticultural Society |year=2004 |volume=117 |pages=312–316}}</ref>
