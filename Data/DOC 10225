The result was    '''delete'''. While it appears the airline was at least ''planned'' to exist, and the photograph doesn't ''appear'' to be a photoshop, there seems to be consensus that we cannot [[WP:V|verify]] that it ever operated. If sources turn up that it operated on a scheduled route (and thus is notable), ping me and I can undelete.

Reason [[User:Monopoly31121993|Monopoly31121993]] ([[User talk:Monopoly31121993|talk]]) 15:02, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
I have listed various reasons on this article's talk page. I think it's a fake airline and none of the links listed work. This seems very similar to another fake Congolese airline I found last week called Skyfly airlines.
* '''Delete''': Not sure if it was a [[WP:HOAX|hoax]] from the start but it fails [[WP:GNG|notability]]. Article created by a [[User talk:FoxyOrange|retired user]] after a name change.

*'''Delete''' I did some checking and there is nothing reliable out there. Even the company web site url http://stellarairways.com on the FlightGlobal blog post has nothing of relevance on it. The Aviation Safety network went as far as to ban it from EU airspace in 2011: http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=9211 so maybe it technically existed back then, who knows. Probably another scam, certainly non-notable. &mdash; Cheers, [[User:Steelpillow|Steelpillow]] ([[User Talk:Steelpillow|Talk]]) 17:51, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' certainly existed as images of CS-TQS exist in Stellar scheme if you search, it was flown to Congo to start a wet-lease on 30 October 2011 but appears to have returned to Lisbon on 12 November. No evidence that any services were actually flown so not really notable. [[User:MilborneOne|MilborneOne]] ([[User talk:MilborneOne|talk]]) 08:28, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
**'''Comment''': Based on what I found in the wayback machine, they did have a timetable and their website was still up in April 2012 (check date of "weekly timetable") May 2012 (check date of "Contact Us" link) - Are there cases of airlines not flying still maintaining websites? Maybe some French-speaking editors can help us here... [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 09:20, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - Did a search on flightglobal.com and this says it "began operations" with a leased A320:
*: Gubisch, Michael. "[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/congolese-start-up-stellar-leases-a320-from-white-airways-364530/ Congolese start-up Stellar leases A320 from White Airways]." ''[[Flight Global]]''. 9 November 2011. - I'll see what I can find
*[[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 08:51, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment''': I'm also able to get archives of the official website from the [[Wayback Machine]] so combined with the [http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/groups/fleet_and_orders_gossip_shop/blog/archive/2011/11/10/airline-start-ups-stellar-airways-plans-services-from-kinshasa.aspx post here] I think the airline is real. Also I found a YouTube clip of a French-language (I guess Congolese) news broadcast about the airline: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmLooHBOBfg - Hopefully some French language newspapers will talk about it [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 08:55, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* The TV broadcast line stated "Digital Congo Le Journal" so I'll check archives of the website to see if they have any articles. I will certainly vote keep if/when I find one more article (other than the one by Michael Gubisch) [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 09:18, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* I did a site search for http://www.digitalcongo.net (which has Congolese news articles) but I haven't found anything... [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 09:33, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - With images like [http://img.planespotters.net/photo/227000/original/CS-TQS-Stellar-Airways-Airbus-A320-200_PlanespottersNet_227759.jpg this] It's obvious the airline does exist ....Just isn't notable.

**'''Comment''': It may help to state why it's not notable. ''[[Flight Global]]'' did write an article on the airline starting operations, but I do want to see if Congolese newspapers say anything about the airline. [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 13:28, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''':I think what we've found is that the airline, if it ever DID exist, only existed for a very short while (days).[[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]], thank you again for your help on this and there is one new thing that I think is also noteworthy: The French Wikipedia page, which [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]], you created, probably back when you were editing the English version of the page is almost non-existant which is strange considering Congo is a French speaking country. I would suggest also nominating that page for deletion as well and I'm not sure if it's possible to do the same for the one created in Bahasa Indonesian because it was created by a user who is now banned ([[User:Pengguna:Aldo samulo|Pengguna:Aldo samulo]]).[[User:Monopoly31121993|Monopoly31121993]] ([[User talk:Monopoly31121993|talk]]) 15:52, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
**'''Comment''': It may be good to wait for the decision on EN. Anyway, the thing about the DRC is that it is officially a Francophone country but it is very poor and has low internet access. I don't know what % of DRC citizens actually speak French or how many have internet access. On the French Wikipedia the vast majority of editors are from France. [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 16:13, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': It seems the company and management were an offshoot of [https://www.zauba.com/company/STELLAR-AVIATION-SOLUTIONS-PRIVATE-LIMITED/U74900DL2009PTC188897 Stellar Aviation Solutions Pvt Ltd], out of New Delhi, which was still around in 2013. The president is the same for both. [[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] <small>[[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|<font color="red" face="Papyrus">come howl!</font>]]</small> 19:13, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
**If I can get sources about the parent company, should they count towards this article? [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 05:24, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
***Perhaps, if they refer to the DRC company, but they might also support an extended article, moved to address the parent. It depends on what the sources say.[[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] <small>[[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|<font color="red" face="Papyrus">come howl!</font>]]</small> 06:44, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
****I don't see any mentions to "Stellar Airways" on the "stellar Aviation Consultancy" webpage (http://www.stellar-aviation.com/services.html). As far as I can tell this is just a consultancy group based in India run by two former airline employees, not a parent company of any airlines. This seems pretty clear, the airline almost certainly never operated flights, never actually possessed an airplane and certainly didn't operate most or any of the routes they claim to on the Wikipedia pages here. I stick to the theory that this is a fake airline just like the Congolese SkyFly Airlines whose Wikipedia presence was simply designed to fool naive investors into lending them money which they used to get a leasing company to paint a plane they never delivered and put a few photos on the internet to make it seem real. It's possibly this was an Indian scam but I think it's clear it was a scam.[[User:Monopoly31121993|Monopoly31121993]] ([[User talk:Monopoly31121993|talk]]) 08:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*****{{comment}}: Often when there is a fake airline there are sources giving accusations of it. For instance [[Metis Transpacific Airlines]] pretty much was a scam airline and there are sources covering the scam itself (including one from a local news station in the US). Should I ask a French speaking editor to watch the Congolese news broadcast? Maybe that can clarify some things and give clues on whether there would be more sources or where we could find them: [[Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Language#French_help:_What_does_this_news_broadcast_say_about_.22Stellar_Airways.22_.28Congolese_airline.29]] and [[:fr:Wikipédia:Bistro_des_non-francophones#Help_requested_to_find_French_language_sources_about_Stellar_Airways]] - Whenever there is a deletion query that is likely to concern another language it's good to reach out to speakers of that language to get more information [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 15:31, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{comment}} Re-post from the French Wikipedia [[:fr:Wikipédia:Bistro_des_non-francophones#Help_requested_to_find_French_language_sources_about_Stellar_Airways]]:
::"The video says : « A new airline companie just been launches in RDC, '[[Stellar Airways]]', whose first aircraft arrived in Congo not long ago [...]. The official lauch ceremony took place in the town of [[Gombe (Kinshasa)|La Gombe]]. [...] It will fly 5 city : Kisangani, Mbujimayi, Goma, Lubumbashi and Kinshasa »
::After that it's just communication message from the company.
::So they just received their first aircraft, and probably haven't made the first commercial fligth when this was broadcasted. I don't know the date tough.
::It seams to be [[Digital Congo TV]] ; their [http://www.digitalcongo.net/default.aspx website] is in French and English.
::As most French people I have very little knowledge of Congo soI have no idea if you can rely on that chanel.

:*"I watched the video; it's too long to transcribe now but the gist is about the launch of [[Stellar Airways]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

: {{comment}} - I find it very strange that there was a TV broadcast from Digital Congo, and yet ''I can't find any written articles about Stellar Airways on its official website'': http://www.digitalcongo.net/ - there are still articles from around 2011 that are there. I'll see if I can e-mail the people at Digital Congo. [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] ([[User talk:WhisperToMe|talk]]) 11:59, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
