== Controversy ==
On April 25, 2014 it was announced that Hundred Proof Club, Think Famous Productions, Akela Family and JDK Entertainment were suing Sony Music and King for fraud in the Sony and FIFA's SuperSong competition. The lawsuit claimed that the competition was rigged and that King, who co-wrote "Vida" was always going to win, cheating the other entrants out of their chance of winning the competition. Although the contest was open to applicants worldwide, King had a contractual agreement and Sony apparently asked King to enter the song "Vida": Sony allegedly pressured the plaintiffs to release King from his contract so that he would be eligible to win, in return for compensation.<ref name="lawsuit">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/sony-supersong-lawsuit_n_5201298.html|title=Sony Accused Of Fraud In FIFA World Cup SuperSong Contest|work=The Huffington Post|last1=Moreno|first1=Carolina|last2=Fridmann|first2=Mandy|date=April 23, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

The lawsuit alleges that Sony induced King’s release from his publishing contract and refused to pay compensation. The attorney Alicia Roman told ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', "[We’re looking to] annul the release due to the fraud they committed. When it’s annulled, all of the rights to Elijah’s songs are returned to my client, particularly the song 'Vida' that Ricky Martin sang." Martin has not made any comment on the lawsuit.<ref name="lawsuit"/> Additionally, Luis Adrian Cortes Ramos, a finalist from the [[Idol Puerto Rico (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Idol Puerto Rico]]'' filled a $10 million lawsuit towards Martin. He sued the singer for releasing "Vida" despite claims that he submitted his version of the track as part of SuperSong contest, a version that was never recognized. Ramos' lawyer released a statement saying "Ramos was surprised, disillusioned and suffered mental anguish because the song was almost identical to the one he composed. Until that moment, Martin was an idol for Ramos."<ref name="lawsuit2">{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/entertainment/celebrities_gossip/20140804_WENN_Ricky_Martin_sued_over_World_Cup_song_Vida.html|title=Ricky Martin sued over World Cup song Vida|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}</ref> However, Martin's representative never commented on the lawsuit.<ref name="lawsuit2"/>
