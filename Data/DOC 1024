==Production==
===Development===
Behl, who co-wrote and also assisted director [[Dibakar Banerjee]] in ''[[Love Sex aur Dhokha]] (LSD)'' (2010), started writing ''Titli'' as ''LSD'' neared completion. In 2011, the news report of a car-jacker gang in Delhi led by a local goon, Joginder Joga, inspired him to start working on the story of a thriller. However, as he developed the script, other themes started joining in, from his personal experiences growing up in the city.<ref name=exp>{{cite web | title = Ties That Bind |work= The Indian Express| url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/ties-that-bind-5/ |author= Dipti Nagpaul |date= 4 May 2014| accessdate = 13 May 2014 |pages=1–3}}</ref> Though he denied it being autobiographical, he mentioned in an interview that the idea of intra-family conflict was derived from his own clashes with his father as a rebellious teenager. He eventually co-wrote the script with Sharat Katariya, and it covered themes of patriarchy, family dysfunction, gender-based violence and oppression, and "a desire for freedom". Through the protagonist, the film also explores the circular nature of life – "how we often end up becoming exactly the person we are trying to run away from."<ref name=toi14>{{cite web | title = 'Titli' stems from personal experiences: Kanu Behl | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Titli-stems-from-personal-experiences-Kanu-Behl/articleshow/35068550.cms |date=13 May 2014| accessdate = 13 May 2014 | work = The Times of India }}</ref><ref name=business>{{cite web | title = Feeling of 'Titli' going to Cannes yet to sink in: Kanu Behl |work= Business Standard | url = http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/feeling-of-titli-going-to-cannes-yet-to-sink-in-kanu-behl-114051301480_1.html |date=13 May 2014| accessdate = 13 May 2014  }}</ref>

In 2012, the script of the film was selected for [[National Film Development Corporation of India|NFDC]] Film Bazaar's Screenwriter's Lab and won the ''Post-Production Award'' at Film Bazaar's Work-In-Progress Lab in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | title = YRF's Titli to compete at Cannes Film Festival|work=India Today | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/titli-cannes-film-festival-ranveer-shorey-yash-raj-films-guneet-monga/1/356371.html|date=13 May 2014|accessdate = 25 April 2014 }}</ref> Here it also won an award for ''Best Work-In-Progress Lab Project'' and was selected for ''Film Bazaar Recommends'', where the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]] selection committee first saw the film.<ref name=exp/>

===Filming===
For the lead roles, relative newcomers [[Shashank Arora]] and Shivani Raghuvanshi were selected. Actors Amit Sial and [[Ranvir Shorey]] were chosen to play the role of two elder brothers to Titli's character. Next, he decided to cast his own father Lalit Behl, who is a Delhi-based director and actor, for the role of the patriarch of the family, considering the film itself was based on his early life experiences.<ref name=exp/>

The film was shot across various locations in Delhi.<ref name=toi14/> During filming, he allowed the actors to explore the scenes and improvise as no scripts were brought to the set. The production team redesigned a house to give a claustrophobic feel to the family home, where much of the filming was done, to provide a contrast from the expansive real world outside, which the protagonist is trying to escape into. For this purpose, rooms were made smaller, the entrance was made labyrinthine, and even the natural light was reduced in the rooms, so that the tube light haze could add to the effect.<ref name=exp/>

By early May 2014, the movie's post-production was completed, ahead of its Cannes premiere due in the same month.<ref name=business/>

She called the film "an enjoyable, character-driven Indian yarn about an emotional family of criminals [that] gets better as it goes on."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/titli-cannes-review-705883|title='Titli': Cannes Review|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Brad Mariano of ''4:3'' "Recommended" the film, calling it "an impressive debut that is far from what one might expect from the Indian cinema", noting the influence of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s [[Italian neorealism|neo-realism]] and the "complex, impossible moral situations" of [[Asghar Farhadi]]'s films. He ended his review by calling it "a gripping debut film that could mark the arrival of a significant new voice in world cinema."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fourthreefilm.com/2014/08/titli/|title=Titli|date=12 August 2014|publisher=}}</ref> J Hurtado of ''[[Screen Anarchy]]'' wrote that while "scenes of people scraping the bottom of the barrel are nothing new in Hindi independent cinema, [...] Behl's treatment of the material is both heart-wrenching, and vividly relatable as everyone tries to make out the best way they can without leaving anything on the table." He called it "a film about hope, and it's overwhelming sadness only makes the hope shine brighter", despite its "dark"-ness and its "low opinion of some of those people who populate Delhi's backstreets."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenanarchy.com/2014/11/third-i-2014-review-titli.html|title=Third I 2014 Review: TITLI Watches The Ugly Caterpillar Emerge From Its Cocoon|date=19 November 2014|website=ScreenAnarchy}}</ref>

He wrote that the film-makers "don’t keep you at an objective distance. They challenge you to stop ignoring the so-called social blots, and once you’re sucked in, they make you believe that the injustice behind the rough exterior is systematic."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/movie-reviews/titli-review-this-is-the-best-hindi-film-of-the-year-so-far/story-upwdbFVhPQ95hrOFRwQM2L.html|title=Titli review: This is the best Hindi film of the year so far|date=30 October 2015|website=Hindustan Times}}</ref> Uday Bhatia of ''[[LiveMint]]'' called the film "unrelentingly grim, morally unmoored". He wrote that the "emotional and physical violence in Titli is wince-inducing, but even more oppressive is the atmosphere of mistrust and desperation that Behl and his co-writer Sharat Katariya build up."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/1ZO3bR5dhNmYcqITJMbjlO/Film-review-Titli.html|title=Film review: Titli|first=Uday|last=Bhatia|date=29 October 2015|website=Mint}}</ref> A more mixed review came from ''[[Filmfare]]'''s Rachit Gupta who called the film "a little too blunt and all too intentionally" despite its "serious" themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmfare.com/reviews/movie-review-titli-11017.html|title=Movie Review: Titli - filmfare.com|website=www.filmfare.com}}</ref>
