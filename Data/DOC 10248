Although there is one review at [[Allmusic]], it itself, this is a pretty unremarkable release of previously released music. There is nothing new here and coverage is very limited. The article services little purpose but the track listing. Per [[WP:NALBUMS]] it is not notable.

*'''Redirect''' to [[Britney Spears discography]] which mentions it: we don't need an article on every compilation of an artist's work, particularly when coverage is so limited and there's no substantial content. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 09:21, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
