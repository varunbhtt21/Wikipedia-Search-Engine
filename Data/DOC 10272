'''George Barnett''' (11 February 1876 – 10 April 1965) was an Irish historian, archaeologist, botanist, geologist, folklorist and poet. Self-taught, he acquired a vast knowledge of the [[Sperrins|Sperrin Mountains]] through experience, experimentation, observation, and traditional lore. He discovered many prehistoric sites, although he is best known for his discovery of the [[Beaghmore]] stone circles, and developed the theory that they were an ancient lunar observatory.<ref name=EEE>{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=E.E.|title=George Barnett: An appreciation|journal=Ulster Journal of Archaeology|volume=29|pages=1–5|year=1966}}</ref> This theory was expressed in his poem, ''The Beaghmore Stone Circles''.

== The Beaghmore Stone Circles ==
<poem>
Ceremonial occasions they often had there,
They knew every day, aye, and week in the year,
For fifty-two weeks they had stones in a ring,
Thirteen in a line for the time the call Spring.

The same for Summer, that time of great joy,
Twenty-six for the Autumn and Winter stands nigh,
Four stones that are bigger stand up in a line,
For midsummer sunrise and midwinter time.

One stone by the circle's a day it appears,
Another convenient makes out the leap years,
You can soon make them out, if you look the place o'er,
Twixt the eastern circle and mighty big four.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mawhinney|first=G.|title=Geordie's Jaunts: George Barnett's rhymes on his ramblings|publisher=Moyola Books|date=1996|isbn=1873345224}}</ref>
