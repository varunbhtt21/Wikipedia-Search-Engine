The '''Ivory Perry Homestead''' is a historic house at the corner of Valley and Dooe Roads in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  The oldest portion of this 2-1/2 story wood frame house dates to c. 1767, when Ivory Perry built a 1-1/2 story Cape style farmhouse.  In c. 1820 the building was enlarged, adding the second story and adding modest Federal styling.  The building's exterior was replaced in the early 1980s in a historically sensitive manner; the interior also has well-preserved 18th and 19th century details.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004061}}|title=NRHP nomination for Ivory Perry Homestead|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>

The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.<ref name="nris"/>
