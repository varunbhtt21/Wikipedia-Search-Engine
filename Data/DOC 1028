==Critical reception==
Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song a positive review, and praised Hill's harmony on the song. He stated that "Tim McGraw and his wife Faith Hill had beauty and style in excess, and that sincerity spilled into the first few rows. None of those qualities are lacking on this simply wonderful country ditty." He also praised Faith Hill's vocals, saying "together, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw have never missed. Each song they record together feels like a gift. They're strategic with when they share a studio, never doing so when the time and song isn’t right. The chorus of this song is a sing-along with familial roots. Anyone other than Hill would have almost been offensive."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/tim-mcgraw-feat-faith-hill-meanwhile-back-at-mamas/|title=Tim McGraw (Feat.
