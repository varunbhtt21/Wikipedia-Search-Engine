Australia has a long-standing association with the protection and creation of women's rights.  Australia was the second country in the world to give women the right to vote (after New Zealand in 1893) and the first to give women the right to be elected to a national parliament.<ref name="ausu">{{cite web |url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-suffragettes |title=Australian suffragettes |date=5 March 2010 |work=australia.gov.au |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=29 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420124631/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-suffragettes |archive-date=20 April 2014 |dead-url=no }}</ref> The Australian state of [[South Australia]], then a British colony, was the first parliament in the world to grant women full suffrage rights.<ref>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/milestone.htm Electoral Milestones for Women] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212103601/http://www.aec.gov.au/elections/australian_electoral_history/milestone.htm |date=2013-12-12 }}.

Australia has also been home to several prominent feminist activists and writers, including [[Germaine Greer]], author of ''[[The Female Eunuch]]''; [[Helen Garner]], author of ''[[The First Stone]]'', [[Julia Gillard]], former prime minister; [[Vida Goldstein]], suffragist; and [[Edith Cowan]], the first woman to be elected to an Australian parliament.<ref name="awip"/> Feminist action seeking [[equal opportunity]] in employment has resulted in partially successful legislation{{According to whom|date=September 2018}}. Laws against sex discrimination exist and women's units in government departments have been established.

The success gained by feminists entering the Australian public service and changing policy led to the descriptive term 'femocrats'.<ref name="fstdg">{{cite book |title=From Superwomen to Domestic Goddesses: The Rise and Fall of Feminism |last=Campo |first=Natasha |year=2009 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=3034300166 |pages=1–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpCZwRTmCXkC |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>                                                                                                                                                                                         

==Cultural theory==
Germaine Greer's 1970 novel ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'' became a global bestseller and a highly influential text in the feminist movement. It discusses and challenges the role of Australian housewives as a homemaker, which Greer suggests leads to a repression. The predominate critical theory of feminism in Australia is that male dominance of business, [[Politics of Australia|politics]], [[Law of Australia|law]] and the [[Media of Australia|media]] has resulted in [[gender inequality]].<ref name="cpia">{{cite book |title=Contemporary Politics in Australia: Theories, Practices and Issues |last=Smith |first=Rodney |author2=Ariadne Vromen |author3=Ian Cook |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521137535 |pages=42–43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szc-c7hVoOAC |accessdate=29 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617043641/https://books.google.com/books?id=szc-c7hVoOAC |archive-date=17 June 2016 |dead-url=no }}</ref> Feminism research has expanded the scope of political science in Australia to include issues related to [[femininity]], motherhood and [[violence against women]].<ref name="cpia"/>

==Notable Australian feminists==
Australia has and has had several notable [[feminist]] authors, academics and activists whose work has been recognised internationally. Perhaps most widely recognised is Germaine Greer, whose book ''The Female Eunuch'' was held in high acclaim after its publication. The book's content was considered{{By whom|date=July 2014}} highly radical at the time of its publication in 1970, with Greer recommending female practices like tasting their own [[q:Germaine Greer|menstrual blood]].

From June 2010 to June 2013, Australia was led by its first female [[prime minister]], Julia Gillard. Gillard is perhaps best known, internationally, for the [[Misogyny Speech]] delivered in the Australian [[Federal Parliament]] on 9 October 2012 to then Federal Opposition Leader, [[Tony Abbott]].

Australia has had several feminist organisations during its history, many of which helped the push for basic women's rights like granting of full [[suffrage]], financial independence from husbands, access to abortions, and equal pay. Other high-profile Australian feminists include Eva Cox and [[Jocelynne Scutt]].

==1800 to 1920==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 76283 Women at the first state election comparing notes, Brisbane, 1907 , (suffragette movement in Queensland).jpg|thumb|The women of [[Queensland]] were granted the right to vote in 1905.]]
The first examples of Australian feminism occurred during the mid 1800s to 1900. The early movement mostly concerned the applications of basic human rights to women, including the right to vote, the right to stand for parliamentary election, and protection from sexual exploitation. [[Mary Lee (suffragette)|Mary Lee]], an Australian-Irish woman, was influential in garnering support for many [[Feminist movement|women's rights movements]] in Australia. From 1883 onwards, Lee was involved in the raising of the [[Age of Consent]] for girls in Australia from 13 to 16, the founding of [[The Working Women's Trades Union]], and co-founded the [[South Australian Women's Suffragette League]], which led to the granting of suffrage rights to women in South Australia. In the early 1900s the [[Australian Labor Party]] displayed reluctance toward women and their entrance to the parliament.<ref name="gcatw"/>  During World War I, women were introduced into the workforce at higher rates than previous years, although often in fields already populated by women.

==1920 to 1970==
[[Edith Cowan]], the first woman to be elected to an Australian parliament in 1920, is depicted on the back of the [[Australian fifty-dollar note]].  In August 1943, [[Enid Lyons]] and [[Dorothy Tangney]] became the first two women to elected to the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]].<ref name="awip"/>  Between the World Wars, the [[Country Women's Association]] was founded in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]], spreading throughout the rest of Australia over the following 14 years. An overarching, national group was formed in 1945. The popular magazine, the ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly|Women's Weekly]]'', created for a female market by [[Frank Packer]], was also founded during this period. However, from its first edition in 1933, the magazine was edited by men until [[Ita Buttrose]] was appointed in 1975.

During World War II, Australia, like other Allied countries, encouraged the introduction of women into the workforce, replacing many male workers who had joined the military e.g. [[Australian Women's Land Army]]. The [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave]] of Feminism in Australia began during the 1960s with the confrontation of legal and social double standards as well as workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. Equally, feminists worldwide began a push for female sexual freedom. Germaine Greer rose to international prominence during the later part of this period, with the publication and widespread adoption of, her ideas in her book, ''The Female Eunuch'' in 1970. At the time of the book's publication, Greer was considered a [[radical feminism|radical feminist]], with her ideas and claims at times described as "polemic".<ref>(27 October 2010) Laurie Penny.

During this period [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] Women's rights also became more prominent, with [[Fay Gale]] earning her Ph.D from the [[University of Adelaide]] in 1960. Her thesis was titled "A Study of Assimilation: Part Aborigines in South Australia". Other notable female Indigenous Australians during this period include [[Lyndall Ryan]] and [[Aileen Moreton-Robinson]]. This contributed to the rise in [[Indigenous feminism]] in Australia.

==1970 onwards==

As the feminist movement led to the organisation of British, Canadian and American feminists in the late 1960s, so too did Australian women move to address oppressive social conditions.<ref name="mwbif">{{cite book |title=Men who Believe in Feminism |last=Goldrick-Jones |first=Amanda |year=2002 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0275968227 |pages=20–21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4J4th7lSpk8C |accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>  The social base of the Australian feminist movement was boosted by the growing segment of women employed as juniors in the 1970s.<ref name="gcatw">{{cite book |title=Four Dimensional Social Space |editor1-first=T |editor1-last=Jagtenberg |editor2-first=P.C. |editor2-last=D'Alton |last=Dixson |first=M. |chapter=Social Movements: The Women's Movement: Gender, Class and the Women's Movements in Australia 1890, 1980 |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Educational Publishers |location=Sydney, New South Wales |isbn=0063121271 |page=463 }}<!--|accessdate=29 April 2014--></ref>  Feminist authors have been credited with stimulating the movement at the time.  By the early 1970s the feminist movement in Australia was divided.  On one side was the Women's Liberation Movement which leaned [[Left-wing politics|left]] and believed men did not have a role in women's liberation. The other side was represented by the [[Women's Electoral Lobby (Australia)|Women's Electoral Lobby]] which was considered more mainstream and sought to engage change within existing structures.<ref name="mwbif"/>

Australia's first woman Premier was [[Carmen Lawrence]], becoming [[Premier of Western Australia]] in 1990.<ref name="awip"/>  The short-lived [[Australian Women's Party (1995)|Australian Women's Party]] sought to ensure equal representation of men and women at all levels of government. [[Quentin Bryce]] was the first woman to hold the position of [[Governor-General of Australia]] between September 2008 and March 2014.

Former Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] gained international attention and praise in 2012 for an off-the-cuff speech in the Australian federal parliament directed at then Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott. The speech, known as The Misogyny Speech has been uploaded to YouTube multiple times, with several thousand views each.
