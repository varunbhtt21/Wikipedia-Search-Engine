'''Abercorn Barracks''', sometimes referred to as '''Ballykinlar Barracks''' or '''Ballykinler Barracks''', is a military installation in [[Ballykinler]] in [[County Down]], Northern Ireland.

==Early history==
The barracks, which were named after [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn]] who was twice [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], were built in 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downnews.co.uk/fears-that-ballykinler-army-camp-is-on-a-slippery-slope/|title=Fears That Ballykinler Army Camp Is On A Slippery Slope|publisher=Down News|date=8 January 2014|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

The sprawling site of Ballykinlar Barracks was pressed into service as an internment camp during the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1919.<ref name="BC">{{cite web | title=Ballykinlar Collection | work=Your Place and Mine - BBC| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/down/ballykinlar_collection.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref> After the [[Partition of Ireland]], the new [[Government of Northern Ireland]] continued to use the base for internment.<ref>{{cite web | title=Internment in Northern Ireland 1922-1961 | work=Internment (by John McGuffin, 1973) | url=http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/internment/intern5.htm | accessdate=2008-06-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509060408/http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/internment/intern5.htm| archivedate= 9 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> There appear to have been attempts by those incarcerated to maintain a normal social structure within the confines of the camp and evidence exists of an orchestra and some examples of typical prisoner art are still available for viewing in museum collections in [[Ireland]], including examples of humorous cartoons.<ref name="BC"/> 'Camp tokens' also circulated within the camp in place of money, being made of printed cardboard.<ref name="oldcurrencyexchange.com">{{cite web|url=https://oldcurrencyexchange.com/2015/11/13/obrien-coin-guide-ballykinlar-internment-camp-tokens-1920-21/|title=O’Brien Coin Guide: Ballykinlar Internment Camp Tokens (1920-21)|date=13 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref>

A former IRA prisoner, Louis J. Walsh (a native of [[County Londonderry]] and later a judge in [[County Donegal]]), published a book in 1921 about his experiences in various institutions in Northern Ireland including a chapter about his time in Ballykinlar Camp which describes, amongst other things, having to march for three miles, handcuffed and carrying luggage, only to be placed in bare huts with nothing to sleep in except damp straw. He continues in a second chapter to describe how the prisoners set up their own 'Council' which then began to negotiate with the military authorities for better food and conditions within the camp. "The camp regime was notoriously brutal - prisoners were shot dead for minor infractions, such as standing too close to the barbed wire fence that kept them penned in (the camp magazine was titled Barbed Wire)." Ballykinlar internment camp housed over 2,000 men from the thirty-two counties of Ireland and was the first mass internment camp in Ireland during the Irish War of Independence.<ref>Liam O'Duibhir, Prisoners of War - Ballykinlar Internment Camp 1920-1921, (2013), Mercier Press. {{ISBN|978 1 78117 0410}}</ref> Three prisoners were shot dead and five died of malnourishment in Ballykinlar in 1921 alone.<ref name="oldcurrencyexchange.com"/>

After peace was declared in 1921 the internees were released but it does appear that their ordeal did not necessarily end after leaving as evidence exists that a train carrying released prisoners from Ballykinlar was attacked at [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]], injuring three [[Sinn Féin]] passengers and several members of the crowd.<ref>{{cite news | title=Freed Prisoners Train is Bombed | work=New York Times (10 December 1921) | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/12/10/archives/freed-prisoners-train-is-bombed-three-sinn-fein-passengers-and.html | accessdate=2008-06-17 | date=1921-12-10}}</ref>

==Military uses== 
In [[World War I]] the [[36th Ulster Division]] formed from the [[Ulster Volunteers]] did much of its training at Ballykinlar.<ref>[http://www.downcountymuseum.com/uploads/2002_OrrVolunteersBallykinlerCamp.doc Down County Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926232931/http://www.downcountymuseum.com/uploads/2002_OrrVolunteersBallykinlerCamp.doc |date=September 26, 2011 }}</ref> A journalist of the time writing in the Belfast Newsletter waxed lyrical about the location describing it as a "camp situated in the centre of picturesque country, with the mountains of Mourne forming an imposing background. On the edge of the camping ground, and within easy walking distance of the tents, is an arm of Dundrum Bay, and here the men will have swimming and bathing drills. Within sight of the camp is the beautifully situated demesne of Tyrella."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ross.hussey/posts/10203514495485785|title=Volunteers at the World's End: the Ulster Division at Ballykindler Army Camp|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>

In [[World War II]]  the camp continued to be a military training establishment and the North Irish Horse record moving there to take over [[Valentine Tank]]s and convert to an armoured regiment.<ref>{{cite web | title=War Diaries for the North Irish Horse | work=North Irish Horse website | url=http://www.warlinks.com/armour/north_irish_horse/nirish_41.html | accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>  Troops from the [[United States]], including those from the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Americans |work=Second World War NI |url=http://www.secondworldwarni.org/details.aspx?id=5&pagerecordid=609&themeid= |accessdate=2008-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723201341/http://www.secondworldwarni.org/details.aspx?id=5&pagerecordid=609&themeid= |archivedate=2011-07-23 }}</ref> also trained at Ballykinlar.<ref>{{cite web | title=GIs Return to Down | work=Your Place and Mine - BBC | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/topics/war/gi_visit_05/index.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>

The year 1974 saw [[the Troubles in Ballykinler]] when a 300&nbsp;lb [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] van bomb killed two [[British Army]] soldiers, injured many others and destroyed some buildings on the base.<ref>{{cite web | title=The bombing of Sandes Soldiers Home, Ballykinler | work=1st Bn Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment| url=http://history.farmersboys.com/Postings/NI/sandes.htm | accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref> Private Swanick was a member of the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment]] and Corporal Coughlan a member of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment | work=Palace Barracks Memorial Garden| url=http://www.palacebarracksmemorialgarden.org/Duke%20of%20Edinburgh.htm | accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>

The base was used as a training centre in the 1970s and 1980s by the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] whose [[3rd Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment|3rd (County Down) Battalion]] was also based there. <ref>Ryder 191</ref>

As peace has returned to Northern Ireland the [[United Kingdom|British]] troops based there were withdrawn from the streets with the ending of [[Operation Banner]] and are now [[Garrison]] troops. In 2008 it was announced that the 2nd [[Battalion]] of [[The Rifles]] based at Ballykinlar would be deployed to [[Kosovo]] to "combat fresh violence between ethnic Albanians and minority Serbs." <ref>{{cite web | title=Troops in Ulster to combat Kosovo violence | work=Yorkshire Post (30 April 2008) | url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/international/Troops-in-Ulster-to-combat.4033424.jp | accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>

Sandes Home, the civilian charity which provides leisure and restaurant facilities in some bases, has had a presence at Ballykinlar Camp for over 100 years. In early 2009 a car bomb was found close to the base, which was thought to have been abandoned by dissident republicans.<ref>{{cite news | title=Abandoned Car Bomb | work=BBC News (31 January 2009) | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7862438.stm | accessdate=2009-01-31 | date=2009-01-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201155130/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7862438.stm| archivedate= 1 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Recent military use==
Major renovation was carried out at the Barracks in 2008 and the camp now has 290 married quarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/ballykinler-barracks-could-close-in-2016-1-1887025|title=Ballykinler barracks 'could close in 2016'|publisher=Newsletter|date=23 July 2009|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> The 2nd Battalion The Rifles moved out to [[Thiepval Barracks]] in June 2014.<ref name=tele>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/armys-retreat-from-ballykinler-base-raises-fears-for-civilian-posts-29860921.html|title=Army's retreat from Ballykinler base raises fears for civilian posts|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|date=23 December 2013|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> In November 2016 the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] announced that the site would close in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565858/20161107_MOD_Better_Defence_Estate_FINAL.pdf|title=A Better Defence Estate|publisher=Ministry of Defence|date=November 2016 |accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>
