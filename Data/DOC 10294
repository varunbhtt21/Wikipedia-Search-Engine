'''[[Epaulettes (stamp)|Epaulettes]]''' are the colloquial name of the first series of [[postage stamp]] issued by [[Belgium]] that depicted [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]] and his prominent [[epaulette]]s from which the name derives. They were first usable on 1 July 1849 when two values, with the same design were issued: a brown 10 [[Belgian franc|centimes]] and a blue 20 centimes. Their introduction proved extremely successful and led to a large expansion of the postage system. The Epaulettes were soon superseded by new types.

The brown 10 centimes [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denomination]], could be used to send a letter up to a distance of {{convert|30|km}}; the blue 20 centimes could be used on all other ordinary national mail. The stamps depicted Leopold I wearing military uniform, with highly visible epaulettes, and were printed using the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio method]]. They were inscribed "<small>POSTES</small>" ("post") at the top, along with the stamp's value in numbers. At the bottom was the stamps face value in French language text. No Dutch language version was produced.
