''Live at the Brattle Theatre'' is a live album by [[Evan Dando]] recorded at the [[Brattle Theatre]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 18, 2000, and released in Australia the following year. It contains a mix of originals from Dando's albums with [[the Lemonheads]] ("Stove," "My Drug Buddy," "Down About It," etc.) in addition to three covers, including [[Victoria Williams]]'s "Frying Pan," and one new track, "The Same Thing You Thought Hard About Is the Same Part I Can Live Without," which later appeared on Dando's first solo studio album, ''[[Baby I'm Bored]]'' (2003).<ref>{{cite web|title=Evan Dando  – Live At The Brattle Theatre / Griffith Sunset EP|url=https://www.discogs.com/Evan-Dando-Live-At-The-Brattle-Theatre-Griffith-Sunset-EP/release/1774577|website=Discogs|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>

''Live at the Brattle Theatre'' is packaged as a two-CD set; the second disc is an EP titled ''Griffith Sunset'', which features Dando covering country songs such as [[Bobby Helms]]'s "Fraulein" and [[the Louvin Brothers]]' "My Baby's Gone." AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the live album "moves quickly, which is probably why it needed to be supplemented by a second disc consisting of covers (good, but a little too overworked in the studio), and it really isn't a substantial addition to [Dando's] catalog. It's simply a nice, warm album, which is enough after a half-decade wait."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Live at the Brattle Theatre/Griffith Sunset|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-brattle-theatre-griffith-sunset-mw0000738660|website=AllMusic|publisher=RhythmOne|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>
