The result was    '''delete'''. Cindamuse was a kind and respected Wikipedian and we were all saddened at her passing, but there is clear consensus that she did not meet our inclusion guidelines as the subject of a biography in mainspace <span style="color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|<span style="color:#00CA00">FreeRangeFrog</span>]]</span><sup>[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]</sup> 18:33, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''maybe redirect?''' to [[Wikipedia:Deceased Wikipedians/2014#Cynthia Ashley-Nelson (Cindamuse)]] or something? mainly similar content there, idk if that violates a policy though <b>''[[en:User:HelicopterLlama|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;color:black">~Helicopter</span>]] [[User talk:HelicopterLlama|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;color:black">Llama~</span>]]''</b> 15:53, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*Check this other article [[Adrianne Wadewitz]], its similar, nobody deleted it. Cynthia Ashley-Nelson is not a memorial article is a normal article. --[[User:Leglish|Leglish]] ([[User talk:Leglish|talk]]) 15:58, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' first, no article here sets a precedent for any other. In order to have an article here Ms Ashley-Nelson must be inherently notable. It's actually quite distressing that we are discussing a recently deceased Wikipedian, but, unless she has inherent notability an article should not have been constructed in the first place. Now we are stuck with a deletion discussion (and yes, I know I initiated it).

*'''Delete'''. Inappropriate to redirect main-space-page to Wikipedia-space-memorial-page. I did extensive searching and found zero (0) secondary source discussion of this person. Zero secondary sources in searches of {{Find sources|Cynthia Ashley-Nelson}}. Zero secondary sources in search of [[NewsBank]]. Zero secondary sources in search of [[InfoTrac Newsstand]]. Fails [[WP:GNG]]. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:44, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:Cynthia Ashley-Nelson was one of the most active female wikipedists and also was vice-chair of Wikimedia's Affiliations Committee. --[[User:Leglish|Leglish]] ([[User talk:Leglish|talk]]) 16:51, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::Has that been mentioned in any ''secondary'' sources? &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:52, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*Don't see how this article can be kept, as the sourcing for GNG is not there.  So it should be removed. [[User:Alanscottwalker|Alanscottwalker]] ([[User talk:Alanscottwalker|talk]]) 18:19, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*I am tempted to do so boldly and out of process, but I've asked Leglish on their userpage if they object to me userfying this page.  There is little chance that this AfD would close as anything other than delete, and I would prefer to avoid an AfD about a sensitive issue where the outcome is inevitable.  I was friends with Cindy, miss her, and value the work that she did, but at this point in time, the outcome of this discussion is a given, and it would be easier to handle this with immediate userification than a seven day discussion.

:*'''Comment''' Perfectly understood. A bold deletion out of process is wholly in order here. The article ought never to have been created, and the creation and only the creation caused the discussion. Such a discussion, while necessary, diminishes the lady's memory.

::*{{ping|Leglish}} - I'd really prefer to take such an action with your agreement since you created the article, so please chime in when you can.  Please keep in mind that I comodded gendergap with Cindy, collaborated with her in numerous other ways, and deeply miss her - but this AfD is going to be an unnecessary week of frank discussion about a sensitive topic, and it's pretty much guaranteed to end with deletion if carried through.  I'd like something like this to be preserved in your userspace and to avoid the next week of discussion about this, and I sincerely think that userfying the page is in the best interests of all.

*'''Delete''': I would prefer a Merge to [[Catalyst Resource Network]], but seeing as the organization isn't [[WP:NOTABLE]], I really doubt that she's notable. I almost feel like this was created just because of the timing of her death right on the heels of [[Adrianne Wadewitz]], and Cynthia here doesn't have near the [[WP:RS|reliable coverage]] to establish notability. I did some cleanup to the article, but holy crap, there's not a lot past what she did on-wiki, most of which isn't really important.

*'''Delete''' Fails GNG. There seems to be a real problem generally with Wikipedians over-estimating the importance of members of the project.--[[User:Shakehandsman|Shakehandsman]] ([[User talk:Shakehandsman|talk]]) 00:25, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
