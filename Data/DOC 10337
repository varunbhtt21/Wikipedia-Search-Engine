{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}

On 24 April 2014, Oliver Duggan, in the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', reported that users of computers that used [[IP address]]es registered to the [[Government Secure Intranet]] (which is used by many of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]]) had added derogatory and offensive material to [[Wikipedia]] articles, particularly the article about the [[Hillsborough disaster]].<ref name=Echo /> The vandalism was quickly re-reported by other media, and subsequent reports have highlighted other acts of [[Vandalism on Wikipedia|vandalism]], on various articles, originated by computers using those IP addresses. After an investigation by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and [[Wikipediocracy]] the person behind the edits was identified as a "junior civil servant" within the UK government and was dismissed.

==Hillsborough disaster==
The issue first emerged when it was reported that the entry about the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 people died at a football match at the [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in 1989, had been altered, briefly, in 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url={{fullurl:Hillsborough_disaster|diff=prev&oldid=283956539}}|title=Wikipedia diff 283956539|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=2009-04-15|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref> with a similar alteration to the [[Anfield]] article in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url={{fullurl:Anfield|diff=prev&oldid=493826709}}|title=Wikipedia diff 493826709|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=2012-05-22|accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref> The report suggested that the edits could have been made from the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Her Majesty's Treasury]] or the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Office of the Solicitor General]]<ref name=Echo>{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/hillsborough-wikipedia-insults-added-government-7029881 | title=Exclusive: Shocking Hillsborough insults added on Wikipedia from Government computers | work=[[Liverpool Echo]] | date=24 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Duggan, Oliver}}</ref> since those departments use the Government Secure Intranet. However, the [[Cabinet Office]] has stated that  "At this time, we have no reason to suspect that the Hillsborough edits involve any particular department, nor more than one or two individuals in 2009 and 2012."<ref name=BBCa>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-27165844 | title=Hillsborough Wikipedia posts were 'sickening', Cabinet Office says | work=[[BBC News]] | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>

The details of the two IP addresses (195.92.40.49 and 62.25.106.209<ref name=Eagle /><ref name=BBCb />) used by computers on the Government Secure Intranet came from then-Treasury minister [[Angela Eagle]] in a reply to a [[UK Parliamentary questions|parliamentary question]] in 2008.<ref name=Echo /><ref name=Eagle>{{cite web | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-12-11d.241962.h&s=%28ip+address%29+speaker%3A10182#g241962.r0 | title=Departmental Internet: 11 Dec 2008: Hansard Written Answers - TheyWorkForYou | work=[[TheyWorkForYou]] | date=11 December 2008 | accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref> The edits, which were made in 2009 (on the disaster's 20th anniversary) and 2012, included the addition of "Blame [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] Fans" to the Hillsborough disaster page and adding the phrases "You'll Never Walk Again" and "yet nothing for the victims of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]" to mentions of the Hillsborough memorial in the [[Anfield]] article.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-launches-inquiry-after-hillsborough-insults-traced-to-whitehall-computers-9285036.html | title=Hillsborough Wikipedia posts: Government launches inquiry after insults aimed at Liverpool fans traced to Government computers in Whitehall | work=[[The Independent]] | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Johnston, Ian}}</ref>

The Cabinet Office responded to the news by saying that they were making "urgent inquiries" into these reports, and that the claims made in them were being treated with "the utmost seriousness".<ref name=BBC>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-27152223 | title=Hillsborough Wikipedia posts: Government pledges 'urgent inquiries' | work=[[BBC News]] | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Johnson, Dan}}</ref> The office also warned, however, that it might not be possible to determine exactly who used the government's computers to make the edits, saying, "As the first incident happened five years ago and there are hundreds of thousands of people on the government's network, it may prove challenging to identify who was involved, but we are exhausting every option."<ref name=BBCa /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/finding-hillsborough-trolls-could-be-tough-30219800.html | title=Finding Hillsborough 'trolls' could be tough | work=[[Independent.ie]] | date=26 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Press Association}}</ref> The inquiry was scheduled to be overseen—but not led—by [[Andy Burnham]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/full-parliamentary-probe-shocking-hillsborough-7035260 | title=Full parliamentary probe into shocking Hillsborough insults added to Wikipedia from Government computers | work=Liverpool Echo | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Duggan, Oliver}}</ref> On 20 May, Burnham said the investigation had identified "strong leads" into determining who made the edits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/strong-leads-hunt-trolls-behind-7143197 | title=Hilsborough Wikipedia scandal: 'Strong leads' in hunt for trolls who used Government computer | work=Liverpool Echo | date=20 May 2014 | accessdate=20 May 2014 | author=Johnson, Mark}}</ref>

In 2016, after the second verdict of the Hillsborough inquiry proved [[unlawful killing]] of the 96 dead due to [[gross negligence]], the ''Liverpool Echo'' reported that edits from an IP associated with [[Warwickshire County Council]] (WCC) added the phrase "You'll never walk again" eight times in the lead of the Hillsborough disaster page.<ref>{{cite web|url={{fullurl:Hillsborough_disaster|diff=prev&oldid=717548799}}|title=Wikipedia diff 717548799|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref> A WCC spokesperson told the newspaper: "WCC IP addresses also include our publicly used machines in libraries that can be used by members of the public. The information has been passed onto the head of our IT team and we are going to be investigating."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fitzsimmons|first1=Francesca|title=Offensive Hillsborough comments added to Wikipedia using council IP address|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/offensive-hillsborough-comments-added-wikipedia-11256592|accessdate=30 April 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=28 April 2016}}</ref>

==Other articles==
On 26 April, the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' reported that one of the edits made via a government IP address (to the Wikipedia entry for [[Howick Falls]]) had mentioned "killing or enslaving" [[black people]] and suggested that they believe "hearsay and myth".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/wikipedia-edits-linked-to-whitehall-30220069.html | title=Wikipedia edits linked to Whitehall | work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] | date=26 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

''The Daily Telegraph'' reported on 27 April that government computers had been used to maliciously alter articles about prominent people, including falsifying the death of television sports presenter [[Des Lynam]]. Other public figures targeted include [[Michael Grade]] and [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]].<ref>Oliver Duggan [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/10791202/Des-Lynam-killed-by-a-giant-snowball-and-other-embarrassing-Wikipedia-edits-from-Whitehall-computers.html "Des Lynam 'killed by a giant snowball' and other embarrassing Wikipedia edits from Whitehall computers"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 27 April 2014</ref> On the same day, ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' in Glasgow reported that the articles for [[Clydebank]] and [[Barlanark]], had been vandalized by government computers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/offensive-wikipedia-edits-made-in-whitehall.24068250 | title=Offensive Wikipedia edits made in Whitehall | work=Herald Scotland | date=27 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Duffy, Judith}}</ref> Also that day, the ''[[National Post]]'' reported that a government computer had also targeted the page about Canadian author [[David Gilmour (writer)|David Gilmour]], which was vandalized to describe him as a "misogynist, homophobe [and] racist".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/04/27/u-k-government-computer-used-to-edit-canadian-author-david-gilmours-wikipedia-page-call-him-a-homophobe/ | title=U.K. government computer used to edit Canadian author David Gilmour’s Wikipedia page, call him a ‘homophobe’ | work=[[National Post]] | date=27 April 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2014 | author=Edmiston, Jake}}</ref>

On 29 April, the [[BBC]] reported the results of its investigation into the edits carried out by computers using the two IP addresses. It found more than one hundred edits that it categorised as "inappropriate editing, vandalism and deletion". The BBC gave no time scale  for these edits but did reveal that edits were made in 2005 and 2006 and that "several of the offensive messages were made prior to the government IP addresses being disclosed in 2008".

The most serious edit was a change to the [[veil]] article, in October 2006, which included the phrase "all Muslims are terrorists".<ref>[{{fullurl:Veil|diff=prev&oldid=82628573}}]</ref> This change was removed six minutes later. Also highlighted was the removal of details, in October 2005, of the [[Cherie Blair#Controversies|controversy]] regarding flat purchases by [[Cherie Blair]]. Other edits mentioned by the BBC were the editing of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] article to add conspiracy theories; and the vandalism, usually with insults and sometimes with page blanking, of the [[Tony Blair]], [[Richard Littlejohn]], [[Jamie Oliver]], [[The Libertines|Libertines]], [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Christopher Byrne (politician)|Christopher Byrne]], [[Peter Levy (presenter)|Peter Levy]] and [[Arsène Wenger]] articles.

Regarding the edits, while stating that the vandalism was appalling, a spokesman for [[Wikimedia UK]] pointed out that, "Edits of this nature are removed very quickly by the volunteers who write and edit Wikipedia, often in a matter of minutes." He also expanded on the nature of the editing process, saying "Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that anyone can edit. This openness has led to an enormous reference work of great value. While vandalism does occasionally happen we are grateful to the many thousands of volunteers who write, edit and organise the content."<ref name=BBCb>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27203371 | title=Wikipedia edit from government computer added Muslim insult | work=BBC | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=3 May 2014 | author=Lee, Dave}}</ref>

==Reactions==
Jon Davies, chief executive of [[Wikimedia UK]], said it was "appalled by such vandalism" but added that, "In this case, none of the offensive comments were up for more than a couple of hours, and most were removed in a few minutes."<ref name=BBC />

The [[Cabinet Office]] described the edits in question as "sickening". "The behaviour is in complete contravention of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service#Codes#Civil Service Code|Civil Service Code]]. It is entirely unacceptable," they added.<ref name=BBCb />

Sheila Coleman of the [[Hillsborough Justice Campaign]] called the edits "absolutely disgusting" and said the relatives of the Hillsborough disaster victims would demand a formal inquiry.<ref name=Echo/>

A [[Criticism of Wikipedia|critic of Wikipedia]], Nigel Scott, writing in ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', sought to place the incident in the context of what he sees as Wikipedia's structural flaws, saying, "Wikipedia is not blameless in this. It allows misinformation to flourish and provides it with a cloak of respectability. It is under-resourced and is unable to police itself adequately." However, the main focus of his argument was other [[List of Wikipedia controversies|Wikipedia controversies]], including the creation of the [[Wikipedia:List of hoaxes on Wikipedia/Bicholim conflict|Bicholim conflict]] article, accusations of editing on behalf of [[Chuka Umunna#Online activity|Chuka Umunna]] and the [[Wiki-PR editing of Wikipedia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/wikipedia-where-truth-dies-online/14963#.U2BsTa1dXN4 | title=Wikipedia: where truth dies online | work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]] | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Scott, Nigel}}</ref>

==Result of the investigation==
From May to June 2014, [[Wikipediocracy]], a website critical of Wikipedia, as well as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' identified the culprit behind the offending edits to Wikipedia.  Using the results of the investigation published in the ''Telegraph'', the UK government identified and took action against the suspect.<ref>Duggan, Oliver, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/10904540/Civil-servant-fired-after-Telegraph-investigation-into-Hillsborough-Wikipedia-slurs.html Civil servant fired after Telegraph investigation into Hillsborough Wikipedia slurs]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 June 2014</ref>  In June 2014, an unnamed 24-year-old [[civil servant]], who was born in London but lives in Liverpool, was sacked for posting offensive comments about the disaster on Wikipedia.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/17/civil-servant-sacked-wikipedia-edits-hillsborough |work=The Guardian |title=Civil servant sacked for offensive Wikipedia edits on Hillsborough |date=17 June 2014|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> After the sacking, the United Kingdom government issued new rules for its civil servants with regard to editing Wikipedia. The guidelines include the statement that anyone making inappropriate edits will be disciplined.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/government-issues-new-wikipedia-rules-7966638 | title=Government issues new Wikipedia rules for Whitehall staff after civil servant posted Hillsborough slurs | work=Liverpool Echo | date=20 October 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Docking, Neil}}</ref>
