Dezső Lehota began his musical studies at the encouragement of his parents at Hódmezővásárhely, and continued them in the conservatory of Szeged under the mentoring of Miklós Budaházi-Fehér. In addition to that he took private lessons with [[Jenö Hubay]], one of the most important Hungarian violinists and teachers.

In 1934 he won first place of the National Music Festival with Paganini's Violin Concerto in D-major.

In 1937 he obtained the concertmaster's position in the BM Symphonic Orchestra, Budapest. Parallel to his work, he was accepted to the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music|National Hungarian Academy of Music]], continuing his studies under the tutorship of Béla Katona.

In 1940 he was conscripted into the Royal Hungarian Army's Orchestra.  He surrendered in 1945 in Hungary to the Red Army, to be held in captivity for four more years.

In 1950 he was released and able to carry on with his studies under Béla Katona, at the Academy of Music.

In 1955 he moved to [[Kaposvár]], gaining a department head position in the Franz Liszt Music School. Besides this work, he also taught in the Teacher Training College of Kaposvár.

In 1958 he became the soloist and leader of the orchestra of the Symphonic Orchestra of Kaposvár.

In February 1967 he applied for a position mentioned in an advertisement published in the magazine 'Das Orchester' a position for concertmaster in the concert orchestra 'Pfälzische Philharmonie, Staatsorchester Rheinland-Pfalz' (See more [[Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz|here]]). He counted this as one of his greatest successes, that despite being 48 years old, he was selected from among seventeen other applicants, with an age-rebate and a sample material doubled by himself.<ref>Autobiography of Dezső Lehota, manuscript, Szeged, 2013.</ref> He played here from February 1967 to September 1987.
