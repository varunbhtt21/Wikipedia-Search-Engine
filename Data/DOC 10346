This new user [[User:Manspacey]] is editing on similar issue and in same time, the [[East London Mosque]], as other sockpuppets of [[User:UsamahWard|UsamahWard]]. Then, on 23 April 2014 these two sockpuppets wrote same things on [[User talk:Fisingi]].
On 14:14, 24 April 2014 [[User:UsamahWard|UsamahWard]] undid a revision by [[User: Ellodorando]], by writing  "Several other mosques broadcast the call to prayer". After 24 minutes the other sockpuppet [[User:Manspacey]] wrote on the [[User talk: Ellodorando]]:"Just to comment on your edits to the East London Mosque. This is not the only mosque in the UK that broadcasts the call to prayer, there are others too in "Bradford, Blackburn, Manchester, Bolton and Coventry."
On  23 November 2012, [[User:UsamahWard|UsamahWard]] edited the article [[Andrew Gilligan]], which was edited even from [[User:Manspacey]] on 22 November 2012. <span style="color:green; font-size: bigger; font-weight: bold;">[[User:Rinfoli|<span style="color:DarkBlue>Rinfoli</span>]]  {[[User talk:Rinfoli|<font color="red">'''''*Di§cu$$ with me"#'''''</font>]]}</sup> 18:38, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

My [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:UsamahWard#Abusing_multiple_accounts unblock appeal] was successful, initially just a shortening of the ban, but eventually after closer examination of the edits, with the conclusion that Manspacey is not my sockpuppet. This examination revealed that my accuser was himself a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Aldota serial sockpuppeter] (with 18 known identities at the time of writing this), who cited some of his sockpuppets in his accusation.

======<span style="font-size:150%">Clerk, CheckUser, and/or patrolling admin comments</span>======
{{adminnote}} The fact that Manspacey has only edited pages that UsamahWard has edited, and usually has done so within hours of the other account, making the same arguments, strongly suggests to me that these are the same editor. I'm blocking Manspacey indefinitely as a sockpuppet, and blocking UsamahWard for a month for abusing a sockpuppet (including using it in edit-wars). -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 21:06, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
