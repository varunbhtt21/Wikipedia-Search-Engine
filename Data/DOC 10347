The '''Bog Wallow Ambush''' was a small unit action during the [[American Civil War]] that took place between [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces under Captain [[J. Fred. Waring]] and Union forces under Colonel [[George W. Taylor (general)|George W. Taylor]] on December 4, 1861, in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], as part of [[major general|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]]'s operations in northern Virginia.  The Union force set up an ambush for the Confederate force on the [[Braddock Road (Northern Virginia)|Braddock Road]].  The action resulted in a Union victory.

==Background==
Following the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]] on October 21, 1861, major offensive action was halted in the eastern theater, as both armies went into winter quarters.  Small detachments were still occasionally sent out to probe the enemy's position and to obtain [[forage]]. On the night of November 5, 1861, a shootout occurred between members of the units later involved in the ambush at [[Oak Hill (Annandale, Virginia)|Oak Hill]] mansion, in an area of such probing and patrolling.<ref>[http://braddockheritage.org/items/show/256 A Look Back at Braddock District Fairfax County, Virginia Oak Hill: Civil War Skirmish]</ref> Members of the Union force also intended to retaliate for the Confederate force's attacks on Union [[picket (military)|picket]]s.

==Opposing forces==

===Confederate===
Commander: [[Joseph Frederick Waring|Capt J. Fred Waring]]

Georgia Hussars (later [[Jeff Davis Cavalry Legion]], Company 'F')

===Union===

Commander: [[George W. Taylor (general)|Col George W. Taylor]]

[[3rd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry]], part of the [[First New Jersey Brigade]]

==The action==
On December 4, 1861, 3rd New Jersey Infantry troops stretched two telegraph wires across Braddock Road at the eastern end of a "perfect [[bog]] hole" to dismount riders of the Georgia Hussars in the middle of the night. A "sheet of fire" erupted from the tree line along the swamp's edge when this happened; the Confederates returned fire and escaped, with casualties on both sides.<ref name=marker/>

==Results==
This was a small unit action of no strategic importance and resulted in only light casualties.  However, it is representative of many such actions in northern Virginia during the early part of the American Civil War.

==Commemoration==
A new historic marker was unveiled May 5, 2013 at the intersection of Braddock Road and Dunleigh Drive in [[Burke, Virginia|Burke]] to commemorate the “Bog Wallow Ambush.” The marker is just outside [[Annandale, Virginia|Annandale]], between Rolling Road and Guinea Road.<ref>[http://annandaleva.blogspot.com/2013/05/historic-market-commemorates-bog-wallow.html Annandale VA Historic marker commemorates Bog Wallow Ambush]</ref>
