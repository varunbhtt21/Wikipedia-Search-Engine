The '''Chengdu campaign''' {{zh|成都战役}} was a campaign fought between the [[Communist Party of China|communists]] and the [[Kuomintang|nationalists]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]] in the post [[World War II]] era and resulted in [[communist]] victory and capture of Chengdu, provincial capital of the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan. The campaign was part of the [[Southwestern China campaign]].

==Battle of Jianmenguan==
Jianmen Pass (Jianmen Guan, 剑门关) was one of the key gateways of [[Sichuan]].  There are 72 peaks in the range and the only road going through the mountains was 50 metres wide.  Whoever controlled this 2&nbsp;km long stretch of the road controlled the gateway of [[Sichuan]], and the nationalists had built an elaborate system of bunkers in the area to strengthen its defense against the expected communist invasion.

After taking the city of [[Guangyuan]] on December 14, 1949, the communists decided that Jianmen Pass (Jianmen Guan, 剑门关) must be taken.  The 540th Regiment of the [[180th Division (People's Republic of China)|180th Division]] of [[60th Army (People's Republic of China)|60th Army]] of the communist 18th Army Group was tasked with this job and after three days of forced march of more than 40&nbsp;km in the mountain, the communist 540th Regiment reached Jianmen Pass (Jianmen Guan, 剑门关).  The communist 540th Regiment immediately launched its assault on the pass by first completely annihilating a company from the retreating nationalist 55th Division tasked to strengthen the defense.  Later, one of the battalions of the communist regiment was sent to outflank the defenders by traversing mountain terrain which was considered impossible by the local populace, including the defenders.  The other two battalions of the communist regiment crawled forward along the ravine under the cover of darkness, and by 10:00 PM, they were within 50 metres of the pass.  The attackers then launched their assault in darkness under the cover of heavy fire, and with the help of the battalion that outflanked the defenders, they were able to cross the last ravine via a log and overwhelmed the defenders.  With Jianmen Pass (Jianmen Guan, 剑门关) falling into enemy hands, the Nationalists had no choice but to retreat and abandon the town of Jiange (剑阁) in the afternoon of December 18, 1949.

The Communists managed to capture over 300 prisoners-of-war and had all the remaining people killed in the fierce battle, and more importantly, the taking of Jianmen Pass (Jianmen Guan, 剑门关) secure the passage for the communists to invade deeper into the heart of [[Sichuan]].
