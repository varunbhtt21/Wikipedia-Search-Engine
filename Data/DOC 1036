== History ==

Aplos Software was founded in 2009 in [[Fresno, California]] by Dan Kelly and Tim Goetz, a [[certified public accountant]]. Tim Goetz previously served as an executive pastor of a church and helped found two nonprofits. He couldn't find the low-cost [[fund accounting]] solution he wanted for his nonprofits, so he joined with a Fresno-based investor that shared his vision to serve the nonprofit sector with simple, affordable software and founded Aplos Software.<ref name="CPAPracAdvisor-Goetz">{{cite news|title=Tim Goetz, CPA - 2015 40 Under 40 Honoree|url=http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12114136/tim-goetz-cpa-2015-40-under-40-honoree|accessdate=9 March 2018|publisher=CPA Practice Advisor|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref>

== Key Areas of Development ==
Aplos Software focused its software on simplifying the primary [[back office]] tasks required to manage a nonprofit, [[private foundation]], [[foundation (nonprofit)]], [[charitable organization]] or church.

===Fund Accounting===
Nonprofit [[fund accounting]] differs from business accounting because it is often necessary to track restricted and unrestricted funds separately. This often occurs when a donor or grant specifies that the organization must use the funds for a specific purpose. The [[accounting software]] must track how these funds were used and how much is available. Aplos first launched its online fund accounting software, Aplos Accounting, in 2011.<ref name=Financialsoft.about.com>{{cite web|last=Elmblad|first=Shelley|title=8 Free and Low Cost Accounting Software Options For Nonprofits|url=http://financialsoft.about.com/od/smallbusiness/tp/Low-Cost-Non-Profit-Accounting-Software.htm|work=Financialsoft.about.com|publisher=About.com|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="CPA Prac Advisor Review">{{cite news|last=Girsch-Bock|first=Mary|title=2012 Review of Aplos Fund Accounting Software|url=http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/article/10797469/2012-review-of-aplos-fund-accounting|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=CPA Practice Advisor|date=29 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=2014Review_CPA>{{cite news|last=Girsch-Bock|first=Mary|title=2014 Review of Aplos Fund Accounting|url=http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/product/11429107/aplos-software-aplos-fund-accounting|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=CPA Practice Advisor|date=May 14, 2014}}</ref> The most popular competitive accounting product for small and mid-sized nonprofits is [[Quickbooks]] <ref name=CampbellRinker>{{cite web|last=Campbell Rinker|title=Nonprofit Accounting Solution Report|url=http://campbellrinker.com/awards/2011_SNP_Summary_Report.pdf|work=Nonprofit Accounting Solution Report - 2011 Edition|publisher=Campbell Rinker|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

In October 2012, Aplos Software launched Aplos Oversight, an online software which provides an administrator or accountant real-time access to the accounting of multiple organizations.<ref name="Accounting Today Oversight">{{cite news|last=Fineberg|first=Seth|title=Aplos Software Adds Admin Product to NP Cloud Accounting Suite|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/accounting-technology/news/Aplos-Software-Adds-Admin-Product-to-NP-Accounting-Suite64254-1.html|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=Accounting Today|date=10 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713021702/http://www.accountingtoday.com/accounting-technology/news/Aplos-Software-Adds-Admin-Product-to-NP-Accounting-Suite64254-1.html|archive-date=13 July 2013|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

=== Form 990 Preparation===
In summer of 2012, Aplos Software was approved as an IRS efile provider to submit [[IRS tax forms]] on behalf of tax-exempt organizations and in October 2012 launched Aplos e-File, a tax preparation and filing software for IRS [[Form 990|Form 990-N]].<ref name="CPA Prac Advisor Form 990-N">{{cite news|last=O'Bannon|first=Isaac|title=Free e-Filing of Form 990-N for small nonprofits|url=http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/10819279/free-e-filing-of-irs-form-990-n-for-small-nonprofits|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=CPA Practice Advisor|date=24 October 2012}}</ref> IRS Form 990-N is an annual electronic IRS filing for tax-exempt organizations with less than $50,000 in annual gross receipts.  In 2013, Aplos added tax preparation and e-file software for IRS Form 990-EZ and its required schedules to Aplos e-File. IRS Form 990-EZ is the short form of the full Form 990 [[IRS tax forms]] and is available to organizations with up to $200,000 in gross receipts and $500,000 in assets.<ref name="Accounting Today 990EZ">{{cite news|last=Fineberg|first=Seth|title=Aplos Software to Assist Nonprofits with IRS Form 990-EZ|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/aplos-software-to-assist-with-irs-form-990-ez-65831-1.html|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=Accounting Today|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="CPA Prac 990EZ">{{cite news|last=O'Bannon|first=Isaac|title=New web-based preparation and e-filing system for non-profits filing Form 990-EZ|url=http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/10884671/new-web-based-preparation-and-e-filing-system-for-non-profits-filing-form-990-ez|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=CPA Practice Advisor|date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>

===Donor Management===
Aplos Software also focused on expanding the [[fundraising]] and [[donation]] tracking aspects of its software since 2012 to make it more successful for the [[vertical market]] of nonprofits. It launched a contributions management module in 2012 that tracked donations within Aplos Accounting and created contribution statements, which are annual giving receipts required by the IRS. In July 2013 it began offering a donor management module, and in May 2017 it expanded on its module to launch a stand-alone product as Aplos Donor Management. 

According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, nonprofits are increasingly creating initiatives to accept donations online and growth in online giving outpaced traditional methods in 2012.<ref name=OnlineGivingGrowth>{{cite news|last=Carew Grovum|first=Emma|title=Big Boom in Online Giving|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/The-Big-Boom-in-Online-Giving/139965/|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=June 23, 2013}}</ref> To keep pace with the growing popularity and requests by its customers for an online giving platform, Aplos Software expanded its fundraising functionality in January 2014 by partnering with [[WePay]], an online payment portal, to add the ability for nonprofits to accept online donations.<ref name=AccountingTodayDonations>{{cite news|last=Hood|first=Daniel|title=Aplos Adds Online Donations|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/accounting-technology/news/aplos-adds-online-donations69822-1.html|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=Accounting Today|date=February 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201621/http://www.accountingtoday.com/accounting-technology/news/aplos-adds-online-donations69822-1.html|archive-date=14 July 2014|dead-url=yes}}</ref>
