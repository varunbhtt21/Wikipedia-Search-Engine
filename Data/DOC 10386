Title : Reference intake
Text : '''Reference intakes''' (RIs) are a means of communicating maximum recommended nutrient intake to the public. Reference Intakes replaced the term [[Guideline Daily Amount]] (GDA), although the principles behind both are the same. The major difference is that GDAs existed for men, women and children; there is only one set of RIs for an average adult.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reference Intakes|url=http://www.foodlabel.org.uk/label/reference-intakes.aspx|publisher=Food and Drink Federation|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

The values for the nutrients are all maximums, not targets. The information is for guidance only and should not be considered individual advice.

The change from GDA to RI on labels on pre-packaged food and drinks sold in the UK is due to [[Regulation (EU) 1169/2011]].<ref>EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New EU law on food information to consumers|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325234056/http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=}}</ref> The intention of the EU Regulation is to harmonise across Europe the content, expression and presentation of the nutrition information given to consumers.

Since RIs are for an average adult, concerns have been raised by major retailers and manufacturers that they may face criticism for misrepresenting the contribution to the diet of products targeted at children, particularly given concerns around children’s diet and [[Epidemiology of childhood obesity|obesity levels]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Adoption of Children’s Reference Intakes for food labelling purposes|url=http://www.sacn.gov.uk/pdfs/sacn1305_childrens_ris.pdf|website=Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition|accessdate=7 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150423/http://www.sacn.gov.uk/pdfs/sacn1305_childrens_ris.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}</ref>

RIs can be combined with [[Traffic light rating system|traffic light labeling]] to make the information easily and rapidly understood.<ref>{{cite web|title=Traffic Light Labelling|url=http://www.sainsburys-live-well-for-less.co.uk/recipes-inspiration/healthier-eating/health-advice/health-labelling/multi-colour-traffic-light-labelling/|website=Traffic Light Labelling|publisher=J Sainsbury plc|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>
