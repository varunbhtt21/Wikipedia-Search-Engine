'''Einar Jolin''' (7 August 1890{{snd}}29 August 1976) was a Swedish [[Painting|painter]] best known for his decorative and slightly [[naïve art|naïve]] [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] style. After studying at [[Konstfack]], [[Stockholm]] in 1906 and at the ''Konstnärsförbundet målarskola'' (the Artists Association Art School), Jolin and his friend [[Isaac Grünewald]] went to Paris for further studies at [[Henri Matisse]]'s academy from 1908 to 1914.

He painted portraits, [[still life]]s and cityscapes, always accentuating what he called "the beautiful" in his motifs. He mainly worked in [[Oil paint|oils]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], using delicate brush strokes and light colors. His most noted works are his paintings of Stockholm during the 1910s and 1920s in his trademark naïve style.

Jolin made numerous travels, collecting impressions and inspiration for his paintings. He journeyed to [[Africa]], [[India]] and the [[West Indies]], but favored the countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], especially the island of [[Capri]] where he also exhibited his works.

He had several exhibitions at [[Liljevalchs konsthall]] in Stockholm and in 1954, he toured the [[United States]] with an exhibition, during which [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] purchased a painting for his office in the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations building]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Einar Jolin was born 7{{nbsp}}August 1890 in Stockholm. He was the son of professor Severin Jolin and grandson of actor Johan Christopher Jolin. He grew up on Kammakargatan 45 in the ''Jolinska Huset'' (Jolin Residence),<ref name="Marten">Mårten Castenfors, 25 September 2010, {{cite web |url=http://www.liljevalchs.se/utstallningar/jolin-1/ |title=Eleganten Einar 140 målningar av Jolin, 2010–2011|trans-title=Einar the Elegant 140 paintings by Jolin |publisher=Liljevalcs art venue |language=Swedish|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> a three-story [[townhouse]] with a garden, built by his grandfather.<ref>Palmgren pp. 15–29.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Jolin Residence, painting, 1943.|url=https://www.bukowskis.com/sv/auctions/555/52-einar-jolin-jolinska-huset-kammakargatan-45|work=Bukowskis|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref> Jolin grew up in the middle of Stockholm close to [[Tegnérlunden]], [[Adolf Fredrik Church]] and [[Vasaparken, Stockholm|Vasaparken]], which may have influenced his depiction of houses, roof tops, and views of Stockholm in his paintings.<ref name="Palmgren 30" /> Jolin loved his house with its exotic furnishings. For interior paintings, he often selected props from things in the house {{ndash}} [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavian]] and [[Empire style]] furniture, [[Chinese embroidery|Chinese embroideries]] and [[Swedish East India Company|East Indian]] tableware.<ref>Palmgren p. 33.</ref> Other residents in the house were his parents, brother Eric, sisters Ingrid and Signe, grandmother Mathilde Wigert-Jolin and his aunt,<ref name="Palmgren 30">Palmgren p. 30.</ref> artist [[Ellen Jolin]] (1854–1939) who was the first to teach Jolin the basic techniques of painting.<ref>Palmgren p. 24.</ref>

Jolin's artistic education started at the Technical School (later known as [[Konstfack]]) in Stockholm in 1906. The school mainly taught painting techniques and Jolin was more interested in learning about style. Within the year, he started looking for another place to continue his studies.<ref>Palmgren pp. 46–50.</ref> At the beginning of the 20th century, the ''Konstnärsförbundet'' (The Artist's Association) had a school on Glasbruksgatan in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bergman|first=Emanuel|title=Aron Gerle och hans konst|trans-title=Aron Gerle and his art|url=http://www.abc.se/~m225/litteratur/hembygd/Arongerle.html|work=Hembygden 1931 |pages=71–75|publisher=abc.se|language=Swedish|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> Jolin applied there in the autumn of 1907.<ref>Palmgren p. 23.</ref> His future teacher [[Karl Nordström]] reviewed his drawings and Jolin was admitted to the school the same year.<ref>Palmgren p. 53.</ref> Jolin joined the inner circle at the school, a group of Scandinavian artists who would later become known as ''De Unga'' (The Young Ones) or ''1909 års män'' (The Men of 1909).<ref>Palmgren p. 55.</ref><ref>Palmgren p. 87.</ref><ref name="Liljevalchs K3">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 3.</ref> Among these were [[Isaac Grünewald]], [[Leander Engström]], [[Birger Simonsson]] and Gösta Sandels.<ref name="Liljevalchs katalog 4">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 4.</ref> Jolin described the pupils at the school as: "...&nbsp;a bunch of individuals with long hair, great muffler scarves and slouch hats worn askew in a way that really impressed me since I was only seventeen and the youngest of the bunch. The most amazing of them all was of course Isaac who had longer and more raven hair than anybody else and a fluttering violet scarf. I had not yet beheld such a creature. We became good friends."<ref name="Liljevalchs K3" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Litografi av Einar Nerman föreställande Isaac Grünerwald och Einar Jolin |trans-title=Lithography by Einar Nerman of Isaac Grünerwald and Einar Jolin |url=http://www.antikvarlden.se/einar-nerman.aspx?article=18799 |work=Periodical |publisher=Antikvärlden |language=Swedish |accessdate=7 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508025413/http://www.antikvarlden.se/einar-nerman.aspx?article=18799 |archivedate=8 May 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Jolin's education at the Artist's Association was curtailed by the school's closure in the spring of 1908.<ref>Palmgren p. 59.</ref>

=== Paris ===
In 1908, Jolin and Isaac Grünewald left Sweden for the vibrant life in Paris and its art community.<ref>Palmgren p. 67.</ref> The Swedish painter, graphic artist and forester Carl Palme knew Henri Matisse<ref>Palmgren p. 72.</ref> and helped the artist to find a suitable location for the new Matisse Academy. An abandoned nunnery in central Paris became the first home for the academy.<ref name="Palmgren 75">Palmgren p. 75.</ref> Together with Grünewald and Leander Engström, Jolin joined the Matisse Academy, where their friends from Stockholm had already been accepted as pupils.<ref name="Palmgren 75" /><ref name="Michaela">{{cite web |url=http://auktionsverket.se/aktuellt/michaela-jolin-om-einar-jolin/ |title=Michaela Jolin om Einar Jolin |trans-title=Michaela Jolin about Einar Jolin|publisher=Stockholms Auktionsverk |language=Swedish|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> At the Academy, Jolin would develop his sense for a stylish line in combination with bright and clean colours in his paintings.<ref name="Liljevalchs katalog 4" /><ref>Palmgren p. 13.</ref>

Jolin's time at the Academy proved more educational for him than the schools he had previously attended and the experience he got from having an established artist as mentor, was important for his development as an artist.<ref name="Palmgren 79">Palmgren p. 79.</ref> Even so, the influence of Matisse on his young pupils should not be exaggerated. Jolin learned [[croquis]] at the academy and also developed a natural, spontaneous speed in his brushwork.<ref>Palmgren p. 81.</ref> He mostly painted models and still life,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nerman|first1=Einar|title=Konturer, minnen och modeller|date=1938|location=Stockholm|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/2932912|language=Swedish|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref> and during a visit to the south of France in 1911, he made his earliest landscapes.<ref name="Palmgren 80" /> At the school, Jolin got his first nickname; the other students, as well as Matisse, used to call him "The Puppy" since he was the youngest of the students.<ref name=Michaela /><ref>Angelini-Jolin p 35.</ref>

During his time in Paris, Jolin became good friends with [[Nils von Dardel|Nils Dardel]]. Jolin also spent some time in [[Senlis]] where he depicted its street life 1913,<ref name="Michaela" /> before returning to Stockholm the following year.<ref>Palmgren p. 85.</ref>

=== Return to Stockholm ===

[[File:Konstnären Einar Jolin som ung.JPG|thumb|Portrait of artist Einar Jolin next to one of his paintings, sometime between 1925 and 1941.]]
In the spring of 1914, when Jolin and his friends from the Matisse Academy returned to Stockholm,<ref name="Liljevalchs K5">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 5.</ref> the group became known as ''De Unga'' (The Young Ones). Their participation and paintings created uproar in the [[Baltic Exhibition]] in [[Malmö]].<ref name="Palmgren 88" /> [[Albert Engström]], artist and influential member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] as well as other members of the Swedish art world at that time, stated that they were perplexed and unable to understand The Young Ones' works.<ref name="Liljevalchs K7">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 7.</ref>

Jolin had planned to return to Paris the following summer, but the outbreak of World War I on 28{{nbsp}}July 1914, forced him to reconsider his decision. With the road to France closed, he decided to stay in Stockholm,<ref name="Liljevalchs K7" /> and managed to obtain a studio workshop on Fiskargatan 9,<ref>Palmgren p. 91.</ref> in the so-called "Scandalous House" {{efn|The house is very tall and obstructs the [[Katarina Church]], which was considered scandalous at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jörgensen|first=Johan|title=Percy säljer drömlyan|trans-title=Percy sells the dream flat|url=http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article2569989.ece|work=Affärsvärlden online|publisher=Affärsvärlden|language=Swedish|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> The house once again became noted in 2006 when ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'' by [[Stieg Larsson]] was published. In the book it is the home of character [[Lisbeth Salander]].}} near [[Katarina Church]] in the southern part of town.<ref name="Michaela" /> From his window he had a wide view of the city, the [[Stockholms ström]] and the harbour entrance. In that apartment, during the years 1914–1915, he created some of his best-known vistas of Stockholm.<ref name="Palmgren p. 95">Palmgren p. 95.</ref>

In 1917, Jolin rented a studio at Kungsbroplan in Stockholm and painted diligently.<ref>Palmgren p. 107.</ref> At the end of that year he was visited by Herman Gotthardt, a wholesaler from Malmö, who had recently taken up art collecting as a hobby.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gotthard|first1=Herman|title=Herman Gotthardts konstsamling|trans-title=The art collection of Herman Gotthard|date=1933|publisher=John Kroon|location=Malmö|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/1354766|language=Swedish|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref> He studied Jolin's numerous works and, as at this time the artists sold very few paintings, it came as a surprise to him when Gotthardt bought 16 canvases. Jolin received seven thousand crowns ([[Swedish krona|sek]]) for the paintings, and at home the same evening he was able to show his parents the money from his first major sales, saying: "Look here, this is what I earned today".<ref>Palmgren pp. 107–108.</ref>

Jolin spent most of 1918 in [[Copenhagen]],<ref name="Liljevalchs K7" /> where he showed his paintings at an art gallery at Nikolaiplads.<ref>Palmgren p. 109.</ref> They sold well enough for him to stay in [[Denmark]] almost a year. Jolin enjoyed life in the Danish capital, the social life was more spontaneous than in Stockholm and people from different professions, or social standings, mixed with each other in a way that appealed to him.<ref>Palmgren p 113.</ref>

=== Travelling ===

After World War I, traveling was once again possible for the many young artists who had been forced to stay home during the six years of war. In 1920, Jolin went on a journey, first to Italy,<ref>Palmgren p. 129.</ref><ref name="Liljevalchs K13">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 13.</ref> North Africa and Spain for new international impressions, and then on to India, Africa<ref>Palmgren p. 147.</ref> and the West Indies.<ref>Palmgren p. 173.</ref> In the spring of 1924, Jolin went to Spain with his first wife, Britt von Zweigbergk. Like many other artists he painted the bullfights,<ref name="Liljevalchs K13" /><ref>Palmgren p. 159.</ref> but contrary to the strong, and sometimes bloody, bullfight painted by his colleague and close friend [[Gösta Adrian-Nilsson]] (GAN),{{efn|His name, [[Gösta Adrian-Nilsson]], is very long and cumbersome to pronounce in Swedish, whereas his initials form a name easy to say and remember. He was called GAN his entire life.

In 1931, Jolins friend, GAN moved to Bastugatan 25, and in 1936, Jolin followed his example and rented an apartment in the same building, where he lived until 1943.<ref name=GAN /><ref>{{cite web|title=Husets och omgivningens historia|trans-title=The history of the house and its surroundings|url=http://www.bastugatan25.se/historia.html|work=Website|publisher=Bostadsrättföreningen Katthuvudet 17|language=Swedish|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> At that time the street was home to numerous artists and writers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tjerneld|first1=Staffan|title=Stockholmsliv: hur vi bott, arbetat och roat oss under 100 år.|trans-title=Life in Stockholm: how we have lived, worked and amused ourselves over a century.|chapter=Människor på Mariaberget|date=1950–1951|publisher=Nordstedt|location=Stockholm|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/1420493|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref> The Swedish writer [[Ivar Lo-Johansson]], who had a studio apartment at number 21, described life in the area thus: "In a part of a street, no longer than three hundred meters, everything existed.

During the years from 1935 to 1956, Jolin spent much of his time travelling.<ref>Angelini-Jolin pp. 55–68.</ref> In 1954, he toured the United States with an exhibition. It was opened in January, by Swedish ambassador [[Erik Boheman]], at Galerie St. Etienne in New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Exhibitions|url=http://www.gseart.com/Exhibitions/Modern-Furies-1048.php|work=Website|publisher=Galerie St. Etienne|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], attended the exhibition and bought a painting depicting [[Riddarholmen]] for his study of the United Nations building.

=== Family and later life ===

With the birth of his first daughter, Michaela, in 1958,<ref>Angelini-Jolin p. 118.</ref> Jolin settled down to a more quiet life as a father and family man.<ref>Angelini-Jolin pp. 153–164.</ref> His second daughter Angelina was born in 1966.<ref>Angelini-Jolin p. 146.</ref> He continued to paint, mostly still life and portraits, at his studio apartment at Stagneliusvägen 34, in Fredhäll.<ref>Angelini-Jolin p. 139.</ref> He spent most summers with his family in [[Tällberg]] in the [[Dalarna County]] or at [[Villa San Michele]] on the island of [[Capri]].<ref>Angelini-Jolin pp. 139–164.</ref> Although he held some minor exhibitions,<ref>Angelini-Jolin pp. 158–177.</ref> his work from the 1960s to his death in 1976, did not receive the same acclaim as his earlier paintings.<ref name=DN>{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Birgitta|title=Einar Jolin på Liljevalchs|trans-title=Einar Jolin at Liljevalchs|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/konstrecensioner/einar-jolin-pa-liljevalchs/|website=www.dn.se|publisher=''[[Dagens Nyheter]]''|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>

Jolin married three times and had three children. His first marriage was to Britt von Zweigbergk, 1921–1936,<ref>Angelini-Jolin p. 40.</ref> during which time they had a son, Christopher Jolin, born in 1925.<ref name="Angelini-Jolin p. 41">Angelini-Jolin p. 41.</ref> He was married secondly to Clorinda Campbell Kissack in the years 1943–1950,<ref name="Angelini-Jolin p. 41" /> and thirdly in 1952–1976 (his death) to singer Tatjana Angelini-Scheremetiew.<ref>Angelini-Jolin pp. 55–59.</ref> Einar Jolin died on 29{{nbsp}}August 1976, and is buried at [[Norra Begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm.<ref>Björnberg p 48.</ref>

== Career ==

=== Style ===

Although influenced by Matisse, the [[Orient]]al art that Jolin discovered at [[Guimet Museum|Musée Guimet]] was even more important to his style. [[Chinese art|Chinese]] and [[Japanese art]] became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s.<ref name="Liljevalchs katalog 4" /><ref name="Palmgren 80">Palmgren p. 80.</ref> Jolin's style deviates from that of the traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.<ref>Palmgren pp. 160–162</ref>

Jolin, as well as Dardel, used a naïve style in their paintings before this concept had been introduced into the Swedish art world.<ref name="Palmgren 88">Palmgren p. 88.</ref> Both Jolin and Dardel were inspired by French naïvists, not just by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], but also by [[Séraphine Louis]] who lived in Sentis<ref>Palmgren p. 82.</ref> and [[Wilhelm Uhde]], a specialist in naïve painting. Matisse, Jolin's and Dardel's mentor, was no stranger to naïve art but it was not prominent in his work. Jolin also appreciated the cultivated and sophisticated, older painting, and was deeply impressed during his visits to the [[Louvre]], where he was inspired by the works of masters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Chardin]].<ref name="Palmgren 79" />

=== Expressionism ===
[[File:Einar Jolin - Interiör med ung dam (Ebba Pantzerhielm) 1915.png|thumb|''Interiour with a young lady (Ebba Pantzerhielm)'', 1915, oil on canvas, {{nowrap|170 × 111&nbsp;cm}}, Malmö Museum, Sweden<ref name=Marten />]]
In 1913 to 1914 Jolin started to paint in his own naïve interpretation of Expressionism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wretholm|first=Eugen |title=Einar Jolin och det primitiva|trans-title=Einar Jolin and the primitive|journal=Paletten|language=Swedish|date=1949}}</ref> By the end of the 1910s his works became more expressed and the shapes more plastic, but in 1916, Jolin's paintings were still inspired by the years he spent in France.<ref name="Palmgren 96" /> That spring, members of the ''Konstnärsförbundet'' (The Artists Association) and their young pupils, were invited to present the new style, Expressionism, to the Swedish audience as exhibition number two (number one being [[Anders Zorn]], [[Bruno Liljefors]] and [[Carl Larsson]]) at the new art venue, the Liljevalchs konsthall, in [[Djurgården]].<ref>Palmgren p. 97.</ref> Participating in the second exhibition were a number of noted Swedish artists at that time, including Leander Engström, Isaac Grünewald, Gösta Sandels, Birger Simonsson and Jolin who exhibited thirteen paintings.<ref name="Liljevalchs K7" /><ref name="Palmgren 98">Palmgren p. 98.</ref>

Two so dissimilar painters and tempers as Einar Jolin and GAN were both called Expressionists.<ref name=GAN>{{cite web|last=Jörgensen|first=Johan|title=Där ett konstnärsväsen klingar – Om GAN|trans-title=Where the spririt of an artist sounds – About GAN|url=http://tidningenkulturen.se/artiklar/konst/konstens-portraett/14126-daer-ett-konstnaersvaesen-klingar-om-gan|work=Tidningen Kulturen online|publisher=Tidningen Kulturen|language=Swedish|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="Palmgren 116">Palmgren p. 116.</ref> During most of the 1910s this term was used in a number of contexts in Sweden. In 1915, the [[Herwarth Walden]] gallery [[Der Sturm]] in Berlin,<ref name="Palmgren 115">Palmgren p. 115.</ref> a venue for Expressionists, presented an exhibition, ''Schwedishe Expressionisten'' (Swedish Expressionism), with works by Swedish artists.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Hubert van den Berg|title=A cultural history of the avant-garde in the Nordic countries 1900–1925|series=Avant-garde critical studies, 1387–3008 ; 28|year=2012|publisher=Rodopi|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-420-3620-8|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/13921941}}</ref> Jolin participated with six paintings, three of these were vistas from Stockholm.

Jolin was tired of Isaac Grünewalds increasingly dominant role among the young Swedish artists at that time, a sentiment shared by GAN.<ref name="Palmgren 98" /> Expressionism never became a dominant style for Jolin, not in the way GAN and other members of the group embraced it. GAN always objected to Jolin's choice to include colors such as pearl gray and light purple or violet in his paintings.<ref>Palmgren p. 167.</ref>

During the years 1925–35, Jolin's style is characterized by light, soft, grey notes and [[Pastel (color)|pastels]].<ref>Palmgren pp. 167–172.</ref> Later on, still life featuring Oriental porcelain, preferably displayed on a reflecting mahogany tabletop,<ref>Palmgren p. 161.</ref> became a more common motif.<ref name="Liljevalchs K19">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 19.</ref> He also painted numerous portraits of the Swedish socialites at that time.<ref name="Marten" /><ref name="Liljevalchs K16">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 16.</ref>

In the 1930s, Nils Palmgren, named a group of Swedish painters "The Purists",<ref>{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Jody|title=Le tumulte noir: modernist art and popular entertainment in jazz-age Paris, 1900–1930|year=1999|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=0-271-01753-8|page=138|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/4748620}}</ref> an expression originally coined by the French artists Amedée Ozenfant and [[Le Corbusier]]. Palmgren referred to painters such as Torsten Jovinge, Erik Byström, Wilhelm Wik and Helge Linden. But, according to Palmgren, Einar Jolin could also be called a [[Purism|Purist]] since he constantly stressed that colors should be kept pure, contours clear and the composition of the motif orderly.<ref>Palmgren p. 19.</ref>
During his more than 70-year career, Jolin always followed his own path.<ref name="Marten" /><ref>Palmgren p. 185.</ref> Through his motifs, characteristic portrayals, still lifes and pictures of Stockholm, an observer can follow Jolin on his journeys to other cultures, explore the collected artifacts in his house or get acquainted with what Stockholm looked like during the first part of the 1900s. Nils Palmgren ends his 1947 biography on Einar Jolin with the words:

{{quotation | Nils Palmgren on Jolin:
:Let us just say this: The artistic hallmark of Einar Jolin comes from his eternal worship of natures beauty, the beauty in landscapes, women, flowers and animals, fabrics and things. He is a tenderhearted, although a bit pretentious guardian of the artistic purity, the simple line, the clear spaces and the poet of soft shapes. His best human qualities are character, pride and courage to walk alone against the tide.<ref>Palmgren p. 207.</ref>}}

=== Depicting Stockholm ===

[[File:Einar Jolin Stockholm från Söders höjder 1938.png|thumb|''Stockholm from the heights of Söder'', 1938, oil on canvas]]
Jolin started to depict Stockholm when he moved to Fiskargatan, on the tall cliffs of southern Stockholm in 1914. From his studio he could see most of the city. He divided the view, facing [[Stadsgården]] or [[Riddarholmen]], into smaller frames for his painings. Noted works from that time are: ''Strömmen mot Kastellholmen'' (Over the Strömmen on to the Kastellholmen) 1914, now in the [[Stockholm City Museum]]; ''Utsikt över Riddarholmen'' (View of Riddarholmen) 1914, bought by the [[Nationalmuseum]] but kept in the [[Moderna Museet]],<ref name="Moderna">{{cite web|url=http://www.modernamuseet.se/Samlingen/Samlingen/Sok-i-samlingen/ |title=108 works By Einar Jolin at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm and Malmö, database |publisher=Moderna Museet digital data base |language=Swedish |accessdate=7 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328060233/http://www.modernamuseet.se/Samlingen/Samlingen/Sok-i-samlingen/ |archivedate=28 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> and ''Utsikt mot Kastellholmen'' (View towards the Kastellholmen) 1915, now in the Malmö Konstmuseum.<ref name=Moderna /> In the ''Stockholm från Söders höjder'' (Stockholm from the heights of Söder) 1938, elements from Oriental art are present in the naked, branches of the trees and the red buoys looking like Chinese lanterns hanging in the trees.<ref name=Marten /> These paintings are defined by swift, flowing brushwork and forceful contours framing fresh, light colours. His composition of the motif involved putting details against big blocks of cool pink, sheer blue, ivory turquoise and emerald, thereby creating a populated setting.<ref>Palmgren pp. 95–96.</ref> There is always an air of teaming citylife along the docks and busy boating on the water of the Strömmen in these paintings.<ref name="Palmgren 96" />

Jolin was a strong advocate for the architectural and aesthetic preservation of the capital, as is written in his draft for a pamphlet called ''Mot strömmen'' (Against the Tide).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jolin|first=Einar|title=Mot strömmen|trans-title=Against the tide|journal=Konstrevy |language=Swedish|date=1954}}</ref> According to him, Stockholm had become an ugly town, by insensitive mixing of styles, densification, and centuries of eager renovation.<ref>Palmgren p. 206.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Wretholm |first=Eugen |title=En blond arkitekt|trans-title=A blond architect |journal=Konstperspektiv |issue=1|language=Swedish|date=1950}}</ref> Jolin wanted to bring out the beautiful and the genuine in the cityscape, as well as restore, what he considered to be distorted parts of the city, to their former glory.<ref>Palmgren p. 205.</ref> According to Palmgren, perhaps it was that dream Jolin expressed in his depictions of Stockholm.<ref>Palmgren p. 196.</ref> At the end of the 19th century, and during some decades into the 20th century, artists depicted Stockholm in a variety of ways, each according to his own mind and individualism. Traditionalists worked side by side with Modernists, old with young, seasoned pursuers of the established view of the city and young enthusiastic individuals, such as Jolin.<ref name="Liljevalchs K11">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 11.</ref> By the middle of the 20th century, his focus shifted from the cityscape to other motifs such as ''[[chinoiserie]]'' settings,<ref>{{cite journal| last=Wretholm |first=Eugen |title=Kinesen bland dovhjortar |trans-title=The Chinaman among fallows |journal=Ord och Bild |language=Swedish|date=1949}}</ref> but in his youth,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hoppe |first=R. |title=Einar Jolins konst |trans-title=The art of Einar Jolin |journal=Konstrevy |language=Swedish|date=1928}}</ref> he and his friends from his years in Paris found inspiration in Stockholm and its surroundings.<ref name="Palmgren p. 95" />

{{quotation | Einar Jolin said of his 1957 retrospective exhibition at the Liljevalchs konsthall:
:In my art I want to express what I have experienced when I have concentrated and immersed myself. There is this everyday view—man has named everything that surrounds her in life and she finds all this self evident and do not see the wonder of it. To me, art is to give form to the wonders of creation, to create beauty and harmony, to be able to lift a receptive observer from the trivial everyday life into the beautiful and fathomless in which we live. If I have succeeded in this, my life have not been in vain.{{efn|The Swedish word for "man" as in "mankind" has no gender, Jolin, and most Swedes, refer to "mankind" as "she".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| title =Människa|trans-title=Man| encyclopedia =[[Svenska Akademiens Ordbok]]| year =1945| pages=M1931| publisher =[[Swedish Academy]]| location =Stockholm|language=Swedish}}</ref>}}<ref name="Liljevalchs K23">Liljevalchs Katalog p. 23.</ref>}}

Throughout his life he continued to paint romanticized exteriors of Stockholm, whether in spring sunshine or winter haze, the city was always depicted as beautiful and unspoiled.<ref name="Palmgren 96">Palmgren p. 96.</ref> He expressed the idea that only through the emotions of an individual could [[nature]] be depicted the right way. In the magazine ''Konst'' (Art) 1913–14, he writes on ''False perspective and exaggerations in modern art etc.'' that: "Nature is wonderful, but a photo is nothing, because nature becomes wonderful only when it is seen and understood by a great human, and a great human always sees and feels something special in nature, something she wants to reproduce."<ref>{{cite book |url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/1161693?vw=full |date=1911–1918 |title=Konst 1913–14. |trans-title=Art 1913–1914 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Bröderna Lagerström |language=Swedish|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>
