Fails PORNBIO and the GNG. No qualifying awards, just employee-of-the-month-type tinfiol citations from her porn industry employers. No independent reliable sourcing beyond reported castlists. No reliably sourced biographical content. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 16:50, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Fails PORNBIO without significant awards. Fails GNG without substantial coverage by reliable sources. Most of the citations in the article are from unreliable sources. The reliable source citations are about a film she stars in. Of those, two are merely cast listings and the rest don't mention her at all. No non-trivial RS coverage found in search. [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 18:47, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''keep''' the article is fairly new as stated on article history logs, article needs more time to be judged for deletion. Quality of the article seems good with neutral tone of language with no [[WP:PROMOTION]] material, as far the references are concerned the article follows the Wikipedia policy [[wp:soapbox]] which clearly states '''"Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical sources is unacceptable".''' <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Science.Warrior|Science.Warrior]] ([[User talk:Science.Warrior|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Science.Warrior|contribs]]) 11:38, 29 April 2014‎ (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->
:*The subject's notability, not the article's neutrality, is in question here. Giving the article more time to establish notability will not help as significant coverage by reliable sources does not appear to exist. [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 13:06, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''keep''' What needs to be kept in mind here is that Lowe is a UK performer, she is notable in her field within the UK and should therefore not be expected to conform to the same requirements expected of U.S performers. The awards she is nominated for this year are notable UK awards and not "employee of the month tinfoil" type awards. She is also the leading star of one of the most notable and publicised porn films from the UK to date.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:BrandonBoyd79|BrandonBoyd79]] ([[User talk:BrandonBoyd79|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/BrandonBoyd79|contribs]]) 13:56, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
