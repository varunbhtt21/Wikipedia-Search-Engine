==Etymology==
Altishahr is derived from the Turkic word ''alti'', which means six, and Persian word ''shahr'', for city.<ref name=Newby4>[[#Newby|Newby 2005]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KTmO416hNQ8C&pg=PA4&dq=altishahr+seven+cities&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FRtdU7aXIbXLsQTM8YGoCg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=altishahr%20seven%20cities&f=false 4 n.10]</ref>  The term was used by Turkic-speaking inhabitants of the Tarim Basin in the 18th and 19th century.  Other local words for the region included ''Dorben Shahr'', the "four cities" and ''Yeti Shahr'', the "seven cities".<ref name=Newby4/><ref name="Canfield">{{cite book|title=Ethnicity, Authority, and Power in Central Asia: New Games Great and Small|first=Robert Leroy|last=Canfield|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2010|page=45}}</ref>

Altishahr was adopted by some Western sources in the 19th century.<ref name=Newby4/>  Another Western term for the same region is Kashgaria.<ref name=Newby4/> Qing sources refer to the region primarily as ''Nanlu'' or the Southern Circuit.<ref name=Newby4/>  Other [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] terms for the region include ''Huijiang'' (the "Muslim Frontier"), ''Huibu'' (the "Muslim Tribal Area), and ''Bacheng'' (the "Eight Cities").<ref name=Newby4/> or Nanjiang.<ref>{{cite book|author=S.

==Geography and relation to Xinjiang==
[[File:Xinjiang regions simplified.png|thumb|right|Dzungaria (Red) and the Tarim Basin (Blue)]]

[[File:Altai, Tienschan-Orte.png|thumb|250px|right|Physical map showing the separation of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Taklamakan) by the Tian Shan Mountains]]

Altishahr refers to the [[Tarim Basin]] of southern Xinjiang, which was historically, geographically, and ethnically distinct from the [[Dzungarian Basin]] of northern Xinjiang. At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by steppe dwelling, nomadic [[Dzungar people]], [[Oirat Mongols]] who practiced [[Tibetan Buddhism]].  The Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, Turkic speaking Muslim farmers, now known as the [[Uyghur people]]. The two regions were governed as separate circuits until Xinjiang was made into a single province in 1884.

In the 18th century, prior to the [[Ten Great Campaigns#The Zunghars and pacification of Xinjiang|Qing conquest of Xinjiang in 1759]], the oasis towns around the Tarim did not have a single political structure governing them, and Altishahr did not refer to specific cities but the region generally.<ref name="Beller-Hann">[[#Beller-Hann|Bellér-Hann 2008]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4lMj8skvoC&pg=PA39&dq=altishahr+six+cities&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WyRdU4GfNI7isATfxoEg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=altishahr%20six%20cities&f=false 39 nn.7 & 8]</ref>  Foreign visitors to the region have tried to identify the cities and offered various lists.<ref name="Beller-Hann"/>

[[Albert von Le Coq]]'s six cities were: (1) [[Kashgar]], (2) [[Maralbexi]] (Maralbashi, Bachu), (3) [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]] (Aqsu), (4) [[Yengisar County|Yengisar]] (Yengi Hisar), (5) [[Yarkant County|Yarkant]] (Yarkand, Shache) and (6) [[Khotan]], with [[Kargilik Town|Kargilik]] (Yecheng) as an alternative to Aksu.<ref name="Beller-Hann"/>  W. Barthold replaced Yengisar with [[Kucha]] (Kuqa).<ref name="Beller-Hann"/>

The term Seven Cities may have been used after [[Yaqub Beg]] captured [[Turpan]] (Turfan) and referred to (1) Kashgar, (2) Yarkant, (3) Khotan, (4) [[Uqturpan]] (Uch Turfan), (5) Aksu, (6) Kucha, and (7) Turpan.<ref name="Beller-Hann"/>

The term Eight Cities (Шәкиз Шәһәр ''Şäkiz Şähār'') may have been a Turkic translation of the Qing Chinese term ''Nanlu Bajiang'', literally the "Eight Cities of the Southern Circuit", which referred to (1) Kashgar, (2) Yengisar (3) Yarkant and (4) Khotan in the west and (5) Uqturpan, (6) Aksu, (7) [[Karasahr]] (Qarashahr, Yanqi), and (8) Turpan in the east.<ref name="Beller-Hann"/>

According to [[Aurel Stein]], in the early 20th century, Qing administrators used the term to describe the oasis towns around Khotan: (1) Khotan, (2) Yurungqash, (3) [[Karakax County|Karakax]] (Qaraqash, Moyu), (4) [[Qira County|Qira]] (Chira, Cele), (5) [[Keriya Town|Keriya]] (Yutian), and a sixth undocumented place.<ref name="Beller-Hann"/>

== History ==
{{See also|Dzungar conquest of Altishahr|Xinjiang under Qing rule}}
Until the 8th century AD, much of the Tarim Basin was inhabited by [[Tocharians]] who spoke an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Tocharian languages|language]] and built city states in the oases along the rim of the Taklamakhan desert.  The collapse of the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghur Khanate]] in modern [[Mongolia]] and settlement of Uyghur diaspora in the Tarim led to the prevalence of the [[Turkic languages]].  During the reign of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanids]] much of the region [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan|converted]] to [[Islam]].  From the 13th to the 16th centuries, the western Tarim was part of the larger Muslim [[Turco-Mongol|Turkic-Mongol]] [[Chagatai Khanate|Chaghatay]], [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] and [[Moghulistan|Eastern Chagatai]] Empires.  In the 17th century, the local [[Yarkent Khanate]] ruled Altishahr until its [[Dzungar conquest of Altishahr|conquest]] by the [[Buddhist]] [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]s from the Dzungarian Basin to the north.  In the 1750s, the region was acquired by [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] in its conquest of the [[Dzungar Khanate]].  The Qing initially administered the Dzungaria and Altishahar separately as respectively, the Northern and Southern Circuits of [[Tian Shan]],<ref name="Michell 1870">[https://books.google.com/books?id=reBFF3fWjPAC&pg=RA1-PA2&dq=Dzungaria+migrants&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jhfuUpn3MZXMsQTWu4DIAg&ved=0CC8Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=Dzungaria%20migrants&f=false Michell 1870], p. 2.</ref><ref name="Martin 1847">[https://books.google.com/books?id=SV9AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false Martin 1847], p. 21.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ik4BAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA554#v=onepage&q&f=false Fisher 1852], p. 554.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KGlJAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA681#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, Volume 23'' 1852], p. 681.</ref> although both were under control of the [[General of Ili]]. The Southern Circuit (''Tianshan Nanlu'') was also known as ''Huibu'' (回部 Muslim Region), ''Huijiang'' (回疆 Muslim Frontier), Chinese Turkestan, Kashgaria, Little Bukharia, East Turkestan. After quelling the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]] in the late 19th century, the Qing combined the two circuits into the newly created [[Xinjiang]] Province in 1884.  Xinjiang has since been used by the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] and [[People's Republic of China]] and southern Xinjiang replaced Altishahr as place name for the region.
