{{DYK nompage links|nompage=Jean D&#39;Costa|Jean D'Costa}}
* <s>... that [[Jamaica]]n author of ''[[Escape to Last Man Peak]]'' (1976), '''[[Jean D'Costa]]''', earned a [[Musgrave Medal|Silver Musgrave award]] for her contributions to children's literature?</s>
:*
<small>Created by [[User:Legally Sher|Legally Sher]] ([[User talk:Legally Sher|talk]]). Self nominated at 17:08, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] This appears to be the page creator's first nomination: Welcome to DYK! No QPQ necessary. Article was created 6 days before nomination, which I accept. It is long enough, adequately referenced, and has no close paraphrasing issues. The hook ref is cited to the publisher's page &ndash; not the best of references. A [[WP:SECONDARY|secondary source]] rather than a primary source is much more preferable. Are you able to find an announcement of her reward in a newspaper or magazine clipping, perhaps?
:*I'm also wondering why you chose to highlight ''[[Escape to Last Man Peak]]'' in the hook rather than ''[[Sprat Morrison]]'', which is in its second printing?
:* Regarding the article, it reads like a standard bio, a rather dry series of facts. It would be appropriate to add a section about D'Costa's writing style, language (use of [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican Creole]]), subjects, and themes. There is some information along those lines in footnotes 3 and 5. Best, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 20:45, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]], the nominator hasn't edited on Wikipedia since April 27, the date this was nominated. At this point, unless you're willing to fix the problems you've found, I don't see any alternative but to close this as unsuccessful, but I'll leave that determination to you, since it depends on your decision on whether to edit further.

:::*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  OK, I added a section about Themes, and would like to propose this new, reliably sourced hook:
:::*'''ALT1''': ... that '''[[Jean D'Costa]]'''{{`s}} novels for children have narrative in Standard English and dialogue in [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican Creole]]? [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 21:38, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Interesting hook fact, and reliably sourced. Length, date, copvio and references have been checked by Yoninah above, and there are no policy issues in the new section added. I have also added a <nowiki>{{DYKmake}}</nowiki> for Yoninah because of her additions to the article. [[User:97198|97198]] ([[User talk:97198|talk]]) 11:24, 1 June 2014 (UTC)
