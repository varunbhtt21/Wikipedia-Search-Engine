}}'''''The Physics arXiv Blog''''' aims to offer an alternative view of  new ideas in science. It is based on, although independent of, the [[arXiv]] pre-print repository run by the [[Cornell University]].  Started in 2007,  in 2009 it was hosted by the [[MIT Technology Review]]. In 2013, it was moved to the platform [[Medium (service)|Medium]]. In 2015 it moved back to the [[MIT Technology Review]].

''The Physics arXiv Blog''  has been said to offer  "the best physics coverage around" by the [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] journal.{{when|date=November 2016}}<ref>
