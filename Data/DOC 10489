==Reception==
''The Disobedient'' received mixed reviews upon its premiere at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]]. Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', said in his review that "There’s nothing wrong with “The Disobedient” that an actual script couldn’t have helped, at the very least. In all other departments, it’s quite smartly turned, the dominating contribution (and pleasure) being Djorde Arambasic’s often lovely, mostly outdoor photography. Screener viewed lacked closing credits."<ref>{{cite web |title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The Disobedient’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-the-disobedient-1201060758/|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> Stephen Farber in his review for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "Painfully slow Serbian road movie offers few rewards for American viewers."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Disobedient: Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/disobedient-sundance-review-673037|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

However, Mark Adams from ''[[Screen International]]'' praised the film by saying that "A lush and lyrical tale, rich in its presentation of tantalising pastoral romance set against a beautiful sunbaked landscape."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Disobedient|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/the-disobedient/5065380.article|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> Ben Umstead of ''[[Twitch Film]]'' also gave the film a positive review and said that "it is the celebration of youth, and the understanding that we should cherish it while we can, for it won't always be the same."<ref>{{cite web |title=Sundance 2014 Review: THE DISOBEDIENT Is A Marvelously Absurdist Abstraction Of Young Adulthood|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/01/sundance-2014-review-the-disobedient-is-a-marvelously-absurdist-abstraction-of-young-adulthood.html|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>
