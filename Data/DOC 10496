Not sure how being a president of a squash club is notable. Does not seem to something that go under a political thing. Unless if there is more he has done, this should be either a merge or a delete. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:25, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' He's president of a sporting club, but that doesn't give him automatic notability.  He lacks the coverage needed to meet GNG.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 16:08, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': To be fair, Al Ahly is more than a squash club but a leading football club in its country. However its presidency is not [[:WP:NOTINHERITED|automatically notable]] and in the absence of [[:WP:RS|evidence]] of other achievements by the subject in his own right, and noting that the sole reference even describes him as "Little known", he fails [[:WP:ANYBIO]]. (There also appears to have been an accumulation of articles around the officials of this club, noting [[:President of El-Ahly]] and [[:President of El-Ahly Sports Club]], both I think of debatable notability.)
