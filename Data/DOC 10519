:::<small>Note: The following templates will need to be changed: [[:Template:Lake index]], [[:Template:SIA]], [[:Template:mountainindex]]</small>
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Consistency. At present some of these categories have names like "''Lists of roads sharing the same title''", some are like "''Scottish Island set index articles''", some are like "''Set indices on lakes''".  The proposed name fits the SIA template message "''a list of related items that share the same name (or similar names)''" and is similar to some of the page titles (e.g. "''[[List of lakes named Diamond]]''").  The term "set index" is an example of (en?)-wiki-specific jargon that's confusing for newbies (and some experienced editors) - there are  [[List of telephone company buildings|m]][[Cumulus congestus cloud|a]][[Middle Ages in popular culture|n]][[Manifold (engineering)|y]] [[Zo people|p]][[Lists of cities in the Palestinian territories|a]][[List of conflicts in the Arab League|g]][[Index of Cameroon-related articles|e]][[List of aircraft manufacturers|s]] that have been incorrectly tagged as a SIA. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 20:32, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''keep''' I don't see the confusion here. Set indices is precise; and the contents are not technically lists but <s>disambiguation pages</s>set indices, but I suppose that's a formality.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 20:48, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

::erp, sorry, corrected. Anyway, we have this defined in policy at [[WP:SIA]] and there is a top-level category for same, so this would entail a renaming of a whole lot of content - policy, categories, templates, etc, all to fix some presumed confusion which I'm not seeing yet, and which can be easily addressed by pointing people to the relevant pages and asking them to read carefully.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 21:03, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::The main reason for the proposed rename is consistency (with the other cats in the nom and the roads SIA categories, some of which have existed since 2005); we generally consider consistency in categorization to be a good thing.  We already have some SIA cats titled "''List of ... sharing the same ...''" so renaming some others is not going to make the sky fall down. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 21:29, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::If we're going by consistency, we should be consistent with the guidance language, the template, and the parent category at {{cl|Set_indices}}. I count 45 subcategories, the majority of which are "set indexes" cats [http://tools.wmflabs.org/catscan2/quick_intersection.php?lang=en&project=wikipedia&cats=Set+indices&ns=14&depth=12&max=30000&start=0&format=html&redirects=&callback=]. Indeed there could be an argument to rename some of the others.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 15:07, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' set indices are set indices, there's no need to muddy the waters. If you want a greater list category, then create a supercategory for them. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.206|65.94.171.206]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.206|talk]]) 04:55, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': There is no [[year zero]] in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], nor in the [[Julian calendar]].

*'''Comment''': If this were a page, I would '''oppose''' deletion for obvious reasons: people unfamiliar with [[Year 1]] would look up 0 BC. However, as a category, I would say '''strong delete''' except that in looking at the [[Special:UnusedCategories|Unused Categories]] page, there are many such category redirects present. I'd [[WP:BOLD|boldly CfD them all]], but the large quantity of examples gives me pause to wonder if there is a legitimate reason for these to exist. [[User:Jsharpminor|Jsharpminor]] ([[User talk:Jsharpminor|talk]]) 19:47, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''keep''' harmless as a redirect. This is not misleading, it is filling a gap with a useful redirect.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 19:50, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep as a redirect''' -- 1 BC was followed by 1 AD, as the concept of zero was a later development.  These are useful to prevent inadvertent creation and population of improper categories.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 18:11, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Peterkingiron, but retarget to [[:Category:1 births]].  Anyone typing "0 BC" means the year after 1 BC, which unambiguously was AD 1.  Right now, the {{tl|category redirect}} bots will automatically fix categories for someone mis-assigned to this category, but if we delete it, they won't.  Right now, people going to this category learn their error and go to the right place.  Right now, nobody's going to repurpose this as a normal category, but if we delete it, someone might create it with the normal category coding (<nowiki>{{M1YearInTopic (no calendar)|0}} {{birthyr||0}}</nowiki>) and inadvertently create confusion.

These provinces were all relatively short-lived in comparison to the region's history (founded in the 1860s, abolished through the Balkans Wars/World War I fifty years later), artificial (they did not correspond to traditional historical or geographical regions and often arbitrarily changed boundaries) and obscure for modern readers, i.e. it is very unlikely one would actually search for people born in a specific vilayet rather than the city or modern country subdivision. It is equally odd to place towns, on whose history the existence of the vilayets had barely any impact, in these categories. IMO a case could be made for having these categories in as over-categories for "Governors of NNN" categories, but that is not really of any use in itself. Should categories be created for every province and sub-province that ever existed? [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 10:17, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak delete''' I think this might have some utility, and having extra categories really doesn't hurt much... but it does mean more categorization work, maybe too much for the small amount of utility. [[User:Brianyoumans|Brianyoumans]] ([[User talk:Brianyoumans|talk]]) 17:28, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
**The categorisation work that is required shouldn't be a concern, as I'm quite prepared to do most of that work personally. In fact, I have already begun and the work is progressing. [[User:Lekoren|Lekoren]] ([[User talk:Lekoren|talk]]) 19:59, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Delete'''</s> '''Delete the purely geographic ones; keep the "people from" ones''' once purged of geographic articles on places that once belonged to the former subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire as we ought not be categorizing city articles by every polity and subdivision in which they were located at any point in their history, <s>not much is left</s> the only thing left are the people from categories. [[User:Carlossuarez46|Carlossuarez46]] ([[User talk:Carlossuarez46|talk]]) 22:54, 6 May 2014 (UTC) And just as we've done with [[:Category:Middlesex]], a long-lived and now gone polity in the UK, we keep the "people from" because it would be ahistoric to say they were from a much-enlarged London that has absorbed their old shire, but we have no slew of places in the category but do have a nice article listing them instead, which is what ought to happen here. The people-from cats can be parented by [[:Category:Ottoman people]] as some already are, or a newly created [[:Category:Ottoman people by vilayet]].

**True, but as I said the main point is that they have not left much of a trace in historical memory (for a number of reasons), so they are rather pointless as categories from a modern reference point. If a particular subdivision corresponds to a traditional and/or particularly long-lasting province that is coterminous with a particular epoch in a region's history, and that has a corpus of articles pertaining to that period and no other, then a category would certainly be warranted. I am thinking here of the Roman provinces like [[:Category:Roman Achaea|Roman Achaea]] or [[:Category:Roman Dacia|Roman Dacia]], although even here categories like [[:Category:Germania Inferior|Germania Inferior]] are (currently at least) a borderline case. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 08:55, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strong keep''' I'd like to point out a crucial detail: these categories are ''part of an established scheme of categorisation'', which deleting them would disrupt. The [[Ottoman Empire]], along with the [[German Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Russian Empire]], was one of the four great empires which came to their end in [[World War I]]. Each of these four empires has corresponding categories for their first-level subdivisions and for the people born in those subdivisions. The German Empire, which existed from 1871 to 1918, even has corresponding categories for the subdivisions of its largest subdivision (Prussia). As for the time period (the vilayet system existed from the 1860s to the 1920s), it cannot be considered short, because we are talking about roughly half a century of ''modern history'', not half a century of ''antiquity''. This is why comparisions with the provinces of the Roman Empire are totally irrelevant. The vilayets must be compared with the first-level subdivisions of other large countries ''of the same period'' (such as the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires), ''not'' with the subdivisions of an empire which ceased to exist in 476 AD. The period we are talking about (from the 1860s to the 1920s) was the final stage of the Ottoman Empire and includes, to name a few, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, the rise of nationalism among the various ethnic groups inhabiting the Empire and among the Turks themselves, the [[Young Turk Revolution]], the [[First Balkan War]], the [[Second Balkan War]], [[World War I]] with its several fronts situated in different parts of the Ottoman Empire, the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]], the [[Greco–Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922]] and many more. There is great deal of historical literature (and Wikipedia articles) dealing with the numerous important events of this period, and in this literature references to the different vilayets of the Empire are very common indeed. For instance, there are many references to the different ethnic composition of the population of each respective vilayet (along with detailed ethnic and religious population statistics), which isn't surprising given the fact that this is the period of the rise of numerous nationalist movements among the different ethnic groups inhabiting the Ottoman Empire in its final stage. To name another example, policy could in practice vary considerably according to the personality (and political connections) of the governor (''vali'') which happened to be in charge of a given vilayet. As the numerous references to the vilayets, to the varying ethno-religious composition of their population and to their governors are well-known to anyone acquainted with the historical literature dealing with this period (from the 1860s to the 1920s) of Ottoman history, the allegation that the vilayets somehow "didn't leave much a trace in historical memory" makes absolutely no sense at all. [[User:Lekoren|Lekoren]] ([[User talk:Lekoren|talk]]) 18:18, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:*I don't argue in any way that the vilayets were not important to the last half-century of the Ottoman Empire, or that the Ottoman Empire was not of crucial importance in several far-reaching events of the period. That much is self-evident, and completely unrelated to the question at hand, which is the use of the vilayets as categorization tools in an encyclopedia anno 2014. Why is it in any way important or even useful to categorize a city under a specific vilayet? To quote from [[WP:CATEGORY]], how are these cities "defined by [the] characteristics" of having belonged to a vilayet or another? Ditto for someone born in this city, when the relevant city category already exists? Does being born in an Ottoman vilayet make people different than being born in a Prussian province or a Russian governorate, so that we should remark on it? No. Would a modern reader seek out people being born in Thessalonica, Beirut, Skopje, Damascus or Sivas by the city they were born in or by the administrative entity they belonged to 100 years go? Do modern people in the Balkans, Anatolia or the Middle East still mentally use the Ottoman vilayets to refer to specific areas? No, in fact most people have forgotten all about them. As tools of categorization, and that alone, the vilayets are redundant and hence useless. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 20:45, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::It seems that you have missed my point, which is this: as first-level subdivisions of one of the great empires of this period (roughly, from the 1860s to the  end of World war I), the vilayets are ''the exact equivalents'' of the governorates of the Russian Empire, the constituent states of the German Empire and the Austrian crown lands. You ask: "does being born in an Ottoman vilayet make people different than being born in a Prussian province or a Russian governorate?" Quite obviously it doesn't, but ''that's precisely what I'm trying to tell you''. Seemingly you do not know that corresponding categories for Russian governorates, Prussian provinces etc (and for the people born in them) ''do'' exist, and many of these categories are quite densely populated. Check out, for instance, [[:Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg]]. These are ''historical'' categories, not modern ones, and this is why there is no much point in trying to figure out how much the average guy in Tirana, Kaunas or Poznań cares about them (to be sure, very little or not at all, but as they aren't contemporary categories, that's beside the point). It's also irrelevant to compare historical categories with city categories, for instance (as if they would somehow be mutually exclusive). A person born in Potsdam in 1900 is categorized both as [[:Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg]] and as [[:Category:People from Potsdam]], whereas a person born in Potsdam in 2000 can only be categorised as [[:Category:People from Potsdam]], as the [[Province of Brandenburg]] (one of the subdivisions of [[Prussia]], itself a subdivision of the [[German Empire]]) no longer exists. The same applies to the corresponding categories of the Russian Empire, Austro-Hungaria and the Ottoman Empire. The corresponding categories for those other empires already exist, hence there wouldn't be any logic in singling out the Ottoman Empire and its first-level subdivisions by deleting the categories for those subdivisions. To my knowledge, no one has yet proposed deleting the corresponding categories for the subdivisions of the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire. This is why deleting the corresponding categories for the first-level subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire would be illogical and, as I wrote before, would disrupt ''an established scheme of categorisation''.

::::::Wikipedia consensus says otherwise. If your personal opinion were the consensus, the elaborate categorisation scheme found under [[:Category:Subdivisions of former countries]] wouldn't exist. Yet it ''does'' exist (with 31 subcategories, many of which have subcategories of their own etc) and, as far as I know, no one has tried to get it (or its various subcategories) deleted. The basic problem with your argument is that you aren't addressing the subject of the present discussion at all. Instead, you're trying to change the subject and to challenge ''an established scheme of categorisation'' in its entirety, namely the categorisation tree subsumed under [[:Category:Subdivisions of former countries]].  Another problem with your argument is that it really isn't an argument at all: essentially, you're saying that [[:Category:Subdivisions of former countries]] shouldn't even exist, yet you don't advance any actual arguments in favour of the opinion you express. As I have already said a couple of times, the vilayet categories we are discussing are part of an established scheme of categorisation  in the same way as other corresponding categories, such as [[:Category:Governorates of the Russian Empire]]. As first-level subdivisions of a large empire, the vilayet categories are the exact equivalents of the corresponding categories for the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] and many more categories about [[:Category:Subdivisions of former countries|subdivisions of former countries]]. As far as I know, no one has tried to get ''those'' deleted. Deleting the corresponding categories for the [[Ottoman Empire]] would mean singling out the Ottoman Empire for special treatment (as compared with other large empires), would be extremely illogical and would disrupt the entire categorisation tree subsumed under [[:Category:Subdivisions of former countries]]. To do so would make absolutely no sense at all. [[User:Lekoren|Lekoren]] ([[User talk:Lekoren|talk]]) 13:25, 12 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Well, there is [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]] for this. By the same analogy, would you go on to create categories for every Byzantine theme, Roman province, Persian satrapy, etc? Categories are search tools first and foremost, and it is by their ability to help in this that their use or non-use must be determined. It may make sense in the context of the German or Russian Empires to categorize things by province, but how likely is it for anyone to search any topic by vilayet? As I am actually engaged in reading and writing about the period and the region, I feel I can confidently say "not very likely", for the reasons I outlined above. Unlike Ottoman vilayets, I have a feeling that both the Russian governorates (at least most of them) and, more definitely, the Prussian provinces, were around much longer and left much more of a mark. Vilayets, on the other hand, along with the rest of the Ottoman administrative system, have largely been wiped from historical memory even in Turkey due to the effects of modern nationalism. If person X was born in the village of Y, which at the time was in Z sanjak, vilayet A, then this can and should be mentioned so in the article, but I still think it is irrelevant as a search term.

*'''Keep''' the geographic categories; '''neutral''' on people categories. I found Lekoren's arguments convincing, and a parallel with historical divisions of other countries especially helpful. As for the people categories, it seems that the people should be categorized by populated place where possible, not by administrative division. If after such recategorizaton some of the people cats become empty, I have no problem with deleting them.—[[User:Ezhiki|Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;([[User talk:Ezhiki|yo?]]); <span class="nowrap">June 12, 2014</span>; 16:32 (UTC)
