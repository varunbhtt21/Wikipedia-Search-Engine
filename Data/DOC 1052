The '''Dothan Opera House''' is a historic [[performing arts]] venue in [[Dothan, Alabama]].  It was built in 1914â€“15 as a municipal [[auditorium]] by the growing town.  Seating 800, it opened October 8, 1915, with a performance by a local orchestra.  The building was designed by [[Atlanta]] architectural firm Morris & Morris in a blend of [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival]] and [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] styles.  The first floor features three central [[arch]]ed entry doors, with a pair of arched windows on either side.  The second story is dominated by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilaster]]s, four in the center section, and three on each side.  The pilasters support a [[limestone]] [[architrave]] beneath a [[dentil|denticulated]] [[cornice]] and [[parapet]] roof.  On the parapet, in line with each column in the center section is a figurine of an opera singer.  A [[mural]] painted on the backdrop of the stage depicts the building under construction and some of the more famous acts to have performed in the theater.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dothan Opera House - Dothan's Hidden Mural|url=http://www.wiregrassmuseum.org/index.php/murals/14-murals/105-mural-dothan-opera-house|publisher=Wiregrass Museum of Art|accessdate=April 23, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424092919/http://www.wiregrassmuseum.org/index.php/murals/14-murals/105-mural-dothan-opera-house|archivedate=April 24, 2014|df=}}</ref>

A new [[civic center]] was built across the street in 1971, and the opera house was refurbished at the same time.<ref name="nomform">{{cite web|last=Floyd |first=W.
