**{{ping|Peterkingiron}} The category's contents are overwhelmingly about England, so an English categ is justified.  As noted in the nom, my intention is to recreate the current title as be a parent category for the English and Irish sub-cats; the Scottish page can also go in that re-created cat. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 01:34, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
***I agree: but if this is to proceed, something must be done about the Scotland list.  I do not know how complete that list is.  There may be an issue over Welsh lists and how to deal with houses such as Wigmore Priory, which were in Marcher lordships (hence medieval Wales), but are now in England.  Similarly the status of Cumberland in the 11th century may casue difficulties, since it was not part of England then.  I have no objection in principle to and England category.  I just think that a category for GB and another for Ireland will be much simpler, even though GB was not politically united until 1603.

:* '''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Artificial intelligence conferences]] to [[:Category:Conferences in artificial intelligence, machine learning and pattern recognition]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' AI, ML and PR are hard to distinguish and often overlapping domains; making separate categories is not maintainable and will yield high redundancy. I am aware that this is an overly long / clumsy category title, unfortunately; but every researcher prefers a different name for his domain. [[User:Chire|Chire]] ([[User talk:Chire|talk]]) 08:51, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

: [[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]], [[User:CharlesGillingham|CharlesGillingham]], [[User:Qwertyus|Qwertyus]], [[User:Fgnievinski|Fgnievinski]]: all of you seem to have interest in this domain. What are your thoughts on this rename? --[[User:Chire|Chire]] ([[User talk:Chire|talk]]) 12:02, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

* I don't have a strong opinion on this, but I do find the new name a bit long. I'm fine with having ML/PR conferences in the AI confs cat, or their own cat, or the CS confs cat for that matter: the supercategory isn't extremely large and I rather dislike the tendency to overcategorize on enwiki. [[User:Qwertyus|Q<small>VVERTYVS</small>]] <small>([[User talk:Qwertyus|hm?]])</small> 13:30, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

: The rationale is that it declutters the [[:Category:Machine learning]] (and AI) when the conferences can sit in a subcategory of machine learning, instead of toplevel machine learning. Cat:ML used to have 300+ entries, now is down to 141 by having classification algorithms, software, companies etc. in subcategories. Using Cat:CSconf means that all these conferences will continue to be tagged as CSConf+ML.
: However, I realized that we also have some journals [[Machine Learning (journal)]], and IMHO they should not be separate from conferences... hmmm... any proposals? --[[User:Chire|Chire]] ([[User talk:Chire|talk]]) 13:42, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

: [[Scopus]] All Science Journals Classification (see tab "ASJC Code List" in [http://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/excel_doc/0003/148548/title_list.xlsx]) puts "Artificial Intelligence" (1702) separate from "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition" (1707). So I think it should be "AI+ML" and "CV+PR". [[User:Fgnievinski|Fgnievinski]] ([[User talk:Fgnievinski|talk]]) 14:51, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

:: Microsoft Academic has "Machine learning and Pattern Recognition" as one subdomain, DM and AI separate... it's not really well defined, but I would consider PR to be more of a ML thing than a CV thing; and I would just put conferences that actually have a large CV focus into a second category Cat:CVConf. But [[:Category:Conferences in artificial intelligence and machine learning]] is fine with me. How about [[Machine Learning (journal)]]? Should we just put it into the conferences cat anyway? --[[User:Chire|Chire]] ([[User talk:Chire|talk]]) 15:36, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Borderline notable society, with no reason no include all the members having articles here  in a category: it is not a significant element of notability or a distinction -- see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/International Organization for a Participatory Society (3rd nomination)]] '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 06:44, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. As far as I know, we have categories for things like members of a national academy of sciences, where the membership means a great distinction. We don't have categories for, say, members of the [[Society for Neuroscience]], because it just means that people have paid their dues. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 17:02, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' -- We should not be categorising people by membership of a society, or even of its interim committee.  That will leave morew than a main article and its subject, which would be better included in a category on the subject.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 18:31, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Not all categories of people serve the purpose of marking 'a significant element of notability or a distinction'. The people included here are all notable already precisely because of their publicly taking political positions, and the fact of their being members of a revolutionary organization is therefore highly significant. It is definitely not the case that 'all the members having articles here' are included in the category, but only those who are widely known because of their political viewpoints. Full disclosure: I am the editor who created the category. [[User:Lambert Meertens|Lambert Meertens]] ([[User talk:Lambert Meertens|talk]]) 19:20, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''' Basically what you are saying is that inclusion or not into this cat will be decided upon some not-well-defined subjective criterion. This cat basically serves as publicity for the organization ("look which important people are members!") --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 19:34, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I don't think that is a fair description of what I'm saying. There are other important people who are members. However, they are notable for other reasons than their political activism—with Chomsky being exceptional because he is notable equally for his contributions to linguistics and his political analyses. The fact that the notability of these people is based on their political viewpoints, and not, for example, on their artistic or athletic achievements, is not that subjective. And the criterion that they are all members of the IOPS consultative committee is completely objective. As I see it, the membership of IOPS and its consultative committee is an important aspect the otherwise quite diverse lot of people in this category share, and as such worthy of being categorized. Does this serve as publicity? Many, if not most, people will not agree with the political viewpoints of the people in question, in which case the category obviously does not function as (positive) publicity. But if you think it does serve that purpose for the minority of people who truly identify with these revolutionary viewpoints, you may be overestimating the publicity power of the category.

::::No, I think I get it right, your argumentation is a perfect example of [[WP:SYNTH|synthesis]].

:::::I forgot to mention they all are also signatories of an open letter, published in various media on the left, calling upon people to join IOPS.
