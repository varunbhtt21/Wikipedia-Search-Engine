:'''Nominator's rationale:''' "of the Ancient era" is rather odd, "of/in Antiquity" is simpler and more often used. [[User:Cplakidas|Constantine]]  [[User talk:Cplakidas| ✍ ]] 19:12, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support in principle''' -- However some categories may need purging, if the cut off is to be 500 AD.  I would suggest a slightly later cut off, so that the late antique period - the equivalent of the Dark Age in Britain is included.  This is sometimes called the migration period, due to the invasions of the Roman Empire by the Huns, Goths and Vandals.  A slightly fuzzy cut-off may be better, refering to kingdoms subsisting until about 500-800 AD.  This would mean that the Sassanid Empire would fall wholly within the category.  However, there may still be a problem over the Byzantine Empire, which subsisted until the 15th century.   [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 16:02, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:* I agree with including Late Antiquity (obviously), but the cutting-off point doesn't really have to be strictly defined. For Britain it would include Sub-Roman Britain until ca. the 6th century, for Byzantium and Persia the point of rupture is clearly with the Islamic conquests in the 630s/640s, for Spain it could be as late as 711.

*'''Delete''' both; they both suffer the same "films about" problems. How much about an "aviation accident or incident" must the film be to be included and what reliable source(s) tell us it's at least that much. And here we are way into subjectivityland... was 9-11 such? was Pearl Harbor? was any war or sci-fi flick where some flying machine is involved in an accident or an "on purpose"? snakes on planes? World War Z had a plane crash after zombies came up from the cargo hold, is it in or out? Let the subjectivity continue or stop it now in its tracks.

*''if kept'' '''rename''' to [[:Category:Government committees in India]] as the current formulation is used in several formal names for committees about American Indians in the US and Canada. So to be clear use "India", and since this is a category, categories should not be ambiguous.

*'''Comment''': The category 'Indian committees' is already nested under [[:Category:Government agencies of India]]. So deleting and category and merging contents to a vast category like 'Govt agencies of India' doesn't make sense. A committee by Indian govt is categorised under 'Indian committees' just like a school in NY will get categorised under 'Schools in NY'. What is wrong in that?
