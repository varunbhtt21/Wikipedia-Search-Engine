*'''Oppose for now'''. There are several items here which are not inquiries, such as [[:Category:United States federal boards, commissions, and committees]], [[:Category:Ethics commissions]], and some decision should be made about what to do with them. More broadly, I fear that the whole thing is [[WP:OC#SHAREDNAME|categorisation by shared name]], right down into the subcats.  E.g. [[Finance Commission of India]] is not an inquiry. It all needs a lot of scrutiny. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 01:28, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' -- Not all commissions are conducting enquiries.  I would suggest that we should retain this despite the SHAREDNAME issue, as the fact that a body is called "commission" is likely to be useful as an aid to navigation, for those who are not quite sure of the procise name of the one in question.

*'''Delete''' purely a shared name. Moreover, [[Commission]] is a disambiguation page for the commission of art works, paying sales people, launching ships, promoting military officers, as well as panels of folks that are fact finding (inquiries?) or negotiating or legislating or administering policies. Surely "commissions of inquiry" would suffice to hold the inquiring panels and the other uses are just shared names.

*'''Comment''': Although the page currently says that [[Commission of inquiry]] is the main article, that redirects to [[Royal Commission]], which says that a "Royal Commission is a major ad-hoc formal public inquiry". In the light of this and the above comments, I suggest the appropriate course would be "delete with selective merge" to [[:Category:Public inquiries]] (or "merge and purge"), as the others are only categorised here because of the shared name, which is [[WP:SHAREDNAME|over-categorisation]]. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 07:40, 19 June 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''.  There is a validly filled subcategory providing enough reason to keep this category.  Traditionally, all plays / films have two categories: Comedy or Drama (happy or sad ending).  Now in current years, these meanings have altered somewhat, but most romance films would fall into either one or the other, even given contemporary understanding of these terms.  We have over 100 comedic romantic film stubs for this decade.  So, maybe we have less than 60 dramatic romantic film stubs, but all of these would still be classified under the larger heading of romantic films. [[User:Dawynn|Dawynn]] ([[User talk:Dawynn|talk]])

** {{tl|1980s-romantic-comedy-film-stub}} - 43 articles

*:[[User:Dawynn|Dawynn]] ([[User talk:Dawynn|talk]]) 12:53, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:::[[User:Dawynn|Dawynn]], with all due respect, your reasoning is flawed. First of all, adding the romance and comedy categories to the stub {{tl|1980s-romantic-comedy-film-stub}} is not appropriate, because that stub is already populating a sub-category of both those categories. '''If''' the template had enough articles to warrant its own category, then placing its category as a sub-category of both would be appropriate. As for {{tl|1980s-romance-film-stub}}, ideally a film article may have more than one stub template, if one is needed for genre and a second for country of origin. And sometimes these stub categories are broken down by decade because of size. But adding a '''third''' stub template that is already covered by the other two, just to populate an unneeded stub category, is redundant and unnecessary. [[User:Fortdj33|Fortdj33]] ([[User talk:Fortdj33|talk]]) 13:05, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
::::You're neglecting year of release.  {{tl|1980s-romantic-comedy-film-stub}} is not yet tagged on enough articles to warrant its own category.  So, no, there is no subcategory here that can merge up to {{cl|1980s romance films}} and {{cl|1980s comedy films}}.  But the template could validly upmerge to both of these categories until such time as it is used on sufficient articles.  But in that case, again, {{cl|1980s romance films}} would be valid because it would then have a validly filled subcategory.  There is no {{tl|1980s-romantic-drama-film-stub}} template, but there probably should be, as the 23 articles noted above (amongst untagged others) could validly use such a tag -- and it would remove the need to tag with both {{tl|1980s-romance-film-stub}} and {{tl|romantic-drama-film-stub}}.  Note that tagging with a year of release tag also helps us to put this in a subcategory under {{cl|1980s film stubs}}.  Such cannot be done if we tag only with non-dated templates. (And yes, it is *quite* likely that an editor would be more familiar with films from a particular decade and want to focus on the decade rather than editing films from all of cinema history). [[User:Dawynn|Dawynn]] ([[User talk:Dawynn|talk]]) 13:17, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Like I said, sometimes stub categories need to be broken down by decade because of size. But per [[WP:STUB]], it serves no purpose to add multiple stub tags to an article, if one or two are already sufficient to cover the subject's main notability. Therefore, it is usually unnecessary to create a stub tag to indicate decade of release if 1) there aren't enough articles using it to meet the threshold, and 2) all the articles involved already have a genre stub tag that is more specific.

:* '''Propose deleting''' {{Lc|Morphology}}<br />
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Any category whose "main article" is a dab page and whose members (including in subcats) cover a wide range of topics (e.g. [[p-Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde]], [[Green Bean Galaxies]], [[Orongorongo River]], [[LGBT]], [[Top-hat transform]], [[Coffin ship]], [[Pollen]], [[Peanut]], [[Tree stump]], [[Crisp sandwich]], [[Plant use of endophytic fungi in defense]] and [[Examples of in vitro transdifferentiation by initial epigenetic activation phase approach]]) is virtually asking to be brought to CFD.  The history shows that the category creator was aware that the main tag points to a dab page so this category may be intended to collect any article/subcat with "morphology" in its name (rather than collecting articles about a specific topic). There are already separate categories for the main subjects that have "morphology" in their name (e.g. Geomorphology). [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 04:14, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' as a [[WP:DEFINING]] categorisation. ''(Category creator.)'' Morphology is a broad type of classification system which groups by shape (including more abstract ideas of shape, such as in [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic morphology]]), this category collects the various morphological systems. The question here is not whether its subcategories cover a lot of material (they do), but as to whether an overarching class of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] is a meaningful grouping that is likely to be useful to readers and editors ("''definingness''"). I would say yes, but that is why I created the category. There is a great deal more work done (within Wikipedia, and without) on [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomy]] than other classes, but we can speak meaningfully about non-biological taxonomic systems. --[[User:Andrewaskew|Andrewaskew]] ([[User talk:Andrewaskew|talk]]) 06:11, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''keep but reorganize''' This should be a container class for the main articles for morphology in each field, and for the corresponding subcats. Period. There's really some argument for making a real main article for this. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 12:26, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' -- While techically the main article is a dabpage, it is in fact more like a list article, with 4-5 redlinks.  The Greek morpheo means I change.  Morphology is therefore the study of change.  Naturally change is studied in many contexts.  The problem is the lack of a proper main article covering all types of this.

:*'''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Subfields and areas of study related to evolutionary biology]] to [[:Category:Evolutionary biology subfields]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' This is a child category to [[:Category:Subfields by academic discipline]]. Other terms used for similar subcategories, for example, are [[:Category:Branches of biology]], [[:Category:Economics by specialty]], [[:Category:Subfields of geology]] or [[:Category:Linguistics disciplines]]. Modeling the proposed category after any of these examples is preferable to the clunky and awkward language the category currently has. <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 00:04, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Rename''' per nom (or to "Subfields of evolutionary biology" which I think is a slightly clearer name) and if necessary add inclusion criteria. Note: This is the only category in enwiki with a name containing "''areas of study''". [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 04:23, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Rename''' to [[:Category:Subfields of evolutionary biology]] per DexDor's suggestion. That format seems to have several parallels in [[:Category:Subfields by academic discipline]].  The current title is unnecessarily verbose.  --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 01:18, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
