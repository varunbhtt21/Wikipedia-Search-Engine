:*'''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Fictional people with bipolar disorder]] to [[:Category:Fictional characters with bipolar disorder]]<br>
:*[[:Category:Fictional people with neurological or psychological disorders]] to [[:Category:Fictional characters with neurological or psychological disorders]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' In the "fiction" categories (like [[:Category:Fictional characters with disabilities]] or [[:Category:Fictional characters by status]]),it is more appropriate and precise to identify individuals in fiction as characters rather than "fictional people". Right now, there is a mix and so if this proposal wins approval, there might be more nominations to come in order to get consistency. <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 22:58, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Rename''' for consistency. The tree is [[:Category:Fictional characters]], the main of the tree is [[Character (arts)]], character is the standard here. Furthermore it makes more sense generally to discuss fictional characters than fictional people. The principal exception in the tree would be [[:Category:Nonexistent people]], which were purported to be real and "created as part of a [[practical joke]], a [[hoax]], a [[fraud]], or even a [[Fictitious entry|copyright trap]]," and thus have a slightly different status than straightforward characters. --[[User:Andrewaskew|Andrewaskew]] ([[User talk:Andrewaskew|talk]]) 00:13, 14 May 2014 (UTC)

:''The result of the discussion was:''  '''Delete'''. Consensus seems to be towards a list solution similar to [[Timeline of the Lewis and Clark Expedition]] which would be a spin-off from [[Portola_expedition#Expedition]]. - [[User:Ricky81682|Ricky81682]] ([[User talk:Ricky81682|talk]]) 22:02, 30 June 2014 (UTC)
:* '''Propose deleting''' {{Lc|Places of the Portola expedition}}<br />
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' I found this uncategorised category, and am not sure whether this category should be renamed, or repurposed or deleted or what, so I am listing it here to start a discussion. I am neutral for now, but may take a firm view as the discussion develops. <br />The 1769-70 [[Portola expedition]] was a defining point in the history of the European colonisation of California, but I am less persuaded that it is a [[WP:DEFINING]] characteristic of every place that the expedition passed through.  It is probably defining for some of them, such as the [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish missions]] established as a direct and planned goal of the expedition ... but for the rest, this has the feel of a [[WP:OC#PERF|performers by performance]] category, in the shape of places-by-people who explored them them.<br />Note that there is a parallel in [[:Category:Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which includes both people and places, but we do not have a broader [[:Category:Places by expedition]].<br />My instinct is that this sort of information is generally better captured in a list, which can include a map and some indication of the expedition's significance, without prejudging its definingness.  The [[Age of Discovery]] saw a lot of voyages of "discovery" by Europeans who mapped the globe and claimed large chunks of it, but I problematise the word "discovery" with scare quotes because the places were well-known to other civilisations.  It doesn't feel entirely NPOV to categorise places by their visits in these expeditions, when we don't generally categorise places by other great historical events.  Wikipedia doesn't even categorise [[Ypres]] as a battlefield, despite have been the site of [[Battle of Ypres (disambiguation)|3 major battles of WWI]] and completely flattened by them. Same with [[Grozny]] and [[Stalingrad]]. I am sure that this category was created in good faith, but isn't this form of categorisation a form of [[WP:Systemic bias|systemic bias]] in favour of the explorer's worldview?

*I confess that I am mystified by this objection. I created the category merely as a place to find links to all of these articles on one page. As with all categories, it's just a shared attribute. It has nothing to do with any "explorer's worldview". Does anyone suppose that Portola chose where he was going based on a "worldview"? "Systemic bias"? Really? [[User:WCCasey|WCCasey]] ([[User talk:WCCasey|talk]]) 06:54, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' we do not categorize places by who visited them, regardless whether it was first Spaniard or first Foolander.  If these places are important to the Portola Expedition, surely the one page where they ought to be found is [[Portola Expedition]]. Imagine if we had similar categories for every war, every processional route, every expedition, every competition ([[:Category:Places of the Tour de France]]?), etc. Cat clutter. [[User:Carlossuarez46|Carlossuarez46]] ([[User talk:Carlossuarez46|talk]]) 19:57, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
::Please expand on "we do not categorize places by who visited them". Is that in a guideline somewhere that I haven't seen? I didn't find it in [[WP:CAT]]. My view is that if an editor wants to take the time to create a category, then more power to her - unless there's a clear violation of a WP policy. There are plenty of categories I don't personally find useful, but that's no reason to delete them. As for creating a list: I may also do that at some point, but it's not an either/or proposition.  [[User:WCCasey|WCCasey]] ([[User talk:WCCasey|talk]]) 04:31, 15 May 2014 (UTC) 

*'''Listify and delete'''. [[User:WCCasey|WCCasey]]'s objectives can be achieved by making a list, and this can be a great deal more informative than a category, e.g. by arranging the places in order or splitting according to various common features. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 21:52, 14 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. I would be in favour of deleting the category. At its core, it just represents a view that is overly "centric" with respect to one particular event. For that reason, I would oppose having a category for it (see [[WP:DEFINING]]) but would not object to a list article.

::I think you might be misunderstanding the issue here — the problem is not "athletic", but "college". "College" and "university" are not interchangeable terms in Canada the way they are in the United States — they're two very different types of institution. While both types can and do have athletic directors, there's exactly no context in which the athletic director of [[Brock University]] could or would ever be referred to as a ''college'' athletic director — because the institution that he's the athletic director of is not a "college". He might be referred to as a university athletic director, or just as an athletic director — but "college" doesn't work. The category ''does'' need to be renamed to something more inclusive and less imposing of USian terminology, but your comment above singles out the wrong word as the issue.

:::1. There is no alternate proposal for wording, provided by anyone.
:::2. <s>No offense, but i simply don't believe that there is significantly different usage in Canada vs. in the U.S. for "college" vs. "university".</s>  They are technically different terms in both places;  "College" works fine for the purpose of differentiating between collegiate/university athletic director big shots vs. nobody directors of recreation on any athletic playground anywhere.  It is not important, but does someone have a source on usage difference in Canada vs. U.S. for the terms?  Note it is a Canadian template, {{tl|Infobox Canadian college athletics}}, that uses "Canadian college athletics" term and which is applied on the [[Brock University]] page.  If someone wants to go to WikiProject Canada and make some case about how Wikipedia oughta not use "College" in any way associated with a Canadian university, go ahead....
::::I struck my uninformed statement above.  [[Comparison of American and British English#General terms]] and [[College]] articles cover differences, including that in Canada and the UK a "college" may refer many secondary schools including high schools while in the U.S. it would not include high schools, and that it would not be used in Canada or UK for what is covered in our [[Collegiate university]] article.  It is noted in the comparison that "In both the US and UK college can refer to some division within a university that comprises related academic departments such as the 'college of business and economics' though in the UK 'faculty' is more often used."  But, there are exceptions, including usage in practice by Canadian wikipedians using infoboxes, as I noted above. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 15:30, 24 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' or '''Rename'''. The current name is problematic because of both the words "college" and "athletic[s]", both of which have different meanings in the U.S. than they have globally. Accordingly, a proper global category should have a name like "University sports directors".

*'''Followup and rename proposal'''.  The one Canadian athletic director's article, which brought me to create this category, was up for AFD [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Frank A. DeMarco|here]], and has closed with "Keep" decision.  Again, note the CFD is a proposal to rename category from [[:Category:College athletic directors]] to [[:Category:]], i.e. there was no explicit proposed rename, and i did not observe consensus building to any alternative.  It is commented that "since the category is essentially empty" (besides the Canadian one and the U.S. ones), that the category should be deleted and re-created later when someone has a better wording.  I disagree with that approach as undermining the fundamental process of building categorization in Wikipedia;  a questioned category should be kept and revised later if/when better knowledge of this topic is unearthed and there is a good argument for an actually better wording.
However, I come to think that '''renaming''' to [[:Category:Athletic directors]], avoiding any college/university distinction, and consistent with our main article [[Athletic director]], would be fine.  Revisiting a distinction I drew above, that it was worthwhile to differentiate "between collegiate/university athletic director big shots vs. nobody directors of recreation on any athletic playground anywhere", I don't think that is important.  Nobodies simply won't get articles in Wikipedia.  In the U.S. only significant athletic directors, usually at [[collegiate universities]] but perhaps also at elite prep schools or other secondary schools, will be Wikipedia-notable and correctly classified.  Googling quickly yields [http://work.chron.com/much-money-high-school-athletic-director-make-13226.html this newspaper article covering that U.S. high school athletic directors have average salary of U.S.$90k]], by the way, so it is a significant position and there could well be Wikipedia-notable ones.  [http://www.ncaahperd.org/athletics-awards.html This North Carolina athletic education association site] names "athletic director of the year" awards for high schools and for middle schools in the state.  And this avoids the issue of different meaning for "college" for Canada and the U.K.  "Athletic directors" is more general so I prefer it.  In fact, even if [[:Category:College athletic directors]] is kept, I tend to think that [[:Category:Athletic directors]] should be created and just hold the one subcategory, but I gather that some here would not, as they have views on principles and practices in categorization that I don't quite understand yet. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 15:30, 24 May 2014 (UTC)

::The category has been applied only to Jews who translated Scripture. It includes people who have translated into a number of languages, including French, English, Yiddish, and Chinese.

*'''Delete''' needn't break this up by religion  - presumably Jewish translators work could be used in a Bible used in Christian churches, so we cannot assume that the religion of the translator matters.  However, the intended audience (or imprimatur) of the translations themselves might be categorized by religion (as no doubt the [[Catholic Bible]] - and the versions listed therein - differs from the [[LDS edition of the Bible]], and from the [[Modern English Bible translations]] - and the versions listed therein not adopted by the Roman Catholic Church) - but that's for another day.

*Just '''delete'''. While the nominator is correct in principle that the proposed format (not the existing one) is the one that categories of this type ''should'' be following ''if'' they're warranted, I'd argue that in most cases we don't need separate categories for each individual neighbourhood within a single municipality — Dartmouth doesn't even have borough status, which would be the bare minimum for justifying a Dartmouth-specific category. As noted above, it appears to have been created as a coatrack for a non-notable campaign of Dartmouth separatism, and thus it's a POV violation as things stand (as well as an empty category that could technically be speedied). No prejudice against future recreation if there's ever actually a ''good'' reason to warrant a separate eponymous category for Dartmouth (e.g. it actually ''does'' someday separate from the HRM to become its own independent municipality again), but it isn't warranted at all as things currently stand.

:* '''Propose deleting''' {{Lc|LGBT people of Peruvian descent}}<br />
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Delete'''. Per past discussions, Wikipedia is not interested in the intersection of LGBTness with a person's ethnic ''descent''. The sole person filed here is not personally ''from'' Peru, and therefore her Peruvian heritage is ''not'' a defining characteristic in conjunction with her sexuality. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 07:24, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''delete''' plus the sibling, [[:Category:LGBT people of Puerto Rican descent]] should also be deleted. Have you seen the descent tree? Can you imagine if we start intersecting that with the LGBT tree? shudder.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 18:19, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
::The Puerto Rican one has, for the record, always been stuck in a special limbo of its own — while the consensus has been clearly against every other ethnic ancestry for which this has been tried in the past, the Puerto Rican one has been nominated for deletion a couple of times now and has been closed as "no consensus" both times (primarily because of [[User:Lawrlafo]], who argued that Puerto Rico's status as a territory of the US made it some sort of special case where we need to make special provision for people who were ethnically Puerto Rican but were born and raised and lived and died on the US mainland instead of on the island of Puerto Rico, and thus couldn't be categorized as being "from Puerto Rico" per se.) I don't ''agree'' that that's an important enough consideration to actually warrant "LGBT people of Puerto Rican descent" — in part because other editors now repeatedly come along and think that it justifies new categories for "LGBT people of Peruvian descent" — but after the first attempt to delete it landed at no consensus, I tried proposing an alternative which would accomodate Lawrlafo's concerns while taking away the "descent" issue, which ''also'' landed at no consensus. So for the time being, even there's otherwise no consensus to ''permit'' "LGBT people by ethnic descent" as a comprehensive category scheme, we're also stuck with the Puerto Rican category as the one isolated example where we ''haven't'' been able to secure a consensus to actually treat it like any other LGBT/ethnicity intersection. If you're willing to initiate a third attempt to get rid of it, though, then by all means be my guest. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 00:16, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per Obiwankenobi. The intersection of LGBT with ethnicity seems to be a big stretch in terms of [[WP:DEFINING]]ness, and could spawn a forest of similar categories if this one was taken as a precedent.<br />[[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] mentions some past discussions; any chance of some links? --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 01:17, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
::BHG, see [[Category_talk:LGBT_people_of_Puerto_Rican_descent]] for two links. I note that we do have LGBT African Americans and a few other ethnic groups in the US but 'of X descent' is usually not used to denote ethnicity but rather ancestry. The whole 'of x descent' tree is pretty bad in general, full of X of Y descent that is never spoken of in reliable sources - I think if we're to keep this tree we should prune it down to groups actually defined and discussed in literature somewhere - not 'this is an x, his mother was from Y and grandfather was from Z, therefore create a new category-of-one to hold him'.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 01:36, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
