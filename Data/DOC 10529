In [[biochemistry]], '''intercalation''' is the insertion of [[molecule]]s between the planar bases of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA).  This process is used as a method for analyzing DNA and it is also the basis of certain kinds of poisoning.

There are several ways molecules (in this case, also known as ''[[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]s'') can interact with DNA. Ligands may interact with DNA by [[Covalent_bond|covalently binding]], electrostatically binding, or intercalating.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Richards, A.

These ligands are mostly polycyclic, [[aromatic]], and planar, and therefore often make good nucleic acid [[staining (biology)|stains]]. Intensively studied DNA intercalators include [[berberine]], [[ethidium bromide]], [[proflavine]], [[daunomycin]], [[doxorubicin]], and [[thalidomide]]. DNA intercalators are used in [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]] treatment to inhibit DNA replication in rapidly growing cancer cells. Examples include doxorubicin (adriamycin) and daunorubicin (both of which are used in treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma), and dactinomycin (used in Wilm's tumour, Ewing's Sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma).

Metallointercalators are complexes of a metal cation with polycyclic aromatic ligands. The most commonly used metal ion is [[ruthenium]](II), because its complexes are very slow to decompose in the biological environment. Other metallic cations that have been used include [[rhodium]](III) and [[iridium]](III). Typical ligands attached to the metal ion are [[dipyridine]] and [[terpyridine]] whose planar structure is ideal for intercalation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schatzschneider|first1=Ulrich |editor1-last=Sigel|editor1-first=Astrid|editor2-last=Sigel|editor2-first=Helmut|editor3-last=Freisinger|editor3-first=Eva|editor4-last=Sigel|editor4-first=Roland K.

In order for an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the DNA must dynamically open a space between its base pairs by unwinding. The degree of unwinding varies depending on the intercalator; for example, ethidium cation (the ionic form of [[ethidium bromide]] found in aqueous solution) unwinds DNA by about 26°, whereas proflavine unwinds it by about 17°. This unwinding causes the base pairs to separate, or "rise", creating an opening of about 0.34&nbsp;nm (3.4 Å). This unwinding induces local structural changes to the DNA strand, such as lengthening of the DNA strand or twisting of the base pairs. These structural modifications can lead to functional changes, often to the inhibition of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication|replication]] and DNA repair processes, which makes intercalators potent [[mutagen]]s.  For this reason, DNA intercalators are often [[carcinogen]]ic, such as the [[Endo-exo isomerism|exo]] (but not the endo) 8,9 [[epoxide]] of [[aflatoxin]] B<sub>1</sub> and [[acridine]]s such as [[proflavine]] or [[quinacrine]].

Intercalation as a mechanism of interaction between cationic, planar, polycyclic aromatic systems of the correct size (on the order of a base pair) was first proposed by [[Leonard Lerman]] in 1961.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Lerman, L.

The ligand displaces a sodium and/or magnesium cation present in the "condensation cloud" of such cations that surrounds DNA (to partially balance the sum of the negative charges carried by each phosphate oxygen), thus forming a weak electrostatic association with the outer surface of DNA. From this position, the ligand diffuses along the surface of the DNA and may slide into the hydrophobic environment found between two base pairs that may transiently "open" to form an intercalation site, allowing the ethidium to move away from the hydrophilic (aqueous) environment surrounding the DNA and into the intercalation site. The base pairs transiently form such openings due to energy absorbed during collisions with solvent molecules.
