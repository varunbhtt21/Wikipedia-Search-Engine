::::hi Dav4isl, a great many people are descended from other famous people but we can't use category trees for genealogy. This is the essence of a non-defining trait - in the lede of these people's articles does it state they came from Loomis? When reliable sources talk about them do they say so and so, whose 5th great grandfather was Loomis, did X? We can't use categories in this way for geneological decent and it would add a huge amount of clutter. I'm quite sure that there are at least 10 articles of people Obama can be shown to be a descendent of, which would add 10 more categories to his article...--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 18:24, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::hi; It is fairly common for biographies and articles about people to mention their antecedents, e.g. here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Scott_Loomis#Ancestry_and_early_life ''This is hardly a "genealogy"!'' But it ''does'' bring out a (potentially) defining characteristic: That people descended from certain others are (or may be) ''predisposed'' to greatness. I can certainly make this point explicitly in the category article itself. [[User:Dav4is|-dav4is]] ([[User talk:Dav4is|talk]]) 10:35, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::More: Since you mention "genealogy" twice in your last append, I assume that this is your chief objection. What I am doing is nothing like a genealogy.

::::::The same can be said for almost any category: it's an oddity of fact. This is contrary to the intended purpose behind categories: i.e. to "help readers find other articles about [or related to] the same topic as the one they were reading". I assume that you are not against all categories ''per se''? Simply noting what you call an oddity of fact in an article does not help the reader find others like it.

*'''hmmm''' I'm not sure if I like the idea of a "films by distributor" tree, which would potentially add new categories to thousands upon thousands of films. I'm also not sure if the company that distributes the film is defining for it. Why not just focus on film production studios, and only categorize films by the studios that produce them. Someone should notify the films project.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 13:35, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per recent consensus at [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_15#Category:Drafthouse_Films_films]]. Moreover, films have a myriad of distributors, according to both region and platform. Creating a tree for this would be a huge mistake imo, creating a mass of needless -- and non-defining -- clutter. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 14:02, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment:''' I am not sure if it is easy to say that a distributor is not a defining characteristic for a film. Studios often buy distribution rights to independent films and provide them with a lot of recognition. To use this case as an example, [[Millennium Entertainment]] bought the independently produced ''[[Bernie (2011 film)|Bernie]]'' (2011) as seen [http://variety.com/2011/film/news/millennium-acquires-linklater-s-bernie-1118039952/ here] for distribution. I've read film news that talk about how distribution can be a success or a failure, so I think it can be a key factor in whether or not a film gets recognition. In addition, major studios can function as producer/distributors or ''just'' distributors. I think it would help to make a distinction between production and distribution. Maybe rename this category to [[:Category:Millennium Entertainment film distributions]]? And for other companies, we would have "Category:<company> film productions" as applicable?

:*Leaving the defining issue aside, it's utterly unworkable. As the ''Variety'' article states, Millennium bought "U.S. distribution" only. And I suspect, based on what the announcement says, they may have well bought U.S. ''theatrical'' distribution rights only. Films get distributed in countries around the world. There are theatrical, home consumer, television, educational, and now, online (VOD/DTO) distributors. Should the U.S. theatrical distributor merit a category -- but no one else? It won't work, and there's very good reasons why we haven't walked off this particular cliff, to date.
