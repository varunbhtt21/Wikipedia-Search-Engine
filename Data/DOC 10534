:'''Nominator's rationale:''' This appears to be a category primarily for people who were delegates at or associated with a [[Colored Conventions Movement|Colored Convention]]. The parent category should in fact be [[:Category:African-Americans' civil rights activists]] and not "organizations," accordingly. If kept, we'd need a rename to make it clear that these are bio articles -- but I'd say it may need to be deleted per [[WP:OC#ASSOCIATED]] or even as a logical extension of [[WP:OC#PERF]]. The current category name reads like it's a grouping of articles or other content ''about'' actual Colored Conventions, and if that is indeed the long-term goal, I'd be happy to see a recreation of the category, in that event. I'm assuming it originated out of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Colored_Conventions]] and I'll alert them.

::An inclusive [[:Category:Fictional characters who use magic|magic-user-category]] already exists. In a typical fantasy setting where every ''other'' character cast spells, most fiction makes a distinction to various "types" of mages, similar to there being different scientists who specialize in research. --[[Special:Contributions/173.51.221.24|173.51.221.24]] ([[User talk:173.51.221.24|talk]]) 03:36, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::"Fictional characters who use magic" is for everyone who uses magic (like [[Morrigan Aensland]] but that's because she's a supernatural being). There's no clear distinction enough 'distinction to various "types" of mages' for all fiction in existance (whatever really is an universal difference between "wizard" and "sorcerer"?) - it should be just fictional magicians ([[Magician (fantasy)]]), a sub-category for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Magicians. --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 19:03, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::: Agreed with Niemti.  You can't compare "fictional sorcerors", "fictional magicians", "fictional witches", to "fictional biologists, physicists, chemists", because there is a single universe with consistent definitions for the real scientists, and there is no consistent definition for the various categories of magic users across different fictional universes.  --[[User:Lquilter|Lquilter]] ([[User talk:Lquilter|talk]]) 12:10, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

*::I think the point of this subcategory was to clearly separate the two different types of ghost ship (paranormal entities vs. real ships found with a missing crew).

*:::As the category's creator, I confirm that the point was to clearly separate paranormal entities (like the [[Flying Dutchman]]) vs. real ships found with a missing crew (like the [[Marie Celeste]]).  See discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ghost_ship#Ghostly_vessels_and_real_derelicts here].  I took the term 'ghostly vessel' from the introductory sentence of [[Ghost ship]] - 'A ghost ship ... may be a ghostly vessel in folklore or fiction, such as the Flying Dutchman, or a real derelict found adrift with its crew missing or dead, like the Mary Celeste.'

:* '''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Dialects of languages with ISO codes]] to [[:Category:Dialects of languages with ISO 639-3 code]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Rename'''. 1) [[Northeastern Mandarin]] has an ISO code (ISO 639-6).  2) Cat description reads "This category is filled by setting [isoexception] to 'dialect' in a language infobox. It is intended for dialects and other varieties of languages which do have ISO 639-3 codes; '''unless the variety is reclassified as a separate language, it cannot be expected to ever have an ISO code''', so there is no point in listing it in the main ISO maintenance category, which is intended to capture articles where the ISO code was overlooked." Currently the category is pure nonsense, as so many things in Wikipedia. [[User:LangBoss|LangBoss]] ([[User talk:LangBoss|talk]]) 13:10, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' being a dialect of a language that has an ISO 639-3 code is not defining for the dialect; it no doubt existed and was notable before, independent of, and will be so long after, ISO 639-3 is deprecated.

*'''Do not delete'''. I don't know much about the renaming proposal, but I disagree with those who have suggested deletion. The concerns of whether or not this is defining for the dialect/language is not terribly relevant here, since this is an administrative category. I've no idea how significant this category is for the overall tracking within [[:Category:Language infobox tracking categories]], but it seems strange to me to remove it from this system without touching the system as a whole.

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Category for television series distributed under a particular [[television syndication|syndication]] contract model; while admittedly that model is slightly different from the usual one for television syndication in the ''business'' sense, it results in no substantive difference to the ''viewer'' — and since our readers and editors are, by and large, viewers rather than television industry insiders, that makes this essentially [[WP:OC#TRIVIA]] rather than a useful point of categorization. The syndication model in question doesn't even have its own standalone article, in fact, but is merely a subsection within [[Debmar-Mercury]], the one and only distribution company that actually uses it — so while I have no objection to ''listing'' the series in that article, a ''category'' for them is a non-[[WP:DEFINING]] "insider baseball" distinction that isn't actually important or useful to our readers.
