:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Delete'''. The epic films category should just go. Look at the epic film article and its warnings templates saying how impossible it is to objectively tell whether a movie is "epic".

*'''Keep''' the epic film article has just one tag, stating that it ''possibly'' contains original research. Not that it does, but it might. This is a clearly defined genre and individual edit wars at article level should be discussed on the talkpage of that article (just like any genre, for that matter).

*'''Keep''' An "epic" film is a sourcable concept. See [http://books.google.com/books?id=nWYmAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The Encyclopedia of Epic Films] for a start. Like many genre classifications there is a huge grey area and the category is often abused on Wikipedia, but that's an argument for more stringent application of our policies and guidelines rather than scrapping it altogether. If the "epic genre" is recognized by the [http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=10 American Film Institute] then we should retain the category alongside our other genre categories. [[User:Betty Logan|Betty Logan]] ([[User talk:Betty Logan|talk]]) 12:35, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
::I came here because [[Gravity (film)]] was added to the category. When I visit its page on AFI, the only genre it is listed as is "science fiction" (a huge can of worms in itself). I can undo the addition but instead of having to defend my action (why Gravity is or isn't epic) I would MUCH rather not have such a fuzzy genre category at all... [[User:CapnZapp|CapnZapp]] ([[User talk:CapnZapp|talk]]) 07:23, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' as a verifiable genre. Per [[WP:CAT#Articles]], ''"Categorization of articles must be verifiable. It should be clear from verifiable information in the article why it was placed in each of its categories."'' This is how we justify a particular categorization.

::Possibly irrelevant comment: That seems flawed to me - just by finding one good source a film could then be included in a particular category.

*'''delete''' The article on [[epic films]] itself says that the genre is ill-defined and that different authorities have wildly disparate notions of its scope. One person is quoted as saying that "''Surely one of the hardest film genres to define is that of the 'epic' film[.]''" I don't see how we can put a limit on what goes into it when the AFI criterion defines so much smaller a set than anyone else; once we decide that they are not the ultimate authority on this it's not going to be possible to decide who is, and we'll get what we have now: any film that anyone, anywhere, has acclaimed as "epic". [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 14:59, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
::Genre classification is subjective by nature, so it is inconsistent to retain some widely identifiable genre categories and drop others. For instance, no-one disputes science-fiction as a genre, but there is widely varying opinion about whether [[Brazil (1985 film)]] comes under its scope. This is true of every genre and the "epic" is no exception in regard. [[User:Betty Logan|Betty Logan]] ([[User talk:Betty Logan|talk]]) 18:06, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:::There's no significant dispute about what constitutes an SF film, but three is sometimes disagreement over whether a particular film, but in the case of epics I'm seeing basic disagreements over how the category is constituted. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 20:02, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Some definitions are broader than others but I have yet to come across any source covering the topic dispute that something like DeMille's ''The Ten Commandments'' is an epic. Sources on the whole are pretty consistent in regards to biblical/historical epics: there is a clear group of films that are epics. [[User:Betty Logan|Betty Logan]] ([[User talk:Betty Logan|talk]]) 20:24, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Then you are talking about some other genre and definition than what is present on Wikipedia, Betty. First off, just because you can find an archetype doesn't mean a category is needed. Second, if you were to propose a narrowing down of the genre definition I could support that, but only if coupled with a name change. "Epic" in itself is repeatedly interpreted as much more than what you are saying. Like it or not, people are NOT using the word "epic" as you might. It simply means much more in contemporary usage than before. A category called "Historical epic" or "Epic (literary genre)" would be MUCH more workable, though I will say I understand any sentiment thinking such to be cumbersome.

*'''Comment''' I might add that had the Genre article been better maintained I could see a stronger point of keeping the category. As it is now, I feel people saying "Keep" is basing that on out-of-wiki knowledge. My proposal is based on that "Oh? An epic films category? I better head over to the main article to find out what that's all about" is currently a failing strategy.

*'''Delete''' I don't even begin to understand how these 'descent' categories are meant to work, but this one is ridiculous. How do we define 'descent' for these categories?

:: you've provided zero reason for keeping. [[User:LibStar|LibStar]] ([[User talk:LibStar|talk]]) 03:13, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' This is a standard type of category for the "of descent" category tree. While looking at it in isolation it might seem ridiculous, there are a lot of small, similar categories within this category tree. <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 15:56, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. The tree {{cl|People by ethnic or national descent}}, includes many forms of national descent. I don't see anyone suggesting we eliminate {{cl|People of British descent}}. It's completely consistent with all the other categories in {{cl|People of Australian descent}}. The nominator's argument doesn't work, as the sub-category clearly contains "actual people"; {{cl|Australian expatriates in Iceland }} is a category containing people. It's preferable to have small, lightly populated but specific subcategories than a giant {{cl|People of Australian descent who live in any country but Australia and we won't indicate the specific countries}}.[[User:Elaqueate|<span style="font-family:Futura, Helvetica, _sans;color:#01110f;font-size:66%;">__ <span style="color:#000000">E L A Q U E A T E</span></span>]] 15:19, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' As functionally empty. Until we can find someone who is actually Icelandic to fit in this cateogry. Australian expatriates are by definition not Icelandic, but Australian.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 03:45, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
**Australian expatriates in Iceland are of course of Australian nationality but can also be of Icelandic nationality. "Nationality" does not equal "citizenship", and it's entirely possible (and in fact quite common) for a person to be a national of a country in which they do not hold citizenship. This situation is most common in the case of an expatriate living in a country that is different than their state of citizenship. The problem arises when users assume that nationality and citizenship are equivalents, which they are not. The entire categories structure is done by nationality, not by citizenship. So it's totally reasonable to place [[:Category:Australian expatriates in Iceland]] as a subcategory of {{cat|Icelandic people of Australian descent}}. It's a convenient nesting of the category tree, if nothing else. [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] <sup>[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]</sup> 23:31, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' -- This may be a small category, but is part of a long-established class of category, with which we should not meddle save on a general basis.  There must be several hundred (if not thousands of) such categories.  We should not seek to be too precise as to what "Austtralian descent" means, as long as it is real.
