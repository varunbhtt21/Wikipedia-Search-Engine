:* '''Propose deleting''' {{Lc|Crosslink pages}}<br />
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' This category says it is for "''pages which crosslink by related topics or concepts''".  Despite the long "explanation" on the talk page I still don't understand the supposed difference between a crosslink page and any other page (e.g. why are some "Outline of <country>" pages categorized here and some not?).  Whatever it's meant to be I don't think it fits under [[:Category:Wikipedia maintenance]].  Note: If this category is deleted then [[:Template:crosslink|the corresponding template]] should be TFDed. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 16:21, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep but re-explain:''' For more than five years, the category has indexed pages which list wikilinks to related topics/images, rather than to similar titles. Whereas a [[wp:disambiguation page]] lists wikilinks to similar titles, a crosslink page lists wikilinks to similar concepts, images, or graphs but with different titles linked. The explanation (at "[[Category talk:Crosslink pages]]") should be improved to clarify usage of the category. We do not delete a category when someone does not understand the purpose. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 17:55, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' shouldn't the outlines be removed? [[:Category:Outlines]] ; Are crosslink pages [[WP:CONCEPTDAB]]s, [[WP:OUTLINE]]s, [[WP:INDEX]]es? -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 07:45, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
*** The nation outlines are a major type of crosslink pages, as multi-level lists of wikilinks with related images. However, crosslink pages are more than just outlines or [[WP:CONCEPTDAB]]s because they can cross between articles, images and categories based on any related concepts. The purpose is similar to a group of synonyms, also linking to related images, but extending beyond just synonyms as when an outline page links to a variety of pages often commonly related to the outline's central topic. Due to the amount of time needed to analyze a topic for listing the major crosslinks, there are few crosslink pages in the category yet. By comparison, the [[:Category:Disambiguation_pages]] contains over 154,000 pages (of 248,000 all), but there could be thousands of crosslink pages for various specific topics (which could be discussed at "[[Category talk:Crosslink pages]]"). -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 05:00, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
**** So, this is duplicating the functionality of the Outlines process? Why should crosslink pages overlap with outlines? That does not seem like a sensible situation, since we already have a clear Outlines workflow in place. The outlines should be excluded. (just as disambiguation pages, set indices, portals, should be excluded) And [[WP:INDEX]] pages should also be excluded, since those have existed since the beginning of Wikipedia, and already have their own process workflow. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 05:51, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
***** (As requested on my talk page) INDEX is the alternate navigation system implemented in Wikipedia from the beginning, when it was first launched. It indexes articles by topic, providing hierarchical navigation through the sidebar entry "CONTENTS" , with the top page [[Portal:Contents/Indexes]] drilling down to more specific indices. Ideally all indices are navigable from a higher level index, through to the top index. Indices are alphabetically ordered and topically divided. There's a wikiproject that covers them [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Indexes]] (and one that covers Outlines as well [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Outlines]]) -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 05:00, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
******[[WP:INDEX]] ([[Wikipedia:Editor's index to Wikipedia]]) lists pages that are about editing Wikipedia so I still don't see what relevance that has to the pages that have been placed (probably all by the category creator) in this category. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 19:38, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
******* That was a mislink on my part. I meant [[Portal:Contents/Indexes]]; "WP:INDEX" used to point to [[Wikipedia:Quick index]] which linked to [[Portal:Contents/Indexes]] -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 06:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
***If this is kept, "crosslink" should be restricted to CONCEPTDABS, as a basic skeletal listform concept-dab. I don't see how it could be anything else without stepping on the toes of other types of pages. (such as regular list articles, SIAs, outlines, indices, portals, BOOKs) -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 16:22, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''delete''' having read all the explanations I still don't see why this exists. We have categories for outlines. This overlaps with them in a vague, subjective and non-definining way. That it needs a lengthy explanation on the talk page shows how problematic it is: category talk pages are probably the least trafficked of all talk pages, no-one is going to find it there. And according to [[crosslink]] and [[wikt:crosslink]] the word has a narrow scientific meaning; the usage here is made up by the category creator, so a very bad basis for categorising - anyone seeing it among an article's categories won't have a clue why it's there.--<small>[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]</small><sup>[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-2.0ex;">[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]</sub> 11:08, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Largely covered by outline categories. Crosslink appears to be a Wikipedia neologism - thus a terrible idea for a category. I'm also changing the article [[-ista (crosslink)]] due to its usage of the word and also the false nature of the description. [[User talk:Sillyfolkboy|SFB]] 13:52, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Rename'''. Primary meaning, see [[Kiowa]]. Not eligible for speedy process as I only just moved the article over a redirect from an undiscussed move in 2011. [[:Category:Kiowa]] is currently a disambiguation page because there is also [[:Category:Kiowa language]], but this disambiguation is not necessary IMHO. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 08:56, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

:* '''Propose deleting''' {{Lc|Conscript militaries}}<br />
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' That a military force currently utilizes any amount of conscripted personnel is not a permanent [[WP:DEFINING]] characteristic of the organization.  There is a list at [[Conscription#Countries_with_and_without_mandatory_military_service]] which can cover complexities such as whether an alternative option to military service is available. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 06:11, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep and remove entries when no longer conscript:''' When a military force changes, to longer require conscription (or drafting) of personnel, then simply remove from the category, not delete the category because entries could change. -[[User:Wikid77|Wikid77]] ([[User talk:Wikid77|talk]]) 17:55, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''leaning delete''' Given the large number of members, I am moved to observe that what's missing is a category of all-volunteer militaries. It's tempting to guess that they are the exception and that conscription is the rule, but I suspect that every the all-volunteers used conscripts at various times. So at this point I'd have to say that this isn't defining. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 15:12, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Because this changes over time, it's not a great idea to categorize by this feature. (In general, categories should be "timeless" and not require constant checking and updating—in other words, once an article is added, it should be able to stay forever.) I also agree with the nominator that it's not always as simple as a "yes/no", which is all the category allows for. A list already exists so there will be no loss of information.

*'''Comment''' - If some militaries are described in terms of their timeframe (e.g., "Russia 19th century army"), then it might make sense. If militaries are never described in discrete enough timeframes to enable specific labeling, then I have to go with Good Olfactory on this one. Seems like a good topic for a list, though. --[[User:Lquilter|Lquilter]] ([[User talk:Lquilter|talk]]) 00:47, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

:* '''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Personal computer automation software]] to [[:Category:Automation software]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Why use the long name and then use sort keys to sort it under "Automation software"? And let it have automation software for other forms of computers too, if they are notable. It won't grow much.
