:::"Oceania" includes Australia but so too can "the Pacific". "Australasia" is generally used as a term to refer to Oceania with the exception that Australasia often bleeds into the Indonesian side of New Guinea. Apart from that, there's not a huge difference between any of these terms. Like Obi, I don't think we need to worry about the Antarctica issue in relation to this category.

::'''Keep'''. [[:ja:セルフカバー|Self-cover]] is a Japan-made English wasei-eigo term, and is quite common among Japanese singer-songwriters. Albums of this nature are consistently referred to as such (picking a few listed at the セルフカバー article, [http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000101773 セルフカバー集] [http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/35570/ 他アーティストへ提供した楽曲のセルフ･カバーをはじめとする] [http://www.amazon.co.jp/ReBORN-%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E7%94%9F%E7%94%A3%E9%99%90%E5%AE%9A%E7%9B%A4-%E5%B0%BE%E5%B4%8E%E4%BA%9C%E7%BE%8E/dp/B001TMEELE/ セルフカバー集] [http://www.amazon.co.jp/TAKE1-%E3%81%A4%E3%82%93%E3%81%8F%E2%99%82/dp/B000197KWG/ 主人公が男性のものをセルフ・カヴァー]). These are distinct from cover albums, as they're not exactly making tributes to themselves, just re-using compositions given to other musicians.
::While what happens at other Wikipedias is irrelevant to what happens here, if you look at the [[:ja:小田和正の作品一覧|Kazumasa Oda discography]] page and the [[:ja:椎名林檎|Ringo Sheena]] page, the people who made those felt that self-cover albums were conceptually different enough to be in their own sections and not lumped-in with the other tribute/cover albums they'd done. --[[User:Prosperosity|Prosperosity]] ([[User talk:Prosperosity|talk]]) 09:39, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Many insects are found across a large part of Europe so being found in any particular European country is not a [[WP:DEFINING]] characteristic of a species.  Many of the articles are categorised for countries that aren't even mentioned in the text ([[Bena bicolorana|example]]).  An example of a previous similar CFD is [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_18#Category:Moths_of_Metropolitan_France]].  Note: If this results in merge then a note should be added to [[:Category:Insects by country]] like there is at [[:Category:Moths by country]].  For info currently the categories for some countries have just a few articles (e.g. England 1, Switzerland 2) and categories for other countries contain several thousand articles. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 19:06, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''' "Europe" itself is pretty arbitrary in places, too. There's no barrier for insects to stop existing at the imaginary line between Eastern Europe and Western Asia. Perhaps landmasses with some commonality in insects would be better, such as [[:Category:Insects of the Scandinavian Peninsula]], [[:Category:Insects of the Iberian Peninsula]] and [[:Category:Insects of the Central Europe]] (depending on where separate insects tend to live). In that regard, [[:Category:Insects of Sicily]] would be a perfectly good category as it's a distinct island with endemic insects (and [[:Category:Insects of the United Kingdom]] could be changed to [[:Category:Insects of Great Britain]]). --[[User:Prosperosity|Prosperosity]] ([[User talk:Prosperosity|talk]]) 11:38, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:::This CFD is because this categorization scheme would, if complete, put many articles about insect species in dozens of categories for European countries that are not even mentioned in the article (many articles say something like "''found throughout southern Europe and ...''").  I.e. it's because European countries are small (on a global scale) that being found in such a country is not generally a [[WP:DEFINING]] characteristic of the species - not because borders are arbitrary.
:::Categorizing by regions would be better than categorizing by countries ("Mammals of San Marino" etc), but IMO Europe (approx 7% World's land area) is about the right level for this categorization.  Note: Many articles ([[Lucanus cervus|some]] [[Coccinella magnifica|examples]]) are not currently categorized by country. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 21:26, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge all''' per proposal. Categorization by subcontinental regions (e.g., Scandinavia) might have merit, but insects don't pay attention to political boundaries, making this excessive and non-meaningful categorization. --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 21:12, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge all'''. Same as the other similar categories that were recently merged (Moths of.., Mammals of...), these categories are useless. Instead, list articles should be used. --[[User:Sander_S%C3%A4de|<span style="font-family:Courier; color:#555">Sander&nbsp;Säde</span>]] 10:03, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' -- I think we recently allowed an Iberian category, on the basis that the Pyrannees were a sufficient barrier.  I believe that we have allowed UK and Ireland categories, on the basis that they are isands.  For the rest fauna do not respect borders and '''merger''' is appropriate.  The most common insects would have dozens of categories, which is not appropriate.  This suffers from the same objection as performance (country of occurrence) by performer (species) categories.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 19:29, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strong oppose'''. I think you're going about this the wrong way. It's not the size or area of a country that matters (and nominator has clearly determined that size matters), but species richness. You haven't considered just how many species there are that have small distributions (a few small countries -- avoiding category clutter). Azerbaijan, for example, is about the same size as Austria or Serbia and has well over 100 endemic plants. I notice that you almost always title these discussions with one of the smaller countries to emphasize your point. Yes, the smallest country categories (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino) may not end up having very many articles in them because regional categories would suffice and so their fate isn't clear, but most of the European country categories could contain many species with restricted distributions or endemics. And because Wikipedia is a [[WP:WIP|work in progress]], these categories have not been correctly applied. The point is that while we may not have an article for every species yet, when we do these categories will be viable if they aren't right now. So I suggest you consider the list above and ask yourself how many of these categories, when circumscribed correctly to endemics and species with restricted distributions, wouldn't violate [[WP:SMALLCAT]]. That's the only question here. I stress that point so much because I know in past discussions that the impulse is to reply with examples that make your case for you so I repeat that the examples you might cite would likely not be included in that category while others have not yet been categorized or written. But then, I suppose, it's easier to nominate categories for consolidation than to go about fixing, sorting, and writing -- the basic tasks of building the encyclopedia. [[User:Rkitko|Rkitko]] <sup><small>([[User talk:Rkitko|talk]])</small></sup> 23:04, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
::Sure, I tend to choose one of the smaller countries for the CFD title; some (especially non-European) editors may be unaware that there are such small countries in Europe and hence that there are so many countries in Europe (especially when places [[:Category:Fauna of Guernsey|like Guernsey]] are included).  These categories do not (currently) say that they are "''circumscribed ... to endemics and species with restricted distributions''" so an article can be placed in many categories (example[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greater_white-toothed_shrew&diff=548120119&oldid=542503041]) for which it is not a [[WP:DEFINING]] characteristic.  Being endemic to a particular region is defining for a species, but we have [[:Category:Endemic fauna by country|other categories]] for that.

* '''Support''' per [[MOS:COMPUTING#Collocation]]. In English, not every words can be replaced by its synonyms because [[collocation]] matters. (Example of collocation: "Red-blooded" is correct, "scarlet-blooded" is not. "[[The Scarlet Letter|Scarlet letter]]" and "red letter" have different meanings.) In this case, "discontinued" is never used with a single version of a computer program. A program is said to be discontinued when it is no longer maintained; meaning that no new versions are released. In that sense, even [[Windows 1.0]] is not discontinued because its ultimate successor, [[Windows 8.1]] is in production.

If the word "discontinued" was to be applied to a version of a software product, it would be discontinued as soon as it came out of the door: The developer always works on the next version, which would be released either in the form of a patch or full package.

* '''Strong Keep''' - In each of the articles contained within the category, the organization is unambiguously stated as "major" (sourced to RS).

**'''Reply'''. The fact that the sources use of terms such as "major" does need mean that they are using them in the same way.

:::'''Reply''' I disagree. I've reviewed each of the articles in this category and, in each case, the descriptors of import used are identifying the preeminent criminal organization in the nation in question, which - by a reasonable reading - clearly is synonymous with "major national criminal organizations." Whether or not they are, in fact, "major" is certainly open to debate ''within the articles themselves''. However, the only thing we will discuss in a category deletion discussion is the black/white issue of whether the category descriptor is contained in the article. That is the criteria and it is, in fact, the absolute definition of objectivity. [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 02:09, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. No clear criterion for inclusion since both "Major" and "National" are very ambiguous terms.

[[User:Pichpich|Pichpich]] ([[User talk:Pichpich|talk]]) 03:02, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Reply''' The criterion, as with all categories, is if the articles within the category use the category descriptor in their body text. If an article says someone was born in 1920, we include them in the category "People born in 1920." If an article says someone was a lover of broccoli, we include them in the category "People Who Love Broccoli." If we don't think someone listed in a category is being accurately represented as lover of broccoli, we address that issue ''within the article itself.'' We do not try to determine, in category deletion discussion, if a criminal organization is "major" (a subjective approach, as you are advocating) - we only attempt to determine if the article describes it as "major" (an objective approach). This is a very, very simple, straightforward process. [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 17:44, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' – the others are not precedents as they relate to non-indigenous populations. It seems likely to me that [[Chief Lake, Wisconsin]], say, has always had a Native American majority population and will continue to do so in a stable and defining manner. (The last three in the list are French-American, German-American and Italian-American to which the precedents do apply, and which should be deleted.)

* '''Keep''' - I always thought wikipedia was for "everyone" but mass nominations like this, explained simply as "numerous precedents" (let's not even bother trying to explain why it makes sense here, that would be too hard) show clearly that not all editors would have it that way, see also [[WP:BIAS]] [[Special:Contributions/71.246.159.247|71.246.159.247]] ([[User talk:71.246.159.247|talk]]) 14:22, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
::I suppose I was a little bit lazy, but all of the previous discussions cover it pretty well. 50% is an [[Wikipedia:OC#ARBITRARY]] threshold; There is no fundamental difference between having 49.9% Native American population versus 50.1%. Plurality populations are even more arbitrary, as it is different for different communities. Sometimes 20% could be a plurality, sometime 49% is. Furthermore, this is a quality that can change over time. It doesn't make sense to categorize everything that at one time had a majority, if these are happening at different census counts. This is especially true for Native Americans, who have been moved around a lot in the country's history. Populations are very fluid, so this isn't an ideal categorization scheme.

* '''Delete''' - this sort of thing should be done as a list ("''List of populated places with a <ethnicity> majority population in the <year> census''").  In some places the percentage of different ethnicities varies over time.  An example of a previous CFD (albeit for a non-indigenous population) is [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2014 January 23#Category:Counties and county equivalents of the United States with African American majority populations]].

*'''Delete''' The majority of people living on US "Indian Reservations" are not Native Americans, the majority of Native Americans do not live on Indian reservations, and more so than some other groups, this will varry if we include just those who report being native American and those who report being Native American and some other race. Beyond this, since any place that ever has fit this description can be so categorized, we would have to categorize places in Michigan and Wisconsin (such as Green Bay), that once had a majority Metis population, although few residents in those places today claim Native American ancestry.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 03:53, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''delete''' the majority population of an area changes over time, and we normally don't do categories that change over time. If it is defining for a place, it should be defining for all time. By that argument, every place in the Americas once had a majority indigenous population - that some places still do in 2014 is not defining, since by 2015 that may change.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 13:42, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' or '''Rename''' to [[:Category:Places in the United States with a Native American majority]], as it is too lengthy.

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Delete''' although I'm willing to be persuaded otherwise. I do find the category interesting and potentially valuable but on the other hand "perennial candidate" is really too subjective as the criterion of inclusion. [[User:Pichpich|Pichpich]] ([[User talk:Pichpich|talk]]) 02:09, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Strong Keep''' The nominator's rationale is only that the decision to place these articles in this category is subjective, so I can only address that argument. No subjectivity has been applied in placing these articles into this category. In each case, the articles themselves refer to the subject as a "perennial candidate" and, in each of those cases, the "perennial candidate" label has been sourced to (usually multiple) RS. Feel free to review each of the articles in this category, and the sourcing references. [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 02:38, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:::You don't create objectivity by simply finding a few sources that make the same subjective assessment. For instance it's trivial to find tons of sources that describe Barack Obama as a communist. When does a candidate become perennial? After this second try? the fourth? Does it have to be for the same office? Are you still a perennial candidate if you run a few times in your 20s and run again for another office when you're 60? Everyone has their definition. [[User:Pichpich|Pichpich]] ([[User talk:Pichpich|talk]]) 03:00, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
::::First, I'm unaware of "tons of" '''''RS sources''''' that describe Barack Obama as a communist. However, RS sources ''have'' identified the candidates in question as "perennial" and, as a result, they have been included in the category "Perennial candidates from Washington state." As to your question ''When does a candidate become perennial?'' I have no idea. This is the description the overwhelming majority of RS sources reporting on these candidates have used and is, as a result, the description that has been included in their entries on Wikipedia. I neither know, nor have interest in knowing, what criteria they've used. Thanks, Pichpich! [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 03:10, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

::This was a poor discussion that was based on the same specious claim that "we can't evaluate if someone is a perennial candidate or not." We're not. '''''The articles themselves refer to these individuals as perennial candidates,''''' and the only people listed in the category are people identified as perennial candidates ''in the opening sentence of their article''. So, the objection then is not with the existence of a category but whether or not these individuals should be referred to as perennial candidates in their articles - an issue that needs to be addressed in the individual articles listed in this category, and can't be resolved by simply deleting the category. [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 23:41, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I think it's important to note that all these first sentences using the "perennial candidate" label are all sentences that ''you'' wrote. Also, when you list sources that use a specific subjective label, you are wilfully ignoring the other sources (possibly more numerous) that did ''not'' use the label and this can create a lot of distortion. For instance, you will have no trouble finding a dozen serious film critics that say that ''[[American Hustle]]'' was the best American film of 2013, yet you wouldn't use this info to categorize the film. Categories are very black-and-white whereas articles can let the reader make up his own mind by giving him the facts of someone's political career. [[User:Pichpich|Pichpich]] ([[User talk:Pichpich|talk]]) 02:56, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
::::I appreciate you're having difficulty understanding the situation and I want to work with you to enhance your understanding, however, I need to ask you please read and review what I've previously written. Again, the articles source RS that describe them as perennial candidates, e.g.: 
:::::{{cite news |first=Danny |last=Westneat |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Perennial Candidate No Stranger To Rejection |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950825&slug=2138159 |work=[[Seattle Times]] |publisher= |date=25 August 1995 |accessdate=14 May 2014 }}
::::For the '''third time''', you need to raise your concerns about whether someone should be identified a "perennial candidate" ''within the articles themselves''. The issues you've explained you have will not be resolved by purging the category. These people are described in their articles as (a) perennial candidates, (b) from Washington state, therefore they are listed in a category called "perennial candidates from Washington state." This is, in fact, the absolute definition of objectivity. Your subjective argument - while I disagree with it - could be a valid argument within the articles themselves. It is not germane or appropriate to a category deletion discussion. Your argument, as it currently stands, would demand we also go through and delete established categories such as "American anti-communists", "Cold War leaders", etc., as 'anti-communist' and 'leader' are both subjective terms, unlike "People born in 1928." Do you feel a little bit better at all now? [[User:BlueSalix|BlueSalix]] ([[User talk:BlueSalix|talk]]) 17:29, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Please read [[WP:OC#SUBJECTIVE]]. The category you're defending faces the same problems as [[:Category:Obese people]] or [[:Category:Cult actors]]. On the other hand [[:Category:Cold War leaders]] makes sense because the Cold War has relatively precise start/stop dates. The term "leader" should probably be defined in a hatnote but it clearly refers to heads of states and there's little ambiguity there. In the case of American anti-communists, the hatnote explains that the cat is for ''articles on Americans who profess (or professed) to be anti-communists.'' This self-identification gives an objective criterion for inclusion. [[User:Pichpich|Pichpich]] ([[User talk:Pichpich|talk]]) 18:40, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' The top example of a perrenial candidate in Utah is [[Merrill Cook]], except he was actually elected to Congress for 2 terms, so not really.

::[[User:Johnpacklambert|Johnpacklambert]], this is not a discussion about perennial candidates generally.

Merrill Cook is not listed in the category "Perennial candidates from Washington state" which is the subject of this discussion.
