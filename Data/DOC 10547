== History ==
Pottery made in Tokoname dates back to the 12th century. During the [[Heian period]], what is now called Tokoname ware was already part of daily life. A kiln known as the Takasaka kiln was built in the 14th century. Towards the end of the [[Edo period]] in the late 19th century, [[Koie Hokyu]] completed a chambered "climbing kiln" (''nobori-gama''). The excellent reputation of modern Tokoname ware was established by his son [[Koie Hoju]]. He laid the foundations for earthenware pipe making and introduced the redware for which the town became renowned. A statue was later put up in his honour in the town.

The construction of the [[Meitetsu Tokoname Line]] in the [[Meiji era]] encouraged production and provided transportation for the increasing tile production during the [[Taishō era]].

The traditions behind Tokoname ware have been kept alive by generations of potters. In 1998, third-generation potter [[Yamada Jōzan III]] (三代山田常山 1924–2006) was named a [[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasure]], after being recognised as a [[National Intangible Cultural Asset]] for making small pouring vessels. His son Yamada Jōzan IV (b. 1954) assumed his father's title after his passing. Another noted potter from the Shōwa era was [[Ezaki Issei]] (江崎一生 1918–1992).<ref>{{cite web

Products that Tokoname is renowned for today are [[wind chime]]s, [[bonsai]] pots, [[redware]] [[tea pot]]s, ''[[shochu]]'' servers, tea [[incense burner]]s.

About 60 climbing kilns formerly operated in Tokoname. The Tōei Kiln (陶栄窯) is a climbing kiln (''nobori-gama'') that was constructed in Meiji 20 (1887) and used until Shōwa 49 (1974). It is the largest climbing kiln existing in Japan. It was designated as an Important Tangible Cultural Property by the government in Shōwa 57 (1982). It has eight firing chambers running a 17° incline and ten chimneys of varying height.
