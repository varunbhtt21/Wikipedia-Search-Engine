:''The result of the discussion was:''  '''rename'''. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 09:49, 21 June 2014 (UTC)

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Similar to American football player categories, these need renaming for clarity. Is "Northumbrian smallpipes players" for players of [[Northumbrian smallpipes]] or Northumbrians who play any sort of [[smallpipe]]? Some of these are categorized to imply the latter, but I think we're better off just defining these by instrument, not nationality. They're going to be fairly small either way. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 22:36, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*Speaking of small cats, I'm thinking maybe the Galician category should be '''upmerged''' to the Spanish one. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 22:44, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Question'''. Are Northumbrian, Scottish and Galician different?  The proposed targets seems to be categorizing based on that difference. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 23:17, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' Setting aside the overall renaming/syntax issue, to answer your question, [[Northumbrian smallpipes]] and [[Scottish bagpipes]] are very specific/defined individual instruments, and [[Spanish bagpipes]] and [[Galician bagpipes]] refer to somewhat broader families of reasonably-similar pipes played in those geographic areas. Actually, come to think of it, while the first two are indeed less-ambiguous as "Players of X smallpipe", etc., but for the latter two, are we sure that they haven't been being used ''both'' as "People from anywhere who play the X bagpipe" ''and'' "People from X who play any sort of bagpipe"?

*'''Rename'''  -- The various kinds of bagpipe are different from each other. so that distinct categories are needed.  The player will normally be of the instrument's ethnic origin, but not necessarily so.  I think Canada has some highland regiments, presumably using Scottish bagpipes in their band.  I am going to pass on whether Galicia should be merged inot Spain.  The main article indicates that there are a lot of regional variants on a theme, so that possibly we should be splitting the Spanish category.

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Personally, I think creating this category when there is not -- as yet -- a single keep !vote at [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_May_13#Category:Millennium_Entertainment_films]] is a little hasty. Both categories have been created by the same editor. Anyway, all I can do is reiterate my argument: we should not be categorizing films by distributor, and I believe this container category opens the door to just that. An individual film has many distributors, across countries and territories around the world as well as "windows" or platforms, i.e. theatrical, TV, home consumer, educational, as well as online distribution. And they are all equally "distributing" the film. So I oppose this category because it opens the door to a massive amount of clutter. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 00:30, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*What's more, the preexisting [[:Category:Films by studio]] has been rendered as a redirect to the new category, in a manner which seems to me to completely out of process. Or maybe this is the way it'll be now, with the category moving tools that I'd read about? Anyway, as someone who works a lot in the film field, I can only reiterate my strong objection to how this all has come about. thank you, [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 00:49, 20 May 2014 (UTC) 
*'''delete''' this container, and all other containers for film distributors. If the entity in question did not produce the film and only distributed it, this is category clutter and would lead to dozens of new categories being added to films depending on how they were distributed in different countries, and lots of category clutter. Delete all film distributors cats.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 13:46, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:*As I'd pointed out at the Millenium CfD, that was also the unopposed view just weeks ago at [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_15#Category:Drafthouse_Films_films]]. Yet that seems to have not made much of an impression, and here we are. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 14:31, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''delete'''.  Both of the above arguments make complete sense.[[User:Onel5969|Onel5969]] ([[User talk:Onel5969|talk]]) 14:30, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:*I should mention that [[:Category:Millennium Entertainment films]] has just been deleted at CfD. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 00:41, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
*As a way of undoing the damage done, can I also make clear that, in the event this CfD is successful, the closing admin will need to reverse the redirect and merge the contents of [[:Category:Films by studio or distributor]] ''back into'' [[:Category:Films by studio]], as there will no longer be any distributors in this category. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 04:25, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' to [[:Category:Films by studio]].  Even if there were distributors in this, I do not think that the distributor is significant enough to need categorisation.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 19:48, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
