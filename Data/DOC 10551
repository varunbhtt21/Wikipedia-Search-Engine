:*Need to re-name the category into " USSR dog breeds", or " Soviet dog breeds". The reason for need is that some dog breeds originated in Russia, while some in USSR, and they differ. However due to the fact that Russia inherited Soviet "brands" , including authorship for most Soviet inventions, a lot of dog breeds are referred to as "Russian" while in reality they could origin in different countries  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Afru|Afru]] ([[User talk:Afru|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Afru|contribs]]) 21:59, 21 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:* '''Propose deleting''' {{Lc|Films set on beaches}}<br />
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Delete as non-defining. I've seen a great many films on this list that simply have a single scene on a beach, some more memorable than others. I don't see how we could retain this and not then have films set in meadows, films set in fields, films set on sidewalks, etc. If kept, the category would need to be seriously pruned so that only films like [[The Beach (film)]], ''predominantly'' set on a beach, are permitted. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 19:53, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
**At this point, I'd have no objection to withdrawing this, unless someone feels strongly it should go ahead. I think the category needs to be pruned of a lot of films that are not defined by beach settings, but I personally have no interested in doing so. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 21:00, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I agree, can we come to some sort of agreement then? Cheers. The problem for me is that although films like From Here to Eternity and Get Carter aren't mostly set on a beach or anything like it they're really quite notable for beach scenes. Obviously it is silly to categorize every film with a beach scene as such but I think we need a way to document the notable ones without implying that the films are set on a beach. A solution could be to keep the category to those which are half or fully set on a beach and to create a list of films which have ''notable'' beach scenes in them which are covered in multiple sources. ♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e">''Dr. Blofeld''</span>]] 07:00, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep''', but I agree with the o.p. that it needs to be ensured that this genuinely is restricted to "films which are set on beaches or have sizable or memorable sections of films on a beach". Only "weak", because I do question whether this is ever going to be useful to anyone.&nbsp;[[User:Mogism|Mogism]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Mogism#top|talk]]) 20:02, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:*And I should probably point out that [[:Category:Beach party films]] is already a subcategory, for those films. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 20:13, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
::*Sure, but there are lots of films where beaches are pivotal, but can't be categorised as "Beach party films" - [[From Here to Eternity]], [[Saving Private Ryan]], [[On the Beach]]...&nbsp;[[User:Mogism|Mogism]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Mogism#top|talk]]) 20:28, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*Actually, ''On the Beach'', despite its name, shouldn't be included imo. Neither should the Bond films, nor ''Some Like It Hot''. I think much pruning needs to be done, but that's not a reason to delete, in itself. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 20:55, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' but I agree it needs to be better defined or instead replaced with a source list with a summary. It's not supposed to be for every film which ever had one beach scene in it. But those films which are predominantly set on a beach or have scenes on a beach in it which the film is famous for. It's a category I was looking for.♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e">''Dr. Blofeld''</span>]] 20:23, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' or limit to where >50% of the film is on beach (yes, I know that's [[WP:OC#ARBITRARY]]).  Films like [[Saving Private Ryan]] are in plenty of more appropriate categories. Possibly listify. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 21:09, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:*I agree. As much as I'll never forget that beach scene, I don't think it belongs here. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 21:28, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Simply having scenes (even important scenes) set on a beach isn't a defining characteristic. The films in this category have nothing substantive in common. -[[User:JasonAQuest|Jason A. Quest]] ([[User talk:JasonAQuest|talk]]) 02:45, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete.'''  After much rewording, I can't improve on what [[User:JasonAQuest|Jason A. Quest]] has said immediately above. No established commonality nor definition. --[[User:Richhoncho|Richhoncho]] ([[User talk:Richhoncho|talk]]) 21:34, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
*Wait, now even as nominator, I have to point out that a film that is set ''primarily'' on a beach is a bona fide setting. And we do have some of those. So I'm going to have to change my own !vote to '''keep and prune if necessary'''. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 00:07, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
::The mere fact that it may be logically possible to determine membership in the category (or not) doesn't address the issue of whether it is a meaningful or helpful category. -[[User:JasonAQuest|Jason A. Quest]] ([[User talk:JasonAQuest|talk]]) 16:27, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
:::That's not my argument. I'm saying that films set ''primarily'' on beaches can exist as a bona fide subcategory of [[:Category:Films by geographic setting]]. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 18:06, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
{{ping|Shawn in Montreal}} I think we can agree on narrowing it down to those films which are primarily set on beaches strictly and we can state this in the category talk page. We can leave a note saying only films ''primarily'' set on beaches can be included. Ones like The Seventh Seal and The Beach. The thing is what about ones like Saving Private Ryan and Ryan's Daughter which have significant footage on a beach. Would they be included? I think we need some leeway. we just need to draw line somewhere! Can you withdraw this? Otherwise it'll probably be deleted entirely and I think it has some use.♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e">''Dr. Blofeld''</span>]] 17:06, 21 June 2014 (UTC)
*Yeah, I kind of thought my !voting keep would = a withdrawal. But sure. '''WITHDRAW'''. [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 18:51, 21 June 2014 (UTC)
::You're probably well up on a lot of the films so feel free to remove the ones from the category you're not happy with. I'm not sure about Saving Private Ryan but I think Ryan's Daughter has enough beach footage to qualify, no objection though if you think otherwise. As memorable though as the beach scene is in Saving I really don't think you could call it significantly set on a beach. Ryan's Daughter on the other hand at least one third of the film was shot on the beach or clifftops. Ones like ''[[The Small Back Room]]'' I also think had enough significant footage to quality as the last third of the film was defusing a bomb on the beach.♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e">''Dr. Blofeld''</span>]] 20:16, 21 June 2014 (UTC)

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Per most of the branches of the category tree ({{cl|Religious buildings by century}} being the main exception), as well as the category's main article, [[Place of worship]] ([[Religious building]] redirects there). [[User:Od Mishehu|עוד&nbsp;מישהו]] [[User talk:Od Mishehu|Od&nbsp;Mishehu]] 17:24, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.  This tree includes convents and other buildings like hospitals and some others.  These are not places of worship.  The absence of a main article and the fact that there is a poorly thought out redirect does not change the need for an article and this category tree which should be the parent for [[:Category:Places of worship]]. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 18:43, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. We do need some sort of container category for things like religious museums, religion office/administration buildings, and the like. You might be able to get away with calling a convent or monastery a place of worship, but not some of these others. That said, since there are so many subcategories that use the terminology "places of worship", maybe the target category should be developed into a sub-container-category rather than being the redirect that is it now. [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] <sup>[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]</sup> 22:22, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' -- Not all religious buildings are places of worship.  The Quakers have meeting houses for theri meetings, but theri metings are not for worship in the conventional sense.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 19:51, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' - Oppose the specific nomination, because not all religion-related buildings are places of worship, of course (and not all "places of worship" are "buildings").  But query: Can buildings properly be said to be "religious"?  Wouldn't it make more sense to describe these as "religion-related ..." or "Religion-affiliated buildings" or something like that? --[[User:Lquilter|Lquilter]] ([[User talk:Lquilter|talk]]) 00:43, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' except this is two separate careers, not one career involving singing and writing. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 05:56, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
**I think it's the fact that it's a single person that is controlling, not the fact that they are two separate careers. And in any case—the entire justification to categorize by this intersection is that there is some connection between the two careers. If we are categorizing people who just happened to have two careers, and there is no connection at all between the two, we probably should not be doing it by category. But these have been justified in the past as representing a phenomenon whereby a sportsperson gains notoriety and then bootstraps that notoriety into a political career. Thus, I if we're going to allow the categories, I think we can say that there's a pretty close connection between the two in the same way that there's a connection between the singer-songwriter careers.

****Yeah, that's what I was guessing and addressing. I'm also Canadian, and can confirm that while that usage does exist among some speakers by virtue of the obvious AmE influence, it's ''not'' accepted as ''standard'' in CanE. But you're right that it's beyond the scope of this discussion; if the user wants to try (and fail) to get it renamed, they can shoot that blank some other time ''after'' the hyphenation issue is dealt with one way or the other.

:* '''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:American Anglican church stubs]] to [[:Category:American Episcopal church stubs]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Per the relevant permcat, {{cl|Episcopal churches in the United States}} - it apprears to be an ENGVAR issue. [[User:Od Mishehu|עוד&nbsp;מישהו]] [[User talk:Od Mishehu|Od&nbsp;Mishehu]] 04:43, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:'''Keep'''. Within the Anglican Communion, "Anglican" vs. "Episcopal" has been essentially an ENGVAR issue, but now there are Anglican groups in the United States that have split off from the Episcopal Church, so this category likely includes some churches that are Anglican but not Episcopal. --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 21:17, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
::{{Ping|Orlady}}, does this mean you would have supported renaming {{cl|Episcopal churches in the United States}} to {{cl|Anglican churches in the United States}}? [[User:Od Mishehu|עוד&nbsp;מישהו]] [[User talk:Od Mishehu|Od&nbsp;Mishehu]] 03:58, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
:::No, it doesn't. Rather, I believe that we need to create a new set of container categories for Anglicanism in the United States, to include the Episcopal Church and the U.S. elements of the [[Anglican realignment]] and other non-Episcopal Anglican groups. The category {{cl|Episcopal churches in the United States}} is defined as containing churches affiliated with the Anglican denomination [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], and it is linked to other categories specific to that denomination. That denominational category structure is entirely valid. The problem is that there are Anglican churches and denominational organizations that aren't Episcopal, such as [[Reformed Anglican Church]], [[Convocation of Anglicans in North America]], and [[Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh]]. Non-Episcopal Anglican churches can be expected to show up as "Anglican stubs," but they should not be treated as "Episcopal stubs." --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 15:37, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Rename''' per nom. I can't see that there's any good reason not to match the naming of a stub category to its non-stub parent, even when we are dealing with ENGVAR issues. [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] <sup>[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]</sup> 04:25, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''REname''' per nom.  This is the name of the denomination.  Episcopalian might be an alternative, but one would have to start by renaming the articles (many of them).  However, they are part of the Anglican Communion (at least at present) and parents should not be renmed to match.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 19:58, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
* Keeping [[User:Orlady|Orlady]]'s contribution in mind, would '''splitting''' into Episcopal and Anglican be an option? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 21:57, 26 June 2014 (UTC)
:*A few days ago I took a stab at doing that by creating [[:Category:Anglicanism in the United States]], which I believe was a needed addition to the category hierarchy -- to match the global categories and because not all American Anglicans are Episcopalians. Your note here reminded me that I needed to continue populating that category -- and I also created [[:Category:Anglican churches in the United States]] -- and I placed this stub category into that new parent category (I also left in the Episcopal churches category). Since I have never been either an Anglican or a scholar of religion, I don't know nearly enough about the subject to do an authoritative job of organizing the Anglicanism category into subcategories. Other participants in this discussion should take a look at what I've done and see how it affects your opinion on the category name. (Also, if you think I made mistakes in category structure or categorization of specific items, PLEASE fix my errors!) --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 23:03, 26 June 2014 (UTC)
