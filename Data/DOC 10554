:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Delete'''. After a lengthy discussion at [[:Category:Advocates of pseudoscience]] per [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2014 May 1#Category:Pseudoscientists|CFD 2014 May 1]], a 3-admin panel closed the debate  as a consensus to keep only a [[:Category:Advocates of pseudoscience]], as a {{tl|container category}}. Individual articles are to be moved to a ''"subcategory or subcategories specifying the field or fields of pseudoscience"''. The other sub-categories do ''not'' include the word "pseudoscience", and while I am sure that these categories are well-intentioned, their use of the word effectively negates the outcome of the previous CFD.

:::[[Trofim Lysenko]] was an odd case: a genuine biologist who diverted into pseudoscience. So he should be categorised as a biologist, in addition to any other categories. I don't know enough about the field to suggest what other terms might be appropriate, but the clear outcome of the May 1 CFD was to stop categorising individuals in categories which explicitly label them as pseudoscientists.

::::Lysenko seems more like a textbook case of a pseudoscientist rather than an odd case.  He's probably more well-recognized as a pseudoscientist than any other member of to-be-depopulated pseudoscientist category.  So how do we follow the instructions of the close which instructs us to subdivide categories into "pseudoscientific" ones and "nonpseudoscientific" ones?  What terminology do we use to subdivide the e.g. pseudoscientific biologists from the nonpseudoscientific biologists? "Pseudobiologists"?  This isn't an academic question: We're supposed to be moving these members of the pseudoscientists category into subcategories right now.  If categories aren't created into which to put these subjects, either they'll be left in the pseudoscientist category (which wasn't decided), or they will be removed from the new categorization schema altogether (which wasn't decided). --<font face="georgia">[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&nbsp;</font><font face="georgia" size="1">([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])</font> 23:22, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::::Are this a wind-up of some sort?  Are you really serious??????
:::::::::A "pseudoscientific biologist" is a pseudoscientist working in the field of biology. Nothing implicit; it's what the phrase means. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 07:12, 23 May 2014 (UTC) 
::::::::::I'm always serious here; I don't think facetious comments are effective online. I'm not sure how you could reach that conclusion about the meaning of the term "pseudoscientific biologist". The term simply does not exist outside of this discussion ([https://www.google.ca/search?q=%22pseudoscientific+biologist%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=kws&gfe_rd=cr&ei=4_t-U4WsE4aN8QelvoDIAw]), it can only mean whatever we define it as meaning.  Similar to the term "Advocates of pseudoscience".
::::::::::If that's what you mean by "explicitly", that's fine, and we can use that usage here.  So, let's define a term of art: ''explicitly*'', which describes usages where the term actually occurs, as opposed to "explicitly" which is what you mean by the word.  E.g., saying "figure A is trilateral" would be explicitly to say that figure A is triangular, but it would not be explicitly* to say that figure A is triangular.  To give a more formal description:  Things explicitly stated need only be implied by a set of actual statements and background knowledge, but things explicitly* stated need to be in the set of actual statements. So to answer your question:  The point could be to disallow explicitly* categorizing biographies as pseudoscientists, but not explicitly categorizing biographies as pseudoscientists. Indeed, I think this would be required:  Because if "explicitly" means that, then categorizing someone in any of the subcategories of "Advocates of pseudoscience" would also be explicitly categorizing someone as a pseudoscientist. Disallowing that, would be absurd, because it would mean not categorizing anyone in any subcategories of the category "Advocates of pseudoscience". --<font face="georgia">[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&nbsp;</font><font face="georgia" size="1">([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])</font> 08:00, 23 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::::For Lysenko, the sources just describe him as a pseudoscientist in biology.  Of the twenty sources I looked at which describe him as a pseudoscientist, none of them explicitly say what causes him to be described as such.  If I had to guess, I would say they do so because they believe he did not follow minimally adequate methods for the field of biology. That's generally how the category works within our reliable sources: It's not the specific ideas or theories which make someone pseudoscientific in the minds of experts, it's the methods or lack of methods followed. E.g., [[Massimo Pigliucci]] concludes just that in ''Nonsense on Stilts'' (University of Chicago Press, 2010): "So what about pseudoscience? What picture emerges there? A field can fall into that category because it again fails to meet the three criteria of naturalism, theory, and empiricism, and yet its supporters insist that there is no problem." (p. 304)   E.g., Isaac Newton believed in alchemy, but he wasn't a pseudoscientist on this view, because he followed adequate methods: It's just that he lacked the information and resources we have now to reach the right conclusions.  --<font face="georgia">[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&nbsp;</font><font face="georgia" size="1">([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])</font> 04:29, 23 May 2014 (UTC)

* The close of the previous CFD probably should not be seen as binding on these categories (they weren't discussed after all), but the same principles apply.  People don't self indentify as "pseduoscience XXXists"; the term is only applied by opponents.  Looking at the actual cases in these categories I would say:
::[[Kauko Armas Nieminen]] - not a trained physist, so probably should not be described as a physist psuedo or otherwise (by category or text).  "Ether vortices" is probably not worth categorizing on, so just the category [[Pseudophysics]] is adequate.  He is the only person in "Pseudoscientific physicists" so if he absolutely must be categorized some like "Aether theorists" is no worse than the current category.
::[[Immanuel Velikovsky]] - already in multiple other pseduo categories and astronomy is not mentioned in the lead.  I see no compelling reason to categorize him as any sort of astronomer
::[[Robert Sungenis]] - Seems t be classified based on his belief in geocentrism.  Perhaps a category "Advocates of geocentrism" is in order. (I imagine there are other modern people who advocate for this idea.)
::[[Zecharia Sitchin]] - Already in multiple other pseudo categories. His ideas seem to be based primarily on "ancient alien" theories (which he is classified under), so I see no compelling reason to also classify him as any sort of astronomer.
::[[Rupert Sheldrake]] - He advocates for his "morphic resonance" idea.  This idea is tied to biology in some sense, but seems more clearly to be a type of [[parapsychology]] under which he is already classified.  I guess he did some legit biology too, so can be classified as a biologist.
::[[Trofim Lysenko]] - His idea became well-enough known to get an extensive article, [[Lysenkoism]].  The simple solution is to make a category "Lysenkoism" and classify that category as a pseudoscience.  Not sure if anyone else with an article would fall into that category at current, but the Lysenkoism article makes it clear that plenty of notable people practiced it.  
:In summary, there is no need for these tiny categories. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 15:04, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
::We still have the problem of moving the people from the Pseudoscientists category to subcategories of the Advocates of pseudoscience category.  We can't just put them in things like "Aether theorists" or Advocates of geocentrism", because that still has the problem of distinguishing the pseudoscientific from the nonpseudoscientific.  E.g., Maxwell wasn't a pseudoscientist but he was an aether theorist; and neither was Tycho Brahe, but he was an advocate of geocentrism.   We would need to make categories like "Advocates of pseudoscientific geocentrism" etc., or some acceptable name.
::Really, the condition you've made is impossible to meet, and for an obvious reason.  We've been instructed by the close to create categories of members of fields "on the condition that reliable sources generally classify the subcategorized field itself as a pseudoscience."  Now you've added the condition that the members have to self-identify with this "subcategorized field".  Well, few are going to do that, and for an obvious reason:  No one who has pretensions of being a good scientist wants to be classified as taking part in something with is generally recognized as pseudoscience.  E.g., Lysenko self-identified as a biologist or a "Michurinist", not a "Lysenkoist" (for more than one reason).  Sheldrake self-identifies as a biologist, not a "parapsychologist".  Pseudoscientists either take part in the [[euphemism treadmill]], or they just refuse to identify with any grouping which might be treated as distinctively pseudoscientific.  --<font face="georgia">[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&nbsp;</font><font face="georgia" size="1">([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])</font> 17:58, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I didn't add a condition, I merely specified one of reasons why such subcats are preferable.  It is not absolutely necessary that one indetify themselves as a parapsychologist, for example...  For cases like alchemy or geocentrism where there is a difference between the scientific idea in the past and the non-scientific adherence to it today, I would suggest something like [[:Category:Historical alchemists]] for the legit scientists as opposed to [[:Category:Pseudoscience alchemists]] for the modern people.

:::::::(To use a more well-populated category), it is true that many astrologers do not practice psuedoscience (i.e. do not pretend there is anything scientific about astrology).  This was a concern mentioned, but not really discussed much in the original CFD.  Our best judgement was that renaming the category from "pseudoscientists" to "advocates of pseudoscience" at least partially adresses this concern.  That is, practicing astrology does not necessarily mean practicing pseudoscience, but it does mean advocating something which is labeled as a pseudoscience.  The top-level category being only a holding category allows it to aid in navigation without actually labelling anyone a pseudoscientist in a way visible on articles; we believe the consensus is that this scheme satisfies BLP concerns.  Whether subcategories should be divided for "historical" or "mystical" differentiation is not a determination we were able to make based on the CFD. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 20:37, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::But you don't have reliable sources agreeing that numerologists are all advocates of pseudoscience.

What you seem to be saying is that some sources label some numerology as pseudoscience, some other sources label some set of people as numerologists, therefore the sources agree that that set of people can be categorized as advocates of pseudoscience. That's reaching a conclusion which is not made explicit in any of the sources. The sources do not say that Pythagoras, Aleister Crowley or William Breeze are numerologists ''cum'' advocates of pseudoscience.

If this inability to distinguish between the non-pseudoscience numerologist/astrologers/etc. and the pseudoscience ones is a problem, it is certainly not a problem created by the rename.  It wasn't really discussed much at the CFD, so I'm not sure many people see it as a problem.  If it is seen as a problem, then a consensus as such would have to be established and news "advocates" category would be deleted.  (Not perfectly overlapping subcats is hardly unique to this situation, for the record.)

Looking back at the original CFD, you wrote "A pseudoscientist is any one who advocates anything properly categorized as pseudoscience. That's as plain as any other category."  Based on that position, if numerology is properly called a pseudoscience, nothing is lost by classifying McCants as a numerologist.

::Petrik does not claim to be a scientist. So there is no basis to categorize him as one. But he claims his discoveries are scientifically sound, of Nobel Prize quality, according to the article. The piece of that article that caught my attention is this:
::{{quote|1=In 2010 Petrik sued two Russian newspapers for defamation after articles they ran about him. He won a judgment against them in which they were ordered to run a retraction and pay damages to him. The settlement awarded him significantly less than he had sought, however. The papers have since insisted that their reports were accurate.}}
::We can report that the opinion of the Russian Academy of Sciences is that he is doing pseudoscience, if we have a source that confirms that. But we shouldn't definitely categorize him as such, that could potentially be called defamation. The article says that in the 1980s he spent time in prison for fraud and extortion.

:::Petrik might be an example of a pseduo-scientist (a scientific fraud) but that isn't the same thing as "doing pseudoscience" and is certainly not the same thing as advocating for a pseudoscience.  Again, this is one of the problems with the old category - there was no way to distinguish between fraudsters and people doing bad science.  Where is there any indication Petrik has ''done'' anything related to science (as opposed to simply making stuff up) that would qualify his a doing pseduo-physics?

They should be replaced by more specific categories. For example, [[Lysenkoism]] is in [[:Category:Pseudoscience]], and so [[Trofim Lysenko]] should be in a [[:Category:Lysenkoists]] which should be in [[:Category:Advocates of pseudoscience]].

:'''Comment''' - The questions seem to me to relate to whether an individual or field of study is ''exclusively'' fringe/pseudo, or, alternately, whether there involvement in a particular field is exclusively fringe/pseudo. Do I have that right? So, for instance, from what I remember anyway, [[Rupert Sheldrake]] started as an apparently maybe legitimate biologist, who only clearly went over to the Woo Side after a few years of work in the field. Maybe we might consider specific subcats like [[:Category:Recent advocates of pseudoastronomy]] or [[:Category: Recent advocates of pseudoastronomical theories]] or something similar, and maybe indicate somewhere that there are intended to be only used when BLP, broadly construed, is an issue. The now older subcat of [[:Category:Saints]] for Lutherans, [[:Category:People celebrated in the Lutheran liturgical calendar]] is kinda verbose too, to meet the specific needs of that instance, but mighy serve as a model for this situation. And I think categories using "advocate" or something similar would not necessarily have the same prejudicial bias as directly calling them "pseudo"-somethings would, and would also not so clearly conflict with categories of "legitimate" science would.

*'''Oppose''' I suppose. This is a strange category, with perhaps 2% of the possible population (no English kings were ever "ousted" apparently), and a name that will puzzle most non-native speakers.

*'''Merge''' back to equivalent "head of state" category.  Ousted can cover a multiude of things, removed by coup; lost elections; etc.  We should not be mixing heads of state and heads of government, becuase they are differnet things in many countries.  Several English kings were deposed (ousted) and would need to be in the category: Edward II, Richard II, Charles I and James II, but I do not think we need this at all: ousted is too vague; and this is a backdoor means of getting a "former" category, which we do not normally allow.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 20:16, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' as proposed.  I probably have to side with [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] to '''merge''' into the other subcategories of [[:Category:Heads of state]], or if nothing fits, into that category directly.  Ousted is simply too ambiguous as documented above.  The introduction being as complex as it is points to the problems with the category.

*'''Merge''' The term "ousted" just is not definitive enough.

:*'''Keep''' Winning a major championship is highly defining of a player. It is something that is always mentioned in the media that a player was a Stanley Cup or Super Bowl champion. This is definitely a category that most people would expect to find when reading an encyclopedia. -[[User:Djsasso|DJSasso]] ([[User talk:Djsasso|talk]]) 13:14, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

::::Well quite simply the most important aspect of a team sport players career is whether they were on a team that won a championship. If its the most important aspect of their career then likely people are going to want to find out who those special athletes are that won that championship. Winning the Superbowl or the Stanley Cup is the equivalent for pro sports of winning a gold medal at the Olympics.

*'''Delete'''.  We shouldn't categorize people by what championships their team has won.

*'''Keep''' Winning a major championship is a defining point in a person's life. Hence why we have categories such as [[:Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States]]. <span class="nowrap"><font color="blue">Canuck</font><small><sup><font color="green">89</font> [[User talk:Canuckian89|(have words with me)]]</small></sup> <small>06:49, May 24, 2014 (UTC)</small></span>
*'''Keep''' Same reasoning as in the previous related nomination - this is a defining aspect of a player as it represents them reaching the peak of their field. Should relay runners also be excluded from [[:Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States]] on the grounds that they are a team? Previous delete reasoning were based upon: this type of category not usually being done (the Olympic example being a prominent counter-example) and overcategorisation for individuals (awards categories are commonly applied to individuals from winning groups e.g. [[:Category:Grammy Award-winning artists]]). As for the reasoning that winning a sports competition is not a defining aspect of a player, I struggle to understand the starting point for that logic. [[User talk:Sillyfolkboy|SFB]] 13:39, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' -- If this were about teams it would apply to almost all of them.  If it is about players, I think it fails [[WP:OC#AWARD]], or if not it is too similar for comfort.  Each player will have enough categories related to his sport and team, not to need another.  Olympic medallists should be treated as an exception, because we would not categorise them as competitors or team members.  In contrast, all those involved here will be in a team category.

::{{ping|Peterkingiron}} Just to get clarity on the above argument per [[WP:OC#AWARD]]: do you believe winning one of the highest honours in a player's sport is not a defining characteristic for a team player (as opposed to an individual)? [[User talk:Sillyfolkboy|SFB]] 20:51, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Being a [[Super Bowl]] or [[Stanley Cup]] are exemplary examples of what is meant by [[WP:DEFINING]] which states that ''“a defining characteristic is one that reliable, secondary sources commonly and consistently define, in prose, the subject as having.”'' For example: [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20755735,00.html]" and [http://ntv.ca/stanley-cup-champion-teaches-next-generation/], picking just two random examples of the thousands of similar prose commonly found when such a champion player is mentioned. [[User:Dolovis|Dolovis]] ([[User talk:Dolovis|talk]]) 22:37, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Weak Keep''' There are reasons to keep them and reasons to get rid of them. It's a team trophy. We list the team champions. The team is listed on the trophy itself. What these categories are useful for is developing a list of players that have been Cup/Bowl-winning team members, but that's not really a defining characteristic. Since there have been so many members, it is unlikely that the editors here would build a 'List of Stanley Cup winning players'. So if the basis for delete is defining players, then no it doesn't really define them. However, it is a useful category for categorizing players.
