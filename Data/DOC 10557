*'''Oppose''' both proposals.

::::BrownHairedGirl's point is that "Shabbat" is a Jewish term unfamiliar to most Christians. [[:Category:Sabbath]] could be renamed to [[:Category:Christian Sabbath]] but I do not see way that improves on things. It seems better to make Shabbat a sub-cat of Sabbath, and consider Sabbath for all types there-of. '''[[User:Tahc|tahc]]''' '''<sup>[[User talk:Tahc|chat]]</sup>''' 19:20, 24 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Sabbath does not exclusively refer to the Christian Sabbath. The article [[Sabbath]] is even broader and actually covers all days of rest. I advocate changing [[:Category:Sabbath]] to [[:Category:Days of rest]] – a category covering articles that exclusively cover the Christian Sabbath and not days of rest more broadly would be a small one indeed. [[User talk:Sillyfolkboy|SFB]] 20:47, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
::Nearly everything that is directly in [[:Category:Sabbath]] is about the Christian Sabbath-- it would ''not'' be "a small one indeed." 
::'''Oppose''' a change to [[:Category:Days of rest]]. That would include many things such as [[Labour Day|Labour]]/[[Labor day]].

*'''Keep''' -- Shabbat is a Hebrew word for a period from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.  Sabbath is an English word derived from it, which is sometimes (perhaps incorrectly) applied to Sunday.  The Seventh Day Adventists worship on Saturdays. I would support (at least in gental terms) the line being taken by BHG and Tahc, of having Sabbath as the parent and the differnet interpretations of that (by Jews and various kinds of Christians) as subcats.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 20:36, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

* There's a lot of distracting discussions going on now. My main point was, we seem to forget that a naive reader won't know the difference between Sabbath and Shabbat. If we would add '''Sabbath (Christian)''' and ''possibly'' even '''Shabbat (Jewish)''', things would be much clearer.

*'''Oppose Merge''' [[:Category:Shabbat]] corresponds directly to its parent article [[Shabbat]], contains articles related to the Jewish Sabbath and the mixing of the two is inappropriate. [[User:Alansohn|Alansohn]] ([[User talk:Alansohn|talk]]) 03:12, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

::: Although the original intention of [[:Category:Judeo-Christian topics]] may have been different, in practice there are mainly separate Jewish articles and separate Christian articles categorized here.

** '''Comment''' I'm not suggesting that the Judeo-Christian tradition is just a mashup of Christianity and Judaism. I'm just referring to the fact that there's currently many articles in this category that are written either from a Christian or a Jewish point of view, e.g. [[Christian views on the Old Covenant]] or [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)]]. Alternatively, there are articles with a separate Christian chapter and Jewish chapter, e.g. [[Idolatry]], which isn't any better. And there's also articles which have nothing to do with beliefs and ethics, e.g. [[Alba Bible]] and [[Fiscus Judaicus]]. The whole point is, the purpose of the category is apparently not clear to people who are (have been) categorizing these articles.

Repeat my call for deletion but I'll phrase my motivation better. A 'term' or 'terminology' is a non-defining characteristic. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 06:45, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
*What would be a better category for articles like [[Moh]], [[Gursikh]] or [[Infaq]]? It would be a bit much to upmerge such articles to the parent religion category. [[User talk:Sillyfolkboy|SFB]] 08:37, 31 May 2014 (UTC)

:* Moh and Gursikh: Sikh beliefs or Sikh philosophy or Sikh practices (I'm not really sure which of the three, you will probably know better). Btw, it's striking that there is currently so little classified in Sikh beliefs.
:* Infaq: Islamic ethics and Quaranic words and phrases. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 10:00, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
Just to avoid any misunderstandings: this proposal refers to Christianity only. The large amount of articles in Christianity already has an additional subcategory within Christianity (next to Christian terms), so there is little upmerging to the parent religion category needed.
