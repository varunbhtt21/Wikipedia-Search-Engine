:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Four years on from my [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2010_March_7#Category:Sports_competitions|original proposal]] - The content of this category is for international competitions in the region and a natural successor to the parent [[:Category:International sports competitions]]. Transnational does not a clear meaning (is the competition in multiple countries? Does it travel across one country to another? Is it between different teams representing nations?) and "international" is a more clear plain English choice for this type of competition. [[User talk:Sillyfolkboy|SFB]] 19:35, 24 May 2014 (UTC)

:''The result of the discussion was:''  '''split as proposed'''. [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] <sup>[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]</sup> 23:18, 23 June 2014 (UTC)
:* '''Propose splitting''' [[:Category:Bantu people]] to [[:Category:Bantu people]] and [[:Category:Bantu peoples]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Split'''. The category currently includes subcategories for both [[Bantu peoples]] (groups) and Bantu people (individuals) which has resulted in confusion and category edit warring. See [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Bantu Bantu category hierarchy on Commons] for how it should be. [[User:HelenOnline|<font color="green">Helen</font>]][[User talk:HelenOnline|<font color="lime">Online</font>]] 09:25, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Split''' – it is surprising this was not done long ago. [[:Category:Komi peoples]]  and [[:Category:Mongol peoples]] are other examples of how it should be done. [[User:Oculi|Oculi]] ([[User talk:Oculi|talk]]) 11:09, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Support''' per nomination rationale. [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 11:12, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' and '''Oppose''' split and, if anything, delete only [[:Category:Bantu people]].  There is no need at ''ALL'' for a split; [[:Category:Bantu]] is the normal form for main ethno cats, all I was doing was normalizing that per a good couple of hundred similar cats....[[:Category:Bantu people]], if there are no articles on people who are individual Bantus, as the edit warrior who wants the "people" dab on all ethno titles maintains, then there should be no such category: HelenOnline's position on her section on [[Talk:Northern Ndebele people]] that the [[Bantu peoples]] main cat means that "Bantu people" should be the form - saying in her edit comments on her participation in the edit war "bantu cat is broader than peoples"....and what would that be?  If not the peoples and all about and associated with them? there are ''some'' "peoples" categories out there, and some "FOO people" ones that are not about "people who are FOO", but overwhelmgingly standalone "FOO" titles are the norm, even when a main article is "FOO peoples", "FOO people" or "FOO tribe"; see subcats of [[:Category:Alaska Native ethnic groups]], and subcats under [[:Category:Australian Aboriginal peoples]], [[:Category:First Nations]] and lots more.  [[:Category:Anishinaabe]] is one of several categories for groups of peoples that does not have "people(s)" appended to its title; nor should it.  [[:Category:Sioux]] is yet another.  
**I'm fine - almost = with "Bantu peoples" ''except'' that [[:Category:Bantu]] already exists and more than suffices for a ''normal'' main ethno category title. There is no other usage for "Bantu" than Bantu topics, and therefore ''no need for disambiguation'' - even in the main article title itself.  [[:Category:Bantu]] is needed as a parent for [[:Category:Bantu languages]] (languages are not peoples)]]; [[Bantu mythology]], [[Ruhanga]], [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]] and other items in the main Bantu category should not be in a "Bantu peoples" category; deities, organizations etc are not "peoples".  Indeed [[:Category:Bantu]] is about more than peoples; and that's why your edit war makes no sense; yet you want to title it to a peoples-specific title.  A ''subcat'' of [[:Category:Bantu]] = [[:Category:Bantu peoples]] makes eminent sense; but instead of just making it, you continued an edit war and now launched a CFD over it; instead of just doing it.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 17:13, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
:::You don't listen and make a lot of incorrect assumptions. Please slow down. Please see the Commons link I provided for the hierarchy I am proposing, including the subcats of the Bantu people (individuals) category there. I launched a CFD as obviously the matter is controversial if people are edit warring over it.

:::Subcats of [[:Category:Bantu]], namely [[:Category:Bantu peoples]] and [[:Category:Bantu people]] '''''are''''' what I am proposing. You don't even know what you are objecting to.

::::Sheeeesh.  ''Just make [[:Category:Bantu peoples]] and be done with it, you are proposing keeping "Bantu people" even though there aren't any.  The "peoples" subcats in the "FOO people" format should be subcatted to [[:Category:Bantu peoples]] and many of them need a parent cat (most do) for "FOO" and some may need "FOO organizations", "FOO languages" (if there is more than one-language related article), and maybe "FOO governments".  This CFD wasn't necessary; and neither was an "edit war" by you or its perpetrator. And Commons cats are named after Wikipedia cats, not the other way around; otherwise there'd still be [[:Category:Skwxwu7mesh]] instead of [[:Category:Squamish people]], similar to other endonym-named Commons cats where the Wikipedia cats are in anglicized or "FOO people" or "FOO Nation" (capital-n Nation=government/tribal governments by convention for that) as IMO too many are.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 01:26, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::You are missing the point (again) about the Commons categories. They are what I am ''proposing'' here (yes I could go to the trouble of writing it all out but most people will click on the link and read it). I am not saying anywhere that Wikipedia cats should follow Commons cats. The Commons Bantu cats were cleaned up by myself and another Commons editor earlier this year, which is why I got involved in this whole saga in the first place.

:::::I disagreed with you and reverted your edits (and discussed it on the article talk page and on your user talk page and here). That is how Wikipedia builds consensus.

[[User:HelenOnline|<font color="green">Helen</font>]][[User talk:HelenOnline|<font color="lime">Online</font>]] 08:58, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::When the reversions don't make sense and are contrary to established practices and names for main ethno categories, attempts to re-instate that without actual justification or ''logic'' are edit-warring; this is all moot, I've told you that ''all you had to do was create [[:Category:Bantu peoples]]'', yet here you are perpetuating this discussion by attacking me for my actions in moving non-individual-bio articles from [[:Category:Bantu people]] to [[:Category Bantu]] as they didn't belong in [[:Category:Bantu people]].  ''Go ahead and make the category''; your original proposal to "merge" [[:Category:Bantu]] was off-base and has no purpose at all; it's fine as it is and there was ''nothing'' stopping you from solving the situation by creating [[:Category:Bantu peoples]].  I'm starting to know/think that people prefer discussion pits than actually taking appropriate action already based in policy and existing precedents.  ''Make the category'' and be done with it. I'd have made it myself already if not for your complaint at me that nothing should be done while an open discussion is underway (which you chided me about moments after starting this discussion before I knew about it.  ''Make the category'', this CfD is a procedural waste of time...like so many.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 03:33, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::[[Wikipedia:Edit warring|Edit warring]] is still edit warring even if you think you are right (doesn't everyone?). Where did I originally propose to "'merge' [[:Category:Bantu]]" (whatever that means, and merge with what?)? I am not sure whether you are not paying attention or deliberately misunderstanding me in a [[straw man]] game, either way it's not helpful. As you are the only person to object here (even though you apparently did not know what you were objecting to) and have not withdrawn your objection, you are the only person holding up the process. Nothing can be done until this CFD is closed and you are holding that up.

*'''Support''' <s>Comment, possible support (depending).</s>  There are no individuals who would go in "Bantu people".  There may be other categories that would go there – say, individual Gikuyu people or some such.  If there are none, the cat could simply be renamed "Bantu peoples" and the bots would take care of the rest.  Articles should not be switched to "Bantu", as that is a broader category, consisting of Bantu languages, Bantu peoples, and various other things Bantu.  — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 00:01, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|User:Skookum1|User:Kwamikagami}} The following cats contain Bantu people (individuals) or subcats containing them. Having a [[:Category:Bantu people]] parent cat as well as an ethno parent cat (e.g. [[:Category:Xhosa]]) which is a subcat of [[:Category:Bantu peoples]] will make it easier to navigate them.
:[[:Category:Bakongo people]], [[:Category:Benga people]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Fang]] (probably should be renamed [[:Category:Fang people]]), [[:Category:Bubi]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Duala people]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Ganda people]], [[:Category:Kikuyu people]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Kota people]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Luba people]], [[:Category:Luhya people]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Meru people]], [[:Category:Mijikenda]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Ndwandwe people]], [[:Category:Northern Sotho people]], [[:Category:Ovambo people]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:Shangaan people]], [[:Category:Sotho people]] (mixed cat), [[:Category:South Ndebele people]], [[:Category:Tswana people]], [[:Category:Venda people]], [[:Category:Xhosa people]], [[:Category:Zulu people]].

:::"Easier to navigate" if they're split, similarly, into main cats and individual-people cats; otherwise as mixed cats they should be subcats of [[:Category:Bantu peoples]].  "People of the Fang people" are one consequence of using "FOO people" for ethno cat; most "mixed" cats don't have enough entries to warrant it; but if they remain mixed, not that other similar small cats for individuals, often very small, don't exist.  But if you insist that they should be in [[:Category:Bantu people]] because they have articles on individuals, the same is true for ''also'' being on [[:Category:Bantu peoples]] and/or [[:Category:Bantu]].  "[[:Category:People from Bantu groups[[" might be a better container subcat for them if there is no such thing, as Kwami maintains, as individual "Bantu people".[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 03:45, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
::::I agree the mixed cats should be split and I will do so in due course. It is not a small job which is probably why nobody has bothered to sort it out yet. [[User:HelenOnline|<font color="green">Helen</font>]][[User talk:HelenOnline|<font color="lime">Online</font>]] 09:13, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
