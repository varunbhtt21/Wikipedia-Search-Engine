[[Slavery]] is a system which requires workers to work against their will for little to no compensation. In modern-day terms, this practice is more widely referred to as human trafficking. [[Human trafficking]] is defined by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation”.<ref>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

==History==
In 1865, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was ended and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] took full effect, freeing the slaves in the formerly [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]]-held territory. Later that same year, the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] was passed, therefore officially outlawing the practice of slavery.<ref>Prologue: Pieces of History.

==Labor trafficking==
Labor trafficking is defined by the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Trafficking Victims Protection Act]] as The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, [[fraud]]  or coercion for the purpose of subjection to [[involuntary servitude]], [[peonage]], [[debt bondage]] or [[slavery]]<ref>FACT SHEET: LABOR TRAFFICKING (English). (n.d.). Retrieved April 24, 2014, from http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/fact-sheet-labor-trafficking-english</ref> and is most frequently reported in domestic work, restaurants, peddling rings, and sales crews.<ref>Human Trafficking Trends in the United States | Polaris Project | Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery. (n.d.). Retrieved April 23, 2014, from http://www.polarisproject.org/resources/hotline-statistics/human-trafficking-trends-in-the-united-states</ref>  With the influx of foreign nationals into the USA in the past decade, labor trafficking has become a central issue for human rights groups.

==Agriculture==
In the agriculture sector, the most common victims of trafficking are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, undocumented immigrants, and foreign nationals with temporary [[H-2A visa]]s.<ref>Labor Trafficking in Agriculture | Polaris Project | Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery. (n.d.).

Such exploitation may take the form of threats of violence and playing on vulnerabilities (i.e. immigration status).  In some cases, workers are held in a state of perpetual debt to the crew leaders who impose mandatory transportation, housing and communication fees upon the workers which are high in relation to pay received, therefore further indebting the worker.  Crew leaders may also provide workers with [[H-2A visa]]s and transportation to the place of work from a home country.

In 2010, the company Global Horizons was indicted on charges of trafficking more than 400 Thai workers through a program of [[bonded labor]]. Charges were ultimately dropped in 2012.<ref>EEOC Files Its Largest Farm Worker Human Trafficking Suit Against Global Horizons, Farms. (n.d.).

==Domestic work==
Domestic workers perform duties such as cleaning, cooking and childcare in their employers home.  Domestic workers are commonly US citizens, undocumented workers or foreign nationals most commonly holding one of the following visa types: [[Visa policy of the United States#A-1, A-2, and A-3|A-3]], G-5, NATO-7 or B-1<ref>Domestic Work | Polaris Project | Combating Human Trafficking and Modern-day Slavery.

Similar means of control to Agricultural Work are common.  Additionally, a lack of legislation regarding the duties and protection of these workers facilitates their exploitation.  Employers commonly use the workers lack of knowledge of the language or legal system as a means of control and intimidation. This is also commonly paired with various forms of abuse and/or passport revocation.  Many domestic workers are brought to the United States on a promise of a better life or an education.<ref>Women's Rights. (n.d.).

==Trafficking hubs==
[[Human trafficking in California|California]], Florida, New York, Nevada, Ohio and [[Human trafficking in Texas|Texas]] are main hubs of human trafficking in the United States because of their “proximity to international borders, number of ports and airports, significant immigrant population, and large economy that includes industries that attract forced labor”.<ref>Key Stats.

==Consequences==

===Health impacts===
Trafficked workers often face permanent physical and psychological damage as a result of their ordeal such as [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|PTSD]] and other health problems.  Child workers face especially
serious consequences which may include a lack of education, [[literacy|illiteracy]] and stunted growth.<ref>The Facts About Human Trafficking For Forced Labor. (n.d.). Retrieved April 24, 2014, from http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/tip/rls/fs/08/108287.htm</ref>

===Economic impacts===
Although the surface economic impact of labor trafficking can be seen as positive due to the cheap labor and a subsequent drop in the price of products, the negative economic impacts are significant.<ref>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. (n.d.). Retrieved April 24, 2014, from http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/An_Introduction_to_Human_Trafficking_-_Background_Paper.pdf</ref>  The unseen costs of labor trafficking can include resources dedicated to its prevention, treatment of victims and apprehension of perpetrators.  This type of trafficking also diverts earnings from workers and their families to employers.  However, labor trafficking continues to be a primary source of income for criminal networks.<ref>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. (n.d.).

==Sex slavery==
{{See also|Sex trafficking in the United States}}

===History of sex slavery===
The age-old issue of sex slavery became a political issue in the early 1900s, which led to a couple of important actions taken by national and international governments.

====Mann Act====
In the early 1900s, the “White Slave Traffic” became prevalent. It involved the movement of young white girls who were kidnapped or tricked into being involved in some form of prostitution. The [[Mann Act]], passed in 1910, made it a felony to be involved in the transportation of white slaves or any person across state or international lines for prostitution or other immoral purposes.

====The Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others====
This is a resolution of the [[UN General Assembly]]. The Preamble states: "Whereas prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community"<ref>Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons.

===Contemporary sex slavery===

Despite regulations, the occurrence of sex slavery/trafficking has not shown a decline over recent years. Millions of women are kidnapped and transported around the world. Some are sold by their families for small amounts of money.

There are some common patterns for sex trafficking. In developing nations, many women and children are brought into trafficking through false promises of a job, an education, and a better lifestyle. Because there are few options in these developing nations, many women decide to take advantage of this opportunity.

Once these individuals are sold, arrangements are made for their departure where they are assigned an escort who will take them directly to their new employer. At this point it becomes dangerous to attempt an escape. There are also other situations in which women can fall into sex trafficking. Women can receive false marriage proposals from men who plan to sell them into bondage. There are also instances when young girls are sold into the sex trade by their parents who are trying to earn some money. Many times women are kidnapped.

Sex trafficking frequently results in [[debt bondage]]. This involves the women and children being held by their employer until they earn enough money to repay the employer for the expenses he paid to acquire them. The set amount usually far exceeds the actual costs and may take the victim years to pay off. Even then, it is common for the woman or child to be forced to continue working or for their employer to sell them back into debt bondage and back into a system from which they cannot escape.
