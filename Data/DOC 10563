::::Thank you, [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]]. I cannot see a reason for two categories and think there should be one called simply, '''[[:Category:Sinn Féin politicians]]''', without the word "Irish" in the title. Any proposed subset of Sinn Féin politicians should be a subcategory of that, if someone could identify a need for one, such as [[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]]'s desire for one for 1905{{nbhyph}}1926. As to that, would we then also need one for 1927{{nbhyph}}1968, and for 1969{{nbhyph}}present? Why bother dividing them like that? There aren't many of them, so the group is not unwieldy. Regardless, I cannot think of any reason why the word "Irish" should appear in any such Sinn Féin category names. The category under discussion should be '''merged''' into [[:Category:Sinn Féin politicians]], '''or renamed''' as suggested and made a subcategory of it.

*'''Agree''' it should be changed. '''Unsure''' about the proposed cat name and contents for two reasons: one, the conventional cut-off is 1922 – Sinn Féin in the years 1922-1926 is essentially Fianna Fáil plus the post-1926 rump Sinn Féin; two, the other cat gives the impression of being post-1970 only, which may leave us with a significant number of uncategorised Sinn Féin politicians.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 22:41, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''merge to {{cl|Sinn Féin politicians}}''' otherwise you will have an arbitrary cutoff, which is best avoided. --[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 14:31, 27 May 2014 (UTC)
**'''Reply'''. {{ping|Obiwankenobi}} The cut-off is ''not'' arbitrary, and the comment suggests that you didn't bother checking the history before commenting (see [[Sinn Féin#Pre-1970]]). <br />In summary, the party split twice in the 1920s, first in April 1923 when the pro-Treaty majority of deputies left to form [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].  It split again in 1926, when the majority of deputies left with deValera to form [[Fianna Fáil]].<br />In [[Irish general election, 1921|1921]] Sinn Féin candidates won 124 out of 128 seats in the Dail. After the 1923 split, they won 44 out of 153 seats at the [[Irish general election, 1923|1923 election]].  After the 1926 split, they won 5 out of 153 seats at the [[Irish general election, June 1927|June 1927 election]], and were wiped out in [[Irish general election, September 1927|September 1927]].<br />In other words, the 1926 split marks the point at which SF made the second of 2 big steps from being absolutely dominant party of Irish politics to being an electoral irrelevancy for 4 decades. A court case in the 1940s ruled that the SF party then in existence was not the legal successor of the pre-1922 party.  So ... far from being an arbitrary cut-off, the 1926 cut-off in the existing category is a [[WP:DEFINING]] characteristic of those so categorised. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 11:23, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
***{{U|BrownHairedGirl}}, You linked to [[Irish general election, 1923]], but the name Sinn Féin does not appear in that article at all. The 44 "Republican" TDs elected were, if not identical, as near as makes no difference to the 44 Fianna Fáil TDs who were elected in 1927. I'll bet my bottom dollar that there is nobody in [[:Category:Irish Sinn Féin politicians]] who joined the party after 1922 that is not in [[:Category:Fianna Fáil politicians]]. So the cat, if it is to be retained, should only be for people who were in Sinn Féin in or before 1922. The court case of the 1940s, that you cite, held that 1922 was the date that the Sinn Féin of the War of Independence ceased to exist.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 16:40, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
****You make a very good case for selecting 1922 as the cut-off date, and I will not oppose that change. However, my main concern here is that whatever we do does not lump the 1918-22 SF politicians with those of more recent decades.   There is a ongoing political and historical dispute about the degree of continuity, and keeping the two categories separate but linked allows readers to form their own view on the degree of continuity.<br />There were several decades in which no SF TDs were elected to the Dail, and that provides a logical break in the category. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 16:51, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
*****I suggest renaming it [[:Category:Early Sinn Féin politicians]] and changing the header to "''This category contains politicians who were members of the original [[Sinn Féin]] party in the early 20th century (pre-1922).''"

*'''Rename''' per nom. This is clearly a distinct and different group than the present party. The Republicans in the United States in 1804 are not the modern party, while the Republicans of 1860, while having many different views than those of today, are clearly the same political party. Just because groups use the same name does not mean they are the same, and in this case there is a clear and distinct break between the past organization and the present one. Same name does not mean same organization.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 15:27, 2 July 2014 (UTC)
