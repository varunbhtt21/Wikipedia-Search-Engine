:: '''Comment'''. I would say, personally, that gender is only a defining characteristic to be subcategorized separately, if there have been serious discussions about gender for this category, or if the distribution between the two genders is very skewed.

*'''Comment'''. If we had categories for "Individual men" etc then category intersection ([[WP:CATSCAN]]) could generate a list of articles about Indian male presenters etc. Has this ever been seriously considered? Otherwise, we're going to continually be having these discussions at CFD. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 11:43, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Newly created category, I have no idea what the inclusion criteria are supposed to be - this could be potentially infinite depending on our interpretation, since we have thousands of articles about things on the web. A lot of things are "contents of websites". Seems a bit of a hodgepodge for now, so I think we should just delete. [[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 23:18, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' [[:Category:Contents of websites]] - This category is useful for articles that are about contents of websites. For example there is an article about [[Youtube]], but the article [[List of most viewed YouTube videos]] is also exist, this article is not a website article, but this is about a content of website article.[[User:DZTREQWS|DZTREQWS]] ([[User talk:DZTREQWS|talk]]) 06:39, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. I think I see what the category creator is getting at (trying to separate the topic of YouTube itself from the topic of YouTube content), but IMO this isn't a useful/workable division. [[List of most viewed YouTube videos]] is categorized under YouTube and under lists and that's sufficient. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 11:49, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

There may have been many organizations that opposed women's suffrage but this wasn't defining for them - however being a member of the anti-suffragist movement was (indeed, most of these organizations in the category had a sole purpose which was to rally against suffrage.). better to use the term of art used at that time - which is anti-suffragism - instead of the more wishy-washy "opposed".

:* '''Propose merging''' [[:Category:Christianity under the Roman Empire]] to [[:Category:Ancient Christianity]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' The two categories overlap almost entirely, because Ancient Christianity existed almost entirely within the Roman Empire. A more distinct subcategory within Ancient Christiantiy would be: Christianity ''outside'' the Roman Empire (though there's few articles that would fit in this subcategory). [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:11, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
:* Alternative proposal: upmerge [[:Category:Christianity under the Roman Empire]] to [[:Category:Christianity and the Greco-Roman world]]. Rationale: the few remaining articles in [[:Category:Christianity under the Roman Empire]] happen to fit well with the articles in [[:Category:Christianity and the Greco-Roman world]]. That's merely coincidental, I guess, but anyway... [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:35, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment'''—it can't be upmerged because Ancient Christianity isn't an immediate parent. Also [[:Category:Ancient Christianity]] has a broader coverage than the Roman Empire. As you point out in your rationale the two are not synonymous and we have to allow somewhere in the structure for articles on Thomistic Christianity, which was well outside the bounds of the Empire. I'm more inclined to agree with the alternative proposal and wonder why the Greco-Roman world category was diffused to such a degree. [[User:Beeswaxcandle|Beeswaxcandle]] ([[User talk:Beeswaxcandle|talk]]) 09:45, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
:: Just to make clear, I'm not at all against having subcategories Thomistic, Armenian etc. Christianity within Ancient Christianity, on the contrary! The point is, exactly, that we should have distinct subcategories instead of subcategories that overlap largely with the (grand)parent.
:: On the side, I removed 'up' in upmerging, as it concerns a grandparent/grandchild relationship. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 14:17, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' It is part of a category structure that embraces all religions in the Empire: pagans, Jews, Christians. It is a useful sub-division within the Category:Ancient Christianity although I would support the creation of Category:Ancient Christianity outside the Roman Empire. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 20:39, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Not all ancient Christianity occurred in the Roman Empire. For example, there is a tradition of early Christianity in India which was not part of the Roman Empire. <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 22:02, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
** '''Comment''' on both: I'm not at all against having a subcategory outside the Roman Empire, or separate categories on Thomistic, Armenian etc Christianity, on the contrary! But the mere existence of an inside Roman Empire category would suggest that 99% of the Ancient Christianity articles ought to be classified as Christianity under the Roman Empire category as well (or instead?). Hopefully you agree that it doesn't make sense to have two categories that are 99% overlapping. Especially so because there's already a pretty complex category tree under Ancient Christianity, it wouldn't be very meaningful to replicate all that in Christianity under the Roman Empire. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 14:06, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

<strike><small>'''Solution'''?
# Execute my 'alternative proposal' above, so move the current articles in [[:Category:Christianity under the Roman Empire]] to [[:Category:Christianity and the Greco-Roman world]]. Christianity under the Roman Empire will then no longer have immediate articles.
# Redefine Christianity under the Roman Empire to become an immediate child of Ancient Christianity.
# Redefine the current child cats of Ancient Christianity to become child cats of Christianity under the Roman Empire instead. So for the time being the category Christianity under the Roman Empire will be the only content of Ancient Christianity.
# Anyone in the future who has articles of Ancient Christianity outside the Roman empire is free either to post the articles directly in Ancient Christianity, or to create a new subcategory in Ancient Christianity for that purpose.

How about this? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 12:03, 31 May 2014 (UTC)</small>

'''Comment''' I thought we might reach a consensus more easily by the above solution. But the solution has also a important disadvantage, namely how would we deal with issues in Christian history that are mainly about the Roman Empire part of Christianity, but not entirely so? Many issues of the Christian church in the Roman Empire in the 4th and 5th century also affected Christians in e.g. Armenia and Persia. Maybe we'd better forget about this compromise and simply discuss the merger again. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 07:13, 1 June 2014 (UTC)</strike>

*'''Oppose''' getting rid of this category. I do not pay much attention to categories, maybe I don't understand how they are supposed to work, but I see nothing wrong with a category do with the ''relationship'' between the "pagan" authorities of the Roman empire and the early church. There are not many articles in this category, I wrote one of them and re-wrote others, they are almost all on my watch list and I would '''strongly oppose''' them being put into a category "Ancient Christianity", that is not what they are about.[[User:Smeat75|Smeat75]] ([[User talk:Smeat75|talk]]) 04:35, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
:: Two questions. Could you give an example of such an article? Could you comment on my earlier statement that Ancient Christianity and Christianity in the Roman Empire are 99% overlapping? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 19:45, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
:::What about [[History_of_late_ancient_Christianity#Outside_the_Roman_Empire]]?--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 20:01, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
::::Dear Obiwankenobi, thanks for your answer. You're giving an example of the opposite, since this belongs to the other 1% (the non-overlapping part). About that, I repeat what I've said before: I'm not at all against having a subcategory outside the Roman Empire, or separate subcategories on Thomistic, Armenian etc Christianity, under Ancient Christianity, on the contrary! I'm only contesting the need for a subcategory ''inside'' the Roman Empire. Theoretically, nearly all articles under Ancient Christianity, including its complex categorization tree under it, could be duplicated to Christianity under the Roman Empire. But it would merely be duplication, not adding anything new. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:03, 4 June 2014 (UTC)
::::::'''Answer''' to [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] above. If you look at the articles in the category, you will see three articles about persecution of the early church by the Roman empire. I wrote one of them and re-wrote another and they are not about "Ancient Christianity". They are about "why did the Romans persecute early Christians, why did they think they were a threat, how much do we know about what exactly happened and how much of it is legend?" Then there are articles about the earliest references to Christians or Christ by "pagan" Roman writers, the provincial governor Pliny the Younger asking the emperor Trajan how to deal with Christians and the emperor's reply, the Roman senator Tacitus on Christian origins in his "Annals" and a couple of mentions in Suetonius. Once again, these articles are not about "Ancient Christianity", they are about Romans and Christians and how they conflicted. I can see why you say "early Christianity was only in the Roman empire so the category is redundant" and I am not saying I don't want it to be changed to something else, maybe "The pagan Roman empire and the early church" or something like that, but it would not be right to say those articles are about "ancient Christianity", the category name has to have "Roman empire" in it, they are at least as much to do with Roman history and Roman officialdom's attitude to early Christians as they are with Christianity.[[User:Smeat75|Smeat75]] ([[User talk:Smeat75|talk]]) 01:27, 5 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Thanks for your answer, your point is clear. I would take it as you're saying that my alternative proposal, to merge [[:Category:Christianity under the Roman Empire]] and [[:Category:Christianity and the Greco-Roman world]], is a more appropriate merge than the one I suggested at first. Earlier on in the discussion, Beeswaxcandle had this same opinion. 

It seems like we have reached '''consensus''' on merging [[:Category:Christianity under the Roman Empire]] and [[:Category:Christianity and the Greco-Roman world]] while the further discussion is about the right name of the merged category. ''**This has been added afterwards as an editorial remark.'' [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 19:26, 5 June 2014 (UTC)

:::::::A question for a merge like that is what would be a better name, 'Christianity and the Greco-Roman world' or 'Christianity and the Roman Empire'. I don't have a firm opinion about either Greco-Roman world or Roman Empire, to be honest. But I would say that the conjunction 'and' in the category name is more consistent with category naming conventions than 'under', also because 'and' suggests it's about the relationship between two worlds (which is what you mean) while 'under' suggests it's about Christianity in itself in a certain time and place (which is the same as Ancient Christianity). [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 06:14, 5 June 2014 (UTC)

:How about "Christianity and the pagan Roman empire"? because of course eventually the Roman empire adopted Christianity as the state religion and these articles do not deal with that era.[[User:Smeat75|Smeat75]] ([[User talk:Smeat75|talk]]) 12:30, 5 June 2014 (UTC)
::Generally I'd say the shorter category name the better. Adding an adjective may lead to unnecessary confusion, like in this case: is it only about Christianity and the pagan religion, or is it also about Christianity and the Roman government? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 19:26, 5 June 2014 (UTC)
:::I have no objection to the category being re-named "Christianity and the Roman Empire".[[User:Smeat75|Smeat75]] ([[User talk:Smeat75|talk]]) 20:54, 5 June 2014 (UTC)

It seems like we have reached '''consensus''' on merging [[:Category:Christianity under the Roman Empire]] into [[:Category:Christianity and the Greco-Roman world]] and renaming it into [[:Category:Christianity <b>and</b> the Roman Empire]]. Just a procedural question, should I post a rename request separately, or is this discussion sufficient? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 08:38, 6 June 2014 (UTC)

::: I didn't nominate this one, but in general I would delete all "hall of fame" awards.  By their very nature and definition, they are recognizing famous & notable people / things.  Those famous / notable people & things are notable for the things they accomplished -- ''not'' for winning the Hall of Fame awards. Sometimes awards might establish or create notability (like the Nobel); other times they simply recognize already gained notability. Hall of Fame awards basically define themselves as recognizing already gained notability, and so I think they're category cruft. --[[User:Lquilter|Lquilter]] ([[User talk:Lquilter|talk]]) 20:05, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' -- [[Wikipedia:Overcategorization#Award recipients]] appears to be the guideline that governs this nomination. It says: "... recipients of an award should be grouped in a list rather than a category when receiving the award is not a defining characteristic." I believe this award is very clearly a defining characteristic of the subjects categorized by it. These "creative professionals" depend on [[Wikipedia:ARTIST]] to demonstrate their own notability and rightful inclusion in Wikipedia. The criterion says that notability exists when the subject "is represented within the permanent collections of several notable galleries or museums"; making it a defining characteristic of their very notability! Categorizing subjects by such notable criteria increases accessibility of the content itself and strengthens the notability of its member articles in a clear and efficient manner which a back-link to a list article can not do.

*'''Comment''' it is worthy to note that the "American" designation is merely a geographic connotation of the hall's physical location and not a citizenship requirement of the inductees.

::It is interesting that you would post this just as I was about to begin adding links that belie your assertion, and it is interesting that the very first example which I randomly choose does so rather succinctly. [[Wikipedia:DEFINING]] says: "if the characteristic would not be appropriate to mention in the lead portion of an article, it is probably not defining." Notice the lead paragraph of two articles that "blah blah blah" were not written by such enlightened Wikipedians as "blah blah blah" you.—Erich Kunzel[http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/2390/40/],[http://cincinnatipops.org/Content.php?id=108]—Elliott Carter[http://elliottcarter.com/biography.html] I'll add more artists who are defined by this, until it becomes abundantly clear that no one gives a Funkadelic anyway.[[User:Anne F.

::: The fact that there are two people who have it in their ledes does not mean that it is "defining" in general. Consider the Nobel Award, which is the classic example; pretty much everyone who wins it is introduced in speeches and in writing and in discussion as "X, a Nobel Award winner".  Now consider, say, being given a local award for being the community's Big Brother/Sister of the Year; winners would be introduced that way in certain contexts, but not generally, and while some winners might hold this award dearest and be introduced that way, it wouldn't make the award "defining" for other winners.  A national HOF in a major industry is somewhere between those two poles. But for any award we can look at the awardees, and see if they are generally "defined by" winning this award. HOFs are rarely if ever going to meet that standard, because the awardees were ''already famous'' for their other contributions, and the HOF designation recognizes existing notability/fame. This is especially true for HOFs that are posthumous, as many of them are. --[[User:Lquilter|Lquilter]] ([[User talk:Lquilter|talk]]) 13:35, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
:::: I do understand your position; and respectfully disagree. Soon, I will begin an RfC to discuss the "defining" clause which I unequivocally believe is misleading. The example of "lead worthy inclusion" is being misinterpreted; unto misapplication.

:::: A person is defined by the "sum of their parts", not the "summary of their parts", and a thing that would be appropriate for mentioning in the lead should not be juxtaposed to mean "must in fact be mentioned". The lead is a summary, therefor it is impossible to suggest it is also the "all inclusive repository of a subjects defining characteristics".

:::: For example: the lead might say "... subject A is nationally acclaimed, and internationally recognized for his work, having won 5 Grammy awards, including Best Classical Album, and the Nobel Peace Prize for something he did." Other "defining awards" are included in that summary, and do not become less "defining" because "creative editorial discretion" chose not to list them in "lead mention". If the "editors discretion" had instead "appropriately chosen" to say: "... subject A is an internationally recognized MacArthur Fellow and Kyoto Prize Laureate". The configuration of the second example does not cause his Grammies or Nobel Prize to become "non-defining".

:::: The "rigid interpretation" of [[Wikipedia:DEFINING]] that has come to mean "must be stated in the lead" is ''plain wrong''. And: "is not mentioned in the lead" does not translate to mean "would not be appropriate to mention in the lead", yet these are the very standards being enforced. Something has gone terribly awry, and good, hard, collaborative work is being "trampled". The situation "must be corrected"! I will be dedicating my focus, from here, on seeing to it.

:::: It would be great to begin making amends right now, by correcting the unfounded decry of deletion, and suggesting we '''keep''' this category instead. Or at the very least, demonstrate a valid reason for why it should be deleted.--[[User:Anne F. Figy|Anne F. Figy]] ([[User talk:Anne F. Figy#top|talk]]) 22:54, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

I might suggest that your RFC would have a greater likelihood of success if you spent some time at CFD becoming familiar with the various issues that we run into, that have led to the policies with which you disagree.

As for valid reasons why this category should be deleted, I'm comfortable standing by deletion, based on (a) the point that these categories are in no way defining of many of their members; and (b) even if I accept (solely for the sake of argument) that the category is defining for ''some'' of its members, it would be too hard to police a category that has a definitively membership criteria but only a subjective "defining" criteria.  --[[User:Lquilter|Lquilter]] ([[User talk:Lquilter|talk]]) 00:33, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::Enthusiasm is a descriptive anachronism when related to my current contributions. My enthusiasm was vanquished by this discussion; throughly eradicated. I am defending this category because I am defending the prospect of me being a useful editor here. And when I am throughly defeated, article coverage of classical music will revert to its condition prior to my arrival, as if I hadn't come at all. If I should then depart, exhausted from the thankless task, this record will be all that remains; as the sole testament that I even tried. 

::::::No, this is not enthusiasm at all, this is manic desperation; an obligatory penance for having come, and proof, in perpetuity, that I did. In parting, I'll leave you with some statistical truths of the research I've done. 

::::::There are 128 inductees in the American Classical Music Hall of Fame. All 128 inductees have a Wikipedia article and all 128 are now members of this category. As a result, Google now returns all of the 128 articles when "American Classical Music Hall of Fame" is searched. When this category is deleted, only 17 articles will return for the same configured search. 

::::::It belies reason that anyone professing to build this encyclopedia should call this appropriate; hampering the dissemination of our own content. It does not matter '''''at all''', in terms of search-ability'', that all 128 articles are on the list article. Their presence on that list does '''absolutely nothing''' to affect the search index, or enhance the return of results. Unless our reader happens to find the list article, '''they will not find the content related to such a targeted search'''. 

::::::This is exactly why [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates]] says; precisely: <blockquote>''the "category camp" should not delete or dismantle Wikipedia's lists, and the "list camp" shouldn't tear down Wikipedia's category system—'''doing so wastes valuable resources.''''' (my emphasis). It also says: ''It is neither improper nor uncommon to simultaneously have a category, a list, and a navigation template which all cover the same topic. These redundant systems of organizing information are considered to be complementary, not inappropriately duplicative. Furthermore, arguing that a category duplicates a list (or vice versa) at a deletion discussion is not a valid reason for deletion and should be avoided.''</blockquote> That advice appears to have been wasted on me; literally. For I did believe I'd done a useful thing; manipulating the search index through categorization to make it return 100% of our content, associated with ACMHoF inductees, instead of 13%; which it did, and apparently will again. 

::::::Lastly, if this is such an inappropriate category, why has it not been removed from any of the '''heavily watched articles''' where it was added; '''not one'''? It is not because of a phantom anomaly; that no one noticed the added category. Check the page view statistics and observe the traffic spikes right after I added the category. Some of it is undoubtedly the page's watchers, making sure I wasn't messing up the article. Also observe the increased daily average of views with the category in place; doing what categories do to increase article accessibility.

::::::Who, of you here, will boldly go to an article and remove the category their self; risking a reversion from those same page watchers? And who, of you here, will be proud after seeing a reduction in traffic, that will occur, after the article is made less accessible? 

::::::How about [[Georg Solti]] for example; it has 72 watchers, spiked 20 views when the category was added, and settled to an average of 40 more views per day than before the categorization. Or try [[Jessye Norman]]'s 37 watchers; it spiked 25 views when the category was added and now averages 50 more views each day than it did previously. Or use your own example; [[George Gershwin]] with 145 dedicated watchers; spiked 100 views when added, now averaging 110 additional views per day. I could do this for 125 more articles, but strongly suspect it won't even be read, and am nearly certain that it wouldn't sway the entrenched opposition even if it was.    

::::::If you do remove the category, ensure your edit summary says that it doesn't belong as a categorized attribute of the subject. I promise you this: if you were to remove it from all 128 articles, you won't be saying; as I do: not once were you reverted. And you won't be talking, only to me; anymore, about the category's usefulness. Prove me wrong on this, and I'll voluntarily push the delete button myself. Peace; out.--[[User:Anne F. Figy|Anne F.

*'''Question''' - I guess I am a little confused here. Is this hall of fame less prestigious in its field than the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], for which we do have a category for inductees? [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 06:38, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
::It would be disingenuous for anyone to suggest such a thing. Not only does the "CHOF" house and maintain the permanent display of classical music's history and the artifacts of its prestiges cadre of inductees, as the "RHOF" does for its genre, but the CHOF is also graced with a "National Artistic Council" and a "Professional Organization Advisory Council",[http://books.google.com/books?id=_x7_3e7H-xcC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=George+Gershwin+american+classical+music+hall+of+fame&source=bl&ots=VsUMuRT-bM&sig=BaoFXRMQ7VHtNaBD20BhkAJQb8w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L--GU8muKseHyASEzYKACA&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=George%20Gershwin%20american%20classical%20music%20hall%20of%20fame&f=false] which the "RHOF" is not.

::The assertion is that the CHOF inductees are so "famous" for their "amassed prestige" that CHOF induction is merely an inconsequential blip in the stream of their life. And that only a rambling fool would think a prominent mention of it was proper. Conversely, the implications are that rock artists are so much less refined that they would be likely to define RHOF induction as a "defining pinnacle". 

::Of course it's "hogwash"; for it elevates [[Wikipedia:DEFINING]] to a superseding role which it does not rightfully function as. And it completely disenfranchises the reader; who doesn't know that we've determined they will not foolishly search for content by a ridiculous characteristic like CHOF induction. And if they do, well they deserve to be hampered from reaching their target. The suggestions will carry the day, as they mock [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates]]; leaving it barely recognizable in open discussion. Some categories should be deleted, this is not one, but it will be.--[[User:Anne F. Figy|Anne F. Figy]] ([[User talk:Anne F. Figy#top|talk]]) 09:57, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

::: I don't think you need to infer a lot of commentary about rambling fools etc.  I think instead it's simply that most of us who work with categories recognize that the vast, vast number of awards do not ''confer'' notability, but recognize it, and are therefore not defining; but this is admittedly an imperfect process, and some kinds of things develop fandoms that make them hard to work with in a rational and consistent way. In other words, I personally would delete the R&R HOF; but I haven't taken it to CFD because I don't have the bandwidth right now to handle it. If this category gets deleted, do feel free to nominate the R&R HOF for deletion on the grounds of consistency; I'll be happy to support. 

::: As for your comments about search etc., the problem is that categories are not really as useful for search as you might think. Search produces a category page, but the items that are within that category are only visible when you click on that category. It's best to think of categories as a navigation tree, and one that functions only when very carefully pruned. To move away from the metaphor, one problem with categories is that they are very difficult to police -- you can't "watch" a category to make sure items stay in it or don't get put in it incorrectly; you can only watch the actual subject pages. From this feature flows a lot of the rules about why we are parsimonious with categories, and apply a strict "defining" standard. It's stricter than "notability", and it's a lot stricter than simply putting content in an article. I'd be happy to discuss this background with you off-discussion if you like, to avoid taking this particular discussion too off-topic.

*'''Delete'''—Given that the award was first given in 1988, the notability of people like [[Lowell Mason]], [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]] is not conferred by the award. All three died long before the award had been thought of. In all three articles there is no mention anywhere of the award.

::You are confusing a potentially reasonable rationale for removing a category from an article with an imagined mandate to delete the category.

::::I can assure you that I am neither confused nor infallible. (Nor do I believe that I have a mandate for deletion.) I would ask you to moderate your argumentative tone and start to apply the principles of [[WP:AGF]]. I can understand that, having created the category, you have strong views on this category, but those views do not justify the tone you have taken against several editors. I would also remind you that by "submitting your ideas to Wikipedia, you allow others to challenge and develop them" (quoted from [[WP:OWN]]).<p>Now, with respect to your argument that some of the category members can stay and others should be removed: for an award category to be useful it has to be applied to all recipients on whom we have articles. Removing the three composers I used as examples (they were just the first three I clicked on at random) would not be true to the purpose of the category. At the same time, none of them are ''defined'' by being inducted into this particular hall of fame. So we're stuck unless there's a different mechanism of collecting the inductees together. Fortunately, there are other possibilities to using a category, such as a list or a nav-box. [[User:Beeswaxcandle|Beeswaxcandle]] ([[User talk:Beeswaxcandle|talk]]) 07:23, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

:::My sense is that WP:DEFINING is sometimes applied at an individual article level, like for {{cl|Restaurant staff}} - some people are notable for having been waiters, and many others who were waiters are not DEFINED by this so the category isn't added. however, other times DEFINING is applied at a category level, meaning that once the category is accepted, everyone who fits the criterion is added. For example, if we decide {{cl|American novelists}} is a defining category of some large proportion of the potential members, everyone who is known as a novelist gets added, as long as it's defining for them. OTOH, {{cl|American women novelists}} is populated with 100% of women + american novelists - in other words, there isn't an additional article-level DEFINING test applied to see if you being a woman + being a novelist is defining, and if 99% of sources simply say "Julie is an american novelist" without mentioning your gender, you will still be added to the category. I feel like awards categories are similar - once the award category is accepted, it is added to ALL people who have received that award. As such, the bar to keep such a category is whether it would be DEFINING of the majority of the members.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 14:22, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I've obviously been all over the map on this today, and I apologize. I spent some more time researching whether I could find a single reliable source, an example of notable coverage, of international conductor Zubin Mehta being added to this Hall of Fame, and the answer is no. Now, I realize that Google News Archive search ain't what it used to be, but if this is a truly distinguishing top-level award, as claimed, there should be ''something''. A Gsearch, Gnews and Gbook search for the terms "Zubin Mehta" and "Hall of Fame" yields better results for other regional Halls of Fame, unrelated terms -- but really nothing for this Hall. An award that truly meets [[WP:OC#AWARD]] would not have this problem -- even for someone of Mehta's stature, it would garner significant mentions.

I am requesting comment from the widest possible cross-section of Wikipedia's editing community to determine if the programed elimination of Wikipedia's "Hall of Fame" categorization scheme is the genuine desired outcome that a consensus of thoughtful editors agree to assent. Currently there is polar disagreement where one pole states a belief that consensus already exists, and guidelines already "clearly define" an affirmation of the former question, and the other pole does not believe that consensus already exists, nor that existing guidelines define any such affirmation; challenging the prose as ambiguous The core guidelines this request seeks comment on are: [[Wikipedia:Overcategorization#Award recipients]] and [[Wikipedia:Overcategorization#Non-defining characteristics]].

!Voting to '''Delete''' or '''Keep''' the specific category being discussed is not required, nor is it disallowed.
