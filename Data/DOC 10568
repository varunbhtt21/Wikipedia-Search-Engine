::'''Weak oppose:''' It is not entirely true that the term "terrorist" is not used; refer to some of the articles in this category, e.g. [[Red Army Faction]]. I originally started creating two separate categories for "paramilitary organisations" and "terrorists" but on reflection merged them. The reason for using both the terms in the category name is that each does not automatically apply to all members. "Paramilitary" implies an organisation built to some extent on military lines with all that goes with it; "terrorist" by contrast has slightly different connotations. I suspect that the Red Army Faction would probably have considered itself to be terrorist rather than paramilitary and would not object to the term. However, it is perhaps a distinction without a difference which is why, although I would keep the title as I created it, I wouldn't fight hard if the general feeling was otherwise. --[[User:The Sage of Stamford|The Sage of Stamford]] ([[User talk:The Sage of Stamford|talk]]) 22:04, 30 May 2014 (UTC)
:::to date there has been fairly strong consensus that terrorist (unadorned) should not be used in category names. We do have cats like 'orgs designated as terrorist by govt x' but that's a different meaning.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 22:32, 30 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Split''' not all terrorist organizations are paramilitary. Not all paramilitary organizations are terrorist. [[:Category:Members of paramilitary organizations]] , [[:Category:Members of terrorist organizations]] and subcategory [[:Category:Members of paramilitary terrorist organizations]] are what should exist. Additionally, we should not confuse terrorist (political) with pirate (financial).

:''The result of the discussion was:''  '''do not rename'''. [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] <sup>[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]</sup> 04:31, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
:* '''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Townsville]] to [[:Category:Townsville, Queensland]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Rename'''. Note sure here, but it is somewhat confusing.  The introduction says this is the category for [[Townsville]] and the [[City of Townsville]].  However there is [[:Category:City of Townsville]] which kind of shows that the description is inaccurate at best and simply wrong at worst. The commons category is at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Townsville,_Queensland Townsville, Queensland].  Subcategories here both use and don't use the ', Queensland' in their names.  Also there is [[Townsville (disambiguation)]] which shows that this is a reasonably well used place name making clarify without ambiguity in the category name important. This category was created as a result of a speedy move request.  [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 19:09, 30 May 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment'''. Not sure how the rest of the world works, but in Australia, there are generally three common uses of the name of any city. 1. There is the historic centre of the city (usually its central business district), which will be a gazetted [[suburbs and localities (Australia)|suburb]]. 2. There is the contiguous urban metropolis that generally radiates out from that centre. 3. There is the local government area, which is typically bigger than than central business district but smaller than the full extent of the urban sprawl. The term "the city" or the "town" is overloaded in the same three ways. In everyday speech, context usually disambiguates which one we mean. In Wikipedia, we generally end up with three articles for these three distinct purposes, although the naming of those three articles is somewhat inconsistent. For example, for Townsville, we have [[Townsville City, Queensland]] for the central suburb, [[Townsville]] for the metropolis and [[City of Townsville]] for the local government area. For Brisbane, we have [[Brisbane central business district]], [[Brisbane]], and [[City of Brisbane]]. Etc. Since we have these three meanings, we potentially have three categories for things "in" them. This is true for Brisbane where we have [[:Category:Brisbane]] and [[:Category:City of Brisbane]] and [[:Category:Brisbane central business district]] (which are subcats directly or indirectly of the first). So the presence of multiple categories for Australian cities is to be expected and generally occurs in both Wikipedia and Commons (although this does not yet seem to have happened in relation to Townsville on Commons which is using a single category for all three purposes). [[User:Kerry Raymond|Kerry]] ([[User talk:Kerry Raymond|talk]]) 22:50, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
:'''Weak oppose''': As to the specific issue of renaming that one particular category to disambiguate it with "Queensland", I don't really care what it's called but there's a cost to making the change for what appears to be no apparent benefit. It's the primary topic so doesn't need disambiguation. It sounds to me like the problem is that the category has a confusing introduction, in which case, maybe the simplest solution is just fix the introduction to be less confusing. I note there is one article currently in the non-existent [[:Category:Townsville, Queensland]] (why isn't it there currently a redirect to prevent this?). [[User:Kerry Raymond|Kerry]] ([[User talk:Kerry Raymond|talk]]) 22:50, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
::That one was added in changing updating categories.  It matches what is used in the article. It was this 'problem' that led to this discussion. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 15:58, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
:::OK, then the easiest way to solve the problem is change the category on that one article manually and then put a redirect in [[:Category:Townsville, Queensland]] to [[:Category:Townsville]] so that nobody will add to [[:Category:Townsville, Queensland]] ever again. The intro to [[:Category:Townsville]] probably still needs to be clarified wrt to its relationship to the [[:Category:City of Townsville]] too, probably along the same lines as the articles do. [[User:Kerry Raymond|Kerry]] ([[User talk:Kerry Raymond|talk]]) 01:38, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' The category and the article refer to the same topic, the metropolitan area. The confusion appears to relate to issues of Australian English as explained by Kerry above. -- [[User:Mattinbgn|Mattinbgn]] ([[User talk:Mattinbgn|talk]]) 00:20, 1 June 2014 (UTC)

:* '''Propose merging''' [[:Category:Teen writers]] to [[:Category:Child writers]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' No need to split out teenagers here, especially since we divide Child writers by nationality (thus, an American teen writer would be both a teen writer and an American child writer). Another option would be to merge and rename the category tree to be {{cl|Writers under 18}} or something similar, but that's a bit annoying. [[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 14:28, 30 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' the definition of minor varies by jurisdiction, and the choice of 18 is seemingly arbitrary, physical adolescence ends at 25. The age of majority in some jurisdictions it is 19, others 21, and it changed through history as well, such as traditional coming of age at 13 (barmitzvah). Instead we should define ages. Below 10; 10-14; 15-19; 20-25; Above 25. Use 5 year intervals, and as below 5 would be a very small category, combine it to all under 10. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 06:19, 1 June 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' per nom. The suggestion by the IP commenter that we need to make this even ''more'' subdivided by age is not the direction I would go. I think just having a general "child writers" divided by nationality is perfect category-wise.

:* '''Propose deleting''' {{Lc|North America Railway Hall of Fame inductees}}<br />
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Listify and delete'''. This is [[WP:OCAT|overcategorization]] by [[WP:AWARD|award]].  These railway stops are not notable for, much less defined by, their inclusion in a hall of fame (created in 1996).  They are notable, like all the railway stops in wikipedia, for their role in mass transit infrastructure, architectural prominence, etc. The hall of fame recognizes existing notability; it doesn't confer notability; and therefore the recognition doesn't "define" the stop.  In other words, these railway stops are going to be in wikipedia whether or not the hall of fame recognition exists.  It's perfectly appropriate to keep the HOF article, and to list the honorees on that page, and that's the better way to handle it.  (In fact, it's dangerous to keep the category, because we cannot automatically police erroneous inclusions into the category, and a category with relatively few watches will have fewer eyeballs to manually catch problematic inclusions.) ...
