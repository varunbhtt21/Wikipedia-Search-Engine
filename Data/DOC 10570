:''The result of the discussion was:''  '''do not rename'''. [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] <sup>[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]</sup> 23:59, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
:* '''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Diving (acrobatics)]] to [[:Category:Diving]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Main article for this category named simply [[Diving]] (about the sport of jumping or falling). I propose to rename category for consistency. Note, [[Underwater diving]] has own article and [[:Category:Underwater diving|own category]]. Otherwise we must rename the article to [[Diving (acrobatics)]], that is not good way, I think. [[User:Nickst|NickSt]] ([[User talk:Nickst|talk]]) 19:25, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per the previous discussions.  Diving is ambiguous and as others have pointed out, this may even not be the primary use.  Categories need to be unambiguous.  The fact that since the split and renames we have not had problems should be viewed as a good reason to not change back to the problematic naming. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 20:59, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
**If diving is ambiguous, then we must rename [[Diving]] to [[Diving (acrobatics)]] (acrobatics?) or [[Diving (sport)]] (better choice) or something else, and put disambig [[Dive#Sports]] into [[Diving]]'s place. Note, some time ago were similar problem, and article [[Team handball]] was renamed to [[Handball]], the primary place. Olympic sports are well known subjects, better then other uses. [[User:Nickst|NickSt]] ([[User talk:Nickst|talk]]) 21:36, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
***Renaming the article is an option.  Note that it is common to have an article at the based name and a disambiguated category name.  The issue is that there is no way to watch what is added to a category.  Even if that feature is added, it may not garner many watchers. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 17:24, 1 June 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - diving is indeed ambiguous and categories certainly need to be unambiguous. I'm not sure that Diving (acrobatics) is the best name but Diving (sport) is still ambiguous, as Sky diving and scuba diving are sports. [[User:Oculi|Oculi]] ([[User talk:Oculi|talk]]) 02:30, 1 June 2014 (UTC)

*'''Strong oppose''' exceedingly ambiguous. Categories are not articles, and acrobatic diving is not the totality of diving. This will require excessive maintenance and will garner alot of miscategorization without the disambiguator.  -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.126|65.94.171.126]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.126|talk]]) 06:01, 1 June 2014 (UTC)----

:* '''Propose downmerging''' [[:Category:Religion in the Roman Empire]] to [[:Category:Religions of the Greco-Roman world]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' These two categories apparently have a very similar purpose and nearly the same contents. Then you could choose between merging up or merging down. In that choice I do have a preference for keeping 'Religions of the Greco-Roman world' as the title of the category, because:
# it comprises Ancient Greek religion, which is very interrelated to Ancient Roman religion
# it comprises not only the Roman empire, but also the Roman republic. The religions in the republic were largely the same as in the empire (except of course for Christianity).[[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 12:49, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Rome was just 1 part of the Greco-Roman world. The Empire was just 1 point in time. The two are not co-extensive. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 18:42, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
: '''Comment''' So that's an extra reason to opt for the broader title, isn't it? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:48, 31 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Reply''' No. It means that they are two tree structures that are valid in themselves and so need not be merged. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 21:15, 1 June 2014 (UTC)

'''Change in content of the debated category page''' Laurel, I notice now that you changed a parent category of this page, after this discussion started. You made [[:Category:Ancient Roman religion]] the parent of [[:Category:Religion in the Roman Empire]]. That can't be right, can it? After all, Ancient Roman religion is just one of the religions in the Roman empire, so the parent-child category relationship should be the other way around. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 21:49, 31 May 2014 (UTC)

At second glance I notice that you even made it into a circular categorization. Which confirms that it can't be right. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 21:54, 31 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Additional reason for merging''': to undo the circular categorization that Laurel Lodged created yesterday. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 14:37, 1 June 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''' From the discussion above and on my talk page, it appears that the proposer has not grasped the categorical structure of Roman history. Here follows a short tutorial for his benefit: Roman history is usually dived into 3 eras (1) The [[Kingdom of Rome]]; (2) the [[Roman Republic]]; (3) The [[Roman Empire]]. All three are usually collectively known as [[Ancient Rome]] to differentiate it from the modern [[Papal States]] and [[Rome|city]]. So there is no circle involved. It's strictly hierarchical. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 21:22, 1 June 2014 (UTC)
:::Yes, there is a circle: [[:Category:Ancient Roman religion]] has become a great-grandchild category of itself, and so have [[:Category:Religion in the Roman Empire]] and [[:Category:Religions of the Greco-Roman world]].[[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:59, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
::::I have found and fixed the grandchild anomaly in [[:Category:Religions of the Greco-Roman world]]. I can find no similar anomaly in [[:Category:Ancient Roman religion]]. Perhaps you'd draw it out for me. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 21:46, 4 June 2014 (UTC)
:::::That's okay, if you break the circle at one place, the circle is broken for all three categories. However, a new problem arises: Ancient Roman Regligion no longer appears as one of the religions (child cats) of Religions of the Greco-Roman world or of Religions in the Roman Empire, while it should be a child cat because it was definitely one of the religions in that era. This remains a problem after you've turned the religion-within-era categorization upside down for just one pair of categories within the entire framework. Kind regards, [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 06:33, 5 June 2014 (UTC)
::::::I don't understand your last comments Marco. Ancient Roman Religion '''is''' a child of Religions of the Greco-Roman world. The category "Religions in the Roman Empire" does not exist. Getting back to the original point, what now are your arguments for continuing this proposal? [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 22:14, 5 June 2014 (UTC)

===== Recap =====
I may have seen it wrong yesterday, and yes, you're right, it's a good idea to recap. The current categorization is: 
* [[:Category:Religions of the Greco-Roman world]]
** Ancient Christianity
** Ancient Greek religion
** [[:Category:Ancient Roman religion]]
*** Religion in the Ancient Roman period
*** Religion in the Roman Empire
*** Religion in the Roman Republic
** Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire

For Ancient Roman religion I mentioned only 3 subcategories, because I'm perfectly fine with the 9 others. Basically, the 9 others are about the (one) Ancient Roman religion, as expected, while the three subcategories listed here are intended for multiple religions, hence shouldn't be in this category but should be higher up in the tree.

# Religions of the Greco-Roman world (in the 1st layer) and Religion in the Ancient Roman period (in the third layer) can be merged because both categories cover all religions in the same region in the same time span. To be honest I hadn't detected this any earlier.
# Religion in the Roman Republic is a very small category and can just as well be merged into its current parent Ancient Roman religion, since it contains only one subcategory which relates to Ancient Roman religion only. I hadn't detected this any earlier either.
# That leaves us with Religion in the Roman Empire, which should be a child category of the upper category Religions of the Greco-Roman world/Religion in the Ancient Roman period, instead of a child of Ancient Roman religion, to begin with. The problem is that religions in the Republic and in the Empire are largely the same, so breaking up religion(s) by Republic versus Empire is a matter of overcategorization. Republic/Empire is not a defining characteristic of any of these religions. I can imagine for convenience reasons they are broken up by time, but that has already been done by century as well.
# Another problem with Religion in the Roman Empire category is that it currently contains very few articles about Ancient Roman religion and equally few about Ancient Christianity, while one would expect to find everything here. But if one would start filling this category, one would create an enormous duplication with the other categories (e.g. with Ancient Christianity and Xth century in religion). So on the one hand it shouldn't exist as it is now, with only a sort of random subset of relevant articles, but on the other hand it's not desirable to expand either.

:'''Oppose''' all of the above. Your reasoning on this topic is very muddled Marco. No. 1 is wrong because Religion in the Ancient Roman period is for 1 period in 1 region, not, as you have suggested, all religions in the same region. THe equivalent is categories for oranges , lemons and limes which are children of Citrous fruits. No. 2 is wrong because there is nothing inherently wrong with it and it shows potential to grow. No. 3 is wrong the Empire was only one of 3 periods in the Roman area of the world. The overall wrapper should be the i; if readers want to delve deeper into one of the periods, they can safely navigate to do so. No. 4 is wrong because the Empire was in a state of transition towards the end of the 3rd and 4th centuries; it was a mixture of pagan and Christian. It would be wrong to classify the Empire as belonging exclusively to one or the other religion. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 19:37, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

Here's my reply:
# Both categories contain a period of about a millennium (500 BC - 500) in the region in which the Romans ruled.
# My best guess is it can only grow by copying more from Ancient Roman religion. Could you elaborate how else it has 'potential to grow'?
# I can only repeat, the distinction between Republic and Empire is irrelevant with respect to religion + It is really not understandable why you define a category with ''all'' religions as a child of a category with only ''one'' religion.
# I understand this even less, why would need to assign a monopoly to one religion when there were in fact multiple religions next to each other?

Note, I presumed nr 1 and 2 were entirely independent of nr 3 and 4, that's why I've posted them already.

Here's an additional comment on #1, for your information:

So far I looked only at the Religion tree. But if you look at the History tree, you will see the following:
* [[:Category:Religion in ancient history]]
** Religions in the Greco-Roman world
*** Ancient Greek religion
*** Ancient Roman religion
*** ''and other religions''
** Ancient Roman religion
** ''and other religions''
* [[:Category:Religion in the Ancient Roman period]]
** ''child categories per century - note that the child cats occasionally also contain Buddhist and Hindu temples, I hadn't noticed that before''
So here we have two different - though in time overlapping - classification systems: one by religion, the other by time. The name Religion in the Ancient Roman period is quite confusing in that respect, as it suggests time ''and'' place simultaneously. I don't have any concrete suggestion for now, except it's clear that my 1st point is not (immediately) feasible.

Besides Ancient Roman religion is now both child category and brother category of Religions in the Greco-Roman world, which doesn't seem right. It should be child.

===== How to proceed from here? =====

Dear Laurel Lodge,
My proposal is as follows:
# I'm going to change the merge request on [[:Category:Religion in the Ancient Roman period]] into a renaming request into [[:Category:Ancient religion by century]], based on my very latest comment. That's entirely independent of our main discussion, isn't it?
# On the other points (2,3,4) I suggest we seek another way to resolve this, i.e. via the Dispute Resolution Noticeboard or a Mediation Committee. Do you agree and do you have a preference of one over the other?
Kind regards

:'''Reply''' Sorry for the late response. I disagree with the first point and have explaned my position on the CFD that you opened for it. For points 2,3,4 I'm happy to go to mediation. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 11:06, 15 June 2014 (UTC)
