:''The result of the discussion was:''  '''administrative close: appears to have been withdrawn in favour of [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_June_2#Category:Several_categories_related_to_women_clergy|this discussion]].''' [[User:Good Olfactory|Good Ol’factory]] <sup>[[User talk:Good Olfactory|(talk)]]</sup> 00:42, 10 June 2014 (UTC) 
:* '''Propose upmerging''' [[:Category:Female Christian clergy and religious]] to [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]]
:* '''Propose renaming ''' [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]] to [[:Category:Female Christian clergy]]
:* '''Propose taking out''' [[:Category:Christian nuns]] from the new category Female Christian clergy

:'''Nominator's rationale:''' Ordained Christian women and its child cat Female Christian clergy and religious are a category within '''[[:Category:Clergy]]'''. For consistency reasons, women who aren't clergy (i.e. nuns) should be taken out and the category can simply be named for 'clergy' (i.e. without 'religious').

It sounds a bit complicated, but it is in fact simplifying, because it saves one category and it results in a shorter and easier category name. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:59, 1 June 2014 (UTC)
*'''Query''' Wouldn't it be simpler to just delete Category:Female Christian clergy and religious and leave the other categories as they are? That would achieve the object of keeping the purity of Category:Clergy. [[User:Laurel Lodged|Laurel Lodged]] ([[User talk:Laurel Lodged|talk]]) 21:29, 1 June 2014 (UTC)

:This could be an alternative, though personally I'd prefer the name of Female Christian clergy, because the other child categories of [[:Category:Clergy]] are also with 'clergy' in it. (Question on the side, if we would only delete Female Christian clergy and religious category, wouldn't we first have to manually upmerge the single articles that are currently in the latter, or is that done automatically too?) [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 05:37, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
*'''Rename''' as  [[:Category:Female Christian religious leaders]]. There is no need for a "clergy" layer. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 09:53, 2 June 2014 (UTC)

'''Don't agree to the latter suggestion'''. The general categorization structure is currently different than that, there is:
* [[:Category:Religious workers]]
**  [[:Category:Clergy]]
*** [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]]
**  [[:Category:Religious leaders]]
*** [[:Category:Female religious leaders]]
So the categorization presumes that clergy are (as such) not religious leaders. This makes sense if you take into consideration that, for example in the Catholic Church, priests are clergy while popes are religious leaders. So this distinction between clergy and religious leaders would imply that we would also have female clergy and female religious leaders next to other. 

BUT this structure also shows an immediate flaw in the current categorization, since Ordained ''Christian'' women are now a child of (''general'') Clergy! Instead there should be 'Female clergy' as a child of 'Clergy' and 'Female Christian clergy' as a child of 'Christian clergy'. 

That means that my proposal of June 1st is not good enough and therefore I '''withdraw''' it.

There's only 6 Buddhist single articles that need to be moved to Buddhist religious leaders, that can be done manually. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:15, 1 June 2014 (UTC)

** Since there haven't been any Buddhist reactions here, I'll recategorize the Buddhist articles already, so that merging can take place easily.[[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 20:20, 4 June 2014 (UTC)
