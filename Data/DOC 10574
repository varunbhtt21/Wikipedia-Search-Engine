===== Five proposals in conjunction =====
:* '''Propose renaming ''' [[:Category:Priestesses]] to [[:Category:Female clergy]]
:* '''Propose upmerging''' [[:Category:Female Christian clergy and religious]] to [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]]
:* '''Propose renaming ''' [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]] to [[:Category:Female Christian clergy]]
:* '''Propose moving''' the new category Female Christian clergy to become a child cat of Christian clergy instead of a child cat of Clergy
:* '''Propose taking out''' [[:Category:Christian nuns]] as a childcat from the new category Female Christian clergy

===== Current categorization tree (at the moment of posting the proposal) =====
'''Currently''' the categorization tree for women clergy ''across religions'' is as follows:
* [[:Category:Religious workers]]
**  [[:Category:Clergy]]
*** [[:Category:Priestesses]]
**** [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]]
***** [[:Category:Female Christian clergy and religious]]
****** [[:Category:Christian nuns]]
****** [[:Category:Women bishops]]

Please note that, in the across-religion tree, Christian subcategories appear with different namings. While ''within [[:Category:Christian clergy]]'' there is nothing quickly visible as female Christian clergy.

===== Proposed categorization tree (as a result of the proposals) =====
The '''proposed consistent categorization tree''' for women clergy ''across religions'' would simply be as follows:
* [[:Category:Religious workers]]
**  [[:Category:Clergy]]
*** [[:Category:Female clergy]]
**** [[:Category:Female Christian clergy]]
***** [[:Category:Women bishops]]
And similarly ''within Christianity'' the proposed simple and categorization tree would be as follows:
*  [[:Category:Christian clergy]]
** [[:Category:Female Christian clergy]]
*** [[:Category:Women bishops]]

The five proposals describe together how to get from the current categorization to the proposed categorization tree.

===== 1st round of comments =====

*'''keep''' Priestesses, as an analogue to {{cl|Priests}}; it was in the wrong place which I fixed. Is there a difference between Ordained women and clergy? Can one be ordained without being clergy? I fixed some of the categorizations so some of the problems you describe are fixed already.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 21:12, 2 June 2014 (UTC)

** Of course there is no difference between Ordained women and Female clergy, that's exactly why I've left out Ordained women from the proposed categorization tree. Thank you for trying to fix some problems, but I've lost track of what you did exactly. For example, how do you now get from Clergy to Female clergy? How do you get from Christian clergy to Female Christian clergy? Isn't it better to revert these changes while this discussion is still pending? I think the best is that we discuss ''first'' whether or not the proposed categorization I posted here is indeed the most logical and simple one.[[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 19:16, 3 June 2014 (UTC)

===== 2nd round of comments =====

::I don't think we need a "female clergy", any more than we need a "male clergy". These are trees which are divided by gender for the most part, so under {{cl|Clergy by type}} you find {{cl|Priests}} and {{cl|Priestesses}}. Category:Female Christian clergy and religious which contains nuns is nonetheless a useful container, I don't think we need to ensure that the {{cl|Clergy}} tree never includes people who aren't clergy, it is common as you go down the branches of the tree to violate some of the precepts of the parents. another possibility might be to rename {{cl|Ordained Christian women}} as {{cl|Female Christian priests}} since the word priestess is not used for them.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 19:29, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
:::Also, I think some deaconesses are not ordained, but may still be considered clergy. I think in some religions there are also deacons who who aren't ordained. I don't think "clergy" can be kept entirely free of people who aren't necessarily called Clergy.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 19:47, 3 June 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for your comments, here's my reply:
* I don't agree that we wouldn't need 'female clergy', the reason being the controversiality of female clergy in history and between christian branches and (still) the scarcity of female clergy. Female is really a distinctive characteristic within clergy.
* I don't really understand why putting Female Christian clergy and religious could be useful, since clergy and nuns are entirely different. One wouldn't put Monks under 'Clergy and Monks' either, right?
* Renaming Ordained Christian women into Female Christian priests instead of Female Christian clergy is an interesting suggestion.
Kind regards, [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 19:07, 4 June 2014 (UTC)

===== 3rd round of comments =====

*'''comment''' I am not convinced that there is a way to shoehorn all these religions together; indeed, I'm finding it hard even to pick a single word word that I feel comfortable in using across all. I would say, however, that if "priestess" is retained it should be limited to religions in which there is a specifically female priestly role. In Christianity, for instance, those groups which have women priests most emphatically do ''not'' call them "priestesses" because the point is, after all, that men and women fulfill the same role without regard to gender. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 12:48, 3 June 2014 (UTC)

** I've considered this while thinking this all over. It's really a tough puzzle. My proposal consists of having 'Female Christian clergy' and 'Ancient priestesses' next to each other, both as subcategories of 'Female clergy'. So I'm deliberately not proposing to rename 'Ancient priestesses' into 'Ancient female clergy'. However, the parent category of them both cannot be anything else than 'Female clergy', entirely analogue to the way as the parent category across religions is named 'Clergy' (which includes Christian clergy and Ancient priests).[[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 19:16, 3 June 2014 (UTC)

===== 4th round of comments =====

* '''Comment''' - (1) nuns are not "ordained" at all. (2) "Priestesses" in a Christian context is entirely inappropriate. (3) "Clergy" in a non-Christian context is also mostly inappropriate. (4 and principally) It's not appropriate to categorise people (or things, or anything) as something they are not simply to make a category scheme work. [[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]]) 15:21, 4 June 2014 (UTC)
:::I'm suggesting renaming to the rather bland "Female clergy"  is less inclusive and less easy to understand than "priestesses", which captures a broader spectrum. As you go deeper in the category tree, the grandparents and great grandparents sometimes become less applicable - c'est la vie.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 15:35, 4 June 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for your further comments, here's my reply:
* Commenting on Eustachiusz' #1: entirely agree! That is exactly the point of my 5th proposal.
* Commenting on Eustachuisz' #2: I agree, that's also why I prefer 'female clergy' over 'priestesses' as the generalizable term across religions (another reason is that female clergy does not only contain female Christian priests but also female Christian bishops).
* Commenting on Eustachiusz' #3: according [[Clergy]], it appears that clergy is a generalizable term across religions. This is what I've based myself on.
* Commenting on Eustachiusz' #4: I agree. Though if something works for men, it should also work for women.
* Commenting on Obiwankenobi: according to [[Clergy]], 'priests' is under 'clergy', so 'clergy' is apparently more inclusive rather than less inclusive. Generally, I do recognize with you that it's sometimes not possible to have a perfect match between (grand)parents and (grand)children.
Kind regards, [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 19:07, 4 June 2014 (UTC)

:Thank you for your replies. It seems to me that it's necessary to keep "Priestesses" and "Female clergy" separate. Neither is adequate as an over-term, as neither can include the other (Wikipedia can't serve as its own source and I discount the article on "clergy"). I appreciate that some flexibility may be necessary but there is a point beyond which a cat has to be accurate, however inconvenient that may be. Another term is needed which can accurately include both "Priestesses" and "Female clergy" level with each other as separate cats. English is a versatile language: it must be possible to come up with something that will cover both - accurately (which is more or less what Mangoe said above).

:So of your five proposals I agree with the last four but not with the first one. [[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]]) 23:32, 6 June 2014 (UTC)

:: Thank you! May I then also conclude there is '''overall consensus about proposals #2, #3, #4 and #5, but no consensus yet about proposal #1''' ? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 07:15, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

===== Priestesses and Female Christian clergy =====
This continues on the comments of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Eustachiusz in the 4th round of comments.

The question really is, is 'priestess' a type of clergy or not? In the current categorization, for what it's worth, it is indeed regarded as a type of clergy. ''If'' they belong to clergy, then they certainly belong to female clergy too. While ''if'' they aren't clergy, we do not need to discuss the subject at all. 

(Btw I thought solely for categorization purposes we are allowed to rely on the main Wikipedia article of the respective category. If we're not, I'm not really sure how to proceed from here.) [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 07:15, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

:Well, you're not bound by my opinion! and you have a precedent in the parallel cat tree. But I didn't see, even in the Wikipedia article, any claim that priestesses - I'm thinking primarily of what Wikipedia calls "Ancient priestesses" - are clergy. [[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]]) 15:10, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

I know I'm not bound :-), it's just that I'm neutral in the choice between two extremes:
# keep priestesses included in clergy -> then also include them in female clergy
# or remove priestesses from clergy entirely
While I'm opposed to keeping them in clergy but not including them in female clergy.
[[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 06:32, 8 June 2014 (UTC)

:I suspect that there is too much unclarity in both terms, "clergy" AND "priestesses", for it to be possible to reach a stable conclusion based on either of them. It also seems very debatable that "priestess" is the correct term for a female Buddhist priest any more than it is for a Christian one. The easiest solution is perhaps to eliminate the overlap by (a) reducing "Priestesses" to "Ancient", "Fictional" and "Wiccan"; and (b) restricting female members of modern organised religions to "Female clergy"; both [[:Category:Priestesses]] and [[:Category:Female clergy]] (with Female Buddhist, Female Christian etc as sub-cats) can then sit side by side as sub-cats of [[:Category:Female religious workers]] under [[:Category:Religious workers]]. (Let's not even worry about whether "Religious workers" is OK or not!) "Vestal virgins" can be slotted in under "Ancient priestesses". [[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]]) 15:35, 8 June 2014 (UTC)

===== Summing up =====
It seems like we've an agreement on the following:
:* <strike> '''Propose renaming ''' [[:Category:Priestesses]] to [[:Category:Female clergy]]</strike> (original proposal no longer relevant)
:# '''Propose upmerging''' [[:Category:Female Christian clergy and religious]] to [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]]

:# '''Propose taking out''' [[:Category:Christian nuns]] as a childcat from the new category Female Christian clergy
:# '''Propose moving''' the new category Female Christian clergy to become a child cat of Christian clergy instead of a child cat of Clergy
:# '''(new proposal)''' Creation of a new [[:Category:Female clergy]] under [[:Category:Clergy]] and under a new [[:Category:Female religious workers]], that will contain Christian and Buddhist female clergy
:# '''(new proposal)''' Creation of a new [[:Category:Female religious workers]] under [[:Category:Religious workers]] that will contain Female clergy (Christian and Buddhist) and Priestesses (excluding Buddhist)

::Yes - the only thing I can see at the moment to add is that "Buddhist priestesses" should be renamed [[:Category:Female Buddhist clergy]].[[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]]) 14:56, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
*'''Rename''' the tree to have consistent use of "female Christian clergy". Remove nuns from being in this tree. Avoid using "priestess" with any Christian. In most Christian traditions most of the uses of that word are associated with non-Christian practices and views. The one exception might be in certain areas of thought among Latter-day Saints, but no Latter-day Saint would go around referring to [[Bonnie L. Oscarson]] as a priestess, but I could argue that such a title might be theologically sound. From a terminology standpoint these are terms Christians do not use. Christians use the term "female priest" or "woman priest" when they recognize the possiblity of such. It is true that in 1st millenium Christianity in places such as France, the term "obispa", which I cannot think of even how to make an English feminized form of bishop would be, bishoptess maybe, did exist. But this was the title of the wife of the bishop, and apparently not a clerical figure at all.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 15:57, 2 July 2014 (UTC)

====="Religious leaders"=====
*'''Use "religious leaders" rather than "clergy"''', see [[:Category:Female religious leaders]]. I've been meaning to return to this area following the CFD at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2013 June 5#Category:Protestant ministers by denomination|2013 June 5]] where Protestant ministers were renamed to [[:Category:Protestant religious leaders by denomination]]. Note the two discussions below that one, where former categories for Methodist clergy and Baptist clergy were renamed to the terms used for religious leaders within those denominational families. '''Merge''' [[:Category:Priestesses]] into [[:Category:Female religious leaders]]; keeping them separate is over-categorization by [[WP:SHAREDNAME]]. '''Merge & rename''' [[:Category:Ordained Christian women]] and [[:Category:Female Christian clergy and religious]] to [[:Category:Female Christian religious leaders]].

*As for [[:Category:Clergy]], '''move''' it back down from [[:Category:Religious workers]] into [[:Category:Religious leaders]]; the article [[clergy]] says ''Clergy are some of the formal leaders within certain religions.'' In the longer term, I think it may be best to merge/rename all clergy categories as "religious leaders", as has already been done for Islamic clergy, see [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2012 August 12#Category:Islamic clergy|CFD 2012 August 12]], because of SHAREDNAME and because it's largely a duplicate layer, but that is beyond the scope of this CFD. {{ping|Cgingold}} can you remember why you made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Clergy&diff=594285346&oldid=544204241 this] change? – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 10:16, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
** Thanks for your contribution! I won't go into all details (yet), I think the most important thing to discuss is the concept of Religious leader. This concept would be perfectly fine for non-hierarchical-organized religions, but I foresee a problem with hierarchical-organized religions. 'Leaders' would then only be applicable for people higher up in the hierarchy (starting at which level?), while 'Clergy' is already used to indicate everyone ordained in the entire hierarchy (regardless level). For this reason I guess it's a sort of unavoidable to keep a 'Clergy' category here in Wikipedia (as well). What's your opinion about this? [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 17:58, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
***I don't see a problem there. "Leaders" does not only mean top-level, but all who exercise leadership over congregations as well as any hierarchy above them. It is no different from clergy, as defined above. 
***Please see [[Category talk:Religious leaders#Clergy categories]] where I have set out an overview of the restructuring as I envisage it. "Clergy" should be kept only as the category name for religious leaders within denominations that use that term, e.g. {{cl|Lutheran clergy}} should be at the same level alongside {{cl|Methodist ministers}} and {{cl|Pentecostal pastors}} within {{cl|Protestant religious leaders by denomination}}. Above the level of denominational families, "Christian clergy" is not needed and would be merged into "Christian religious leaders". – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 20:01, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
**** [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]], your proposal is well-structured for sure. But still I think your definition of leader goes a bit against common use of terms, in the sense that local clergy in hierarchy-organized denominations or religions is probably not perceived as leaders - it's more likely that they are perceived as workers instead of as leaders. If you know anyone here who is more specialized in e.g. the Catholic or Orthodox Church hierarchy than I am, you'd better check with him/her first. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 21:50, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
*****  [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]]: Thanks! I still think there is no contradiction; the Roman Catholic church sees priests as leaders of the parish community, e.g. [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_20020804_istruzione-presbitero_en.html] and [http://catholicpriesthood.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=33&Itemid=33]. OK, the RC church does not ordain women, so here is a generic citation: ReligiousTolerance .org has a page on women clergy, which is headlined "Women as religious leaders". [http://www.religioustolerance.org/femclrgy.htm] Moreover, the principle of these renamings has been accepted at the [[Category talk:Religious leaders#Clergy categories|CFDs]] in May-June 2013. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 22:48, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
****** Fair enough. Meanwhile I've also noticed that the current [[:Category:Christian religious leaders]] already contains Christian priests. I guess for the process it would be better if you post a separate CfD to merge [[:Category:Christian religious leaders]] and [[:Category:Christian clergy]], or not? Nobody else will have noticed the discussion that we had here. [[User:Marcocapelle|Marcocapelle]] ([[User talk:Marcocapelle|talk]]) 06:39, 8 July 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''.  I came here because closure was requested at [[WP:AN]], but if I were going to close it (I'm not), I would have to close it as "Too confusing".  Perhaps there's consensus here, but the layout and the discussion are very confusing, and it would probably be really difficult for anyone to close — you've basically had a normal "how does this work" discussion, not a CFD.  I'd advise that someone start a new CFD with a specific proposal shaped by this discussion, ensure that all other participants in this discussion participate in the new one, and give others the chance to participate without understanding everything that happened here.

* There are '''50''' articles in this category!  *IF* twins are a Thing in Indian films, then it's reasonable to have a category for films that are in fact defined by their twinitude. (I imagine, say, some kind of romantic comedy plot device, or something culturally specific.) But if it's defining then it should be able to support an article -- something like, [[Twins in Indian film]] -- describing and discussing this genre phenomenon.  I think someone should go through this category's articles to be sure that these films are actually "defined" by having twins in them.  If it's really 50 such films then that's evidence that there's a thing. If, after pruning, it's just a few, then I would upmerge into [[:Category:Twins in fiction]]. --[[User:Lquilter|Lquilter]] ([[User talk:Lquilter|talk]]) 13:48, 4 June 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep but rename''': Based on a sample, I would conclude that categorization has been done with prudence.

:* '''Propose merging''' [[:Category:Concepts by field]] to [[:Category:Terminology]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Merge'''. This proposal is my attempt to deal with the mess illustrated by the individual case discussed at [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_June_2#Merge_Category:Biological_concepts_and_Category:Biology_terminology]]. This is a problem with numerous categories from [[:Category:Concepts by field]] and [[:Category:Terminology]], both of which are rather problematic as they are containers for articles that people just wanted to remove from the parent categories but couldn't figure out where they should go. To be honest, I'd probably support deleting both categories (as a sociologist and Wikipedian, I don't really see why all articles from [[:Category:Sociological terminology]] shouldn't be in [[:Category:Sociology]], pending a more meaningful categorization). But for now, instead of proposing the nuclear option, let's at least deal with a mess of having two container categories for "stuff people don't know how to categorize and thus call foo-ian concepts or terminology".  A number overlap in a similar way to the Biology example discussed, consider for example [[:Category:Philosophical terminology]] and [[:Philosophical concepts‎]] - is just one of several. Another problem is illustrated bt arbitrary choices: why do we have [[:Category:Engineering concepts‎ ]] but no [[:Category:Engineering terminology]]? Or [[:Category:Sociological terminology‎ ]] but no [[:Category:Sociological concepts]]? For a perfect illustration of the arbitrary system, consider the prior sociology example - and the reverse in psychology: we have [[:Category:Psychological concepts‎ ]] but no [[:Category:Psychological terminology]]. I hope I make a clear case that those categories are about the same type/level of concepts. Let's merge them - probably to terminology as it is more popular. Once that happens we can have another discussion about the merits of keeping or deleting the resulting category. <sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 08:51, 2 June 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' As Acroterion notes, it's not practically possible for a ship merely to be damaged by the explosion of its magazine — [[:File:InvincibleWrecksp2470.jpg|destruction is inevitable]].  The only way merely to be damaged is if bits of the exploding ship impact other ships; no need to categorise those ships here.

*'''delete''' As already noted, we have a category already for explosions that weren't battle-related. Explosions in battle are just one of a number of mechanisms by which ships are damaged or destroyed, and I note that the subject of the most familiar photograph of a magazine explosion, the [[USS Shaw (DD-373)]], survived another four years of service before scrapping. Nor are magazines the only things on ships that explode. I don't see making a distinction as to why a ship sinks when it is bombed or torpedoed.

:*Well, [[HMS Zubian|anything can be repaired if naval types want to]], as long as it's not totally sunk (''Shaw'' was already in drydock, so she couldn't sink); the magazine explosion there is just as relevant to her as it is to ships such as ''Invincible'' (the photo I linked).  My point was that a magazine explosion shouldn't be treated like a fire or a big hole or something else that will damage just part of the ship before you get around to repairing it; it's inevitably a huge event, and aside from anomalies such as ''Shaw'' (who expects magazines to explode in drydock?), it inevitably sinks the ship.  Note that they're not always in battle; ''[[HMS Vanguard (1909)|HMS Vanguard]]'' blew up (probably from a magazine explosion) at anchor.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 22:00, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
:*One reason for the category is precisely because these events tend to produce the most familiar images of naval explosions, and they were more common than generally realized. Historically, the vulnerability of British capital ships to such events was something of a scandal during WWI. I'm not sure why the ''Shaw'' event argues against the category: as Nyttend notes, ''Shaw'' couldn't sink, and the Navy made a point of salvaging and repairing every ship from Pearl Harbor they possibly could regardless of military expediency. There's a point where a line must be drawn: I've included ''Barham'', for instance, but am undecided about [[USS Princeton (CVL-23)|''Princeton'']].
