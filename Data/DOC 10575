The '''Church of Sant'Agostino Parish ''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] parish church in  the ''[[frazione]]'' of [[Sant'Agostino, Emiliaâ€“Romagna|Sant'Agostino]], part of the ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) of [[Terre del Reno]] in the [[Province of Ferrara]], Italy. 
The original church built in 1507 by commission from the Bianchetti family. By 1566, the church had its first reconstruction, and in 1626, the belltower was added; this was reconstructed in 1823. Just prior to becoming a parish church, the site had been part of the Oratorio dei Sacchi. In 1791-1792, the lateral naves were added and the nave elongated. The present [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]] facade dates to 1879. 

The main altarpiece was once attributed to Fra [[Stefano da Carpi]] (1710-1796), but more recent documents point to [[Jacopo Calvi]], also called il Sordino (1740-1815).<ref>[http://www.parrocchiasantagostino.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=22:la-chiesa-parrocchiale&catid=37:la-chiesa-parrocchiale&Itemid=34 Parish Church History], from Tratto da "Sfogliando le delibere - 1816/74", curated by Enzo Baroni e Lorenzo Baruffaldi (2000).</ref>
