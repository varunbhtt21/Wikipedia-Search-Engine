By keeping the "by sport" category, the new [[:Category:Sports champions]] one will just contain the "by sport" category and the "navigational boxes" one.

:* '''Propose renaming''' [[:Category:Granularity of materials]] to [[:Category:Granular materials]]
:'''Nominator's rationale:''' '''Rename'''. The term "granular materials" is universally accepted by scientific community, instead the term "Granularity of materials" was invented in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17 this discussion] that changed the correct name due to same personal and illogic considerations. Furthermore the term "granularity" in a scientific context can be confused with "roughness", which is not correlated with the meaning of this category. See also these results in Google books: [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22granular+materials%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 148000] for "granular materials" vs [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22granular+materials%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1#q=%22granularity+of+materials%22&safe=off&tbm=bks only 22] for "Granularity of materials" !!!

* '''Keep''' – the very recent cfd discussion [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17| of 17 April]] makes it clear that this is intended to be a topic category containing articles about granularity, not a list category of granular materials. (There was not all that much support for the existence of a list category of granular materials.) [[User:Oculi|Oculi]] ([[User talk:Oculi|talk]]) 12:49, 4 June 2014 (UTC)
** "Granularity?" What is it granularity? Who invented this term? Who used this term? I am sorry to say this, but I think too many unqualified people participated to the last cfd discussion (let's tell me if it is not the case, which scientific knowledge do you have... I am really curious!). For this reason I ask the participation to this discussion of some competent wikiproject, so hopefully some other expert in materials science will confirm that the previous discussion was completely illogical. Sorry about the tone of my answer, but your last renaming is an offence to the [[material science]] made by people that very likely never studied it or any other similar subject! If do not know what is it a "[[granular material]]" (it is clearly the case), I can rewrite the page for you and adding reliable references, but please, put back the old, correct category name! --[[User:Daniele Pugliesi|Daniele Pugliesi]] ([[User talk:Daniele Pugliesi|talk]]) 02:34, 9 June 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' – The previous (and proposed) category included ''materials'' that are granular. That is very different from the intent of the current name, which is to group articles about the ''properties of granularity itself'', not the materials involved. - [[User:Gorthian|Gorthian]] ([[User talk:Gorthian|talk]]) 05:43, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
:* You did not explain WHY in your opinion we have to adopt the name "granularity of materials", that is a term invented by some wikipedians, instead of adopt the name "Granular materials", that is a term adopt in the field of Material science. --[[User:Daniele Pugliesi|Daniele Pugliesi]] ([[User talk:Daniele Pugliesi|talk]]) 17:43, 9 June 2014 (UTC)

::''[[wikt:granularity#Noun|Granularity]]'' is not a term "invented by some wikipedians," it is a real property that is important to many fields, including materials science.

*'''Note''' This list seems to contain mostly granular materials still. If the intent is to be a category about describing granular materials then it should be that . It seems to be a list serving two purposes under one heading currently. That title is not correct for one of the two purposes. Maybe it should be broken into two categories instead of one.[[User:XFEM Skier|XFEM Skier]] ([[User talk:XFEM Skier|talk]]) 15:49, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
:* Two categories? Which categories? Please be more detailed in your answer. --[[User:Daniele Pugliesi|Daniele Pugliesi]] ([[User talk:Daniele Pugliesi|talk]]) 17:43, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
::If there is consensus that the category should be granularity of materials and that should include articles describing granularity in materials as opposed to granular materials then that should be a category and what is contains. But the current category is about half populated by granular materials. (Aggregate (composite), Cobble (geology), Construction aggregate, ...). These should not be categorized as granular materials not granularity of materials. So the idea was that there should be a granularity of materials about things like fineness modulus and another category with granular materials with things like aggregate. Although I personally think the definition should be broadened to both and the title should be changed to granular materials.

:::The introduction was only fixed two days ago, so some cleanup of the contents may be required.  That lack of cleanup should not be construed as demonstrating the need to the existing category to be split. It is simply an indication that the cleanup from the rename is not completed. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 00:09, 10 June 2014 (UTC)

*'''Rename''' per all of the above notes and rebuttals. I have never heard the word "granularity" to describe a property of a material in any scientific context -- only in describing sound, vision, texture, and in woodworking and cooking. All but one article in the current category is written in both context and content of the physics of granular materials. The category name "Granularity of materials" may ''possibly'' be suitable for an article on, say, a statistic based on the size, homogeneity, and viscosity of particles in a granular material; it makes no sense for a category. This subcategory, should it continue to exist as-is, ''cannot'' be described as "Granularity of materials" and the best suggestion for renaming is "Granular materials".

::The term ''[[wikt:granularity#Noun|granularity]]'' is common in many fields, including science. It is not only common, it is measureable. In my comment above, I cited six examples of its use from Google Books. - [[User:Gorthian|Gorthian]] ([[User talk:Gorthian|talk]]) 21:31, 11 June 2014 (UTC)
:::Are you sure that the "granularity" you are talking about is a synonym of "to be a granular material"? Maybe is just one property of granular material used in some very specific field, because it is the first time that I heard about this property. I think that you are following some bizarre guideline ignoring the common sense. We have [[:Category:Materials|a lot of categories about materials]], I really don't understand why you want to change the name of this particular typology of materials.

*'''Oppose''' (as category creator) The current name fits the convention of [[:Category:States of the United States geography-related lists]], and allows for inclusion of lists relating to topics such as demographics and climate, which are not lists "of places".<br />Part of the problem here is that the [[:Category:Lists of places in California]] is being misused; it should be simply a container for [[:List of places in California (A)]], but instead it is being stuffed with other items.  The broad concept of "geography" makes a better container than "place", because what is a "place"?  Is California a place, or the United States?  Better to either use the broader term "geography" or a more specific one such as "cities". --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 08:08, 3 June 2014 (UTC)
**According to [[place (geography)]], a place is "a point or an area on the Earth's surface or elsewhere", with the added clarification that a ''place'' is defined by human and/or social attributes, while a ''location'' is based on more definite features, like geometry.

**Ok, I take it back, looking over some of the other lists, there are clearly some non-place lists in the "geography-related" categories, so there's obviously merit in keeping them separate. I suggest we make "Lists of places" categories children of the "geography-related" categories, and put place-lists in the child categories only.
