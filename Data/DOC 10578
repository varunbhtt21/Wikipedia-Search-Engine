:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] <small><small><small>@[[:User:Rlendog|Rlendog]]:</small></small></small> Sufficient prose length; timing proper at more than five times expansion; hook just a tad (7 characters) over 200 characters so in the ballpark (I would suggest to anyone seeking to promote this that if the minor length overage is a problem, the word "recording" could probably be omitted); reads as neutral; reliable sourcing and hook cited; spot check found no infringement; in short, ready to go.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 22:48, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::*I would have no problem with eliminating the word "recording." I agree that isn't necessary. [[User:Rlendog|Rlendog]] ([[User talk:Rlendog|talk]]) 01:18, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
