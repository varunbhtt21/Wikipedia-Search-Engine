Seems like a promotional ad, also it is a proposed rail. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-the person who created it also made the same page-put a speedy on it. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:44, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' Per [[WP:CRYSTAL]] - a project that was recently proposed (and by recently I mean February of this year) and doesn't seem to have much coverage beyond routine speculation, at least in English sources. I'm sure it will be worthy of inclusion as an infrastructure endeavor once it actually leaves the "maybe" phase but not right now. <span style="color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|<span style="color:#00CA00">FreeRangeFrog</span>]]</span><sup>[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]</sup> 20:37, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per FreeRangeFrog - Nothing but speculation, I suggest it be created once something more concrete comes up.
