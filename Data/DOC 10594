'''Dominic "Dom" Copeland''' is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama ''[[Holby City]]'', played by actor [[David Ames (actor)|David Ames]]. He first appeared in the [[Holby City (series 15)|series fifteen]] episode "Second Life", broadcast on 23 April 2013. Dom arrives at Holby City hospital as an [[Foundation Programme|F1]] on Keller Ward being mentored by [[Antoine Malick]] ([[Jimmy Akingbola]]) and later [[Sacha Levy]] ([[Bob Barrett (actor)|Bob Barrett]]). The character was originally introduced for several episodes and featured in a storyline with Malick. Producers later decided to reintroduce the character on a permanent basis with Dom returning in January 2014.

Dom is a complex character who enjoys causing trouble and creating different personalities to suit his desired outcome of a situation. His manipulative behaviour has seen him lie under oath and attempt to ruin his colleagues careers. His reintroduction signalled a rivalry with [[Arthur Digby]] ([[Rob Ostlere]]) and a friendship with [[Zosia March]] ([[Camilla Arfwedson]]). He goes on to develop a close friendship with Arthur that proves significant to his character development. Writers also made changes to his personality by placing Dom alongside senior staff with "strong moral compasses" who help him to become a "better person". The character shares romantic relationships with agency nurse Kyle Greenham (Alan Morrisey) and patient Lee Canon (Jamie Nichols). The latter subjects him to a violent attack which affects his career at the hospital.

Writers carried on victimising the character when they paired him with registrar [[Isaac Mayfield]] ([[Marc Elliott]]). Their relationship was used to portray domestic abuse within a gay relationship. The story culminated with Dom leaving Isaac and exposing his abuse. Dom was left with a steroid addiction and severe trust issues. His next relationship was developed with nurse [[Lofty Chiltern]] ([[Lee Mead]]), which takes many episodes to develop. ''Holby City'' producer Kate Hall felt it was important because Dom had been emotionally damaged and could not move on quickly. Writers continued to create dramatic stories for the character when he contracts [[Hepatitis C]] from a needle stick injury. Producers later rewrote the character's back story which reveals he was adopted and introduced his biological mother [[Ange Godard]] ([[Dawn Steele]]). Critic Anthony D. Langford from [[TheBacklot.com]] has often praised the character for not being stereotypical. While other reviews have labelled him "bad" and "sneaky".

==Development==

===Casting, characterisation and family===
Ames had previously auditioned for a different character but was unsuccessful. Gaining the role of Dominic meant a lot to Ames' family who were already ''Holby City'' fans.<ref name=tvint>{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Cheryl|title=David Ames interview|url=http://www.holby.tv/david-ames-interview/|work=holby.tv|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

{{cquote|Troubled and trouble in equal measure, Dom’s a wily schemer who is always working an angle. Intelligent and sharp-witted, he’s actually very sensitive and is easily wounded, often believing himself to be the victim and justifying his actions as self-defence. Fiercely protective of, and generous towards, those he favours, Dom can also be surly and vindictive towards those he feels have betrayed him. When it comes to fact versus fiction, Dom prefers to glamorise.|4=''[[BBC Online]]''.<ref name=dom>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mhd6/characters/dominic-copeland|title=Dominic Copeland|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>}}

Dom is billed as "complicated, unpredictable and deliciously wicked". His manipulative persona is said to make the show more interesting.<ref name=dom/> Career wise Dom is incredibly ambitious.<ref name=ds/> But he is untruthful and has "demons" from past experiences that continue to trouble him. Ames called him a "scheming, cheeky little mongrel" and finds fun in playing the nasty character. He told [[Lorraine Kelly]] that "Dominic is a very complex character and he has a lot to prove and he doesn't really hold back on how he goes about doing that."<ref name=bigint/><ref name=lor/> Ames believed that there are similarities between him and Dom. He told a reporter from ''[[Gay Times]]'' that "as a gay man playing a gay man, there’s definitely an element of myself in Dominic’s personality, because one thing I wanted to do with Dominic is to have fun with him."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Holby star David Ames: I used to be clinically overweight, but now I feel comfortable in my own skin|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/08/04/holby-city-star-david-ames-sir-ian-mckellen-is-the-most-influential-gay-acctor/|website=[[PinkNews]]|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=4 August 2014}}</ref>

The character goes on a journey emotionally and through his career at ''Holby City'' his personality changes. Ames assessed that originally his character had "questionable morals and standards". But being around senior hospital staff with "such strong moral compasses" he finds a "good path". Through these connections writers developed him into a "better person, a better colleague and a better friend."<ref name=arthur/> In 2017, Ames assessed that the character is "so full of bravado, he is very cocky and he is very full of himself".<ref name=ames2017int/> But Ames also likened his character to someone wearing a mask. When his "mask slips sometimes" and you learn that Dom "is vulnerable and underneath it all he is quite scared and timid." The actor concluded that he was still fascinated by his complex character.<ref name=ames2017int/>

In 2015, Julia Deakin was hired to play Dom's mother Carole Copeland. She was described by a writer from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' as being the "overenthusiastic parent" of her "beloved boy" Dom.<ref name=overenthusiastic/> She likes to know all of his business and wants to be close to him again. With this Carole secures a job at the hospital cafe. When Carole hears gossip about her son, she confronts him on Keller ward in front of patients. Dom is "mortified" by his mother and they have an "embarrassing row" on the ward. The incident also causes Dom to behave unprofessionally with a patient. Dom has to tell his mother to "mind her own business for once".<ref name=overenthusiastic>{{cite journal|date=4–10 July 2015|title=Oh, mother!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=26|page=30|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}</ref>

===Guest role and return===
Dom sleeps with Malick, but he is in a relationship with Nathan Hargreave (Jotham Annan).<ref name=return/> Malick treats murderer Amanda. He grants her wish to not resuscitate after she tells him the location of her final victim. But he finds himself in trouble and the matter gets taken to court.<ref name=is/> When Malick rejects Dominic's further advances he wants revenge. Malick is questioned over the [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] and expects Dom to validate his statement. Dom uses the opportunity to get Malick in further trouble over the incident.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mullin|first=Cheryl|title=What's on TV tonight: The Apprentice, Shameless and Holby City|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/tv/whats-tv-tonight-apprentice-shameless-4020709|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=28 May 2013}}</ref> Ames believed that Dom was under much "psychological stress" at this point.<ref name=tvint/>

Dom then proceeds to lie under oath to further enact his revenge.<ref name=return/> Dom claims that Malick delivered Amanda a fatal overdose. To defend himself he is forced to admit that he kissed Dom. Akingbola told a reporter from ''Inside Soap'' that "Dominic's crush rebounds on Malick, Nathan has been a rock to him, and now Malick worries that he'll lose the love of his life as well as his job."<ref name=is>{{cite journal|title=Game over?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=1–7 June 2013|issue=22|pages=26|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}</ref> Ames told a reporter from BBC Online that it was Dom's "inexperience and naivety" that got him in to deep with Malick.<ref name=bigint/> But Dom's lies at the coroner's inquest are exposed and he leave ''Holby City'' shamed.<ref name=bigint/><ref name=wot/> Ames summed up the departure as Dom leaving the show disgracefully under a cloud.<ref name=lor/>

In September 2013, it was announced that Ames had reprised the role. Executive producer Oliver Kent said that his return would "definitely shake things up at ''Holby City''".<ref name=return>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Exclusive: 'Holby City' confirms two new characters, Dominic return|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/news/a515905/holby-city-confirms-two-new-characters-dominic-return.html#~oCEV4wbxJGFbQm|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=17 September 2013}}</ref> Ames told a ''[[TV Choice]]'' reporter that "Dominic is definitely going to spice things up and he's someone who is going to cause a lot of sparks."<ref name=ds>{{cite web|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|title=Holby City's David Ames: 'Dominic's return will spice things up'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/news/a542654/holby-citys-david-ames-dominics-return-will-spice-things-up.html#~oCEV3N3qUfBx5G|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=9 January 2014}}</ref> Dom returned during the episode titled "Intuition", broadcast on 14 January 2014.<ref name=wot/> He "skulked off with his tail between his legs" when he left the hospital shamed. But he returns to try again but this time remain focused on his career. He also damaged his emotional wellbeing in addition to his career.<ref name=bigint/> Lying to the jury delivered a "massive blow" to his life and he struggled to regain respect.<ref name=ds/> Ames believed that his character had learned a "valuable lesson" and that Dom would use it to better himself. He warned that while Dom would not be predictable he remained as untrustworthy as ever. Dom will do "whatever it takes" to appear better at everything tries.<ref name=bigint/>

===F1 repeat===
Dom's return to Keller Ward means that he has to contend with Arthur. Malick and Arthur were close colleagues so his return inevitably causes friction.<ref name=ds/> Ames explained that "Dom has a long way to go before Arthur even begins to consider them equals, let alone friends. Arthur is a faithful old Labrador."<ref name=bigint>{{cite web|title=Q&A with David Ames|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mhd6/features/david-ames-interview|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> Arthur wants to expose Dom to their mentor Sacha. Ostlere told Kelly that Arthur "is very suspicious about Dominic but he cannot convince Sasha."<ref name=lor/> Sacha believes they are working well together, but this is due to Dom behaving in a manipulative manner. He fakes multiple personas and uses them to suit a desired outcome. Ames namely described a "butter wouldn't melt" attitude shown while in Sacha's presence.<ref name=rival/>

Dom is aware that forming a working relationship with Arthur will be difficult; so he decides to have fun creating tension. Ames told a reporter from ''What's on TV'' that "there’s clearly a lot of friction between them and Dom likes to push Arthur's buttons, not least just to entertain himself."<ref name=rival/> One example of Dom and Arthur's rivalry occurs while treating a patient involved in a factory explosion. Sacha places Arthur in charge of Keller and Dom uses the opportunity to make Arthur appear unable to manage the situation. Ames said "Dominic will put his own job above anyone else's job. He'll say whatever needs to be said in order to better himself and his career."<ref name=rival>{{cite web|title=Holby star David Ames: 'Dom is definitely going to spice things up'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/holby-city/news/holby-star-david-ames-dom-is-definitely-going-to-spice-things-up|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=31 January 2014}}</ref>

''Holby City'' quickly developed a "best friend" partnership between Dom and fellow F1 Zosia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry moves in on Amy|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/holby-city/episodes/harry-moves-in-on-amy|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=8 April 2014}}</ref> Arthur warns Zosia about Dom's past.

But Zosia is not fazed by the revelation. Jane Simon of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' noted that Dom being a sociopath only served to make him more interesting to the aspiring psychiatrist Zosia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Simon|first=Jane|title=TV today's|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+TTOODDAAYY''SS.-a0364931205|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=15 April 2014}}</ref> He sees his friendship with Zosia as part of creating his new life. Ames said that they have a "different dynamic" compared to his other working relationships.<ref name=tvint/> Ames opined that gay men are often attracted to strong independent women and Zosia is very ambitious. It was therefore a natural development that Dom gravitated towards her. Zosia's interest in psychiatrics means that she likes to observe Dom. But Ames believed that the duo "equally intrigue each other".<ref name=tvint/> Dom, Arthur and Zosia were often featured in storylines together and formed a best friend group. In 2015, Producer Simon Harper decided to split up the trio having Dom staying on Keller, Zosia moving to Darwin and Arthur working on AAU. Harper said it was a difficult decision to make and it was discussed at length with executive producer Oliver Kent.<ref name=split/> But Harper wanted to tell stories reflecting real medical careers. He noted that "as they mature and progress, [they] would go on to their separate disciplines and wards [...] What's great about the changes is that gives them different stories."<ref name=split>{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Holby City producer Simon Harper reveals more story teasers: 'We'll crack Hanssen open again'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/interviews/a672662/holby-city-producer-simon-harper-reveals-more-story-teasers-well-crack-hanssen-open-again/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=9 October 2015}}</ref>

===Friendship with Arthur Digby===
Despite initially being enemies the pair go on to forge a close friendship.<ref name=split/> In one storyline Dom's father is homophobic and tries to embarrass his son in-front of an audience inside a holiday club. Arthur defends his friend by kissing him on the lips as a showing of support. This led viewers to suspect the show was developing a romance between the two character. But Harper later stated that there were no plans and branded it a "beautiful gesture in support of his gay mate" to challenge homophobia.<ref name=split/> Ostlere called it a "show of solidarity" and described the pair as "very close friends". He was also glad writers did not develop their friendship into anything more. They were friends without worrying what their sexuality, "It was a really honest portrayal of two friends."<ref name=departure>{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Holby City's Rob Ostlere reacts to Arthur Digby's emotional exit: 'It sparks a lot of change'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/interviews/a796914/holby-citys-rob-ostlere-arthur-digby-exit/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref> Ames viewed it as a "very beautiful bromance". He also praised the realism of gay males having straight male friends. The actor concluded "as a gay man myself, it's always very nice when you have those straight friends who are so beyond comfortable with you that they can act in ways that other people would perhaps question."<ref name=digby>{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Holby City's David Ames on Arthur Digby's death aftermath: 'Dominic lashes out and shuts down'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/interviews/a797245/holby-citys-david-ames-dominic-arthur-digbys-death-aftermath/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=10 June 2016}}</ref>

The pair were unlikely friends who would "gripe and moan and bitch at each other." He was the best friend that Dom has been searching for, something he had never had before. Ames believed Dom "genuinely felt love and affection" towards Arthur. Dom lives his life in fear of losing people and Arthur is one of the rare examples that the character decided to get close to.<ref name=digby/>

Arthur is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ames said that Arthur's illness "hit Dom very hard". He tries his best to be there and support Arthur.<ref name=wotinterviewthree/> He later dies from the illness and Dom is left to grieve for his best friend.<ref name=digby/> Ames explained that his character tends to suppress his feelings in turmoil. He reverts to old habits and behaviour that made him unpopular in the hospital. He becomes "very emotionally cut off" refusing to cry and furiously argues with colleagues during a "tumultuous time".<ref name=arthur>{{cite web|title=David Ames: 'Dom can't channel his emotions in Holby, so he just gets very, very angry!'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/holby-city/news/david-ames-dom-cant-channel-his-emotions-in-holby-so-he-just-gets-very-very-angry|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=8 June 2016}}</ref> Ames concluded that Arthur was Dom's friendly "soul mate". He was "someone who didn't quite fit in, in the same way as Dominic doesn't. They were an unlikely pairing and it's a struggle for him to get over the fact he's lost that."<ref name=digby/>

The feelings "probably felt a lot like first love" which was "very intoxicating" and "incredibly attached" to Lee in a short period of time.

After time off-screen Lee was reintroduced alongside his wife Alison Jones (Elizabeth Cadwallader) who is pregnant.<ref name=wotinterviewtwo/> Ames said that Dom is "absolutely dumbfounded", angry and confused because he had genuine feelings for Lee. But he has "the gall" to arrive at Dom's place of work with Alison knowing that he will be working on the ward. Lee warns Dom to keep their affair a secret and is in denial about his sexuality. Dom builds a rapport with Alison and does not want her to feel cheated by Lee like he was.<ref name=wotinterviewtwo/> But Alison is not fooled and acknowledges that Lee has had affairs with many men and ends her relationship. Lee is angry and confronts Dom feeling he is to blame. Ames explained that his character "doesn't hold back in telling Lee that he’s a liar, a fraud and someone who has affairs with men." Dom's truthful tirade enthrals Lee who then lunges at Dom and begins a violent attack. Ames said Lee's anger stemmed "out of frustration over not being able to control who he is". [[Ric Griffin]] ([[Hugh Quarshie]]) tries to intervene in the fight and Lee picks up a knife.

In the months that follow the attack Dom struggles at work. Ames assessed that the medic is "still trying to make his peace with what happened." He distracts himself from the issue and realises that he needs to focus on work. Through this he is able to regain some normality. Alison is later admitted to Keller ward with complications in her pregnancy.<ref name=wotinterviewthree/> Her presence makes his encounter with Lee "all very fresh in Dom's mind again". He tries to avoid treating Alison but then decides to deal with the situation. Alison asks for Dom's help to visit Lee and rebuild her family. He wants to know how Lee is but cannot face him. He is annoyed at Alison for relying on him to sort out her marriage. Ames explained that Dom decides to help Alison move on. He tells her that she cannot hold onto the past, advice Dom decides to act on and forget about Lee. The actor added that the story gave Dom "an element of closure" over Lee.<ref name=wotinterviewthree>{{cite web|title=Holby's David Ames: When Alison turns up, the 'whole Lee incident' is churned up again|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/holby-city/news/holbys-david-ames-when-alison-turns-up-the-whole-lee-incident-is-churned-up-again|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=25 May 2016}}</ref>

===Domestic abuse===
[[File:Marc elliott.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Marc Elliot plays Dom's violent partner Isaac Mayfield]]Writers later paired Dom in a romantic relationship with new registrar [[Isaac Mayfield]] ([[Marc Elliott]]). Over the course of the relationship it becomes problematic and Isaac turns violent and controlling towards Dom. A substantial amount of the physical abuse was not aired in episodes.<ref name=isaac/> The violence occurred off-screen and Elliot believed that the pre-watershed time slot played a role in this. Plus he did not believe the audience would want to see such high levels of violence each week. The story did include the element of emotional abuse, but only in one very violent scene did they depict Dom being attacked by Issac. It also helped to portray that such domestic violence usually occurs behind closed doors and the victim covers for their abuser.<ref name=isaac/> Ames said that the story showed "how easy it is to fall into that trap and how blindly you can wonder into it" because of love.<ref name=ames2017int>{{cite interview |subject=David Ames (actor) |subjectlink=David Ames (actor)|title=David Ames Interview|work=[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|date=30 January 2017}}</ref>

The emotional abuse began soon into their relationship. Dom was emotionally vulnerable still grieving over the death of his best friend. Elliot believed that "Isaac got him in his clutches when he was particularly weak, extremely malleable and easy to manipulate." The actor stated that the story is "twisted" as his character embarks on a pattern of controlling behaviour and tells lies to manipulate Dom. Issues arise because Isaac wants Dom "dangling on a string" and his "reason for wanting to destroy Dom is simply because he can."<ref name=isaac2/> But Isaac begins to lose control of Dom when he stands up to him and announces that he is going to live with Zosia. This was the point writers introduced violence into the story. It had just been "very emotional and very psychological" but Dom's defiance worries Isaac and stirs up anger. Isaac thinks the only way to break Dom into submission is to attack him. Filming the brutal attack required Ames to have a cushion underneath his attire so that Elliot could kick him in the stomach.<ref name=isaac2/> The fight scene was so aggressive that ''Holby City's'' post-production had to edit out distressing sounds from the attack. The actors did not enjoy filming multiple takes as Ames had to drop to the floor repeatedly for the scenes.<ref name=isaac2>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Victoria|title=Holby's Marc Elliott on Isaac's brutal attack: 'I really had to kick David!'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/holbys-marc-elliott-i-had-to-kick-david-462649/|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc. UK]])|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=28 March 2017}}</ref>

Dom addresses Isaac's temper but he refuses to admit he has a problem. Elliot told Victoria Wilson from ''[[What's on TV]]'' that his character is a classic sociopath and does not want to hear that he has done wrong.<ref name=isaac/> The actor firmly believed that Isaac does not love Dom. He explained that the relationship is a "nasty and devious game" and he lacks empathy. He added "that's why he’s able to be as cruel as he is to Dom without caring in the slightest because there's no emotional attachment to Dom whatsoever." He just wanted to "loved and be adored" by Dom without returning the sentiment.<ref name=isaac/>

When Dom's ex-boyfriend Kyle is admitted as a patient, Isaac becomes annoyed at their shared past. The character is not jealous but does view Kyle as a threat. Elliot said that Issac thinks Kyle is an "obstacle" and feels the need to isolate Dom and gain "full power over him". He concluded that it becomes about "competitiveness and one-upmanship".<ref name=isaac/> The relationship comes to an end when Dom falls down the stairs during an altercation. Writers chose not to include Isaac pushing Dom. Elliot explained that his character is so " threatening, intimidating and menacing" towards Dom that pure fear causes him to fall down the stairway. Dom reports Isaac to the hospital management and he is suspended thus the character being written out of the show.<ref name=isaac>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Victoria|title=Holby's Marc Elliott on Isaac's shock sacking: 'He never really loved Dominic!'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/holby-marc-elliott-on-isaacs-shock-sacking-465492/|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc.

===Relationship with Lofty Chiltern===
Producers created a new friendship for Dom when they introduced nurse [[Lofty Chiltern]] ([[Lee Mead]]). When Lofty arrives to work on Keller the pair do not like each other. Mead told Emma Bullimore (''[[TVTimes]]'') that Dom has a "frosty side" which he displays when Lofty annoys him.<ref name=meadinterview/> He told Digital Spy's Sophie Dainty that "I think Dom is a strong character and he just can't work out Lofty."<ref name=digitalholby>{{cite news|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Lee Mead discusses his big move to Holby City, upcoming Casualty crossovers and Lofty's future|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby-city/interviews/a828076/lee-mead-on-lofty-holby-city-casualty-swap/|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=12 May 2017|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref> Dom cannot believe that Lofty is as nice as he appears.

He turned him down on that basis only, but feels jealous when Dom begins to date Freddie Chapel (Aaron Fontaine). Lofty decides to keep his feelings for Dom a secret.

The pair later begin to develop a romance. But Dom soon makes things awkward with Lofty when he suggests his ill grandmother Sheilagh Chiltern ([[Wanda Ventham]]) comes to live with them. Mead told Wilson that "it's such a kind gesture but it freaks Lofty out a bit". He added that "given their previous dalliances" Lofty is not ready to move in with Dom.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Victoria|title=Holby City's Lee Mead on 10 years in showbiz: 'I'm really happy at Holby and Lofty's a great part!'|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/holby-citys-lee-mead-really-happy-at-holby-518954/|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc.

Their relationship took a while to happen because Dom was still emotionally damaged by Isaac. Ames defended Dom, stating "I think Dom can be forgiven for thinking that most men are bastards!"<ref name=ames2018int/> But Ames was actually happy with the slow progression of the relationship. He believed that Lofty helped his character remember that some people are "good and kind". Lofty is "unsure of life in general and quite timid".<ref name=ames2018int/> The actor thought this was an additional reason for their "slow burn" relationship. Ames quipped that Dom and Lofty are like a modern day [[Ross Geller]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) and [[Rachel Green]] ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), two characters from the American sitcom ''[[Friends]]'' who became infamous for their [[on-off relationship]].<ref name=ames2018int/> The actor concluded that scenes with Lofty bring "silliness and lightness" to his character's story. Ames enjoyed working with Mead and felt that professionally, they were similar. The relationship became popular with viewers who were eager for Dom to be happy.

===Hepatitis C===
2018 episodes featured the character at the centre of a [[Hepatitis C]] story. [[The Hepatitis C Trust]] announced that the story would be a long-running arc for Dom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hepatitis C storyline to feature in Holby City|url=http://www.hepctrust.org.uk/blog/apr-2018/hepatitis-c-storyline-feature-holby-city|website=[[The Hepatitis C Trust]]|date=23 April 2018}}</ref> While Cydney Yeates of the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' said that it would initially cause issues with Dom and Lofty's relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yeates|first1=Cydney|title=Holby City's Dom and Lofty relationship on the rocks as voicemail spells trouble?|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/698306/Holby-City-spoilers-Lofty-Chiltern-Lee-Mead-Dom-Copeland-hepatitis|website=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=([[Northern & Shell]])|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=24 April 2018}}</ref> The medical issue begins when Dom treats a patient named Susan Beckett ([[Susie Amy]]) for blocked arteries. He discovers that she has hepatitis C and proceeds with caution. Susan is a book publisher and explains how she is working on a book written by a domestic abuser. When he discovers she is working with Isaac he is stunned and it affects his work. When he operates on Susan he loses concentration and has a needle stick injury. He is then told he has probably caught the virus from Susan and takes a test to confirm this.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Dom in danger?|journal=[[What's on TV]]|date=21-27 April 2018|issue=16|pages=8|publisher=([[Time Inc.

His illness affects his work life and he is unable to operate on patients. Ames told Wilson from ''What's on TV'' that "his Hep C diagnosis has had a massive impact on his work [...] and on his love life, because he just doesn't feel sexy."<ref name=wotint2/> He is left emotionally vulnerable and he wants to be alone. When he goes for a walk he finds a woman, Shannon Laurence (Ffion Jones) with her leg impaled on a fence. Dom's mobile phone is broken and Shannon's is on the other side of the fence.<ref name=wotint2/> He tries to retrieve it and cuts his hand. As they both have open wounds he is not allowed to treat Shannon because it will infect her. She starts to lose a lot of blood and she begs him to help her regardless of his hepatitis C. Ames said that Dom takes "a huge risk" in treating Shannon, which helps save her life. In return he gets a "feeling of worth", he realises that he is lucky to have Lofty's support and he decides to accept his diagnosis.<ref name=wotint2>{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Victoria |title=Dom's big risk! |journal=[[What's on TV]] |pages=8 |date=26 May - 1 June 2018 |issue=21 |publisher=([[Time Inc.

The character often joked in scenes about being adopted and it becoming fact offers Dom an explanation to solve his confusion.<ref name=wot9/> Ames hoped that the story would demonstrate that good parents do not have to be blood relatives.<ref name=wot9/> To portray the subject correctly, Ames researched adoption and conversed with adoptees. He also based his performance on real life experiences such as break-ups.<ref name=insidesoapmagz/> Ames had to keep the story a secret until the reveal was broadcast to surprise viewers.<ref name=insidesoapmagz/>

His biological mother [[Ange Godard]] ([[Dawn Steele]]) had already been introduced into the show as a consultant. She was unaware that Dom is her son. The adoption revelation soon aired during an episode centric to Dom's birthday, in which Ange realises that Carole adopted her baby in the 1980's.<ref name=ange>{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Victoria |title=What is Ange's secret? |journal=[[What's on TV]] |date=23-29 March 2019 |pages=8, 9 |publisher=([[TI Media]])}}</ref> She quickly realises that she has been unknowingly working alongside her son. Steele told Victoria Wilson (''What's on TV'') that "this news is massive" and Ange and Carole have an "emotional" exchange in which "lots of secrets are revealed."<ref name=ange/> In the closing moments of the episode Ange goes home to retrieve a shoe box filled with keepsakes about Dom. Steele added "it's all quite heavy, and it's about to get a lot worse."<ref name=ange/>

Dom finds out he was adopted in the following episode when Carole confesses. He then discovers Ange his is mother while they are both operating on a patient. Ames chirped "as often happens in Holby, these emotional scenes take place over someone's open chest, so Dom and Ange are in quite an awkward situation."<ref name=wot9/> He told Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy that Dom reacts by "freaking out" and "absolutely loses his mind and has to run out while doing theatre".<ref name=1quote1/> He reiterated to Wilson that Dom is "dumbfounded" and "completely floored". Dom is left in a "trance and spends most of the day just trying to get his head around this absolutely life-changing news."<ref name=wot9/> Ames believed that it would take some time for Dom to get used to Ange, but he wanted a relationship with her.<ref name=1quote1/> Ange's attitude to the situation stalls any progress. Ames branded it "fairly tumultuous" and Dom feels Ange is not making an effort "to bridge this huge gap in his life." He also defended Ange because she is struggling to accept the information. Ames concluded that "they've basically got to start from scratch, really, to build a relationship, a bond and trust."<ref name=wot9/>

Producers also remained committed to further development of Dom's relationship with his adopted mother Carole. Ames said that Dom is left feeling "sour" because he thinks his "beautiful bond" with Carole was "based on lies, secrecy and deceit."<ref name=wot9/> Dom connects with Ange and Carole remained in the series. Ames said there was much for Dom and Carole to work through; adding "it'll be something where they realise that you don't have to be blood to be family."<ref name=insidesoapmagz/> Producers also introduced Dom's half-sister, [[Chloe Godard]] ([[Amy Lennox]]), who works at the hospital as a cardiothoracic registrar. Chloe does not know about the adoption and Dom is tasked with keeping quiet until Ange figures out a solution.<ref name=insidesoapmagz/> Ames believed that he and Lennox bore a slight resemblance to one another, which made the story more authentic. He added that Dom finds it difficult to work with Chloe after the truth is revealed.<ref name=insidesoapmagz/>
