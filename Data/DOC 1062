'''''The Iron Triangle''''' is a 1989 film about the [[Vietnam War]] shot in [[Sri Lanka]]<ref>p. 3D Cruez, Dexter ''War-torn Sri Lanka Makes Great Movie Location'' Lawrence Journal-World'' 29 May 1988</ref> and directed by Eric Weston.

The story is based on the diary of an unknown Viet Cong Soldier. This unique fact gives the movie a different perspective than many of the other movies about the Vietnam war and makes black and white distinctions about who were the "good guys" and "bad guys" a little more complicated. The film stars [[Beau Bridges]], [[Haing S. Ngor]], Liem Whatley, [[Johnny Hallyday]], [[Jim Ishida]], and [[Ping Wu]]. Each character helps bring to life the struggle of what it means to fight for one's country. Whether they be a simple farmer's son (Ho), a French mercenary (Jacques), or a simple soldier (Keene) these three men bring to light a gray view of war which reflects that there are many sides to the war than just "good" or "evil".
