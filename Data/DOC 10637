==Critical reception==
Lewis Corner of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song a positive review stating:

<blockquote>
The British Isles can hold its head up high when it comes to its world-leading pop, rock and dance music talent dominating the mainstream. However, utter the abbreviation R&B and you'll find us glossing over it with more talk of how great Bastille and Disclosure are doing overseas. Hoping to change that fortune is rising star Joel Compass, who won over tastemakers with his lilting R&B balladry at the end of 2013 - but it seems even he has had to tap into other genres for his latest release. Teaming up with producer Dan Carey (Hot Chip, Kylie Minogue) on 'Forgive Me', Joel has added a splash of house synths and rattling percussion to his impassioned urban serenade. "When you turn and say you'll leave/ Keep your memories far from me," he warns his ex-beau, before impressively slipping into a quivering falsetto drenched in soul. The final result may have glanced to other influences to make some noise, but at its heart, it pin-points Joel Compass as one of the UK's most promising R&B prospects in years. {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a565371/joel-compass-forgive-me-single-review.html Joel Compass: 'Forgive Me' - Single review - Music Review] - [[Digital Spy]]</ref>
