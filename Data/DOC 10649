The '''GAZ-3310 Valdai''' ({{lang-ru|Валдай}}) is a medium-class flat bed [[truck]] (category N2 MCV) formerly produced from late 2004 until 2015 at the [[Gorky Automobile Plant]] in [[Russia]]. It differs from the [[Light commercial vehicle]] "[[GAZelle]]" in that it does require a [[Driving licence in Russia|category C]] [[driver's license]]. The production of the truck ended in December 2015.<ref>[http://wroom.ru/en/cars/gaz/valdai GAZ Valdai]</ref>

== Manufacturing History ==
[[File:GAZ-33104B.jpg|thumb|left|GAZ-33104V]]
After the economic collapse in the late 1990s, the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] Automobile Plant cartel (along with [[ZiL|AMO]]), created a flat-bed trailer to transport [[Truck classification#Medium duty|medium duty]] trucks in response to market demand. The first models were created in conjunction with [[Minsk Automobile Plant|MAZ]]. [[Minsk]] residents later refused to supply their GAZ type MAZ-5336, and instead launched a family of five-ton, low loader trucks; the MAZ-4370 "Zubrenic". GAZ had to develop their own cabin, because available cabins did not suit their needs. Eventually these cabins were used as the basis for the popular "GAZelle" (GAZ-3302). GAZ has produced two engine types: a compact, 4-cylinder engine and an inline six-cylinder diesel GAZ-562 (License Steyr).

Despite its protruding engine cover, the modified engine compartment provided room for a second passenger within the cabin and is listed as "conditional triple" for short and long distances. The GAZ-3310 used modern teardrop-shaped headlights as well as a hood, grill and an integrated bumper, each of which have been modified. The prototype four-ton GAZ-3310, titled "Valdai", debuted at the Moscow International Automobile Salon in 1999. In 2003, "Valdai" began the mass production of block headlights which assisted in the restyling of their commercial "Gazelle" and "Sable" vehicles. The "Valdai" type chassis - a 5-ton diesel truck (GAZ-4301) - was modified with reversed front suspension; it introduced new front and rear axles, and low-profile tires. The braking system was originally only air, but was refined to allow the installation of an automatic braking system (ABS). The entire set of design modifications allowed for the creation of a modern truck with a low-loading height (1000&nbsp;mm), comfortable suspension, an advanced braking system, and an economical diesel engine.

The "Valdai" was offered with a choice of multiple engines: a diesel MMZ D-245.7, a gas (Steyr)-562, a Cummins 3.9 140 CIV, and an IVECO-8143, SOFIM. For economic reasons, preference was given to the Minsk D-245.7 modification (GAZ-33104). In 2006, production began on a 4-meter wheelbase version of the GAZ-331041. At the Moscow International Motor Show, an experimental version (GAZ-43483) was shown containing a reinforced chassis (GVW 8.5 tons and double) and a cabin designed for long-distance transport, together with a chassis for prospective models of small buses. In 2004-2006, the "Valdai" was created by experienced Russian makers of small buses ([[KAvZ|KAvZ - 32081]] and [[Pavlovo Bus Factory|PAZ-3202]]). Ukraine serially produced the small bus Galaz-3207, cars and the fire vehicle "Killer Whale".
