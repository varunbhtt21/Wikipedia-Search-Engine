Title : To Be Young, Gifted and Black (play)
Text : {{italic title}}
'''''To Be Young, Gifted and Black:''' Lorraine Hansberry in her Own Words'', was written by [[Lorraine Hansberry]], an American writer best known for her 1957 play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', a play that made Hansberry the first black author of a show on Broadway. After her death in 1965, Hansberry's ex-husband and friend, songwriter and poet Robert Nemiroff, collated her unpublished writings and adapted them into a stage play that first ran from 1968 to 1969 off Broadway. It was then converted into an equally successful autobiography with the same title.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Margaret B.

== Synopsis ==
The play was adapted from Lorraine's letters, interviews, and journal entries. It begins at the start of Lorraine's life, highlighting her early childhood in a Chicago ghetto to her college years and then later life, including the creation and inspiration for ''A Raisin in the Sun''. Her journey from Chicago to New York was complicated by obstacles she overcame in order to get her play on Broadway and incorporates fragments of her personal life, such as her marriage and involvement in politics (e.g., her strong support of racial and gender equality). The play concludes with her battle with terminal illness, from which she eventually died at 34.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Iris|title='To Be Young, Gifted and Black' Belongs More to the Page Than the Stage|url=http://www.backstage.com/review/la-theater/to-be-young-gifted-and-black-lorraine-hansberry-actors-co-op/|publisher=Backstage|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hansberry|first=Lorraine|title=To Be Young, Gifted and Black|url=http://hs.stdoms.org/ourpages/auto/2013/12/2/48425646/Lorraine%20Hansberry%20Letter%20text.pdf|publisher=Caedmon|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>
