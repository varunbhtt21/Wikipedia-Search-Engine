:({{Find sources|Carlos Rivera (General Hospital)}})
Article fails to meet the requirement of the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Soap Operas|WikiProject for Soap Operas]] for [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Soap Operas#Character articles|character articles]]. Article is not written to give a real-world prospect that other articles have given, and proven to achieve, and lacks a severe amount of [[WP:RELIABLE|reliable sources]] on the subject. The storyline and character history are written as if to give "storyline trivia" about the character of Carlos Rivera, which is frowned upon by the project. A previous article at [[List of General Hospital characters (2010s)#Carlos Rivera]] suits the character just fine.
