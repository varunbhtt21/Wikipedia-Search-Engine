The '''Pińsk Ghetto''' ({{lang-pl|Getto w Pińsku}}, {{lang-be|Пінскае гета}}) was a [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Nazi ghetto]] created by Nazi Germany for the confinement of [[Jews]] living in the city of [[Pińsk]], Western [[Belarus]]. Pińsk, located in [[Kresy|eastern Poland]], was [[Soviet invasion of Poland|occupied by the Red Army in 1939]] and incorporated into the [[Byelorussian SSR]]. The city was captured by the [[Wehrmacht]] in [[Operation Barbarossa]] in July 1941; it was incorporated into the German [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] in autumn of 1941.

In the 5–7 August 1941 massacre, 8,000 Jews were murdered just outside of Pińsk.{{sfn|Megargee|2012|pp=1442–43}}<ref>Azriel Shohet: [https://books.google.com/books?id=4uRTP8D7M7wC&pg=PA654&dq=%22police+battalion%22+pinsk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinvcrqkIfcAhVs0YMKHUf0D1AQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22police%20battalion%22%20pinsk&f=false ''The Jews of Pinsk, 1881 to 1941'']</ref> The subsequent [[Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland|creation of the ghetto]] was followed – over a year later – by the murder of the imprisoned Jewish population of Pińsk, totalling 26,000 victims: men, women and children.

==Background==
[[File:Kac 1924-10-19 Pinsk jews reading mishnah.jpg|thumb|Religious Jews of Pińsk in 1924]]
Poland [[National Independence Day|gained independence]] at the end of World War I.<ref name="TMP"/> In the April 1919 [[Pinsk massacre]], during the [[Polish–Soviet War]], the Polish garrison summarily executed 35 Jewish men without due process on the suspicion of plotting a pro-Soviet counterattack. It was a war crime never forgotten by the Jews of Pińsk.

In the subsequent decade the city grew to 23,497 inhabitants as part of the [[Polesie Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].<ref name="TMP"/> It was briefly declared the capital of the province in 1921 but a citywide fire resulted in the transfer of power to [[Brześć]] within months.<ref name="TMP">T.M.P., [http://www.polesie.polinfo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29&Itemid=33 Województwo Poleskie (Polesie Voivodeship),] [http://www.polesie.polinfo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29&Itemid=33&limitstart=1 (page two of current document).] 2014 Towarzystwo Miłośników Polesia w Gorzowie  Wlkp.

In 1939, following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in accordance with the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Pińsk and the surrounding territories were taken over by the Soviet Union. The [[NKVD]] secret police conducted raids and shut down all synagogues and shops. Mass deportations to Siberia followed.<ref name="Stosunki"/> At that time, the population became over 90% Jewish due to the influx of refugees from German-controlled western Poland.<ref name="Stosunki">Marek Wierzbicki, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080623073822/http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?secId=49&docId=60&&Rozdzial=historia Stosunki polsko-białoruskie pod okupacją sowiecką 1939–1941] (Polish-Belarusian relations under the Soviet {{nobreak|occupation 1939–41}}.

==German occupation==
On 22 June 1941 Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Advance forces of the Wehrmacht entered Pinsk on 4 July 1941. Christian inhabitants welcomed the German army as liberators from the Soviet regime, greeting them with bread and flowers. Under new anti-semitic regulations, Jews were forbidden to leave the city or shop in the market and were required to wear armbands with the Star of David. Random killings, beatings, looting, requisitions, and abduction of Jews for forced labour took place.{{sfn|Megargee|2012|p=1442}} 

A ''[[Judenrat]]'' (Jewish Council) was formed on 30 July 1941. On the night of 4 August, 300 Jews were detained in order to compel the Council to assemble Jews between the ages of 16 to 60, ostensibly for a labour detail. Thousands of men were marched out of the town and shot in prepared trenches. In the next two days, the Germans rounded up additional Jews, including younger boys and some women, who were also shot. By 8 August 1941, 8,000 Jews were murdered in this manner.{{sfn|Megargee|2012|pp=1442–43}}

==Ghetto resistance and liquidation==
The ghetto in Pińsk existed only for half a year, officially between 20 April and 29 October 1942,<ref name="Krawcowicz">Barbara Krawcowicz, [http://old.fzp.net.pl/historia1.html  Holocaust w Polsce – kalendarium.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427222029/http://old.fzp.net.pl/historia1.html |date=2014-04-27 }} Forum Żydów Polskich.</ref> much shorter than most [[Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland]].<ref name="Encyklopedia"/> The relocation action took place on 1 May 1942. Food was rationed, and a barbed-wire fence erected. The following month, in June 1942, the first murder operation took place there, with 3,500 Jews rounded up in Pińsk and nearby [[Kobryn|Kobryń]], and transported to [[Bronna Góra]] (the Bronna Mount) to be shot.<ref name="Encyklopedia"/> This was the location of secluded massacres of Jews transported by [[Holocaust train]]s  from the [[Brześć Ghetto]] as well.<ref name="Encyklopedia"/>

The Pińsk Ghetto's population swelled, with Jews deported en masse from all neighbouring settlements until food ran out. The liquidation of the ghetto began on 28 October 1942. The German motorized battalion met armed resistance from underground fighters,<ref name="Encyklopedia"/> which came as a complete shock to the [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|German police]]. The insurgents were shooting from secretly set-up bunkers, so reinforcements were brought in and massacres followed. According to the Nazi-issued final report, 17,000 Jews were killed during the insurgency, bringing the total to 26,200 victims before the ghetto's closure.<ref name="statistics">Statistical data compiled on the basis of [http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/selectcity/  "Glossary of 2,077 Jewish towns in Poland"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208215116/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/selectcity/ |date=2016-02-08 }} by ''[[Virtual Shtetl]]'' [[Museum of the History of the Polish Jews]] &nbsp;{{En icon}}, as well as [http://www.izrael.badacz.org/historia/szoa_getto.html  "Getta Żydowskie," by ''Gedeon'',] &nbsp;{{Pl icon}} and [http://www.deathcamps.org/occupation/ghettolist.htm "Ghetto List"] by Michael Peters at Deathcamps.org {{En icon}}.

After the war, Poland's [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|borders were redrawn]] and Pinsk became part of the Soviet Union. Some of the Jews who survived the Holocaust returned, but they were prohibited from reopening a synagogue. In the 1970s and 1980s, most of them emigrated.<ref name="Encyklopedia"/> Pinsk became part of independent Belarus in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 1999, only 317 Jews lived in the city.<ref name="Encyklopedia"/>
