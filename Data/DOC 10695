==Reception==
''Lock Charmer'' received positive reviews upon its premiere at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]]. Geoff Berkshire of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', said in his review that "Natalia Smirnoff's second feature is a wisp of melancholy comedy with a dose of magical realism."<ref>{{cite web |title=Film Review: ‘Lock Charmer’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-lock-charmer-1201090604/|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> Boyd van Hoeij in his review for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "A modest but quite charming feature about an Argentinean locksmith who unlocks truths about the lives of his clients."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Lock Charmer (El cerrajero): Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/lock-charmer-el-cerrajero-sundance-676279|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> Eric Kohn from ''[[Indiewire]]'' praised the film by saying that "Measured and never indulgent in its depiction of the plot's mystical ingredients, “Lock Charmer” does a great job at blending two genres and placing them in the strangeness of the 2008 setting" and praised the performances of Lamothe and Huaripata that "Lamothe portrays the locksmith as a man at once perturbed by the behavior of the women in his life and resentful towards his male role model — namely, his estranged father. The natural chemistry between him and Huaripata, as Daisy, matches the efficiency of the movie's direction."<ref>{{cite web |title=Sundance Review: 'Lock Charmer' Wonderfully Explores the Magic of Being Honest|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-the-lock-charmer-wonderfully-explores-the-magic-of-being-honest|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>
