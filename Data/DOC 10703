The result was    '''delete'''. I'm not officially calling this a merge, but If somebody wants to include some information from this article in [[Mayor of Faversham]], that would certainly fall under normal editorial discretion.  If you need reference to the deleted text, any admin will be able to get you a copy in your user space. -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 13:46, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

:({{Find sources|Harry Knowles (politician)}})
I've searched the major UK newspapers for more sources but can't find coverage to support any claim to notability other than what is presented in the article, ie Mayor of Faversham, Freedom of Faversham, Alderman of Faversham. On the face of it this seems to fail [[WP:GNG]] due to the coverage being essentially either local or a passing mention. Seems to fail [[WP:NPOL]] because it is a position of Mayor of a relatively small town (compared with say Mayor of London/Liverpool/Manchester which would be clearly notable). The absence of national coverage I think underlines this. Other examples of articles on Mayors of Kent towns seem to exist where there was an additional claim to notability such as being an [[Robert Vaughan Gower|MP]] of the national parliament, or one case of a famous [[Thomas_Arden|murderee]] who was written about for that reason - but in this case I can't see what the claim could be based on.

::I'm a bit puzzled by this vote. In the absence of any significant content about the position itself outside a list of people who have done that job, isn't [[Mayor of Faversham]] effectively a [[WP:LSC|stand alone list]] which should follow [[WP:NLIST]] meaning that we apply [[WP:BASIC]] to determine whether we should include a given mayor in the list?  If we agree that Knowles is not sufficiently notable for a standalone article, thus failing [[WP:BASIC]], then copying the content to that list seems not to be based on the guidelines. --[[User:nonsenseferret|''<sub><font color="green" size="1px">nonsense</font></sub>'']] [[User talk:nonsenseferret|<font color="BF1BE0" size="1px">ferret</font>]] 11:45, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
