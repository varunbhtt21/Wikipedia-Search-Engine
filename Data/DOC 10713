Top 40 singles show (IRMA charts are used as far as I can make-out), with presenters speaking in Irish, broadcast on several radio stations, but I cant find any notability, unique as it seems, just stuff like [http://www.redfm.ie/shows/top-40-oifigiuil-na-heireann/  this on redfm] or [http://www.digitalaudioproductions.com/radio-shows/ this from the prodution company]. The only notable one I fund is the independent article used on the page.
