:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Article created by Rosiestep on April 27, 2014 with text only: 3,887 characters of readable prose. Well supported by inline references. I think the long quote from Staël which is in public domain could be shortened a bit. The source of quote in the hook can be [https://www.google.ca/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=%22Twayne's+world+authors+series%22+%22captivated+Europe%22&=  confirmed here.] The painting is copyright free but the "PD-Art" template at Commons needs a small touch-up. Good to go as is. Thanks, [[User:Poeticbent|<font face="Papyrus" color="darkblue"><b>Poeticbent</b></font>]] [[User_talk:Poeticbent|<font style="font-size:7.0pt;color:#FFFFFF;font-weight:bold;background:#FF88AF;border:1px solid #DF2929;padding:0.0em 0.2em;">talk</font>]] 14:56, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::*A friendly FYI that I did shorten the quote a little bit. If anyone wants to shorten it further, please go for it. --[[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) 01:22, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
