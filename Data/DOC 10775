*'''delete''' I think I've figured out who the sole reference refers to but this phrase is not used in conjunction with that name. I don't see a way to salvage the current content, as the article was created in a single edit seven years ago by an editor who hasn't been active since, and all subsequent edits have been tagging/untagging and minor formatting changes.

*'''Delete''' - I can't find any references to this term outside of wikipedia. [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 14:54, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I'm a software engineer and I've never heard the term. A Google search returns the Wikipedia article, another wikipedia article and then an article on hardwood flooring! --[[User:MadScientistX11|MadScientistX11]] ([[User talk:MadScientistX11|talk]]) 20:54, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
