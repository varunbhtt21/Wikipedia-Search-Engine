The complex consists of two parts named Piruro I and Piruro II.  This archaeological zone has had a long occupation, its first vestiges date from 3000 to 2500 years B.C ([[Andean preceramic|Final Preceramic]]) and they extend until the [[Inca Empire]] ([[Periodization of pre-Columbian Peru|Late Horizon]]).<ref name=":0" />

The Fortress of Piruro II can be found in the right side of the river Tantamayo over 3.8&nbsp;km over the sea level, the first archaeological inspections of the fortress happened during the explorations of [[Bertrand Flornoy|Bertrand Flornov]] around the years 1957 and 1975 and excavations are attributed to Lois Girault between the years 1968 and 1970, the carbon dating from those examinations give a date between 1930 and 2100 years B.C. meaning this fortress was built in the [[Andean preceramic|pre-ceramic period]], Girault found architectonic remnants of hewn stones that seem similar to those found in [[Kotosh]] and certain walls located in [[Chavín culture|Chavin]]. The fortress is composed of walls build with stones hewn in squared shape and uniform size. The building is composed of 5 floors, where the front of it has rectangular doors and windows. In the front of the building there is a large-scale clearance that shapes a park because in the center of it there are remnants of a stone and mud structure covered by the ground. Currently the building is fenced by stone walls of 1 1/2 meters in height were two rectangular doors protrude, there also is a 4-meter height stone tower near the place where some stones bulge in the backside of the structure that were used as a makeshift ladder.<ref name=":0" />
