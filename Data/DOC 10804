==Life==
Cárdenas got his first job in operations at [[XEEW-AM|XEEW]] radio in Matamoros and worked at the El Bernal shredding plant in González as he pursued a degree in business administration from the [[Universidad Autónoma de Tamaulipas]].<ref name="sil"/> He also became the director general of a hotel in [[Ciudad Victoria]] and of Cerámica Santa Mónica, S.A. de C.V.

In the early 1990s, Cárdenas ran for and won the municipal presidency of Ciudad Victoria, serving from 1993 to 1995. This first public office propelled his political career; he was a local deputy to the LVI Legislature of the Congress of Tamaulipas between 1996 and 1998 and was the PAN's gubernatorial candidate in 1998 and 2004.<ref name="sil"/> Between 1999 and 2000, he was the president of the PAN in Tamaulipas, leaving that position to make a successful bid for the Senate. In the [[LVIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress|LVIII]] and [[LIX Legislature of the Mexican Congress|LIX]] Legislatures, he was the President of the Tourism Commission and sat on those dealing with Social Development and Economic Development.<ref name="sil"/> He cut his Senate term short in order to pursue a second bid for governor, which failed.<ref name="sil"/>

In 2006, Cárdenas returned to the federal legislature, this time as a deputy in the [[LX Legislature of the Mexican Congress|LIX Legislature]]. He sat on the commissions for Tourism; Population, Borders and Migratory Matters; Special for the Bicentennial of Independence and Centennial of the Revolution; and Special for Attention to Forest Peoples.<ref name="sil"/> From 2007 to 2010, he worked in ASERCA (Aid and Service to Agricultural Marketing), a division of [[SAGARPA]].<ref name="sil"/>

2013 marked the end of Cárdenas's tenure in the PAN. He was considered by the party as its potential candidate for municipal president of Ciudad Victoria; when the PAN selected another candidate, he left the party and accepted Movimiento Ciudadano's invitation to run under its banner instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://daviddorantes.mx/gustavo-cardenas-deja-el-pan/|title=Gustavo Cárdenas deja el PAN|work=David Dorantes|first=David|last=Dorantes|date=2013-03-26|accessdate=2016-08-12}}</ref> Cárdenas finished second but lost by 9,000 votes to {{Interlanguage link multi|Alejandro Etienne|es}}, of a PRI-PVEM coalition.<ref>{{cite news|work=Últimas Noticias|url=http://www.ultimasnoticiasenred.com.mx/local/alejandro-etienne-ya-es-alcalde-electo/|date=2013-07-10|title=Alejandro Etienne ya es Alcalde electo|accessdate=2016-08-12}}</ref> In 2014, Cárdenas became the coordinator of MC's State Operating Commission in Tamaulipas.<ref name="sil"/>

On February 23, 2016, Cárdenas took leave from the Chamber of Deputies in order to pursue his third bid for [[Governor of Tamaulipas]], being temporarily replaced in the legislature by his alternate, Daniel Adrián Sosa Carpio; the MC bid came in a distant third to the PRI and PAN candidacies, pulling in 5.8 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://noticias.terra.com/mundo/latinoamerica/prep-tamaulipas-2016-resultados-preliminares-elecciones-para-gobernador-ietam-5-de-junio,9d1bb8c35c5e9264b5979289323d6c74gg4u23fe.html|title=PREP Tamaulipas 2016: Resultados preliminares elección para gobernador|date=2016-06-06|work=Terra|accessdate=2016-08-12}}</ref>
