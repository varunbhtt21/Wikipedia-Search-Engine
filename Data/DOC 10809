Title : William Davy (lawyer)
Text : '''William Davy''' [[Serjeant-at-Law|SL]] (died 1780) was an English [[barrister]] during the 18th century. Known as "Bull" Davy, he was noted as quick-witted, with a ready sense of humour, but, according to one author, relatively unscrupulous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2005|p=116}}</ref>

According to [[Humphry William Woolrych]], he was originally either a grocer or a [[pharmacist]] before being declared bankrupt and learning the doctrines around ''[[nisi prius]]'', for which much study was not required.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woolrych|1970|p=605}}</ref> He was admitted to the [[Inner Temple]] on 16 October 1741.

Early in his career was responsible for prosecuting [[Elizabeth Canning]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Woolrych|1869|p=606}}</ref> Davy became a Serjeant-at-Law on 11 February 1754, and soon after became involved in prosecutions under the [[Black Act]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Woolrych|1970|p=616}}</ref> In 1762 he became [[King's Serjeant]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2005|p=117}}</ref> then the highest accolade for a barrister.

Davy argued that "the air (of England) is too pure for a slave to breathe in"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2005|p=139}}</ref> when he represented [[James Somerset]], an escaped African slave come from Boston whose London godparents had sued for a writ of ''[[Habeas Corpus]]'', in ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]''.  This case was one of the first tests of ''Habeas Corpus'' when the gaoler had no colour of state; the writ had been conceived in  the midst of the English Civil War as the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]], in order to defend the subject from government tyranny.  Similar uses are seen today in India, where the confinement is in a [[madrasa]].<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece thehindu.com: "‘Love Jihad’: court unhappy with probe" 27 Oct 2009]</ref>

Davy died on 13 December 1780,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2005|p=222}}</ref> and was buried in [[Newington Butts]].<ref name = "wool632">{{Harvnb|Woolrych|1970|p=632}}</ref>
