The result of the discussion was '''moot'''. Page replaced with a sock tag. The disruptiveness in the edit history has been RD3'd as pure disruption.&nbsp;[[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 08:18, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

This falls under MfD, not being in English, and when I used Google Translate on it, the page is claiming that he was unfairly banned, and that this is an alternate account. Apart from that, the entire page is made up of a vulgar rant against those that harmed him. Before, the page was made up of disruptive images, showing that the page creator does not have good faith towards Wikipedia. Listing the person at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Pszczolka Maja1, as he claims to be an alt of Toma646, who is a sockpuppet of Pszczolka Maja1.

*<s>'''Delete''' unless I get a convincing response to my request on the author's talk page. (I requested removal or explanation...). [[User:Peridon|Peridon]] ([[User talk:Peridon|talk]]) 20:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</s>
:Satisfactory change made. [[User:Peridon|Peridon]] ([[User talk:Peridon|talk]]) 12:45, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Page is now in English, and now you can see the vulgarity in full form. Could an admin close this, so I can list this under CSD? [[User:123chess456|123chess456]] ([[User talk:123chess456|talk]]) 21:14, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
