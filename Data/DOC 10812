'''Vanna Bonta''' (April 3, 1953 – July 8, 2014) was an Italian-American writer, actress, and inventor. She wrote ''[[Flight: A Quantum Fiction Novel]]''. As an actress, Bonta played "Zed's Queen" in ''[[The Beastmaster]]''. She performed primarily as a voice talent on a roster of feature films, such as Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', as well as on television. Bonta invented the [[2suit]], a flight garment designed to facilitate [[human intimacy]] and stability in [[microgravity]] environments of outerspace. The spacesuit was featured on ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe television series]]'', which followed Bonta into zero gravity to film an episode titled ''[[Sex in Space]]'' that aired in 2009 on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].<ref name="Lo spazio">{{cite news|last=Scaturro|first=Giorgia|title=Lo spazio, mai stato così sexy|url=http://daily.wired.it/news/scienza/lo-spazio-mai-stato-cosi-sexy.html?page=1|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=27 April 2009}}</ref>

On 13 November 2013, a haiku by Bonta was one of 1,100 haiku launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] on the NASA spacecraft [[MAVEN]] to Mars.<ref name="Boulder haiku" />

==Early life and family==
Bonta was born in the United States to Maria Luisa Bonta (née Ugolini), an artist from [[Florence, Italy]], and James Cecil Bonta, a military officer from [[Kentucky]]. Her mother's elder sister was Italian children's author Lidia Ugolini.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Literary career==

In 1995, Bonta's first novel, ''[[Flight: A Quantum Fiction Novel]]'' was published. ''Flight'' has been characterized as "inter-genre" (belonging to more than one genre simultaneously) by the [[American Library Association]], which reviewed it an "auspicious, genre-bending parable".<ref name=booklist>{{cite news|title=Flight, by Vanna Bonta|url=http://www.booklistonline.com/Flight-Vanna-Bonta/pid=633821|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=BookList|date=June 1995}}</ref> ''Publishers Weekly'' described the debut work as running the gamut of particularly moving to quirky and hilarious satire, with "asides about bathtub books, self-doubt tapes and other foibles."<ref name=bonta>{{cite news|title=Flight: A Quantum Fiction Novel|url=http://www.pw.org/content/vanna_bonta|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=2 January 1995}}</ref>

In 2013, a haiku Bonta wrote was one of over 1100 that was launched to [[Mars]] on the NASA spacecraft [[MAVEN]].<ref name="Time mag coverage">{{cite news|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|title=NASA is sending these poems to Mars|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/08/09/nasa-is-sending-these-poems-to-mars/|accessdate=27 May 2014|newspaper=Time|date=9 August 2013}}</ref> The haikus for the Mars trip were chosen by popular vote from a total 12,530 submissions.

==Inventions==

===The 2suit===

In 2006, Bonta gave talks about an invention she called the [[2suit]], a flight garment that can be attached to another 2suit to allow two or more people to stay in proximity to one another in low-gravity environments. Although it had several other potential applications, its primary purpose was to enable [[sex in space]]. Producers of the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] television series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]'' approached Bonta in 2008, offering to manufacture a prototype of the 2suit and send Bonta into zero gravity to test it. She accepted. On the 2suit's segment of the episode, Bonta and her husband demonstrated how the suit works by kissing while installed in it.<ref name="Foreign policy blog">{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Uri|title=Is Newt's zero-gravity sex idea any good?|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/01/26/is_newts_zero_gravity_sex_idea_any_good|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=ForeignPolicy.com|date=26 January 2012}}</ref> The documentary concluded that the "2Suit is one small step for humankind colonizing the universe."<ref name="history channel broadcast on youtube">{{cite news|title=The Universe: Sex in space|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-Fl7KM7A88|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=History Channel}}</ref> The 2suit received significant media attention after the episode, titled ''Sex in Space'', aired in 2009.<ref name="wired article">{{cite news|last=Scaturro|first=Giorgia|title=A two-seater suit for space-lovers|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-04/30/a-two-seater-suit-for-space-lovers.aspx|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=Wired.com|date=30 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505020959/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-04/30/a-two-seater-suit-for-space-lovers.aspx|archive-date=5 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="alan boyle on 2suit">{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Alan |title=Outer-space sex carries complications |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14002908/%20Outer-space%20sex%20carries%20complications |accessdate=12 May 2014 |newspaper=NBC news.com |date=27 July 2006}}</ref><ref name="german interview on 2suit">{{cite news|title=Haben Astronauten eigentlich Sex im All?|url=http://www.bild.de/news/2010/sex/space-shuttle-kommandant-poindexter-sagt-nein-13120432.bild.html|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=Bild.de|date=7 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="italian article about 2suit">{{cite news|title=Sexo no espaço intriga pesquisadores|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI1078906-EI238,00.html%20Sexo%20no%20espa%C3%A7o%20intriga%20pesquisadores|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=Noticias.terra.com|date=24 July 2006}}</ref><ref name="quarks to quasars">{{cite web |title=The Complications of Sex in Space |url=https://futurism.com/the-complications-of-sex-in-space |accessdate=7 January 2018 |website=Futurism |date=6 September 2014 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909152747/https://futurism.com/the-complications-of-sex-in-space |archivedate=2018-09-09}}</ref><ref name="russians on 2suit">{{cite news|last=Ambruš-Kiš|first=Miroslav|title=Seks u svemiru?
