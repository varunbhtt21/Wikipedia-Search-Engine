== Review ==
On this album Johnson show even more exquisit landscapes in improvisational music. ''Magic Labyrinth'' brings together individual compositions by the musician, one collaborative work between Johnson, Muthspiel and Tunçboyaciyan, and additional two delicate compositions by [[Miles Davis]] and [[Hermeto Pascoal]]. Downbeat praised the album for its "excursions to the more adventurous and angular regions of improvisational jazz".<ref name=birdland/>
