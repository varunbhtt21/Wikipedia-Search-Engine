'''''Chicago XXXVI: Now''''', sometimes stylized as ''"NOW" Chicago XXXVI'' or ''Now: Chicago XXXVI'', is the twenty-fourth studio album, and thirty-sixth overall by [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]. It was written and recorded in 2013—2014, and was released on July 4, 2014. Aside from the occasional few new tracks found in the band's many compilation and cover albums, ''Now'' is the band's next full album of new compositions in the eight years since 2006's ''[[Chicago XXX]]'',<ref name="Grow the Legacy at Something Else"/> and it is the next release of original material following 2008's fifteen-year-delayed ''[[Chicago XXXII: Stone of Sisyphus]]''.<ref name="Something and Watching, SER"/> This album has the first original Chicago credits for veteran musicians [[Walfredo Reyes, Jr.]] and [[Lou Pardini]], since joining the band.

==Production==
The album was produced in a geographically distributed, "[[Just in time (business)#Benefits|just-in-time]]"<ref name="Something and Watching, SER"/> fashion. Noted by the band's cofounder [[Robert Lamm]] as "a very sort of disjointed way to work",<ref name="Grow the Legacy at Something Else"/> ''Now''{{'}}s production model was largely enabled by a fully mobile system of the band's own design called "The Rig".  It was recorded primarily in hotels and secondarily in studios along the band's American tour, constructed mostly from each musician's isolated performances between concert dates, and then synchronized via a private [[Web portal]] site for final overdubbing by coordinating producer and engineer Hank Linderman.  The band's songwriting members are each respectively credited as each track's "supervising producer".<ref name="Chicago XXXVI liner notes"/>

Even throughout the album's year-long development, audio preview clips of each track were progressively released via the public Internet — some before they were completed by the addition of the band's signature brass section.<ref name="Something and Watching, SER"/> The first preview, "Naked in the Garden of Allah", was released in April 2013, the album was finally made available for preorder in April 2014, and was released July 2014.<ref name="Naked review, SER"/>

{{quotation|The ultimate goal was to make music — and now we’re doing that. We’re going to see how far we can go with this. Thank goodness we have 46 years of track record behind us. We’re just trying to grow the legacy even more.|Chicago cofounder, [[Lee Loughnane]], on ''Now''<ref name="Grow the Legacy at Something Else"/>}}

==Reception==
{{Album ratings

}}
Beginning in April 2013, the Something Else! webzine engaged the band's progressively released preview clips. They said that "Naked in the Garden of Allah" "reanimates" the band's early "cutting" political messages, wherein "the lyrics, and the song’s turbulent textures, speak to both the horrors of war and to Lamm’s enduring pleas for peace".<ref name="Naked review, SER"/>  "Watching All the Colors" is said to resemble [[Robert Lamm]]'s 2008 solo sessions from ''The Bossa Project'', and "Something's Coming, I Know" "rumbles along with a more scuffed-up cadence — until it’s broken up by this sun-streaked, Beatlesque bridge".<ref name="Something and Watching, SER"/>  Recorded on the tour bus, [[Tris Imboden]]'s drums on "Crazy Happy" are said to "sound modern and appropriate for the song and mesh seamlessly". They complement the album's percussion, as provided by "the great Walfredo Reyes Jr."<ref name="Crazy Happy, SER"/>

It entered the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at #82.<ref name="Billboard 200: Chicago"/>

Allmusic's Stephen Erlewine assigned 3.5 stars out of 5, calling the album "united in sound and sensibility, anchored upon the splashy horn-fueled jazz-pop they pioneered in the '70s but usually returning to the slick professional adult contemporary of the '80s", with songs that are "big, smooth, cheerful, and bright, emphasizing melody over instrumental interplay, explicitly evoking the past without re-creating it".<ref name="Chicago XXXVI overview, Allmusic"/>
