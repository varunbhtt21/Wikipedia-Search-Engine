"'''Onward, Christian Pilgrims'''" is a 20th-century [[Christians|Christian]] [[hymn]] by David Wright. It was composed in 1982, is based on "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]", and was intended as a non-militaristic version of the earlier hymn.

== History ==
"Onward, Christian Soldiers" was written in 1865 and uses [[New Testament military metaphors]] of [[Miles Christianus|Christians as soldiers]].<ref>{{cite book|title=God's Church Made Simple |first=James Edward |last=Smith |publisher=Lulu.com |year=2009 |ISBN=0557135710 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HfoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA44}}</ref> In the 1980s there was a growing movement against the notion of Christian military references, leading to some churches in the United States dropping it from their hymn books.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ari L. |last=Goldman |authorlink=Ari L.

== Criticism ==
"Onward, Christian Pilgrims" has been criticized as having been born out of a perceived need to change older hymns to be modernised or more [[Political correctness|politically correct]]. "Onward, Christian Pilgrims" is viewed as a politically correct version of "Onward, Christian Soldiers".<ref>{{cite news |first=Francis |last=Wood |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Church+matters.-a0110845853 |title=Church matters |work=[[Evening Chronicle]] |location=Newcastle |publisher=archived at The Free Library |date=2003-11-29 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref> It was suggested in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper that the new hymn was created because of a misreading of "Onward, Christian Soldiers" as being just a commemoration of militaristic Christianity.<ref name=tele /> Some members of the Church of England also objected to "Onward, Christian Pilgrims", which led to new hymn books being issued to certain parishes with "Onward, Christian Soldiers" replacing the new hymn in them.<ref>{{cite web |first=Frank R. |last=McManus |url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2009/24-april/comment/letters-to-the-editor/a-place-for-%E2%80%98onward,-christian-soldiers%E2%80%99 |title=A place for 'Onward, Christian soldiers' |work=[[Church Times]] |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>
