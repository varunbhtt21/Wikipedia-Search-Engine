'''Cláudio Assis''' (born December 19, 1959) is a Brazilian [[filmmaker]]. He was born in [[Caruaru]], in the state of [[Pernambuco]], and went to [[Recife]], the state's capital, when he was 17. There, he started to attend for Economics and Communication studies, but he felt "totally incompatible" with its structure. After working as assistant in some production, he went to direct his own short films: ''Padre Henrique - Um Crime Político'' (1987), ''Soneto do Desmantelo Blue'' (1993), ''Viva o Cinema'' (1996), and ''Texas Hotel'' (1999). The latter served as inspiration for his first feature film ''[[Mango Yellow]]'', which was released in 2002,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/ilustrad/fq2707200309.htm | title=Filme une diretor "caótico" e ator "raro" | author=Arantes, Silvana | date=July 27, 2003 | work=[[Folha de S.Paulo]] | publisher=Grupo Estado | accessdate=April 27, 2014 | language=Portuguese}}</ref> winning several awards including the Best Film at the [[Festival de Brasília]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.estadao.com.br/arquivo/arteelazer/2002/not20021127p1882.htm | title=Festival de Brasília consagra "Amarelo Manga" | date=November 27, 2002 | work=[[O Estado de S.
