:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough, QPQ checks out. I'm not that happy about the hook - it is clearly just one writer's suggestion. I would think something like this would be better:
:::'''ALT1''': ... that "'''[[Onward, Christian Pilgrims]]'''" has replaced "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]" in some British [[hymnal]]s?
::[[User:StAnselm|<b>St</b>]][[Special:Contributions/StAnselm|Anselm]] ([[User talk:StAnselm|talk]]) 12:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Fine. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 07:00, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The ALT hook is verified and cited inline. However, I don't think the article is complete. It really should say something about the lyrics, perhaps doing a few line-by-line comparisons with the original hymn. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 00:50, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::*{{ping|Yoninah}} I can't list all of them since I think they're copyrighted but I have made a comparison of the choruses. Is this what you were looking for? <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 08:11, 6 May 2014 (UTC)  
:::::*Yes. I added from another source as well. Could you check to see that the formatting is to your liking before I approve the nomination? Thanks, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 10:28, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::*I have no problem with that format, though you have duplicated it when I think it only needs to be said once. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 10:38, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::*I see that the first line appears in both the first stanza and chorus of "Onward, Christian Soldiers", but these lines differ in "Onward, Christian Pilgrims". Do you know how to format the lyrics side by side for comparison? [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 10:41, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*I've put in a table showing the two side by side. Is that OK? <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 11:06, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Perfect! New enough, long enough, well referenced, no close paraphrasing seen. QPQ done. Hook ref verified and cited inline. ALT1 good to go. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 11:35, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] This is a bit of a nitpick, but the article doesn't actually say anything about replacing "Onward, Christian Soldiers" in UK hymn books - only that it written as a version of it & that it was published in said books.  Could you tweak either the hook or the article? --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 03:52, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
**That's why it says "some British hymnbooks", not just "British hymnbooks". <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 07:28, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
***'''Alt2'''<s>... that "'''[[Onward, Christian Pilgrims]]'''" was viewed as a politically correct version of "Onward, Christian Soldiers"?</s>
**** ThaddeusB, I don't see how the hook contradicts the article. The hymn was replaced in Anglican and British crematorium hymnbooks &ndash; that's the "some British hymnals" in the hook &ndash; and IMO, the ALT1 hook is quite hooky. ALT2 is not sourced; it is just one blogger's opinion. I think we should stick with ALT1. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 17:11, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*****I think he may have misread it. Could you please re-add the green tick if you think there isn't a problem? <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 17:52, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
******[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] ALT1 reconfirmed as good to go. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 19:39, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
******[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] My apologies.  You are correct - I misread something last night. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 21:06, 7 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
