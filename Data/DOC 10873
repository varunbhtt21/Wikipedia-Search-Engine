'''Richmond Town Hall''' is the [[town hall]] of [[Richmond, New Hampshire]].  It is located on the east side of  [[New Hampshire Route 32]], about one mile north of its junction with [[New Hampshire Route 119]].  Built in 1780, and originally used for both civic and religious purposes, it is one of the oldest [[meeting house]]s in the state.  It is a plain white clapboarded structure measuring {{convert|30|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|40|ft|m}} long.  Its religious trappings (pews and pulpit) were removed in 1884, at which time the rear gallery space was adapted to house town offices, and a stage was added to the auditorium in place of the pulpit.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=79000273}}|title=NRHP nomination for Richmond Town Hall|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>
