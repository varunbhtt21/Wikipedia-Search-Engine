'''The Manitoba tuck''' is a form of slide in [[curling]]. A tuck under is when the curler's front toe is the only part of the slider that comes into contact with the ice. The slide is used almost exclusively by curlers from the province of [[Manitoba]] though tuck curlers are also found in nearby regions of [[Saskatchewan]] and the US state of [[North Dakota]].<ref name=tuckers>{{cite news |title=Team of 'tuckers' |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/curling/team-of-tuckers-371331851.html |author=Paul Wiecek |publisher=''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' |date=March 7, 2016}}</ref>
