'''Clontead House''' is a dwelling in [[Clontead Beg]] townland, {{convert|1.1|km|mi|abbr=on}}s east of [[Coachford]] village.

During the late eighteenth century, it was the residence of Rev. Simon Davies, Rector of Magourney.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greene, A.|title=The Church of Ireland in Magourney Parish|journal=Coachford Record|date=Dec 1991|volume= 2}}</ref> The Ordnance Survey name book (c. 1840) refers to Clontead House and demesne being in the southern part of the townland and the property is also named as 'Clontade House'. It is depicted as Clontead House, both in the 1842 and 1901 surveyed OS maps.
