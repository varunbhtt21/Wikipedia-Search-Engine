Article was nominated for AfD in 2012 but the discussion was closed after only one contribution (which was from a single purpose account writing articles about [[Henning Larsen Architects]]). Article makes no particular claim to notability, Steffensen seems only to be a senior member of staff at the architectural practice. Publishing a book and lecturing at a university seem insufficient to pass [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:CREATIVE]] notability criteria. [[User:Sionk|Sionk]] ([[User talk:Sionk|talk]]) 20:49, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete or redirect''' to [[:Henning Larsen Architects]] as suggested by [[User:Candleabracadabra]]. I am not finding [[:WP:RS|evidence]] of individual notability for this person. (Note there is an investment manager of the same name about whom more coverage can be found.) [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 20:05, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. No evidence of passing [[WP:CREATIVE]] has been supplied. The only thing I can see that looks like it could lead to notability is publication of a monograph of his drawings, but to be notable for that we need multiple reliably published reviews of it. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 22:26, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
