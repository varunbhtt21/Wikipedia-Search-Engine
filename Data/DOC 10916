'''Azkajwar II''' (died 712) was the ruler of the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarezm]] from an unknown date to 712. He was the son and successor of [[Sabri of Khwarezm|Sabri]]. Azkajwar II is agreed by most scholars to be the same person as king '''Jigan''' or '''Chigan'''.<ref name="MarshakO">Marshak (1994), pp. 235-236</ref> In most medieval sources, he is simply called ''Khwarazmshah'' (king of Khwarazm).

Azkajwar is first mentioned in the mid-690s, when his kingdom was invaded by [[Umayya ibn Abdallah]], who was the [[Abbasid]] governor of [[Khurasan]]. Azkajwar's capital, [[Kath (city)|Kath]], was shortly captured Umayya, who forced Azkajwar to recognize Abbasid suzerainty. However, after Umayya left Khwarazm, Azkajwar declared independence from the Abbasid Caliphate. During the early 700s, [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]], the new Abbasid governor of Khurasan, invaded Khwarazm but was eventually repulsed by the forces of Azkajwar.<ref>Nerazik & Bulgakov (1996), pp. 228–229</ref>

Azkajwar is later mentioned in 712, when he was faced by a rebellion of his younger brother [[Khurrazadh]], and had tensions with his rival, the king of Khamjird. Unable to solve his problems, he secretly sent envoys to the new Abbasid governor of Khwarazm, [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]],<ref name="CentralAsia458">Litvinsky, Jalilov & Kolesnikov (1996), p. 458</ref><ref>Gibb (1923), p. 42</ref><ref name="Wellhausen436">Wellhausen (1927), p. 436</ref> who was at that time in [[Merv]].<ref name="MarshakV">Marshak (1994), p. 234</ref> Azkajwar and Qutayba shortly made an agreement that Azkajwar would recognize Abbasid authority in return for military aid against his brother. Qutayba shortly sent an army under his brother Abd al-Rahman to [[Hazarasp]], where he defeated and killed the king of Khamjird, and captured 4,000 of his soldiers, who were shortly executed. Meanwhile, Qutayba defeated the supporters of Khurrazadh and captured the latter, who was given to Azkajwar who shortly had him executed.<ref>Nerazik & Bulgakov (1996), pp. 229–230</ref><ref>Gibb (1923), pp. 42–43</ref>

However, an anti-Abbasid rebellion shortly broke out in Khwarazm, which resulted in the overthrow and death of Askajwar, and the coronation of an Afrighid prince named [[Khusrau of Khwarezm|Khusrau]] as the king of Khwarazm. However, Khusrau was shortly defeated and killed by the Abbasids, who made Azkajwar's son [[Askajamuk II]] the new ruler of Khwarazm.
