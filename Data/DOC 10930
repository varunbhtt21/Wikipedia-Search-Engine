'''Soldsie''' is a social [[Ecommerce|eCommerce]] platform based in San Francisco, CA. Co-founders Chris Bennett (CEO) and Arrel Gray (CTO) met through the startup community of Silicon Valley in 2011. They officially launched Soldsie in May 2012 at a time when the viability of 
f-Commerce was still being questioned by the industry. The founders of Soldsie were able to show that Facebook commerce is a viable form of social commerce when it wasnâ€™t just another tab on a retailer's Facebook page for users to click onto.<ref name="techcrunch1">{{cite web|author=Sarah Perez|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/15/soldsie-the-service-that-lets-you-shop-via-facebook-and-instagram-comments-raises-4-million/ |title=Soldsie, The Service That Lets You Shop Via Facebook And Instagram Comments, Raises $4 Million |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref>
