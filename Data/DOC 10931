:({{Find sources|Ming Jiang}})
Biography of a non-notable academic. The article reads like a résumé and indeed the only cited source is the subject's résumé. He does not meet [[WP:GNG]] and though he has some awards I do not believe they are big enough, or that he has made sufficient impact, for him to qualify under [[WP:PROF]].

*'''Delete''', it indeed reads like a resume and is cited to his resume. He's a Senior member of the IEEE but not a Fellow, so falls (just) short of meeting [[WP:PROF]] notability criteria. But he's obviously a possibility for Fellowship in the future. Not notable yet. [[User:Sionk|Sionk]] ([[User talk:Sionk|talk]]) 21:15, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak delete''' there are some high cites on [[Google scholar]] for Ming Jiang, but I'm not sure that it is right person. Would the nominator like to come up with an [[h-index]]? [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 01:43, 29 April 2014 (UTC).
**'''Comment'''. I think [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author%3Aming-jiang+%22School+of+Mathematical+Sciences%2C+Peking+University%22 this] is a reasonably accurate search. It at least seems to cut out all the other Ming Jiangs but I suspect it misses some of his publications. Anyway, it gets citation numbers (in some strange unsorted order) of 252, 226, 70, 46, 44, 43, 39, 29, 24, 24, ... and an h-index of 12. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 02:00, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks. That would be a reasonably good index for a pure mathematician. I am not so sure in computer mathematics. Too early? [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 02:30, 29 April 2014 (UTC).
*'''Comment''' Just to reiterate an obvious point: it's irrelevant what his h-index is if there are no independent [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].  We just cannot write a [[WP:V|verifiable]] article without them, however much we might want to.  This is of course particularly important for a [[WP:BLP|living person]].

* '''Delete''' <s>'''Comment'''</s> Chinese Wikipedia doesn't mention him. He has an [http://baike.baidu.com/subview/682314/6647115.htm entry on Baidu] but that fails [[WP:RS]]. There is a lengthy quote from him at the Microsoft China Research website [http://www.msra.cn/Articles/ArticleItem.aspx?Guid=fe180ace-62a6-4d3e-92a9-a4b0a1ec0eaa here] but nothing else notable that jumps out from a Chinese Google search.

*'''Weak delete'''. So far I don't find the evidence for [[WP:PROF]] convincing. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 15:27, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
