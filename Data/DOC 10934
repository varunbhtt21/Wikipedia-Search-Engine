I think either a redirect or merge might be the best for this article-as there is very little in this article. (I think merge is the best option [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:03, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
Or a userfy-but right now it looks like a deletion or merge. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:04, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''redirect''' to [[Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein]] which already has more information than is in this article. Sources seem to differ about whether it's a solo project of his (in which case definitely it makes sense to redirect/merge), or a group (in which case we go by notability). But there's not a lot of coverage of Doyle or the album in the bigger music publications, it's mainly small magazines/websites and the occasional interview. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 09:18, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-Yeah I'm leaning towards redirect actually. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 14:34, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
