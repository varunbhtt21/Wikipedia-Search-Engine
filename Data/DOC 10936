:({{Find sources|Chinese food therapy}})
A one-sentence article which fails to establish its significance or indeed show that it is considered to be a distinct entity apart from TCM or Chinese diet more generally. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 21:03, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' Not enough content to prove notability [[User:Shii|Shii]] [[user_talk:Shii|(tock)]] 21:29, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment''': I'm finding some stuff out there that specifically focuses on the dietary angle, but I agree that I'm somewhat wondering if it should be included in the overall TCM article since that seems to be the major focus of the stuff I'm finding.

* '''Strong keep''' – I see why an article created in 2002 that is still two-lines long in 2014 would be submitted for AfD, but there are plenty of [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] out there to prove notability. (And I'm putting aside the five sources that are already cited in the article.) Ute Engelhardt's "Dietetics in Tang China and the first extant works of ''materia dietetica''" (in ''Innovation in Chinese Medicine'', Cambridge University Press, 2001) shows that the ''shiliao'' tradition goes back a long way. See also Vivienne Lo, "Pleasure, Prohibition, and Pain: Food and Medicine in China", in ''Of Tripod and Palate: Food, Politics, and Religion in Traditional China'' (Palgrave MacMillan, 2005). There are two interesting vignettes on food therapy in TJ Hinrichs and Linda Barnes (editors), ''Chinese Medicine and Healing: An Illustrated History'' (Harvard UP, 2013; see "Folk Nutritional Therapy" on pp. 259-260, and "Food Therapy" on pp. 339-341). For modern China, see Nancy Chen's ''Food, Medicine, and the Quest for Good Health: Nutrition, Medicine, and Culture'' (Columbia UP, 2013). Abundant "Oprah" kind of literature is also listed in [[Talk:Chinese food therapy#Recomended References]] (''sic''). I think this is more than enough to prove notability. The address the nominator's and {{u|Tokyogirl79}}'s other concern, this topic is related to but distinct from [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], as "food therapy" is about dietetics and preventive hygiene rather than actual medical therapies. "Food therapy" also overlaps with Chinese cuisine, but the latter is much broader and not typically informed by therapeutic or preventive considerations. In light of all this, I think this page more than deserves to be kept! [[User:Madalibi|Madalibi]] ([[User talk:Madalibi|talk]]) 14:08, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - see [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Chinese food therapy]]. There is not a single word or decent paragraph in the main article. There is no reason to have a separate article to promote fringe nonsense.

:*{{reply|QuackGuru}} I agree that this article should not promote anything. But so what? Chinese "food therapy" may not be scientific, but neither are [[twerking]] and [[circumcision]]. They're just cultural practices that have reliable sources about them and as such deserve to be documented on Wikipedia.

::*I've added a basic "[[Chinese food therapy#Origins|Origins]]" section to the article to show how this topic could be treated. [[User:Madalibi|Madalibi]] ([[User talk:Madalibi|talk]])
* '''Strong keep'''- Food Therapy is a distinct module/modality within Traditional Chinese Medicine.  Furthermore, [[User:Madalibi|Madalibi]] should be commended for single-handedly rebuilding the article.--[[User:Apokryltaros|Mr Fink]] ([[User talk:Apokryltaros|talk]]) 04:45, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' - There's significant coverage in major historical documents. Although some of these works have been lost over time, it appears to have been mentioned in the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]]. As stated in the lede, it's also the subject of several contemporary publications. -[[User:A1candidate|A1candidate]] ([[User talk:A1candidate|talk]]) 19:04, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per [[WP:HEY]] and Madalibi.  This has been fixed up for rescue. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 21:49, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Keep''' - after {{u|Madalibi}}'s complete rewrite of the article, I don't think there's any doubt that the topic is notable. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 23:59, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
