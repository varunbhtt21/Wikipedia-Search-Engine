Not convinced these are noteworthy tours for [[Luther Vandross]]. The tours do not appear to have multiple reliable sources about the tour itself, merely reviews of individual stops.  The other tours nominated as a group are below. [[User:Thargor Orlando|Thargor Orlando]] ([[User talk:Thargor Orlando|talk]]) 21:06, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep All''' - Upon reviewing the sources in some of these articles, some of the tours actually ''do'' appear to have received [[WP:SIGCOV]] in multiple, reliable sources. It would be better to assess each article more closely and perform sources searches as suggested in section D of [[WP:BEFORE]], after which time then renominate those that haven't received SIGCOV accordingly. Those that actually don't meet notability guidelines could be merged to [[List of Luther Vandross tours]].

**I hate the use of this BEFORE essay that implies the research hasn't been done.  Can you please show which of these tours have received said coverage ''about the tours'' that aren't simply local reviews?  They have been reviewed, so if I missed them, you should be able to point them out.  [[User:Thargor Orlando|Thargor Orlando]] ([[User talk:Thargor Orlando|talk]]) 18:06, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''merge/redirect all''' to [[Luthor Vandross]]. Saying a tour happened, and here were the dates/locations is not of encyclopedic value.  Give a sentence or two about each tour in the main article. That is sufficient, unless there is significant commentary/content on one of them.

*'''Merge all''' <s>with [[Luthor Vandross]];</s> to [[List of Luther Vandross tours]]; separate articles are not needed.   <b>[[User:Fylbecatulous|<font color="#595454">Fylbecatulous</font>]] [[User talk:Fylbecatulous|<font color="#DB7093">talk</font>]]</b> 14:09, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Basically a permastub that I'd argue should merge into [[Luther Vandross]] if this content is kept in any form. [[User:Thargor Orlando|Thargor Orlando]] ([[User talk:Thargor Orlando|talk]]) 13:23, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
::::The list of tours is more feasible than all these individual articles; which really need to be put somewhere, rather than continuing to stand alone. Upon reconsideration I will amend my merge above to reflect the list as my preference.  I do hope the list can be expanded with more text and sources to fend off the permastub declaration.  <b>[[User:Fylbecatulous|<font color="#595454">Fylbecatulous</font>]] [[User talk:Fylbecatulous|<font color="#DB7093">talk</font>]]</b> 13:39, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
