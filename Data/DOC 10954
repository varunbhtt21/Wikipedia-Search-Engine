The play was next produced [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Vineyard Theatre]] on June 5, 1986,<ref name=script /> and then opened in a Vineyard Theatre production at the [[Westside Theatre]] on September 7, 1986.<ref>[http://www.vineyardtheatre.org/lady-day-at-emersonss-bar-and-grill/ "''Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill'' at the Vineyard"], vineyardtheatre.org, accessed April 27, 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/735/lady-day-at-emersons-bar-and-grill "''Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill''"] samuelfrench.com, accessed April 27, 2014</ref> This production closed on May 17, 1987 after 281 performances. Directed by [[Andre Ernotte]], [[Lonette McKee]] starred as Holiday. In February 1987 [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] took over the role of Billie Holiday.<ref>Gerard, Jeremy.

The Hollywood Playhouse (in California) produced ''Lady Day'' in October 1987, directed by Andre Ernotte, and with S. Epatha Merkerson reprising her role as Holiday. Ernotte said that he wanted to "deglamorize Billie: show the dark, sad side. So it's not so much a nightclub act as a theater play with music." He also noted that Merkerson brought another aspect to the role as an actress rather than as a singer.<ref>Arkatov, Janice.

==Critical reception==
In his review of the 2005 Long Wharf production for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Frank Rizzo wrote:
<blockquote>
...two-time Tony nominee Ernestine Jackson... presents the singer as a simultaneously strong and desperate figure who finds some solace in her songs, but more in her own personal “moonlight” of drugs, booze and memories. Jackson nicely suggests rather than mimics the famous Holiday deeply lived sound in a show filled with more than a dozen tunes accompanied by an accomplished trio. But this is far from a simple songbook, and the cumulative power comes in the unraveling of an addicted artist and her story at the end of her days.<ref>Rizzo, Frank.

</blockquote>
Critics praised the performance of Audra McDonald in the 2014 Broadway production while not being as enthusiastic about the writing.<ref>[http://stagegrade.com/productions/1404 "''Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill'' Review Summaries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429061730/http://stagegrade.com/productions/1404 |date=2014-04-29 }}, stagegrade.com, accessed April 28, 2014</ref> In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Charles Isherwood]] said,
<blockquote>
it's worth putting up with the show's tackier (and duller) aspects for the pleasure of hearing Ms. McDonald breathe aching life into some of Holiday's greatest songs. She has tamped down the lush bloom of her voice to suggest the withered state of Holiday's instrument during the last years of her career, but the sound remains tangy, expressive and rich.<ref>{{cite web|last=Isherwood|first=Charles|title=Audra McDonald in ''Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill''|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 13, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/theater/audra-mcdonald-in-lady-day-at-emersons-bar-and-grill.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>
</blockquote>
[[Marilyn Stasio]] in ''Variety'' called the play's script "unrealistically stuffed with just about every known biographical detail about [Holiday's] unhappy life", but praised McDonald's performance, saying
<blockquote>
she captures the plaintive sound, the eccentric phrasing and all the little vocal catches that identify Billie Holiday's unique style. But it's her extraordinary sensitivity as an actor that makes McDonald's interpretation memorable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stasio|first=Marilyn|url=https://variety.com/2014/legit/reviews/broadway-review-lady-day-at-emersons-bar-grill-starring-audra-mcdonald-1201156527/|title=Broadway Review: ''Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill'' Starring Audra McDonald|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>
