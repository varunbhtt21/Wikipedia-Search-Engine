"'''Living on a Thin Line'''" is a track written by [[Dave Davies]] and performed by [[The Kinks]] on their 1984 album, ''[[Word of Mouth (The Kinks album)|Word of Mouth]]''.

==Background==
"Living on a Thin Line" is one of two songs on ''Word of Mouth'' written by [[Dave Davies]] (the other being "[[Do It Again (The Kinks song)|Guilty]]"). In his biography ''Kink'', Davies said that the track was influenced by [[The Kinks]]' long and difficult career, along with his hatred toward politicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hinman|first=Doug|title=All Day and All of the Night|pages=272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBlkaDf49M0C&printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&q=living%20on%20a%20thin%20line&f=false}}</ref> The song was also influenced by the deterioration of [[English national identity|English identity]] in the 20th century and Davies' longing for a return to "days of old".<ref>{{cite book| title = Living on a Thin Line: Crossing Aesthetic Borders with the Kinks| editor1 = Kitts, Thomas M.| editor2 = Kraus, Michael J.| publisher = 	Rock 'n' Roll Research Press| date = 2002| pages = 71–72}}</ref>

==Reception==
"Living on a Thin Line" has been praised as one of [[Dave Davies]]'s greatest songs. David Fricke of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that "in 'Living on a Thin Line' – a dark variation on Ray's own death-of-England's-glory songs – brooding, goose-stepping chords and moping [[Pink Floyd]] synths underscore the desperate effectiveness of Dave's nervous croon."<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|last=Fricke |first=David |title=Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/albums/album/189321/review/5945895/word_of_mouth |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510155927/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/albums/album/189321/review/5945895/word_of_mouth |archivedate=10 May 2007 }}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] said, in his review of ''[[Come Dancing with The Kinks]]'', that the track is the "second-best" on the album (to "[[Come Dancing (song)|Come Dancing]]"), and "'There's no England now,' he opines, which explains a lot."<ref name=Christgau>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|title=Kinks|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1464&name=The+Kinks|accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref>
More recently, the song has become popular with British [[anti-immigration]] campaigners. For example, on [[YouTube]], a video of which uses the song for anti-immigration purposes gained over 500,000 views<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nse0Ch5_cKs|title=There's no England now|first=|last=You Kipper|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=10 October 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>, before being removed by YouTube for 'hate speech'. Shortly after, it was re-instated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/YouKipperLad/status/994328490165047296|title=(You) Kipper on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>
