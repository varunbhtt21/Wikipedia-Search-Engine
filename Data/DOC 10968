'''St.Thomas Syriac Orthodox Cathedral Acton ''' is a [[Syriac Orthodox]] [[Cathedral]]  in [[Acton, London]], [[England]], formerly known as '''St Saviour's Centre for the Deaf''' [[Anglican church]], It was a social centre for deaf people. It was the first and only purpose-built church for deaf people.<ref name=bbc-close>{{cite news|last=Tracey|first=Emma|title=UK's only deaf church to close|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-27130455|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=27 April 2014}}</ref> St Saviour's was the central location for the [[Diocese of London|London Diocesan]] Chaplaincy among Deaf and Deafblind people.

==History==
[[File:St Saviour, Old Oak Road. London W3 - Foundation stone - geograph.org.uk - 1716659.jpg|thumb|The foundation stone]]
The congregation was first established at a site in [[Oxford Street, London|Oxford Street]], where the original building was constructed from 1870 to 1874. The architect was Arthur Blomfield.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford Street: The Rebuilding of Oxford Street|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42131#s7|work=Survey of London: volume 40: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 2 (The Buildings)|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=1980}}</ref> The Duke of Westminster had provided the site on a lease for sixty years. The foundation stone was laid by [[Edward VII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]], who had a hearing impairment.<ref>{{cite web|title=1875 – St. Saviours Church for the Deaf & Dumb, Oxford Street, London|url=http://archiseek.com/2011/1875-st-saviours-church-for-the-deaf-dumb-oxford-street-london/|publisher=Archiseek.com|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

The first service there was held in 1873. The building became a great symbol for deaf people of their rights to play a full part in church and society.<ref>{{cite web|title=History part 1|url=http://royaldeaf.org.uk/About_RAD/HISTORY_PART_1/87|publisher=Royal Association for Deaf People|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

The church moved to a new site in Acton in 1925, when the Oxford Street location was required for redevelopment into the present [[Selfridge's]].<ref>{{cite web|title=St Saviour's history|url=http://londondeafchurch.wordpress.com/useful-info/st-saviours-history/|publisher=Diocese of London Deaf Church|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> The congregation worshipped in the church continuously for 90 years. The building included many features specially designed for the deaf, which included dual pulpits (one for the speaker and one for a sign language translator), clear lines of sight (with no pillars or visual obstructions), and a sloping floor to ensure that even those near the back can clearly see the signers.

==Deaf ministry==
[[File:St Saviour, Old Oak Road. London W3 - geograph.org.uk - 1716655.jpg|thumb|Another view of the church]]
Although St Saviour's Church has now closed, the congregation continues to meet. The Chaplaincy among Deaf and Deafblind people has four other meeting locations,<ref>Details on the service's official [http://www.london.anglican.org/mission/chaplaincy/chaplaincy-among-deaf-and-deafblind-people/ webpage] at the Diocese of London.</ref> although St Saviour's was the only dedicated premises, and the only church with specially designed facilities for the deaf. The closure of St Saviour's corresponds with the appointment of a new full-time Chaplain for the Chaplaincy service.<ref>Details of [http://londondeafchurch.wordpress.com/chaplaincy/ appointment]</ref> Chaplains are ordained priests appointed to specialist ministries, in this case the provision of worship and social activities for the deaf and deafblind community in London.

==The church building==
In September 2014 the Diocese of London announced that St Saviour's Church building had been sold to the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] community in west London, who have developed it for continuing use as a church within their own tradition, reopening it as St Thomas Cathedral in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web|first=Gavin|last=Drake|title=Britain’s first Syriac Orthodox Cathedral consecrated|publisher=ACNS|date=2016-11-25|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/11/britains-first-syriac-orthodox-cathedral-consecrated.aspx|accessdate=2016-12-22}}</ref>

Documents and archives associated with the church are currently being researched by the History of Place project,<ref>St Saviour's Deaf church timeline http://historyof.place/location/st-saviours-deaf-church/</ref> and will feature as part of a display at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] during 2018.<ref>History of Place exhibition at the V&A http://historyof.place/events/exhibition-at-the-victoria-and-albert-museum/</ref>
