==Influences==
''Steel'' borrows concepts and names from the manga ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'', for example the lyrics of "Band of the Hawk": 'We are a mercenary band, led by Griffith, the white hawk.' "Iron Hand" similarly refers to protagonist Guts's iron arm, referring to him as the 'Black Swordsman'.
