:({{Find sources|George Harrison (executive)}})
This is a bio of a business executive that lacks significant coverage in independent [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to establish [[WP:N|notability]].  The references present in the article are a brief item about him leaving Nintendo (business as usual type news coverage) and is not significant coverage.  The other two items are about other things for which he is interviewed / quoted.  My searches for sources found only more coverage where he is being quoted.

*'''Keep''' - I would count the ''Wired'' interview as significant coverage.  Long discussions about his livelihood qualify, just as asking an author about their books, a musician about their songs, etc, would count as significant coverage.  On that note, I also found another extensive interview with GameSpot: [http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-nintendo-vice-president-george-harrison/1100-6126595/ Q&A: Nintendo Vice President George Harrison]. —<B>[[User:Torchiest|Torchiest]]</B> <sup>[[User talk:Torchiest|talk]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-3ex;">[[Special:Contributions/Torchiest|edits]]</sub> 13:40, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Weak keep'''. Has coverage in multiple sources, but they're mostly due to his role as a marketer in that the articles are not about him but the company ([http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/24/interview-george-harrison][http://www.wired.com/2007/05/interview_noas_/][http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/11/27/interview-with-george-harrison]). And then there's a whole lot on his departure [http://www.edge-online.com/news/george-harrison-confirms-nintendo-departure/] but notabilty for all that coverage alone is close to [[WP:BLP1E]]. He also has a ''Joystiq'' tag [http://www.joystiq.com/tag/GeorgeHarrison/]. Anyway, I think this is a weak case and I can easily cede to a redirection argument (to NOA). Please ping me if more (non-English and offline) sources show in the future. <span style='font:1.1em"Avenir";padding:1px 3px;border:1px solid #909;color:#909'>czar&nbsp;[[User:Czar|<font color="#909">♔</font>]]</span> 03:02, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - The sourcing pointed out here, aside from the ones about Harrison's departure from Nintendo are not about Harrison.  Note that his role as stated in both the Wired and Gamespot items is "senior vice president of marketing and '''corporate communications'''" (emphasis added).  These significant sources are about Nintendo, and Harrison is working in his role as SVP of Corporate Communications; in other words, a senior spokesperson.  As for "discussions about his livelihood" qualifying, which source is about his livelihood?  The news about his departure is just regular news reporting on the comings and goings in the industry.  I don't see anything that talks about what he has done of significance at Nintendo as the SVP of Marketing and Corporate communications. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 01:46, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
