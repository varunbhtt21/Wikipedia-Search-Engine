:({{Find sources|West Midlands Stratford Road bus Corridor}})
Clean-up templates do not seem to be having any effect on the author of this article, it remains a rambling, unsourced collection of travel information and photos. Neither is there any evidence, apart from Wikipedia mirrors, of the existence of "Bus corridors" in the West Midlands. They seem to be an invention of the author to justify bundling a variety of routes that go in the same direction. Fails [[WP:GNG]] and definitely falls into [[WP:NOT]]. 

I am also nominating the following related pages because they fail [[WP:GNG]] and fall into [[WP:NOT]] for the same reasons as above:

*'''Keep all''' I have found multiple reliable sources for a transportation. It appears to pass GNG. The issue is sourcing many of the articles remain unsourced which needs to be added and improved.

::The issue is these "Corridors" don't exist, which is a pretty fundamental reason to delete the articles. [[User:Sionk|Sionk]] ([[User talk:Sionk|talk]]) 22:20, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::With all respect have you read the noms rationale as he states "''Neither is there any evidence, apart from Wikipedia mirrors, of the existence of "Bus corridors" in the West Midlands''"?.....

:::They sort of exist, but only in the West Midlands Local Transport Plan: [http://www.westmidlandsltp.gov.uk/mmlib/includes/sendfile.php?id=308]. Not so much bus corridors as more general transport corridors, and certainly no sign that they've been picked up on outside of local government.
*'''Delete all'''. Buscruft. There's always tonnes of it. I used to know a bus enthusiast so I can see why... [[User:Szzuk|Szzuk]] ([[User talk:Szzuk|talk]]) 11:34, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete all''' as lacking independent sources with in depth coverage. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 22:54, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep all''' I did not see any item in [[WP:NOT]] of which this falls afoul. I also do not agree that this does not satisfy [[WP:GNG]], given that the routes are referred to in government documents and on bus timetable sites, as well as occasionally in other media. I think, in fact, that each route could have a case for its own article under GNG, but that this is a more informative way of structuring the information.

*'''Delete all''' per the above and past precedents that bus routes are not generally notable enough for individual articles like these. <span style="background:#006B54; padding:2px;">'''[[User:Imzadi1979|<font color="white">Imzadi&nbsp;1979</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Imzadi1979|<font color="white"><big>→</big></font>]]'''</span>  01:04, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete all''' per nom. Buscruft. If there is no reliable secondary sourcing that these "corridors" exist this is verging on a hoax.--[[User:Charlesdrakew|Charles]] ([[User talk:Charlesdrakew|talk]]) 22:40, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
