'''George Cunningham Leslie''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] was a senior Royal Naval officer who joined the Royal Navy in 1938.<ref>http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RN_officersL.html</ref><ref>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/LESLIE.html</ref> He saw extensive service during the Second World War and in the postwar Royal Navy. He retired with the rank of rear admiral in 1970.

==Early life==
Leslie was the fourth son of Col A S Leslie CMG, WS Kininvie and Mrs M I Leslie (née Horne). 
He joined the Royal Navy in 1938.<ref>http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RN_officersL.html</ref><ref>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/LESLIE.html</ref>

==Second World War service==
During the Second World War, ''Leslie'' served in the cruiser HMS ''York'' from 1939 to 1940<ref>[[HMS York (90)]]</ref> then transferred to the destroyer HMS ''Harvester'' in 1941. From 1942 to 1943 he served on the destroyer HMS ''Volunteer''.<ref>[[HMS Volunteer (D71)]]</ref> This was followed by service on the destroyers HMS ''Cassandra'' 1944 to 1945<ref>[[HMS Cassandra (R62)]]</ref> and HMS ''Chevron'' from 1945 to 1946.<ref>[[HMS Chevron (R51)]]</ref>

It was while serving on HMS ''Cassandra'' during Arctic convoys to Russia that his ship was attacked and had her bow blown off. On 30 November 1944, the ''Cassandra'', with three other destroyers of the 6th Flotilla, left Scapa Flow to cover the passage of the North Russian Convoy JW62 (31 ships), as part of Operation Acumen, which had left Loch Ewe on the previous day. The Home Fleet was under the command of Rear-Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor, with his flag in the escort aircraft carrier ''Campania''. Despite a U-boat concentration off the Kola Inlet in Northern Russia, convoy JW 62, consisting of thirty merchant ships, arrived safely in the Kola Inlet on 7 December and the White Sea portion on 9 December.
He served aboard HMS ''Cassandra'' during Operation Acumen, which was the suppression of submarine attacks on convoys in the Atlantic supplying the USSR.
The return convoy, RA62 (28 ships), left the Kola Inlet on 10 December. It was attacked by U-boats and torpedo bomber aircraft, and while no merchant ships were lost or damaged, the ''Cassandra'' was torpedoed by U-boat ''U-365'' under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Diether Todenhagen at 0600 on 11 December when about 165 miles north of the Kola Inlet, to which she returned, escorted by the 20th Escort Group, under tow. Sixty-two men died in the attack and ''Cassandra'' had her bow blown off.

Leslie was awarded the OBE for his devotion to duty and actions during this incident. The torpedo had blown off her bow forward of ''B'' gun, and the ''Cassandra'' took no further part in the war. She was brought alongside at Rosta for temporary repairs and the cutting away of the damaged portion, but owing to delays, and especially the shortage of steel plate locally, it was not until 14 June 1945 that she was able to leave Kola for Rosyth, arriving on the 18th under the escort of HMS ''Onslaught''.<ref>http://royalnavymemories.co.uk/hms-devonshires-captains/</ref>
As an aside, HMS ''Cassandra'' would have her bow replaced three times during her lifetime.
