'''"Low Budget"''' is the sixth track from [[The Kinks]]' [[Low Budget (album)|album of the same name]]. It was written, produced and sung by [[Ray Davies]].

==Background==

"Low Budget" was recorded in January 1979.<ref name=hinman/>  It describes a man giving up his "expensive tastes" in order to save money. Like many of the tracks on ''[[Low Budget (album)|Low Budget]]'', it applies to the economic troubles occurring during the time that the album was released, such as strikes in Great Britain.<ref name=hinman>{{cite book|title=The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night|author=Hinman, D.|pages=225-228|year=2004|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn= 9780879307653}}</ref><ref name=complete>{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of the Kinks|author=[[Johnny Rogan|Rogan, J.]]|page=126|year=1998|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0711963142}}</ref>  However, [[AllMusic]]'s Richard Gilliam claimed that the track's theme could "easily apply to just about any modern recession".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/low-budget-mt0013902357|title=Low Budget - The Kinks &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review &#124; AllMusic|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>

Although "Low Budget" refers to economic problems of the times in general, it also refers to some of Ray Davies' own personal concerns.<ref name=kitts>{{cite book|title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else|author=Kitts, T.M.|pages=26, 198-199|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=041597769X}}</ref>  In the song, Davies mocks his own fear of not having money and his frugality.<ref name=complete/><ref name=kitts/><ref name=hasted/>  The song also references Davies' vanity.<ref name=kitts/>  The singer describes himself as once being well dressed and able to afford cigars, but now has to buy discount clothes and chew mints.<ref name=kitts/>  He describes himself as "a cut-price person in a low-budget land."<ref name=hasted/>  But despite being reduced to poverty, the singer expresses pride in his hair and his teeth.<ref name=kitts/>  Author Thomas Kitts notes that even the title, used in the [[refrain]] "I'm on a low budget" could refer to Davies keeping himself on a tight budget.<ref name=kitts/>

When asked which guitar performance he was most proud of, The Kinks' guitarist [[Dave Davies]] noted "Low Budget," as well as "[[You Really Got Me]]," as a favorite. He said of this:

{{quote|I like “Low Budget” [1979]. It’s wild. I like that kind of, almost country-style playing. It’s like a shape; I don’t even worry about what notes I play as I’m doing it. And if you catch a few open strings, you might get lucky with a weird clunk or a harmonic or something. I think all the best stuff is the stuff that happens before you’ve even realized what you’ve done. So “Low Budget” and, obviously, “You Really Got Me.”|Dave Davies, ''Guitar World'', 2014<ref name=guitarworld>{{cite web|last1=Fanelli|first1=Damian|title=Dear Guitar Hero: Dave Davies Talks Kinks Reunion, His Kinks-Era Gibson Flying V, New Album and More|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/dear-guitar-hero-dave-davies-talks-kinks-reunion-his-kinks-era-gibson-flying-v-new-album-and-more|website=Guitar World}}</ref>}}

==Release and reception==

When it was released as the B-side of "[[(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman]]," ''[[Trouser Press]]'' described "Low Budget" as being "rauchier" than its A-side, going on to comment on the rawness of Ray Davies' vocal and stating that "Ray's never been funnier nor [[Dave Davies|Dave]]'s guitar tougher sounding."<ref name=hinman/>  Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] describes the song as a "sloppy burlesque."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kinks|author=[[Robert Christgau|Christgau, R.]]|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=the+kinks|publisher=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>  Critic [[Johnny Rogan]] praises its self-deprecating humor, calling the line "Don't think I'm tight if I don't buy a round" one of the best of Davies' career.<ref name=complete/>  According to Davies, hearing the song on the radio in early 1979 helped inspire him to finish writing the rest of the songs for the ''Low Budget'' album.<ref name=hasted>{{cite book|title=The Story of the Kinks: You Really Got Me|author=Hasted, N.|year=2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9781849386609}}</ref> The song also appeared on the compilation albums ''Come Dancing with The Kinks'' and ''[[Picture Book (The Kinks album)|Picture Book]]''.

==Live version==

"Low Budget" became a popular song for the Kinks to play live in concert.<ref name=kitts/>  Of a performance in [[Binghamton, New York]] on February 18, 1979, the [[Binghamton University]] newspaper ''Pipe Dream'' noted that "'Low Budget' became an audience effort when Davies ceded his microphone to members of the front row during the [[refrain|chorus]]."<ref name=hinman/>  In 1980, a live version of "Low Budget" (recorded at [[Providence Civic Center]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]], on 23 September 1979) was released on the album ''[[One for the Road (The Kinks album)|One for the Road]]''.
