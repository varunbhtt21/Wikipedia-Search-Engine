With the ties for both division leads, tiebreakers were played on the originally scheduled weekend of May 3 and 4 and the Championship series was delayed one week.  Tiebreakers were played between Penn and Columbia for the Lou Gehrig Division title and between Yale and Dartmouth to decide the Red Rolfe Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/releases/Baseball_Weekly_Release_-_Week_9|publisher=Ivy League|date=April 22, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2014|title=Baseball Weekly Release - Week 9|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428015547/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/releases/Baseball_Weekly_Release_-_Week_9|archive-date=April 28, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Columbia defeated Penn by a score of 4–0 in the tiebreaker for the Lou Gehrig Division.  The game was held on May 3 at [[Meiklejohn Stadium]] on [[Penn Quakers baseball|Penn's]] campus in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], with Lions senior David Speer extending his scoreless innings streak to 23, recording 9 strikeouts, and allowing just five hits and two walks.  Columbia appears in the championship series for the second year in a row and fifth overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/releases/Columbia_Wins_Gehrig_Division_Playoff_To_Advance_To_Championship_Series|title=Columbia Defeats Penn In Gehrig Division Playoff To Advance To Championship Series|publisher=Ivy League|date=May 3, 2014|accessdate=May 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505162006/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/releases/Columbia_Wins_Gehrig_Division_Playoff_To_Advance_To_Championship_Series|archive-date=May 5, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In the tiebreaker for the Red Rolfe Division, Dartmouth defeated Yale by a score of 11–4.  The game was held on May 4 at [[Dartmouth Big Green baseball|Dartmouth's]] home field, [[Red Rolfe Field at Biondi Park]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].  Big Green starter Beau Sulser exited in the second inning due to an apparent elbow injury, and was replaced by sophomore Duncan Robinson.  Robinson completed 5.1 innings to earn his seventh win, tied for most in the Ivy League in 2014.  Dartmouth extended its winning streak to eight games and represents the Red Rolfe Division in the Championship Series for the seventh year in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/releases/Dartmouth_Claims_Rolfe_Title_With_Win_Over_Yale|title=Seven Straight Division Titles for Dartmouth Baseball|date=May 4, 2014|accessdate=May 5, 2014|publisher=Ivy League|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505171319/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/releases/Dartmouth_Claims_Rolfe_Title_With_Win_Over_Yale|archive-date=May 5, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
