Clark earned B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in [[meteorology]] from [[Iowa State University]] (ISU) in 2004, 2006, and 2009, respectively. In 2009 he joined NSSL as a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] post-doctoral research associate under [[David Stensrud]] and soon became a research scientist at CIMMS/NSSL. He is also an assistant professor at the affiliated [[University of Oklahoma]] (OU). On December 23, 2013, Clark was selected by President [[Barack Obama]] for the prestigious [[Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers]] (PECASE),<ref name="VP">{{cite web |title = CIMMS Nationally Recognized Awards |work = Research Highlights |publisher = University of Oklahoma Office of the Vice President |date = 2014 |url = http://vpr-norman.ou.edu/research-highlights/2014/february/cimms-nationally-recognized-awards |accessdate = 2014-04-27 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140223221849/http://vpr-norman.ou.edu/research-highlights/2014/february/cimms-nationally-recognized-awards|dead-url = yes |archivedate =2014-02-23}}</ref> which was awarded at a White House ceremony on April 15, 2014.<ref name="briefings">{{cite web |last = Cobb |first = Susan |title = Adam Clark wins prestigious Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers |work = NSSL Briefings |publisher = National Severe Storms Laboratory |date = April 15, 2014 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/briefings/2014/04/adam-clark-wins-prestigious-presidential-early-career-award-for-scientists-and-engineers/ |accessdate = 2014-04-27 }}</ref>
