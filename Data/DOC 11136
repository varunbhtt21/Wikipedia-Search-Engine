James Montgomery of MTV News commended the song's "breakneck guitars, yelped vocals and cascading drums," making reference to his own personal anticipation for ''Neighborhoods'': "From the sound of things, the new Blink-182 may very well be adept at everything [...] Sort of only makes the anticipation that much greater."<ref name="mtv"/> Jon Dolan of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the song three stars out of five, writing, "The second taste of Blink's comeback LP reboots their bubblegum punk, setting a post-breakup bitchfest to shrink-wrapped hardcore that's pitched perfectly between the mosh pit and the food court."<ref name="RS">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/hearts-all-gone-20110817|title=Heart's All Gone - Song Reviews|author=Jon Dolan|date=August 17, 2011|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> [[BBC Music]] described the song as "blisteringly fast," commending Barker's drum work on the song.<ref name="Diver">{{cite web |last=Diver|first=Mike |title=Blink-182: ''Neighborhoods'' Review |publisher=[[BBC Music]] |date=2011-09-26 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/zdhf |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref> Thomas Nassiff of [[AbsolutePunk]] called the song "instantly accessible," noting that, for fans, "[the song] the high-energy pop-punk track we all wanted."<ref name="Nassif">{{cite web |last=Nassif |first=Thomas |title=Review: Blink-182 – ''Neighborhoods'' |website=[[AbsolutePunk]] |date=2011-09-20 |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?p=95151702 |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref> Kyle Ryan of ''[[The A.V.
