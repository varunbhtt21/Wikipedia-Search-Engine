Title : Conditional jockey
Text : A '''conditional jockey''' is an [[apprentice]] [[National Hunt racing]] [[jockey]] in Great Britain or Ireland under the age of 26 who has not won more than seventy-five races [[Horse racing in Great Britain#Types of racing|under rules]] or had not won that many races within the last six months.<ref name=Rules/>

A conditional jockey is entitled to a reduction, known as an allowance, in the weight carried by his horse, dependent on the type of race, which varies according to the number of races the jockey has won. A jockey who has ridden fewer than twenty winners can claim an allowance of seven [[Pound (mass)|pounds]], one who has ridden between twenty and forty winners can claim a five pound allowance and one who has ridden less than seventy-five winners can claim a three pound allowance. A conditional jockey with fewer than five winners is allowed a further three pounds when riding for the stable which employs him. Allowances cannot be claimed when riding in races restricted to conditional jockeys and in some other instances, for example the [[Grand National]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rules of Racing - 141.
