:({{Find sources|Godfrey Mdimi Mhogolo}})
Article that has been in existence for a month heavily reliant on a source that scantly provides any other information outside of his occupation. Has no detail on birth, career, etc. Fails general notability. [[User:Rusted AutoParts|<font face="Rockwell" size="3" style="color:#000000;color:red"><i>Rusted AutoParts</i></font>]] 22:47, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::Why was this placed in the "places and transportation" category? --[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 18:57, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I don't know, but I just changed it to biographical. [[User:Novusuna|Novusuna]] <sup>[[User_talk:Novusuna|talk]]</sup> 19:35, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Keep''' The article is a stub. Anglican bishops are considered notable. Thank you-[[User:RFD|RFD]] ([[User talk:RFD|talk]]) 22:55, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::[[User:RFD|@RFD]] I don't see any [[Wikipedia:Notability_(people)|special exceptions]] for Anglican bishops or other religious leaders. --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 23:48, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''' [[WP:CLERGY]] states that Anglican bishops are generally found to be notable, for what that's worth. [[User:Novusuna|Novusuna]] <sup>[[User_talk:Novusuna|talk]]</sup> 01:47, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::To what extent, though? We don't have a birthdate, or alot of information that's needed for an article. One source is binding this article together. [[User:Rusted AutoParts|<font face="Rockwell" size="3" style="color:#000000;color:red"><i>Rusted AutoParts</i></font>]] 02:22, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Delete''' Does not pass notability.  --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 23:48, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - A quick Google search turned up many RS sources about his death and a homosexual issue in the church a number of years back.  Also per [[WP:CLERGYOUTCOMES]]. Obviously needs expanded beyond a stub. [[User:VMS Mosaic|VMS Mosaic]] ([[User talk:VMS Mosaic|talk]]) 08:06, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' There's a few refs, although the repetition of agency copy means not all google hits are independent. But taking into account references, [[WP:CLERGYOUTCOMES]], systemic bias, his long career before web news was common, the difficulty for most Wikipedians of searching offline sources in Tanzania, and the likelihood of additional sources in Swahili, keep seems a sensible option. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 13:54, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - A couple of the English sources in the article actually do indicate passing [[WP:GNG]].  It is certainly likely many more exist in other languages, perhaps non-internet as well as all Anglican Bishops are cultural leaders in their region. --[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 18:43, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Diocesan bishops of major denominations are usually held to be notable. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 12:44, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
