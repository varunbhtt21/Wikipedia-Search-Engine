Not sure what is intended, but clearly not a template. Could not find a speedy reason to just allow deletion. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 18:59, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

This template is used on one page (and is possibly unnecessary) and says in the documentation not to used it. [[User:Jamesx12345|James]]<sup>x</sup>[[User talk:Jamesx12345|12345]] 19:06, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' clearly if a page isn't displaying properly, we should mark it so for our readership, so they don't get the wrong idea about where the error comes from (such as from a virus on their own personal machine). And the instructions should be modified to indicate that when the template is used, one should always post a message to VP about the page. I would think use should always be rare, but it would be a good idea to use it when necessary. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.206|65.94.171.206]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.206|talk]]) 22:57, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
**Most of the html Wikipedia uses is very well established, and most "interactive" features are tables and gifs. [[User:Jamesx12345|James]]<sup>x</sup>[[User talk:Jamesx12345|12345]] 17:21, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' the TFD discussion from 2010 indicates that the /doc page is a false documentation, and the real documentation is on the template doc page. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.206|65.94.171.206]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.206|talk]]) 22:59, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* This was a weak close the first time. The question of a template's utility is not whether some random IP could dream up a use for it, it's whether it's actually being used. [[User:Thumperward|Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward)]] ([[User talk:Thumperward|talk]]) 14:42, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per the others. Essentially unused and unneeded. (In the one place it is used, there is no indication why the template was put there to begin with, rendering it meaningless.) — <span style="border:dashed #666;border-width:1px 0 0 1px">[[User:This, that and the other|This, that]]</span> and <span style="border:dashed #666;border-width:0 1px 1px 0">[[User talk:This, that and the other|the other<small> (talk)</small>]]</span> 11:04, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''delete''', can't see it being widely used. [[User:Frietjes|Frietjes]] ([[User talk:Frietjes|talk]]) 23:42, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
