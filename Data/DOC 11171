* I ([[User: Donanurag]]) disagree with this claim that this is unfree. This is because this file can be found at multiple sources; no one owns or claims ownership of this file, and hence this file is not copyrighted and completely free to use.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned"> — Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 19:28, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!--Template:Undated--> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

* Maybe copy, definitely a derivative of the classic copyrighted London Tube Maps. http://www.tfl.gov.uk/maps/track/tube '''[[User:Ronhjones|<span style="border:1px solid;color:#dfdfdf; padding:1px;background:#ffffdf"><font color="green">&nbsp;Ron<font color="red">h</font>jones&nbsp;</font></span>]]'''<sup>[[User talk:Ronhjones|&nbsp;(Talk)]]</sup> 22:03, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

* Can I please draw you attention to the fact that this map does NOT exist already?  It is BASED on the current map but has EXTENSIVE changes to show the inclusion of the THREE new LONDON OVERGORUND lines?  There are NO existing LONDON UNDERGOUND maps that have the overground in solid orange.  There are NO EXISTING maps that have the line running from LIVERPOOL STREET to CHESHUNT.  There are NO EXISTING maps that have the line running from LIVERPOOL STREET to CHINGFORD.  There are NO EXISTING maps that have the line running from LIVERPOOL STREET to ENFIELD TOWN.  There are NO EXISTING maps that have the HACKNEY DOWNS/HACKNEY CENTRAL interchange, the WALTHAMSTOW CENTRAL/QUEENS ROAD interchange, ARCHWAY/UPPERHOLOWAY interchange.

* Also not like any other published map it shows the UPMINSTER to ROMFORD line.  The font used is "London Tube (Normal)", a free font.  Extensive modifications to the current map include a totally different layout for the VICTORIA LINE - now shown direct, not indirect.  The stations on the PICADILLY line have been changed to show the correct relative positions of the stations compared to the OVERGROUND.    Labels are not in the same position on the CENTRAL LINE to provide space on the map for the NEW OVERGROUND LINES.  CAMDEN ROAD shown as "long" interchange with CAMDEN TOWN.    The HIGHBURY AND ISLINGTON OVERGROUND line has been changed in layout to provide room for the new lines.  LIVERPOOL street is now a "tripple interchange" station on the map.  The GOSPEL OAK line is now horizontal across the map.  BETHNAL GREEN Central Line station move to accommodate new overground lines and BETHAN GREEN OVERRGOUND station.  NORTHERN LINE stations positions changed to allow OVERGROUND interchanges to be shown.

* But, apart from that, it's JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES.  [[User:Briantist|<span style="background-color:#841818; border-top: 1px solid #AD3031; border-bottom: 1px solid #5A1810; color:#EFEBDE">'''&nbsp;BRIANTIST&nbsp;'''</span>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Briantist|''(talk)'']] 07:32, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
* Compare with [https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/standard-tube-map.pdf] properly please, not even vaguely "a copy".

:You were definitely alternating the copyrighted maps to produce your own images. Copyright law also grants the copyright holder the right to derive the original work. There is a huge amount of details of your maps identical to the TfL maps, e.g. the curves between Liverpool Street and Aldgate East of H&C line. Which means you can't release your maps without TfL's consent. You need to create everything from scratch, literally. -- [[User:Sameboat|Sameboat - 同舟]] ([[User talk:Sameboat|talk]]) 10:52, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
