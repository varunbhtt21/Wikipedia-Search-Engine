 |Description       = Front cover art for Motorcycle Mechanics, first-ever issue, April 1959. The copyright is believed to belong to the publisher. The publication and title were originally Mercury House Magazines, then owned by EMAP. The title is defunct, but the successor-title Performance Bikes is now owned by Bauer
 |Source            = www.ebay.co.uk, the entire magazine was offered for sale as a collector's item. Image was copied 4 February 2014. Most ebay files are deleted after 60 days.
 |Portion           = Most of front cover which was already slightly-cropped at edges when sourced. The image is a publication cover, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image, and confirm the title name.
 |Low_resolution    = Small as originally sourced and low file size. Size is sufficient for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original cover
 |Purpose           = To be placed into infobox for identification of the brand which could not easily be conveyed by words alone, showing the date and the "new!" annotation of this historic magazine, the title script, the strapline "The illustrated how-to-do-it magazine", the contents topics and other fonts on the front cover
 |Replaceability    = 1959, not replaceable
 |other_information = Historically important example cover of an important long-standing UK magazine to illustrate an existing Wikipedia article
