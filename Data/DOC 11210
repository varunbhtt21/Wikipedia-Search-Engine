*'''Delete''' Recreation of a previously deleted article about a web series hosted on Youtube and Vimeo. No additional sources showing notability have come to light. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 20:27, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  I can't find any coverage at all in reliable sources, which is fairly damning for web-only content. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 00:01, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
