No evidence of notability. Was written like SEO spam till yesterday. Two stories are just about it's sale to Adobe. Only one short article about it. The other references are pay-to-enter "awards". [[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 23:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

This article is really unfortunate. Behance produced some innovative organizational products in its early years and seemed like a very interesting company and culture. But it has changed almost completely since Adobe purchased it and perhaps that explains the sorry state of the article today. It appears the "Action Method" products are now produced and sold elsewhere under a license of some sort. It would be wonderful if someone with knowledge of the company's early days could edit the article. <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.218.164.179|24.218.164.179]] ([[User talk:24.218.164.179|talk]]) 23:53, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->
: Knowledge is great, but first-hand info isn't. We need proof it's notable. --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 08:43, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep'''. Easily. I'd entertain a redirect just in terms of building it out [[Wikipedia:Summary style|summary style]], but there's no way this is non-notable enough for deletion. [http://thenextweb.com/company/behance Here] are a series of news postings from [[The Next Web]] about the site/company that are fine on its own. [http://www.businessinsider.com/behance-tour-2012-7 Here]'s another dedicated article from Business Insider. And then there's a bunch of coverage on the acquisition, e.g., [http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789400/adobe-acquires-behance-bolsters-creative-cloud-service]. <span style='font:1.1em"Avenir";padding:1px 3px;border:1px solid #909;color:#909'>czar&nbsp;[[User:Czar|<font color="#909">♔</font>]]</span> 02:56, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
: Right, the most notable thing referenced seems to be the sale to Adobe. --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 21:47, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

Advert language is being added back to the article, but proof of notability is not. --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 23:57, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' seems to meet minimum [[:WP:GNG]].  The article does need a ton of work, but that is not a reason to delete. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 23:38, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' - not a lot of coverage, but enough to meet our notability standards. <b>~<i><font color="#07517C">[[User:SuperHamster|Super]]</font></i><font color="#6FA23B">[[User:SuperHamster|Hamster]]</font></b> <small>[[User talk:SuperHamster|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/SuperHamster|Contribs]]</small> 06:20, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
