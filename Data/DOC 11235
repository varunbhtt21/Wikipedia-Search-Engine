* He is featured in ''[[How Few Remain]]'', the first volume of Turtledove's ''[[Southern Victory Series]]'', which chronicles an alternate history world after the South wins the Civil War. The Confederacy which Benjamin helped create is portrayed as an analog of [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s–1940s.
* Benjamin is a significant character in [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison's]] alternate history ''[[Stars and Stripes trilogy]]''.
* In the 2004 [[mockumentary]] film ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'', Benjamin convinces France and Britain to side with the Confederacy, which wins the war.
* Benjamin figures prominently in the award-winning writer [[Dara Horn]]'s short story "Passover in New Orleans" and her mystery novel, ''All Other Nights'' (2009). The story is a fictional account of an attempt to assassinate a New Orleans Jewish Confederate official before he can assassinate Lincoln.
* Benjamin appears in the alternate history novel ''By Force of Arms'' by Billy Bennett, where he reprises his role as the Confederate Secretary of State, this time under President Robert E. Lee. Benjamin is instrumental in getting Great Britain to sell the Confederacy vital weapons for its new war with the Union.

The first two books of the trilogy are ''The Butcher's Cleaver'' (2007), and ''Death Piled Hard'' (2009). In them, the role of Benjamin as the effective head of civilian Confederate covert operations and intelligence is a central feature of the plot. This interpretation of Benjamin's place in history is based on the historical study, "Come Retribution", a study of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]].
