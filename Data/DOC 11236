'''''The World Trade Center Tapestry''''' was a large [[tapestry]] by [[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Royo]].  It was displayed in the lobby of [[2 World Trade Center]] (the South Tower) in [[New York City]] from 1974 until it was destroyed in 2001 by the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]].

Saul Wenegrat, former director of the art program for the [[Port Authority of New York]], had suggested to Miró that he could make a tapestry for the World Trade Center, but the artist declined as he would only make the work with his own hands but had no experience of making a tapestry.  However, after his daughter recovered from an accident in Spain, Miró agreed to make a tapestry for the hospital that had treated her as a token of his gratitude.  Having learned the technique from tapestry maker Josep Royo, Miró made several other tapestries with Royo, including one for the World Trade Center, ''Woman'' for the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]], and one for the [[Fundació Joan Miró]].

The work was an abstract design, with bright blocks of colour, red, green, blue and yellow, with black elements and a light brown background.  Made of wool and hemp, it measured {{convert|20|xx|35|ft|m}} and weighed 4&nbsp;tonnes.  It was completed in 1973, and displayed at a retrospective at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris before being installed in New York in 1974.
