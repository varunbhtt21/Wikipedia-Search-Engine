*'''Delete'''. Apparently the name of redirect is an abbreviation of the former template's name "[[Template:History of Tunisia InfoBox]]". Since the "InfoBox" part was dropped, and seemingly the redirect was not used since, it doesn't serve any purpose now. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.

This redirect was created when this page was moved to [[Closed]] back in 2007. However, since [[Closed]] is currently a disambiguation page, this redirect should be '''deleted''' per [[WP:INTDABLINK]], unless there is a good retarget option for this redirect, but I'm not able to find a good target.

Requesting deletion of this redirect and its associated talk page (a similar redirect to my talk page).  Redirect was created by a user shortly after his account was registered and, based upon his [[Special:Contributions/Nolzzress|edit history]], may have created the redirect in an attempt to impersonate an administrator during a content dispute. --''[[User: Allen3|Allen3]]''&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:Allen3|talk]]</sup> 11:31, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' and '''[[WP:SALT|salt]]'''. Let Nolzzress prove his capability of operating without harming other editors before he gets second chance to do so. P.S.: deletion is necessary in order to prevent future problems for Allen3 in case of misconduct by Nolzzress. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.

This redirect was directing to [[Oneworld (disambiguation)]], which listed it. I redirected it to [[Peter William Armstrong#Oneworld.net]], which was scoring high among search results, but I am not sure whether it is appropriate target, so listing it here in hope for crowdsourcing effectiveness. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D. Czarkoff]] ([[user talk:czarkoff|talk]]•[[Special:Contributions/czarkoff|track]]) 02:39, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:I have enormous misgivings with the current target, it is basically [[WP:RESUME]] as far as I can tell. I am going to do a bit of prowling then if my suspicioins are correct I will take it to AfD. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 03:00, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': Target is the only reasonable place for this redirect to go.  If the target gets deleted, we can just [[WP:G8|G8]] it.  Until then, this is a perfectly good redirect.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  03:57, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' redirect. Two of its subsidiaries/divisions have articles, [[OneWorldTV]] and [[OneClimate]]. For the record, there was a Keep decision for the lowercase-titled article [[Oneworld.net]] in 2007, followed by a Delete decision in 2008 at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Oneworld.net (2nd nomination)]]. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 12:33, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
