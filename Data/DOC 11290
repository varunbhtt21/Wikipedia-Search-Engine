A non notable smart phone, also seems like an advertisement page. No links go here either. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:59, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per [[WP:PRODUCT]]. There seems to be a reasonable amount of independent coverage out there.[http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/water-resistant-wickedleak-wammy-passion-x-octa-core-processor-launched-rs-22500-219127.html][http://www.bgr.in/news/wickedleak-wammy-passion-x-launched-for-rs-22500-ss314/][http://www.knowyourmobile.in/micromax/9831/wickedleak-wammy-passion-x-vs-micromax-canvas-knight-vs-intex-aqua-octa-which-octa] What's needed is some more balanced reviews which reflect the concerns expressed by some users.

*'''Keep''' Quite popular smartphone in India. I can find many reliable and significant sources after a quick search. [http://gadgets.ndtv.com/wickedleak-wammy-passion-x-1330] & [http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/et-review-wickedleak-wammy-passion-x/articleshow/33718466.cms] among a few. I agree with [[User talk:Trevj|Trevj]]. I also don't find it like an advert. <span style="text-shadow:#333333 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em;">[[User:Harsh_2580|Harsh]]</span>[[User talk:Harsh_2580|<font color="blue"> <small>(talk) </small></font>]] 11:13, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
