The '''SS ''City of Chester''''' was a [[steamship]] built in 1875<ref name=WaPo>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/04/23/a-19th-century-shipwreck-near-the-golden-gate-bridge-was-just-discovered-again/ |title=A 19th-century shipwreck near the Golden Gate Bridge was just discovered (again) |last=Berman |first=Mark |date=April 23, 2014 }}</ref> that sank after a collision with [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|RMS ''Oceanic'']] at the [[Golden Gate]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] on August 22, 1888.

==Sinking==

Headed to [[Eureka, California]], with 90 passengers on the foggy morning of August 22, 1888, at about 10&nbsp;am she collided with RMS ''Oceanic'', a liner inbound from [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2014/20140423_cityofchester_shipwreck.html |title=NOAA Coast Survey ship finds 19th century shipwreck off Golden Gate Bridge â€” again  |publisher=[[NOAA]] |date=April 23, 2013 }}</ref> The two ships saw each other, but as was later determined by a British Naval Court, ''City of Chester'' was caught by [[tidal current]] and carried into the path of the larger ship.<ref name=SFGate/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18880830.2.3&srpos=37&e=-------en--20-DAC-21-byDA-txt-txIN-City+of+Chester+sunk-----# |title=The Tide Did It: Verdict of the British Naval Court on the Bay Disaster |newspaper=Daily Alta California |date=August 30, 1888 |page=1 }}</ref> An eyewitness aboard ''Oceanic'' said: "Into her we crashed with irrisistible force, cutting her just as though she was a cheese."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SDU18880824.2.37&srpos=27&e=-------en--20--21-byDA-txt-txIN-City+of+Chester%2c+Oceanic%2c+cheese----- |title=Sickening Sights: A Passenger's Vivid Description of the Catastrophe |newspaper=[[Sacramento Daily Union]] |date=August 24, 1888 |page=4 }}</ref> She sank in six minutes, and despite rescue efforts by those aboard ''Oceanic'', sixteen passengers, including two children, and three crew members died.<ref name=SFGate/> In terms of loss of life, this is the second most deadly [[Ships lost in San Francisco|wreck in the history of San Francisco Bay]], after the sinking of the {{SS|City of Rio de Janeiro}} in 1901.<ref name=Yahoo/>

''Oceanic'' had Chinese crew and her steerage passengers were Chinese immigrants; [[Yellow Peril|anti-Chinese]] [[xenophobia]] was high in the US at the time and initially the Chinese were accused of letting ''City of Chester''{{'}}s passengers drown. When news of their efforts to save them came out, it helped to reduce the prejudice against the Chinese.<ref name=SFGate/><ref name=NOAA/>

==Discovery of wreck==
