Because the match is not that important[[User:PeacefulJarl379|PeacefulJarl379]] ([[User talk:PeacefulJarl379|talk]]) 00:23, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Keep''' This match is in fact one of the most famous football matches to be ever played, due to both the rivalry and the historical circumstances surrounding the relations between the two countries and the on-field play. This match had two of the most famous goals ever scored in football matches.
*'''Keep''' and close. "Because the match is not that important" - so what '''policy''' does this not meet? '''[[User:Lugnuts|<font color="002bb8">Lugnuts</font>]]''' <sup>[[User talk:Lugnuts|Dick Laurent is dead]]</sup> 07:01, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Procedural keep''' - No valid reason given for deletion.  Appears to be a POV ([[WP:NPOV]]) nomination. [[User:VMS Mosaic|VMS Mosaic]] ([[User talk:VMS Mosaic|talk]]) 07:52, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - a very high profile game due to the controversy surrounding it.  No proper rationale for deletion. [[User:Bladeboy1889|Bladeboy1889]] ([[User talk:Bladeboy1889|talk]]) 07:54, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - as clearly notable per [[WP:GNG]]. Could perhaps do with a rename, but that is a matter for the article talk page. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 11:50, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I do not follow the sport, and even I am well aware of the Hand of God goal.  An immensely famous World Cup match. [[Special:Contributions/209.90.140.72|209.90.140.72]] ([[User talk:209.90.140.72|talk]]) 19:30, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
