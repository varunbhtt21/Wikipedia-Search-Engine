Title : Help to Work
Text : '''Help to Work''' was a government [[Workfare in the United Kingdom|workfare scheme in the United Kingdom]] for individuals who had not found work after two years on the [[Work Programme]]. Help to Work was the overall name for 'Community Work Placements' and other intensified 'activation' measures, and was launched at the start of 2014, but it was announced in November 2015, that the [[Department for Work and Pensions|DWP]] was "not renewing" it.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.uk/government/news/department-for-work-and-pensions-settlement-at-the-spending-review |title=Department for Work and Pensionsâ€™ settlement at the Spending Review |publisher=DWP |date=2015-12-25 |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref>

Individuals who refused to participate in the scheme faced sanctions usually involving full withdrawal of benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27177767 |title=BBC News - Help to Work: New unemployment rules in force |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=2014-04-28 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}</ref> 

==Pilot==
A study of a pilot of the "Help to Work" scheme carried out by the [[National Institute of Economic and Social Research]] reached the following conclusion:

<blockquote>The good news: Help to Work reduced benefit receipt and increased employment among participants. The not so good news (but no surprise to those of us who know the literature): not by very much, and overall outcomes were still pretty bad.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Portes|url=http://niesr.ac.uk/blog/help-work-pilots-success-failure-or-somewhere-between#.U151DfldWlv|title=The "Help to Work" pilots: success, failure or somewhere in between?|publisher=National Institute of Economic and Social Research|date=29 Dec 2013|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Richard Godwin writing in the ''Evening Standard'' criticised the scheme as "slavery by another name".<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Godwin |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/richard-godwin-help-to-work-is-slavery-by-another-name-9232236.html |title=Richard Godwin: Help to Work is slavery by another name - Comment - London Evening Standard |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=2014-04-02 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}</ref>
