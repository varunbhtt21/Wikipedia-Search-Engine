== Difference between "His main success lies in... " and "His success mainly lies in" ==

Is there any semantic difference between "His main success lies in..." and "His success mainly lies in..."? Thank you!  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/1.202.187.153|1.202.187.153]] ([[User talk:1.202.187.153|talk]]) 01:03, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: Yes, there is a difference.  The first one means he had different forms of success but his main success lies in X.  The second one means he had one success but it can be attributed to different things, the main one being X.  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 01:15, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

== rayoysfirkom? (Soviet acronym in Yiddish) ==

Anyone has an idea what 'rayoysfirkom' standards for? It appears here http://www.nlr.ru/poisk/paper_idish_e.html . Is it a Komsomol committee? a Rayon government body? --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 10:22, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:[[User:Medeis]] should be able to answer this. It is indeed Eastern Yiddish. <span style="text-shadow:#BBBBBB 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em; class=texhtml"><font face="MV Boli" color="blue">[[User:KageTora|KägeTorä - (<sup>影</sup><sub>虎</sub>)]] ([[User talk:KageTora|Chin Wag]])</font></span> 12:36, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
::<small>Thanks for the confidence, but neither Yiddish nor Soviet jargon is my forte.  Jackof Oz and Lyuboslov Yezykin are the go-toes on advanced or technical Russian and I guess Sluzzelin is for Yiddish. [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 16:38, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</small> 
:::<small>I don't really know Yiddish fluently, and it takes me forever to read Hebrew script, but the language is quite accessible by ear for native speakers of German, and I've always loved Klezmer (and jokes in Yiddish).</small>---[[User:Sluzzelin|Sluzzelin]] [[User talk:Sluzzelin|<small>talk</small>]] 17:40, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
::::<small>Yes, I've had 8 years of German, and have a Yiddish station from NYC programmed on the car.  (Love Klezmer.)  I laugh at the commercials, and enjoy the music.  There's no way I'd ever have gotten the jargon from ''oysfirn'', though. [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 19:55, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</small>
:I think it is indeed something like the ''[[raion]] executive committee''. "oysfirn" ([[:fr:wikt:אויספֿירן|אויספֿירן]]) means "to execute" ("ausführen" in German). I think the Russian equivalent is Райисполком (Rayispolkom). ---[[User:Sluzzelin|Sluzzelin]] [[User talk:Sluzzelin|<small>talk</small>]] 13:48, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:: We have a [[Rayispolkom]], which redirects to [[Committee#Executive committee|Executive committee]].  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 19:48, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:::To confirm what's been said here, Rokhkind's 1940 Yiddish-Russian dictionary (available online [https://archive.org/details/yidishrusisherv00rokh here]) lists ''oysfirkom'' (אויספירקאָמ in Soviet spelling) as meaning ''исполком''.
