== Where can I find a Bot? ==

Is there a Bot that can change External links into references, retaining the text, separated from the URL by a space, within the article?<br />
I'm probably just being lazy, but [[Apple community]] is just a riot of External Links, however, several sections would be entirely unreferenced if these were all simply removed. [[User:Arjayay|Arjayay]] ([[User talk:Arjayay|talk]]) 10:57, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
:you can use the "cite" button above the editing box and drop the URL into the appropriate "news" / "book" / "web" drop down and it will automatically call up a lot of the citation specs. its a couple of manual clicks for each link and review for missing info, but its not that difficult.-- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]]
::It would be nice to have a cite button - but as an IE user, it stopped working ages ago, and now doesn't even waste pixels by appearing on my screen at all ;-0 [[User:Arjayay|Arjayay]] ([[User talk:Arjayay|talk]]) 14:38, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:I believe Arjayay may have been referring to a ''large'' number of external links embedded in the text of (particularly) the "[[Apple_community#9to5Mac|9to5Mac]]" section. In April 2013 {{User|Apollozac}} 'helpfully' turned ''all'' the properly cited references into embedded links, all to 9to5mac.com. I also note that many of them were removed by other editors shortly after Apollozac did  it, and more since this discussion started. There are still a hell if a lot left though, three in the first paragraph, 18 in total in that section alone seems ''very'' excessive, 'walls' of {{blue|blue text}}!
* Another way to 'fix' this situation is to manually turn the links into refs with bare URLs, and then use [[wp:Reflinks|Reflinks]] to fill in most of the citation 'fields' for you--[[user:220 of Borg|'''220''']] [[Special:Contributions/220 of Borg|''<small>of</small>'']] <sup>[[User talk:220 of Borg|''Borg'']]</sup> 15:57, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::Correct about the IT, and correct about the external links embedded in the text.<br />[[WP:EL]] states External links "should not normally be placed in the body of an article". I'm not sure why the word "normally" appears - I can't see an example of where "abnormally" they can be placed in the bodytext, and editors have used this to argue for the retention of ELs.<br />The article in question was just a sea of blue, and many of these links were promotional in nature. Thanks to [[user:220 of Borg|220 of Borg]] many of these have now been converted to references.<br />Do I assume the answer to my original question is that there is no such Bot? - [[User:Arjayay|Arjayay]] ([[User talk:Arjayay|talk]]) 16:31, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

== Editing pages that have been translated from another language into English ==

I have enjoyed occasionally correcting grammar or spelling mistakes in pages that are primarily in English. I used a page on Laura Evangelista Alvarado Cardozo , known as Mother Mary of St. Joseph and clicked for it to be translated into English. This was done...but...it needed a fair bit of correction as the gender of the saint was often mistranslated. I clicked the edit word and the edit facility appeared...but...back in Spanish. Just a note - that needs no reply - but would open the door for those who can correct computer-translations a little more accurately IF there is access to the translations as well as the original language(s) from which the page has been computer-translated. I don't think it was my computer (which isn't too expensive a one), I trust that, in time, this opportunity will present itself. Thank you.

== [[Matilda Ziegler]]: I can't find a free image for her infobox ==

I just found this:
* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/norwichamnesty/6505392119]
and I don't know can I upload that image (or an edited version of it) to Wikipedia? Alternatively, it's good if other editors find her image and add it to her infobox, because I didn't upload such images before and I'm not familiar with "reuse" rights. --[[User:Zyma|Zyma]] ([[User talk:Zyma|talk]]) 15:30, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{replyto|Zyma}} The Flickr page says "Some rights reserved", with three tiny icons nearby. Hovering the mouse over those icons pops up the text "Attribution", "Noncommercial", and "No derivative works". Those last two are incompatible with the free license that Wikipedia requires, so it cannot be uploaded here. Sorry. -- [[User:John of Reading|John of Reading]] ([[User talk:John of Reading|talk]]) 16:55, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

== I want to submitt my article to review ==

Hi,
I want to send my article for reviewing, the only one that I made, to check if it is possible to upload it in wikipedia.
I don not know how to do it.
Thanks,

:This article is of a much higher standard that almost all new articles by new contributors. I believe it deserves to be accepted; but I know nothing about music. One thing puzzles me:
:*The title of the article is "Felipe Browne".
:*His name is given in the first sentence as "Felipe Browne Braun".
:*Within the article, he is sometimes referred to as "Felipe", sometimes as "Browne".

::I've now learned about Spanish surnames, understood the "Browne Braun", and added the "Spanish naming" template to the article.

== I would like to start a new article. ==

Dear Sir
I'm trying to start a new article in the  cycle manufactures page. I noticed that there is no mention of Trimble cycles from Berryville Arkansas USA. Started, made & designed by Brent Trimble. With help from his brother Roo Trimble. They started in 1988 making a carbon mtb. Then a racing bike. The company ended in 1998 due financial problems. The company was restarted in 2005 till 2007 when again production stopped. I have pictures of these bikes.  
This brand is not in you list of cycle manufactures.
Please can you help?
Many Thanks

:see [[WP:42|the basic requirements for having a stand alone article]]. Does the company meet them? If so, you may gather your [[WP:RS|reliably published third party sources]] and follow the process at [[WP:AFC]] or you can suggest that someone else create the article at [[WP:RA]]. -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]] 18:26, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

== "league championships" for football teams ==

The way league championships are counted for football teams needs to be changed. Right now, only Super Bowl championships are counted as league championships (look at the Oakland Raider spage for example). Things is, there have been other leagues besides the NFL, like when the AFL was its own separate league.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Afm2105|Afm2105]] ([[User talk:Afm2105|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Afm2105|contribs]]) 18:52, 24 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
