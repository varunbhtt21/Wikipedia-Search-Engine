The '''Goffs Schoolhouse''' is a historic school building located at 37198 Lanfair Road in [[Goffs, California|Goffs]], [[California]]. Opened in 1914, the [[one-room schoolhouse]] was the first in Goffs used solely as a school; prior to its construction, the school district had used a rented building. Architect Anthony Beimer designed the [[Mission Revival architecture|Mission Revival]] building. The district served students in a {{convert|1000|sqmi|adj=on}} region surrounding Goffs; its students were the children of the area's miners and railroad workers. Many of the students came from Mexican immigrant families, and bilingual students often served as teacher's assistants to translate for the teacher. Goffs residents also used the school building as a community center, and it housed a branch of the [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] Library. The school closed in 1937, when the Goffs School District merged with the [[Needles, California|Needles]] district. During [[World War II]], the school building served as a canteen for the [[Desert Training Center]], the largest Army training facility in the United States. The Mojave Desert Heritage and Cultural Association now uses the building as a museum and cultural center.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Andrew|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Goffs Schoolhouse|url={{NRHP url|id=01001102}}|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=April 27, 2014|author2=Laurie Boetcher |author3=Corrine Miller |author4=Thonni Morikawa |author5=Ross Nelson |author6=Joe Thomson |date=April 9, 2001}} {{NRHP url|id=01001102|title=Accompanied by photos|photos=y}}.</ref>
