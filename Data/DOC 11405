* ... that '''[[Alien Spidy|extraterrestrial spiders]]''' have only six legs?
:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/Barney Berlinger]]
:* ''Comment'': This is quite obviously an April Fools hook. I can create a regular one if need be, but this came to mind immediately, so I ran with it.
<small>Created by [[User:Sven Manguard|Sven Manguard]] ([[User talk:Sven Manguard|talk]]). Self nominated at 00:41, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Date and length OK, hook citation checks out. The hook is fun and I see no objection to using it outside 1 April. A fully-cited and clearly-written, nice article. Just two points: (1) The word "grapple" has a disambig link; IMO it doesn't need a link at all, really. (2) No QPQ yet, though you have had more than 5 successful DYK noms. So if you could please remove the disambig link, and either do a QPQ review or explain why you don't need to, then this nom is good to go. --[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 07:09, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:* I should add that the article contains a non-free image, but the rationale and image licence check out OK.--[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 07:46, 28 April 2014 (UTC) 
::*[[User:Storye book|Storye book]]: I've delinked grapple. As for the QPQ, it is [[Template:Did you know nominations/Barney Berlinger]] (as has been noted above this entire time {{wink}}).

:::* Oh, I'm so sorry, don't know how I missed it. Had to giggle about that. Thanks for your patience! And thanks for the delink. All is well.
:::* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Good to go. --[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 19:25, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
