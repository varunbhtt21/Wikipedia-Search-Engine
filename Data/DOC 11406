:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The cited source (or the article) is not so certain that it's an ambush predator for sure. Need to add "likely" to the hook. Also, "elapids" should be linked, as it's not a common word. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 04:21, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]]  It did not take long to find an example of uncomfortably close paraphrasing in this article. Based on problems with other snake articles written by this author (see [[Black mamba]] for one example), I don't think this is appropriate for the main page until a more thorough check is undertaken.
