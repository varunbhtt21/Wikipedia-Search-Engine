:({{Find sources|Virginia Williamson}})
A Google search reveals no reliable sources to, in fact of the sources that do exist (poor quality and only mentions her in passing) her name is actually Virginia Londner or Virginia Londner Green. <span style="font-size:smaller; background:GreenYellow; padding:3px; padding-left:3px; border-radius:10px; border:1px black">[[User:Mrfrobinson|Mrfrobinson]] ([[User talk:Mrfrobinson|talk]])</span> 20:52, 23 March 2014 (UTC) 00:50, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''on the fence''' doesn't seem to pass GNG for now. {{ping|Ottawahitech}} can you get more sources that cover her life and impact on Byte magazine and early computing in more detail? Also need to determine best name for the article as Mrfrobinson is right in the sources I found she was Virginia Green. But I think we need more than just the fact she founded a magazine - we need more detailed coverage of her. Such might exist in magazines from the late 70s, early 80s but would require likely going to the library. One option might be to move to draft space while additional sources are found to establish notability - I have a guess that she might pass but need to see more sources.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 11:27, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:That was the problem I had, on the surface she looks notable except there is barely any mention of her anywhere. You would think there would be even a news article that mentions her but I came up empty handed. Plus the name thing is a big issue. <span style="font-size:smaller; background:GreenYellow; padding:3px; padding-left:3px; border-radius:10px; border:1px black">[[User:Mrfrobinson|Mrfrobinson]] ([[User talk:Mrfrobinson|talk]])</span> 20:52, 23 March 2014 (UTC) 13:30, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::the name worries me less - thAts a matter of just finding the best title. But for now we need some way to establish notability, which would probably require pulling old magazines from a library that might have a more detailed profile of her and discuss the impact she had on computing. Absent that we should prob delete for non-notability or Userfy.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 14:00, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::::The only thing that bothers me about the name is it makes the search hard, I've just found another reference to her but her name was Peschke in that one. <span style="font-size:smaller; background:GreenYellow; padding:3px; padding-left:3px; border-radius:10px; border:1px black">[[User:Mrfrobinson|Mrfrobinson]] ([[User talk:Mrfrobinson|talk]])</span> 20:52, 23 March 2014 (UTC) 15:39, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Just put the other names she is known by in the lede of the article, and list any other new names you find here so ppl looking for sources can find them. If kept we could discuss a rename later.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 16:31, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep'''. Finding sources for this subject is difficult as she has had many surnames, including Green, Londner, Peschke, and Williamson. As the founder and publisher of an important computer magazine in the early days of personal computers, she has some claim to notability though. The book ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=-yjr5lAji1wC&pg=PT20&dq=Virginia+byte+magazine&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vo9fU-uWLvXNsQSSu4CIDg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Virginia%20byte%20magazine&f=false Priming the Pump: How TRS-80 Enthusiasts Helped Spark the PC Revolution]'' has more than a passing mention of her. She also figures prominently in the history of Byte magazine. I'm still looking for a reference to support that she was a vice president of McGraw-Hill, which I imagine would also add to her notability.

:After reading that reference I wish I could change my nomination to strong delete. It states that once she become the owner of Byte she quickly sold it to McGraw-Hill. I am sorry but if that is true quickly flipping a business obtained from a divorce does not equate notability. <span style="font-size:smaller; background:GreenYellow; padding:3px; padding-left:3px; border-radius:10px; border:1px black">[[User:Mrfrobinson|Mrfrobinson]] ([[User talk:Mrfrobinson|talk]])</span> 20:52, 23 March 2014 (UTC) 02:30, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:* She had a longer term relationship with the magazine than that. She and Wayne were also the first employees in [[73 (magazine)]], the predecessor to Byte (see [http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/73_Magazine/How_73_Started.htm]).

*'''Comment''' - if any of the statements in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byte_%28magazine%29&diff=337910569&oldid=337104929 this diff for Byte (magazine)] could be verified, it might be sufficient to make her notable. However, all I have been able to find are copies of old versions of [[Byte (magazine)]]. [[User:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist]] ([[User talk:RockMagnetist|talk]]) 16:35, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak delete'''. It sounds like she ''should'' be notable, but I haven't been able to find any good sources. I'll happily change my vote if anyone can find any that do more than mention her. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] ([[User talk:Kaldari|talk]]) 23:41, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - sources check out. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 15:50, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
:* Given that a few people have said they aren't adequate, perhaps you could provide some detail? [[User:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist]] ([[User talk:RockMagnetist|talk]]) 16:21, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
::My answer:
# is a users' organization, and it mentions her twice
# vintagecomputer.com appears to be reliable, and discusses a "publishing predicament [that] would never be settled...."
# is a local source, but [[WP:AGF]], and mentions her in passing
# is also a local source, but 'small town papers' can be reliable; this has more of an extensive discussion, and
# may not be reliable (is The Seeker Books a [[vanity publisher]]?). [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 16:47, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
