==Plot summary==
Set during the reign of [[Edward III of England]] in the 14th-century, the novel follows the romance between [[Joan of Kent]] and Edward's eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]].

==Development==
''The First Princess of Wales'' was written by American author [[Karen Harper]] and published as her third novel.<ref name=contempauthors/> Harper was inspired to become a writer by the [[Anya Seton]] novel ''[[Katherine (Seton novel)|Katherine]]'', as well as her many visits to English historical sites.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.penguin.com/book/mistress-shakespeare-by-karen-harper/9781440697722 |title=Q&A |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref> After publishing her first novel in 1982, Harper left her job teaching British literature to become a professional author.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/authors/karen-harper.aspx |title=Karen Harper |publisher=[[Random House]]  |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ohioana-authors.org/harper/highlights.php |title=Highlights of a Life |publisher=Ohioana Library Association |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref>

Near the time of the novel's publication in 1984, Harper was in part inspired by the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer]], particularly when the newly married couple appeared on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] together. Later, however, Harper felt the romance between Edward and Joan in her novel better resembled the "longtime, sometimes secret love between Prince Charles and [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]]", as the author felt both couples faced opposition from their respective families.{{sfn|Harper|1984|pp=610–11}}

The novel was first published in 1984 as ''Sweet Passion's Pain'' by [[Zebra Books]] before being re-released as ''The First Princess of Wales''.<ref name=contempauthors>{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3482900079.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114224207/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3482900079.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 14, 2018 |title=Harper, Karen 1945– |work=Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series |date=January 1, 2006 |accessdate=April 30, 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}</ref><ref name=publishersweekly/> [[Three Rivers Press]] published it in paperback in December 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-12-24/entertainment/0612230180_1_wild-west-show-new-edition-suzan-lori-parks |title=New In Paperback |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> In a 2006 review, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' praised the author for "breath[ing] a lust for life into history's distant icons" and for "keep[ing] the tension taut as she weaves together the many subplots into a first-rate epic.
