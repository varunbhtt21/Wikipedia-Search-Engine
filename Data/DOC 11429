The '''Atka B-24D Liberator''' is a derelict bomber on [[Atka Island]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]]. The [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated B-24D Liberator]] was deliberately crash-landed on the island on 9 December 1942, and is one of only eight surviving D-model Liberators (including partial and derelict aircraft). The aircraft, serial no. ''40-2367'', was built in 1941, and was serving on weather reconnaissance duty when it was prevented from landing at any nearby airfields due to poor weather conditions. The only casualty of the crash landing was Brigadier General [[William E. Lynd]], who suffered a fractured collarbone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/aviation/atk.htm|title=Atka B-24D Liberator|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>

The wreck site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979,<ref name="nris"/> and was designated as part of the [[World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument]] in 2008.
