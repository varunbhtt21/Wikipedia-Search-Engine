*'''Delete''' - per nom. As a player, he fails [[WP:NSPORT]] having never played in a fully pro league. He also fails [[WP:GNG]] having not received significant coverage either as a player or a fitness trainer. [[User:Sir Sputnik|Sir Sputnik]] ([[User talk:Sir Sputnik|talk]]) 14:34, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - fails [[WP:GNG]] (no significant coverage) and [[WP:NFOOTBALL]] (has not played or managed in a [[WP:FPL|fully-professional league]]. Being a fitness coach in one is not sufficient. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 17:44, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
