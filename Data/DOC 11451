'''Treia Cathedral''', otherwise the '''Church of the Annunciation''' ({{lang-it|Duomo di Treia, Concattedrale della Santissma Annunziata}}, {{lang|it|Chiesa della Santissima Annunziata}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] in the city of [[Treia]], [[Macerata]], [[Italy]], dedicated to the [[Annunciation]]. It was formerly the seat of the [[bishop of Treia]] from the creation of the diocese of Treia in 1817 to its merging into the [[Diocese of San Severino]] in 1920, and following several other mergers is now a [[co-cathedral]] of the [[Diocese of Macerata-Tolentino-Recanati-Cingoli-Treia]].

The present structure, a re-building of a [[collegiate church]], was erected between 1782 and 1814 to designs by the architect [[Andrea Vici]] (1743-1817), a pupil of [[Luigi Vanvitelli|Vanvitelli]].<ref>[http://www.prolocotreia.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15&Itemid=489 Pro Loco Treia], entry on churches.</ref> It has a [[Greek cross]] ground plan with three naves, divided by [[Corinthian column]]s and pilasters. It has an enormous [[crypt]] nine metres high.

The sacristy of the cathedral houses a painting depicting the ''Apparition of the Virgin Mary near the Convent of Forano to the Blessed Pietro da Treia and the Blessed Corrado da Offida '' by [[Giacomo da Recanati]]. In the church itself is a bust of [[Pope Sixtus V]] by [[Bastiano Torrigiani]]. The church also houses a canvas depicting a ''Deposition'' by [[Vincenzo Pagani]].<ref>Pro Loco Treia.</ref>
