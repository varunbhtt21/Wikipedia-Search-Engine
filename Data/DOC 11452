"'''I’m Falling'''" and "'''Cold Life'''" are songs by American rock band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]. Written by [[Al Jourgensen]], these were first released in 1981 by [[Wax Trax! Records]], as the band's debut single. Initially featuring "I'm Falling" as the A-side, the single found success via its B-side, "Cold Life", which was chosen as the A-side on release in the UK. In 1985, during Ministry's short-lived return on Wax Trax!, the single was reissued with "Cold Life" as the A-side.

Initially, Jourgensen had recorded a demo tape of “I’m Falling” in his apartment, using a newly-bought [[ARP Omni]] synthesizer, a drum machine, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder.<ref name="Uncle Al on ‘I’m Falling’ demo"/> At one occasion, Jourgensen had presented a demo to Jim Nash, the co-founder and co-owner of the [[independent record label]] [[Wax Trax!

After assembling the first line-up of the band subsequently known as Ministry, Jourgensen went to Hedden West studios with co-producer Jay O'Roarke and an English-born engineer [[Iain Burgess]], while Nash had paid for the band to record.<ref name="Ordained by Dance"/><ref name="RedBullWaxTrax!"/> For the recording, beside the core line-up of Jourgensen, keyboardists John Davis and Robert Roberts and drummer [[Stephen George]], also approached were backing vocalist Steve Brighton, bassist Lamont Welton, and a horn player Preston Klik (also of The Book of Holy Lies); Jourgensen assumed an English accent for his vocals on “Cold Life”, like he did on “I’m Falling”.<ref name="Ordained by Dance"/><ref name=Hatchet>{{Cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/gwu_hatchet_19820920#page/n11|title=Ministry: detached tension for funkaholics [Ministry, ''Ministry'', Wax Trax]|last=Hansen|first=Julie|date=September 20, 1982|work=[[The GW Hatchet]]|access-date=August 17, 2018|issue=7|department=Arts|volume=79|page=12|via=the Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Greene|1993|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=50}}.</ref> Nash and his Wax Trax! partner Danny Flesher liked both recorded songs, but requested Jourgensen to record one more track, an instrumental titled “Primental”, for the single; Jourgensen states that “Primental” resembles some of music written for performances held by his then-girlfriend, Shannon Rose Riley.{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=50|postscript=: “Jim and Danny loved the songs and wanted to release them as the third single on Wax Trax! But they wanted a third song, so I put together ‘Primental,’ which was this real cheeseball, dancey instrumental with a drum machine, handclaps, and moog keyboards that sounded like some of the atmospheric stuff I used to write for Shannon’s performance art.”}}
