'''Sewallis Shirley''' (19 October 1709 – 31 October 1765) was a British Member of Parliament in the latter part of the reign of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. His marriage to the [[Margaret Rolle, 15th Baroness Clinton|Dowager Countess of Orford]] ended in divorce after three years, and Shirley spent the last few years of his life as an officer of [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]]'s household.

==Personal life==
He was born the fourteenth son of [[Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers]] (and fourth son by his second wife, Selina). [[Robert Shirley (MP)|Robert Shirley]], MP was his brother.

Shirley was a noted [[rake (character)|rake]], including amongst his lovers the notorious [[Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane|Lady Vane]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Stemmata Shirleiana | first=Evelyn Philip | last=Shirley | authorlink=Evelyn Shirley (1812–1882) | publisher=Nichols and Sons | location=Westminster | year=1873 | page=214 | url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029787250}}</ref> In 1746, he began cohabiting with his mistress, [[Margaret Rolle, 15th Baroness Clinton|Margaret, Countess of Orford]], whom he married on 25 May 1751, shortly after the death of her long-estranged husband, the [[Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford|2nd Earl of Orford]].<ref name="hop">{{cite web | title=Shirley, Hon.

Margaret had taken care to legally protect her own estates and [[jointure]], so that Shirley could have no claims on her property. Shirley's persistent and aggressive demands for money ensured that the rupture would be permanent, although she ultimately settled £750 per year on him to extinguish his claims. An attempt by [[Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet|Sir Horace Mann]] to bring about a reconciliation between them in 1758 was unsuccessful. They had no children.<ref name="hop2">{{cite web | title=Shirley, Hon.

==Politics==
Shirley entered Parliament in 1742 at [[Brackley (UK Parliament constituency)|Brackley]], on the interest of the [[Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater|1st Duke of Bridgewater]], who had withdrawn his support from [[George Lee (English politician)|George Lee]] after the latter accepted office in the [[Carteret Ministry]]. He followed his patron in backing the opposition under [[Robert Walpole]]. After the death of Bridgewater in 1744 and the transfer of the Brackley interest to [[Richard Lyttelton|Sir Richard Lyttelton]], who married Bridgewater's widow in 1745, Shirley conformed with Lyttelton's politics to support [[Henry Pelham]]'s ministry.<ref name="hop" /> From 5 July to 14 November 1746, he was [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] under [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], then [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]].

At the [[1754 British general election|election of 1754]], he was returned for [[Callington (UK Parliament constituency)|Callington]] on his wife's interest, and was identified as a [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]]. By the [[1761 British general election|1761 election]], the two were separated, and Margaret put up one of her agents, [[Richard Stevens (MP)|Richard Stevens]], in Shirley's place; he did not again sit in Parliament. In 1762, he was appointed comptroller of the household to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], a post which he filled until his death in 1765.<ref name="hop2" />
