**All copyvio content has been removed from this article -- [[User:ChrisTheDude|ChrisTheDude]] ([[User talk:ChrisTheDude|talk]]) 20:23, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
***Any update here?  It's been a fortnight....... {{ping|Justlettersandnumbers}} -- [[User:ChrisTheDude|ChrisTheDude]] ([[User talk:ChrisTheDude|talk]]) 17:30, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
****''Cleaned''. Thank you for rewriting that, [[User:ChrisTheDude|ChrisTheDude]]. Alas, we have a real shortage of admins working this area, so there can be a backlog. Nothing like what it this time last year, when (as I recall) it stretched for months. [[User:Justlettersandnumbers]] is an awesome copyright clerk, but not yet an admin and can't merge the rewrites. :) --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 12:04, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
*****My ears are burning! I was concerned that the rewrite was based on the infringing version, not done from scratch. But if {{u|Moonriddengirl}} is happy, then I am too. [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]] ([[User talk:Justlettersandnumbers|talk]]) 10:03, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

::I have already rewritten many of the copyvios as well as doing episode summaries myself. A look at the history will show my edits. [[User:REVUpminster|REVUpminster]] ([[User talk:REVUpminster|talk]]) 20:33, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::[[User:REVUpminster|REVUpminster]], can you identify the copyvios you have not rewritten and perhaps assist with rewriting them? It will help avoid unnecessary deletions. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 12:00, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
::::As the duplicate detector report shows, the problems here are '''not''' fixed. Would it be appropriate just to remove the summaries completely? They are totally unreferenced, and clearly close-paraphrased from the source(s). [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]] ([[User talk:Justlettersandnumbers|talk]]) 10:03, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::It's unfortunate, but appropriate, [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]]. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 10:30, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::I'm beginning to get the feeling that no one bothered to look at the temporary subpage that I created as per the copyvio warning template. I removed all of the copyright info and pared it back to the barest of episode summaries.  - [[User:X201|X201]] ([[User talk:X201|talk]]) 10:41, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::You're right, [[User:X201|X201]], I missed that the "rewrite" link had turned blue - I was too focused on waiting for a response from the editor who left the note above. I'm sorry about that, for several reasons - not only do I not want you to waste your time, but it would have been quicker for me to merge in your change than place all those little "don't violate copyright" notes. :) Anyway, I'll go merge it now, and I appreciate your taking the time. It's rare that somebody does. :D --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 10:57, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::As must be obvious, I also missed that; sorry about that, {{u|X201}} [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]] ([[User talk:Justlettersandnumbers|talk]]) 11:02, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
::::No problem both. - [[User:X201|X201]] ([[User talk:X201|talk]]) 11:23, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
