:({{Find sources|Bolivarian propaganda}})
No notability (term "Bolivarian propaganda" or any related term has never been used in a reliable source), almost full article is unfixable violation of [[WP:OR]] (particularly [[WP:SYNTH]]), systematically biased and intended as a page attacking the subject. There is nothing which can be actually referenced for this topic without constituting a violation of the aforementioned policies. There are no equivalent articles for any other contemporary political movement except in extreme cases such as [[Nazi propaganda]], and there is no reason for there to be about this one, any more than for any other. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 01:28, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

{{Disagree}} It should be kept as it is an important piece of Chavez's story. There is a substantial amount of reliable sources saying that there is obvious propaganda being use to promote his ideologies. I doubt that ''The New York Times'', ''BBC'', ''The Boston Globe'' and ''CATO Institute'' can not be reliable.''' 

The article has not changed much since [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bolivarian_propaganda|it was decided to '''KEEP''' back in April 2012]]. It was a unanimous decision. Until my recent edits involving education and some pictures added, there was no discussion about deleting this article. '''In fact, there were only 10 edits since the decision and when I began editing the article'''. This article should not be deleted.--[[User:Zfigueroa|Zfigueroa]] ([[User talk:Zfigueroa|talk]]) 02:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

The labeling of something as 'propaganda' (rather than as 'normal' expressions of support for an ideology, certain political views)--except in notable cases ([[Nazi Propaganda]], [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union]], etc.)--reflects a clear subjective judgement (negative POV). Thus this article could only refer to opinions/allegations, or to media campaigns (by political parties, the government, supporters, etc) not traditionally labeled 'propaganda'. This same material would be better suited (and, in some cases, is already covered) within existing articles. For example, there already exists multiple articles on the ideology associated with the 'Bolivarian' movement ([[Bolivarianism]], the [[Bolivarian Revolution]], [[Chavismo]], [[Socialism of the 21st Century]], etc.). There also exist innumerable articles on the politics of this movement, and countless articles on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Venezuelan_media Venezuelan media] and popular culture ([[Media of Venezuela]], [[Censorship_in_Venezuela]], [[Community and alternative media in Venezuela]], [[Media representation of Hugo Chávez]], [[Venezuelan art]], [[Television in Venezuela]], [[Culture of Venezuela]], [[Aló Presidente]], 'popular culture' sections of [[Hugo Chavez]], etc. as well as articles for each of the [[Bolivarian Missions]], for each of the 15 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Venezuela elections] held since 1998, etc.).--[[User:Riothero|Riothero]] ([[User talk:Riothero|talk]]) 03:51, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::The term "Bolivarian propaganda" has been used before.

If anything, the page should have a lot more contributions (preferably more neutral) in order to save it.--[[User:Zfigueroa|Zfigueroa]] ([[User talk:Zfigueroa|talk]]) 05:55, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:Still does not justify its uses, and that's 4 random sources. In the WikiLeaks source, "Bolivarian propaganda" is just a term someone used in some leaked e-mail. Elcomercio.pe is also just displaying some leaked e-mail. And that "cable gate" is just some leaked confidential document. This term is not used in publications, it is not used by the media, it is used nowhere, because it simply does not exist, as Riothero argued. A pro-Chavez campaign exists, but just the same as a pro-Obama campaign exists, which has an article which is '''nothing''' like this article, which definitely cannot be fixed. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 13:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I think the nomination should have made clear what the nominator thinks has changed since the last AfD, rather than just posting a new AfD with the same reasons.  Use of the term is not widespread in the secondary literature but it's there.  The article itself is well-sourced and the complaint seems really to be about POV concerns.  I think the solution there is to add further information to present a balanced, neutral POV, not delete the article.

Yes, the article is well-sourced, that's something I acknowledged from the start, do you even read? "It's there"? No, the term "Bolivarian propaganda" or any similar terms do not actually exist in any research, publication, or whatever.

*'''Keep''': Unlike other countries, Venezuela has long crossed the treshold between mere political campaign and outright propaganda. See [[Propaganda#Specific techniques]]: Ad hominem, ad nauseam, appeal to authority, appeal to fear, appeal to prejudice, bandwagon, inevitable victory, join the crowd, the lie, blac-and-white fallacy, selective truth, common man, cult of personality, demonizing the enemy, disinformation... if we go though the whole list, we'll find that the Chavista regime uses the vast majority of propaganda techniques. And so, [[WP:SPADE|call a spade a spade]]. Nobody ever said that propaganda was something that can only be found in nazi germany or in soviet russia. After all, in other countries you watch Big Brother, but in Chavista Venezuela, Big Brother watches you!

::So what? That is only your irrelevant opinion. You're not understanding the issue at hand that is that the only article this article can exist is through violations of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:SYNTH]] and notability guidelines. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 19:09, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::The fact, that you people must understand, is that while there may be "institutionalized propaganda", in your opinion, there is no study, research, or publication which systematically deals with this "propaganda" (which a non-biased user may simply call a normal political campaign), other than passing mentions of "propaganda" in news items about Venezuela. The article, no matter how well sourced it is, is simply a massive violation of [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:SYNTH]]. Additionally, the article takes the form of an article attacking the Chavista political campaign. The article contains random criticisms of the government which have only a very weak relationship of the topic and copypastes of random lines from articles criticising the government, which are used in an original research [[WP:SYNTH]] manner to say whoever made the Wikipedia article wants to say. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 19:09, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:::There are not many researchs or books about the Chavista regime because, unlike nazi germany or soviet russia, it is still a modern government, still located in the newspapers rather than in the history books. It is still ongoing, and we do not know yet how will it end and what will come after it. Historians always prefer to work with historical periods wich are finished, so that their work do not get outdated in a few months. But, as Wikipedia is not printed, it does not have the same problem. It is acceptable to work with modern things that most historians do not work with just yet, and reliable newspapers are accepted as sources even if the subject lacks actual academic studies. [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 22:20, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Sure it is, the problem is that there are not many newspaper articles which have really focused on this, rather this article just references random lines (violation of [[WP:SYNTH]]) from articles about Venezuela which are somewhat related to the topic. Original research is not allowed in Wikipedia. I suggest that you view the article, review Wikipedia policies once again, and re-consider your decision. Additionally, the notability of the subject matter itself is not established, as said by others. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 22:48, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': Delete for the reasons laid out by [[User:Zozs|Zozs]]. The article is mainly a collection of loosely related snippets of information, most of which could probably be more effectively integrated into other articles (the education section into [[Education in Venezuela]], for example.) The title term is obscure, and although the article has a decent number of sources, the sources fail to establish the notability of the title subject. --[[User:4idaho|4idaho]] ([[User talk:4idaho|talk]]) 19:04, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep and improve:''' First of all I wish to highlight the [[WP:N]] of the article: There is no doubt that Chávez and his successor Maduro governments have marked a significant period in Venezuelan history. Chávez has created a great popular support, especially from the lower class persons, and most of this support was created by the way president Chávez communicated his charisma and used the media to his advantage. I consider that the article has good content but also a [[WP:POV]] issue, which can be solved with further editing and contribution, not a [[WP:OR]] or [[WP:SYNTH]] violation which seems to have been talked about in the previous discussion: if the [[WP:POV]] is a problem more references should be included to turn the article more neutral. For example, its introduction could be more descriptive, and the other sections could explain the ideology of the propaganda or the ways it is featured. For example, the first paragraph of the background section currently explains the ''Bolivarian Revolution'' concept, but then criticizes the government through several sources, while it could explain more about the effects of the ''Bolivarian Revolution'' in the Venezuelan ideology. The term "[[propaganda]]" can usually be misinterpreted to have a negative connotation and as a synonym, for example, of "[[indoctrination]]". If the title of the article is the problem it should be renamed with a more appropriate title, and if there's information that would be better in another article some of its content could be merged with them. I don't know if some things that I said would be better in the article's talk page, but this is my opinion. The article should not be deleted, and the article's most notable contributor, [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]], should be informed about the deletion request. --[[User:Jamez42|Jamez42]] ([[User talk:Jamez42|talk]]) 22:47, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::You have not explained how the subject matter is notable in its own right and not by extension (although Chavez is), the only thing which could grant it "notability" is the random mention of "propaganda" in a few articles about Venezuela. Additionally, you have not explained how it is not an OR or SYNTH violation. And there is systematical POV because of the nature of the article. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 23:46, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::{{reply to|Zozs}} In short I'd say that the most important aspect of the article is the effect of the ideology in the people and not the propaganda itself. However, as I mentioned before, the methods of how the propaganda is featured could be described (billboards, wall paintings, toys, books, etc.). I also consider is not an OR or SYNTH because the content of the article can be sourced properly while fixing the POV issue. --[[User:Jamez42|Jamez42]] ([[User talk:Jamez42|talk]]) 00:08, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Is there any research, source or article on "the effect on the people"? Is there any research on the "propaganda"? How would you source, in such a manner that it is not "SYNTH"? It is my opinion that this is impossible. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 00:13, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

::::{{reply to|Zozs}} The effect on the people I'm referring to is mostly that of the Bolivarian ideology and Chávez presidency, which can be expressed in the huge support he received, the demonstrations in favor of his government and, giving an example of a research, poll regarding their opinion towards Chávez. The ways of expressing the propaganda can be cited referencing the political campaigns carried out (during an electoral period, for example) or urban paintings supporting Chávez or being against the United States government, like the one that is shown in the article. If I happen to find this kind of "propaganda" or paintings I would be glad to take pictures of them. --[[User:Jamez42|Jamez42]] ([[User talk:Jamez42|talk]]) 00:32, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::So basically, there is no research about that "propaganda" and this can be done only through original research. Articles about the political campaigns can exist, but this article is just a mess and intended as an attack. There is nothing into it which is worth saving. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 00:42, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::{{reply to|Zozs}} The detail is explaining exactly what do you mean with "propaganda". Putting the political campaigns apart and thinking about what the article says, "messages and pictures used to influence the behaviors and opinions of the Venezuelan people and promote Hugo Chávez's version of a 21st-century Bolivarian Revolution", then we would be facing the political bias dilemma. The most recent expression of this "Bolivarian Propaganda" would be the resolution 58 and the new government curriculum, which has been accused of several times to be politically biased due to its [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQxAxWZIdc8 content], and could be named as a propaganda precisely for being messages that can change the subject's opinion. I think that the article can reach a neutral point of view by not seeing this messages or pictures under a negative light, but as an effort to gain support from citizens, just like in a political campaign the candidates are looking for people to vote for them. --[[User:Jamez42|Jamez42]] ([[User talk:Jamez42|talk]]) 00:55, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::Again, making a "Bolivarian propaganda" article based on using bits from here and there would constitute original research, which is a point that you are not refuting. The resolution 58 information fits on the [[Education in Venezuela]] article. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 02:22, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::{{reply to|Zozs}} I still consider that these messages and pictures still fall into the term of "propaganda" because of their influence (or their attempt) towards individuals. Chávez has been a very influential person, to the point that some persons even consider him now as a [http://www.el-nacional.com/sociedad/Hugo-Chavez-santo-capilla_0_166183388.html saint], and during his government there was (and still is) a lot of propaganda about him. Something as simple as a soda advertisement can be considered as propaganda because of the influence it has on people, and there's nothing wrong about it, it depends on the way you see it or it is expressed, and that is part of the POV issue. At least that's the way I see it and why I think this article shouldn't be deleted. I think it could be renamed, merged or cleaned up, but not everything in it is an attack on the government. --[[User:Jamez42|Jamez42]] ([[User talk:Jamez42|talk]]) 02:41, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

I this the issue at hand is an important part of the Venezuelan society, and as such, shouldn't be ignored.

So I just did a search of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&limit=500&offset=0&profile=default&search=intitle%3Apropaganda Wikipedia articles with "propaganda" in the title]. These are the instances when it referred to a state (click "show"):

As you can see this kind of article (this is a KIND of article, it is not only the fact that the word "propaganda" is used in the title, it is the whole type of article which this is part of) is used only with extreme cases like the propaganda of a single-party state and only when there is well available documentation and research on the subject, NOT like this article, which is just arbitrary bits from news articles used as a reference to produce an article which fits the author's opinion. You people need to understand that with the current state of available sources, it is impossible to do an article like this without violating original research guidelines.

::Single-party state as in being the most dominate party in a nation for almost two decades? I mean Chavez's party in Venezuela has changed names but they've always remained loyal to Chavez for 15 years now. '''That is the same amount of time that the Nazi party was becoming the most dominant party in Germany''' (1930-1945). So it is not too far fetched to call Venezuela a single-party state. But that is just my opinion Zozs. Just like it is your opinion for wanting to delete this article.--[[User:Zfigueroa|Zfigueroa]] ([[User talk:Zfigueroa|talk]]) 05:23, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Single-party state is obviously a state where all other parties are inexistent, because it is a dictatorship. The thing is that most of you saying "Keep" are not making any arguments, just displaying your biased point of view. "Chavez is evil", "Chavez is evil", "Chavez is evil". That's all the arguments you guys have for "Keeping" this. Now you're comparing Venezuela to Nazi Germany. The thing is that everyone is free to post his opinion there, but he must make it from arguments which relate to Wikipedia policy, not from one's own personal view of the subject, which is what all the "keepers" are doing here.

::::Zos, you brought the nazis into the discussion yourself, in the opening of this discussion. No, there is no point of comparison between Chavismo and Nazism as a whole, because Chavismo is not attempting or calling for any Holocaust, and thus does not deserve the universal rejection that Nazism deserves. Having said that, Zfigueroa's point is not about that: it's that, if we seek international well known examples of governments attempting a similar type of government, limiting civic freedoms and using all media to praise the glorious leader and say the most horrible things about the domestic or international opposition, then yes, nazism is one of the first examples that comes to mind.

::::::Exactly. I'm not saying that anyone is evil. I am just saying there are similarities in '''some cases'''. I used my opinion just for the Nazi case too.

'''Of course there are some problems with the article''', it is about a '''controversial subject''' and '''is still occurring at the moment'''. It isn't a situation that has been happening for long enough to have the extravagant research you demand Zozs. There are plenty of books out there about this topic and they just need to be used to improve upon this article. Also, most of the propaganda sources you provided have been long established for over 50 years. That gives people plenty of time to research what has happened in effected areas. Chavez's propaganda has primarily happened in the past decade and is still developing (as you can see from new content being placed in the article).  We all know that Bolivarian propaganda does occur and not only in Venezuela. It has happened at a regional and international level. I have seen images in places like Cuba and Bolivia. The Wikileaks sources also explains how wherever Chavez went, his Bolivarian ideas followed.--[[User:Zfigueroa|Zfigueroa]] ([[User talk:Zfigueroa|talk]]) 15:10, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

Now, the current version of the article is only suitable for deletion. [[User:Zozs|Zozs]] ([[User talk:Zozs|talk]]) 22:26, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::::::::::That is why the users here want to keep the article. '''This article hasn't been edited for almost 2 years since I began editing'''. Many things have changed in the past 2 years for Venezuela.--[[User:Zfigueroa|Zfigueroa]] ([[User talk:Zfigueroa|talk]]) 00:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' No evidence has been presented that the topic is notable, and there are no sources used in the article that specifically discuss the topic.  In rhetorical speech, the word "propaganda" is frequently added to the name of any political group - Communist propaganda, Yankee propaganda, right-wing propaganda, feminist propaganda, etc.  We should not find every noun in the dictionary then apply every possible adjective and generate as many articles as possible.

*'''Keep'''.  While the term "Bolivarian propaganda" may return few hits, the '''Venezuelan''' propaganda phenom is notable; '''Bolivarian''' refers to the last few decades of Venezuelan history, during the Chavez/Maduro years, where the propaganda issues have differed from historical issues.   Notability for recent Venezuelan propaganda issues is not hard to establish;  have a look, for example, at [http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/04/28/4085192/how-maduro-is-interfering-in-venezuelas.html what is going on in Venezuelan schools,] where a Cuban curriculum is mandated.  <blockquote>How Maduro is interfering in Venezuela’s schools ... However, their main concern is that the new regulation takes power away from parents and school authorities, and opens the door for political actors to use schools as places for propaganda. Experts agree, pointing to the slanted nature of some of the textbooks currently being distributed. They point, for example, to an illustrated copy of the constitution that is being sent to many schools in which Hugo Chávez himself is portrayed as a quasi-religious figure along with Simon Bolívar. The pictures show Chávez teaching children and Nicolás Maduro standing next to the actual text of the constitution ... </blockquote>  There are many other examples ... the spin around the "coup" of 2002, the notion that the US was involved, etc.' and the article should be/could be expanded to cover more of them.  The now defunct Venezuela Information Office was a key part of the campaign in earlier years, and their are still other quasi-official mouthpieces for the government that could be covered.  What has happened in the movie industry is another example to be covered.  This is a question of using the best search terms and knowing where to look.  Is "Bolivarian" the best term to use in the article name?  Well, is it right to name the article "Venezuelan propaganda", when this phenom is occurring only since the "Bolivarian Revolution"?    Are there examples of Venezuelan propaganda pre-Chavez?   Or is it better to call the article "Venezuelan propaganda since 1998"?  [[Propaganda in Venezuela]] would not be an adequate title, as the campaign is international.  Venezuelan propaganda ?  Whatever the title is, the phenom occurring since the "Bolivarian revolution" is real and distinct.

::That's your personal opinion not backed by sources. Some random opinion article on an unknown web news site saying Chavez is a "quasi-religious figure", yeah, that's a joke. You fail to establish the notability of the subject matter, and do not address the issue of the article being based on the whole on original research.

:::* It appears from reading the article, and the sources already there, that my "personal opinion" is backed by a large number of reliable sources.  Renaming the article to Chavez/Maduro propaganda doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I'm open to other suggestions.

::::These sources aren't research or publications on "Bolivarian propaganda". They're simply hand-picked publications which are not research about "Bolivarian propaganda" but simply contain criticism of the government, and are used to push original research and a POV.

:::To be fair, I read an article on The Huffington Post (definitely not an "unknown web news site") that describes that supposed issue. --[[User:Yeah 93|yeah_93]] ([[User talk:Yeah 93|talk]]) 21:06, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

==This is Zozs' personal nomination for deletion==
Zozs, it seems that you are the only one who continuously pushes to have this article deleted. '''You think your opinion is greater than 7 other users and refuse to take down the nomination for deletion.''' I know that some other users have asked for the deletion, '''but the majority has spoken and it has been a week now'''. Throughout this nomination page you have accused others of only using their opinion when the whole reason the article was nominated and is still being nominated is because of your personal opinion. This nomination is no longer due to Wikipedia's standards but due to Zozs' personal opinion and needs to be dealt with promptly.--[[User:Zfigueroa|Zfigueroa]] ([[User talk:Zfigueroa|talk]]) 23:20, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
