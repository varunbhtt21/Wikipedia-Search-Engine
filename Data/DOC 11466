== The Como Brothers Band ==
To Whom this may concern,

The page was charged with these counts:
21:57, 19 April 2014 FreeRangeFrog (talk | contribs) deleted page The Como Brothers Band (G11: Unambiguous advertising or promotion)
18:58, 19 April 2014 NawlinWiki (talk | contribs) deleted page The Como Brothers Band (A3: Article that has no meaningful, substantive content)
07:27, 24 February 2013 Qwyrxian (talk | contribs) deleted page The Como Brothers Band (A7: Article about a band, singer, musician, or musical ensemble, which does not indicate the importance or significance of the subject)

I do not understand why The Como Brothers Band Wikipedia page was deleted. I contested the deletion and it appears no one even looked at my objections. I request this page be restored. Read through the page and you will see that all information being relayed can be verified by third party persons. All facts written are referenced and sources are clearly outlined. All material is objective and unbiased. This page was not created for the promotion/advertisement of any person, place or product - FreeRangeFrog is with G11 unjustly labeling the page before reading its content. The Wikipedia page is needed to clarify information regarding the nature of the band, history, and its verified web sources - NawlinWiki and Qwyrxian with A3 and A7 are wrongly assuming that the facts being relayed are not relevant and important to fans, agencies, and record companies. The band needs a source to relay information that is accurate as there have been several discrepancies. The Como Brothers Band is even referenced in other Wikipedia pages.  Several bands of lower caliber than themselves, with fewer references have Wikipedia pages.  Please explain what make the Como Brothers Band a lesser entity than The Brooks Young Band, Kingsfoil, Jeff Leblanc,Push Play, Rachel Elelynae, Patent Pending, Colortheory, John Tagileri, Juliet Ashby, Katie Cole, Erene, Jamestown Story, Joesph Jett,Rattlin' Bones, Gary Hoey, Jenn Bostic,NO (Band), Action Item,  and many many others.  You did not even give me a proper amount of time to complete or fix the supposed problems. I do not understand why this band is being discriminated against.  Fans have tried to make a Wikipedia pages for the band int the past and it is consistently deleted.  Please let me know how this problem can be resolved. 

Thank you,
Marissa

Someone mistakenly have thought Sauer S 1800 UL is the same engine as the certified Sauer S 1800 engines and then just deleted the Sauer S 1800 UL article and redirected to Sauer S 1800. They have similar names, but all Sauer "UL" versions are different from the certified versions, different cylinders, different crank shaft, different characteristics.

Both the criteria applied for the Speedy Deletion of this Page doesn't apply to this page. 

This is '''not''' a page created to promote Swamiji Ramakrishnan. He is already a popular Swami in North India - Rishikesh, Himalayas. 
He has an Ahsram that is visited regularly by many people. Moreover, his contributions & works on the traditional Sanskrit works
in particular Bhagawad Gita, Brahmasutra & the canonical philosophical systems of India  has been lauded across the country & adopted
as texts in many of the Universities. He has been christened "Dravidacharya" owing to his works. 
He is regularly invited for lectures in all the important Mutts in India including the  birth place of Shanakara the most revered of Indian philosophers.
 
Surely the deletion of this page is by someone who is '''unaware''' of the importance of such young Swamis & their contributions to the 
contemporary philosophy & scholarship of India.  

I request an un-deletion of this page.

I am the owner of the page. All the content and information is completely legitimate and ethical. I have conducted some of the the most important interviews of our time for New York Wisdom. There is a fine line between many od the pages I see posted on Wikipedia and this page which demonstrates the many accomplishments as an entrepreneur and active member of the community are rather puzzling and maybe personally motivated by third parties who envy the success of others.

I have just added sourced info, including the $26 million founding gift, and the fact that a large Gothic revival building (former home of a theological seminary) at the edge of te campus is being renovated by a notable architecture firm to house the new Collegium.  The Collegium is new, but it is clearly a well-supported, major institute.

Hello. The Page 'Media Idee' was deleted for the company not being notable at the time. 

Since then, the following are some of the projects that have gotten it into the limelight: 

The biggest one is the Organization of the first ever Dolphin Show in Pakistan. Please see http://www.dolphinshow.org/partner.php and www.facebook.com/dolphinshowkarachi for proof that MI was the main organizer. Just Google 'Dolphin Show Karachi' and you will get about a 100 links back from major media companies in the country discussing that including some that actually Cite Media Idee. This is one FB page which lists the event's as MI: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Media-Idee/346860588664883.

Maybe this time around I will be able to work more fluidly with your system. 
Maybe with acceptance for non deletion I won't use my Mac... and things will be clearer and easier.
I think you wanted me to provide a source for where Stacy Doris was born? 
The verification of sources for each of her books seems odd, if that is what you were asking me for. Should I put links to the Library of Congress or the Bibliotheque Nationale de France for each? I found the system hard to work with, but can perhaps get used to it. But then having the minimal things I started putting in there questioned was disheartening...
How can I start editing this again?
Many thanks!!!! -[[User:Wattsirod|Wattsirod]] ([[User talk:Wattsirod|talk]]) 12:30, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

Contested PROD yesterday morning, after noticing through Article alerts that the PROD was about to expire.  The contested PROD was either ignored or overlooked (or not saved, but since I posted it through my phone rather than a real computer, it would be difficult for me to determine if that were the case) and the article was deleted perhaps less than a half hour later, which was about three hours short of the time listed on the PROD notice purporting to be the "deadline to contest PROD".  Seeing as how the article does at least give hint of the organization's notability, AFD is the more suitable venue for this. -[[User:RadioKAOS|<span style="color:green;"> RadioKAOS </span>]]/[[User talk:RadioKAOS|<span style="color:green;"> Talk to me, Billy </span>]]/[[Special:Contributions/RadioKAOS|<span style="color:green;"> Transmissions </span>]] 18:16, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

The reason for the removal was an issue of notability, but the context and work done by this organization is important in the Vancouver, Canada setting.  The issue of poverty and hunger are not trivial matters in Canada's lowest income area.  The organization in contention provides social aid that is different from other responsive initiatives, where they address mostly symptoms of poverty and hunger.  Where other organizations try to simply give people food, this organization helps its users to break out of the cycle of poverty giving them choice in their food consumption.  If the Vancouver Food Bank Society deserves a page then there isn't a reason why Quest Food Exchange should be deemed irrelevant.

::::Well, you know, I'm not even sure how ''I'' interpret it! As you can see from the couple of sections above, I restored the history under two redirects. In one case, the history had been deleted as a PROD, so that was okay. In the other case, the history was on a different page that was deleted as a result of [[WP:MFD]] rather than [[WP:AFD]]. When I performed the merge, I could have re-deleted the history but left it in its restored state. In the case of this subsection here, I deferred to the deleting admin, which I felt was the best course of action, rather than override his decision.

::::It's a good idea to start another discussion to clarify things. The appropriateness of restoring history seems dependent on the situation. If it's history of an improved article or deletion due to PROD, then no problem, unless the deleted history is a copyvio.

:*It looks like it's still in the mainspace and will likely be speedied, but requesting this to be re-created before it's actually deleted is a little premature.

::*In other words, I honestly don't think that this should be re-created even after it's speedied because it's highly unlikely to ever pass notability guidelines given that it aired in June 2013 and never received more than a passing mention here and there.

I have also listed this in the contesting of the deletion.
In brief, Agosto is a real person.  He has been an important part of downtown theater and gay history in New York. 
The fact that he has little presence on the web is exactly why he has requested me to make a Wiki page about him.
Please allow this article to live.
Honestly I do not see any valid and just reason why you would delete it.
We are still in the process of adding links and references.

As per your request I have put in the text "Coming Soon".
Please review the earlier drafts.
I do not see how this content violates any of the rules you cited.
thanks again

I cannot see why the updated information can not be displayed please at it reflects facts rather than opinions. Please can I have a response a.s.a.p.  Many thanks, Helen - comms2014 - 

I have tried to post updated information on the Cardiff Council page for the past couple of days.

the informaiton included is purely factual informaiton about the new arrnagements at the organisaiton and do not have or hold personal viewpoints, I therefore request that my edits which have been saved yet again this afternoon are uploaded to the page a.s.a.p?
The organisation official name has recently changed to City of Cardiff Council following the election of a new Leader, again, this is a fact and needs to be reflected in the Wikipedia informaiton in terms of the title.

I look forward to hearing from you.

thanks,
