The '''Kakwani index''' is a measure of the [[progressive taxation|progressivity]] of a [[social intervention]], and is used by [[social scientist]]s, [[statistician]]s, and [[economist]]s. It is named after the economist who first proposed and used it, [[Nanak Chand Kakwani]].<ref name="De Maio">{{cite journal|last=De Maio|first=Fernando G|title=Income inequality measures|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|date=Oct 2007|volume=61|issue=10|pages=849–852|doi=10.1136/jech.2006.052969|pmid=17873219|pmc=2652960}}</ref>

The Kakwani index uses the [[Gini index|Gini framework]] to measure how progressive a social intervention is. It is equal to the difference between the Gini index for the social intervention, and the Gini index for incomes before imposition of the policy intervention. Theoretically, the Kakwani index can vary between −1 to 1; the larger the index is, the more progressive is the social intervention.<ref name=Kakwani>{{cite journal|last=Kakwani|first=Nanak C.|title=Measurement of Tax Progressivity: An International Comparison|journal=The Economic Journal|date=March 1977|volume=87|issue=345|pages=71–80|doi=10.2307/2231833|jstor=2231833}}<!--|accessdate=22 May 2014--></ref>

The index is calculated using the following formula:
:<math>K_t = 2\sum^n_{k=1} \frac{1}{n}(\frac{k}{n} - \sum_{i=1}^k \gamma_i) - G_{beforetax},</math>

where <math>i = 1, . . ., k</math> denotes individual <math>i</math>, <math>n</math> is the total number of individuals in society, <math>\gamma_i</math> is the share of total taxes paid by individual <math>i</math>, and <math>G_{beforetax}</math> is the before-tax Gini coefficient. Using the formula for the Gini coefficient, the equation for the Kakwani index can be reduced to:
:<math>K_t=\frac{2}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n (\sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i - \gamma_i),</math>

where <math>\alpha_i</math> denotes the share of income received by individual <math>i</math>.

The Kakwani index was originally devised to measure the progressivity of [[tax system]]s, in which case, it would be equal to the [[Gini concentration index]]{{what|date=October 2016}} for the taxes collected minus the [[Gini index]] for pre-tax incomes.<ref name=Kakwani/> This can be shown to be equal to the absolute decline in the Gini index for incomes, caused by the imposition of taxation, divided by the average net rate of taxes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bracewell-Milnes|first=Barry|title=Measurement of Tax Progressivity: A Comment|journal=The Economic Journal|date=September 1979|volume=89|issue=355|pages=648–651|doi=10.2307/2231875|jstor=2231875}}<!--|accessdate=22 May 2014--></ref>

The Kakwani index is also commonly used to examine the equity of government [[health care]] provision. In that situation, the Kakwani index would be equal to the difference between the [[Gini coefficient]] for incomes and the Gini concentration index for out‐of‐pocket health care payments.<ref name="De Maio"/>
