'''Tano Eduardo  Tijerina''' (born June 23, 1974) is a [[ranch]]er and [[business]]man from his native [[Laredo, Texas]], who is the [[County Judge]] of [[Webb County, Texas|Webb County]] in [[South Texas]], United States. On January 1, 2015, he became the 23rd person to hold the elected office since Webb County was established in 1848. For five years beginning in 1993, Tijerina was a [[baseball]] player for minor-league teams of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].

==Background==

A Laredo native, Tijerina is one of two sons of Cayetano Tijerina, III, and  Rosalinda Flores, educators in Webb County. His brother is Carlos Tijerina.<ref name=bio/> Tijerina's grandfather, Cayetano "Tito" Tijerina, Jr. (1919–2014), was a [[United States Marine]] sharpshooter in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] in World War II and for forty-six years an employee of the [[United States Postal Service]] in Laredo. He and his late wife, Dora, had fifteen children.<ref>"Cayetano "Tito" Tijerina, Jr.", ''Laredo Morning Times'', November 20, 2014, p. 10A</ref> His aunt by marriage, Rosaura Palacios "Wawi" Tijerina, the wife of Tijerina's uncle, Omar, is a Laredo [[lawyer]] and former educator who has served since 2007 as the Precinct 2 Webb County Commissioner, one of four positions, along with the county judge, that governs the county by handling most government business outside the Laredo city limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webbcountytx.gov/Pct2/Biography/|title=Biographical History|publisher=webbcountytx.gov|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}</ref><ref name=tijerinatorunagain/>

While in high school, Tijerina worked in the early 1990s for [[H-E-B]] grocery and a fence company in Laredo.<ref name=linkedin>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/tanoforcountyjudge|title=Tano for County Judge|publisher=linkedin.com|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>

==Baseball==
In 1992, Tijerina graduated from [[J. W. Nixon High School]], where he played baseball for the Nixon Mustangs under coach Butch Flores. Tijerina was named to the Class 5A All-State team and played in the Texas High School North–South All-Star game in the [[Astrodome]].<ref name=halloffame/> He thereafter enrolled at the two-year [[Navarro College]] in [[Corsicana, Texas|Corsicana]], Texas.
 
In 1993, Tijerina was drafted at the age of eighteen in the eighth round by the Milwaukee Brewers and pitched right-handed for that organization's minor league clubs for five years.<ref name=bio/> He played for the [[Arizona League Brewers]] team in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], the [[Beloit Snappers]] in [[Beloit, Wisconsin]], the [[Helena Brewers]] in [[Helena, Montana]], and the [[Rio Grande Valley WhiteWings]] of the [[Texas–Louisiana League]] in [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]], Texas. Tijerina spent five years in the Brewers organization. He peaked at Low-A ball for the Beloit Snappers, posting in six seasons a 16-19 record and a 6.48 [[Earned run average]].<ref name=lemurs/> In his third spring training Tijerina was sidelined by an injury which required surgery on his elbow and limited his potential to enter the major leagues.<ref name=halloffame/>
 
In 2002, having left the Brewers he played a sixth season in the [[Central Baseball League]] for the [[Edinburg Roadrunners]] in [[Edinburg, Texas|Edinburg]], Texas. In 2009, at the age of thirty-five, Tijerina played a single season for the since defunct [[Laredo Broncos]] in [[United League Baseball]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=tijeri001tan|title=Tano Tijerina|publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>
 
After retiring from baseball, Tijerina in 2002 earned his college degree from [[Texas A&M International University]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://tanoforcountyjudge.com/?page_id=18|title=Meet Tano|publisher=tanoforcountyjudge.com|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>
 
In 2004, Tijerina was inducted into the Laredo Latin American International Sports Hall of Fame.<ref name=halloffame>{{cite web|url=http://madmax.lmtonline.com/textarchives/010904/p4.htm|title=Tano Tijerina picked to Latin Hall, January 9, 2004|work=Laredo Morning Times|accessdate=April 27, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140428012059/http://madmax.lmtonline.com/textarchives/010904/p4.htm|archivedate=April 28, 2014|df=}}</ref> 
 
In 2013, the [[Laredo Lemurs]] named Tijerina the starting pitcher in the inaugural "Family Chevrolet Sister Cities Baseball Classic", presented by [[Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery|Tecate beer]] on September 26 at [[Uni-Trade Stadium]] in Laredo.<ref name=lemurs>{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4684428|title=Tano Tijerina to Pitch in First Sister Cities Classic, September 18, 2013|publisher=oursportscentral.com|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>Zach Davis, "Lemurs add local: Laredo's Tano Tijerina to pitch against Tecos", ''Laredo Morning Times'', September 19, 2013, p. B1</ref>

==Political career==
In 2010, Tijerina, in his first bid for public office, narrowly lost the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination in the [[primary election|primary]] [[runoff election]] to the incumbent County Judge [[Danny Valdez]], who assumed the position on January 1, 2007 and vacated the office on December 31, 2014. In a low-turnout contest, Valdez received 14,227 votes (51.2 percent) to Tijerina's 13,575 ballots (48.8 percent).<ref>Zach Lindsey, "Webb County Judge: Valdez emerges victorious, ''Laredo Morning Times'', April 14, 2010, p. 1</ref> In the [[primary election]] held on March 2, 2010, Valdez had also led Tijerina by a narrow margin. Two other candidates were eliminated in the primary: former 406th District Court Judge Andres Ramos (born c. 1959) and former County Judge [[Louis H. Bruni]], Valdez's predecessor in the office.<ref>''Laredo Morning Times'', March 3, 2010</ref> Valdez faced no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent in his heavily Democratic county in either of his two terms as county judge.

In September 2013, Tijerina announced before a large turnout of supporters that he would again challenge Valdez for county judge in the Democratic primary held on March 4, 2014. Tijerina vowed to focus in his second campaign for the office on matters of  public health, safety, and government service. "We almost pulled off the greatest upset in Webb County's history four years ago. This year I am a lot older and wiser, and I've listened to the people. I feel the same frustration that the people have now with the Webb County government."<ref name=tijerinatorunagain>Aldo Amato, "Tijerina to seek judge's post", ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', September 5, 2013, p. 3</ref>

On October 3, 2013, in statement of candidacy, Valdez said that water quality would have been his top concern had he been retained by voters.<ref>"Valdez to seek re-election", ''Laredo Morning Times'', October 4, 2013, p. 3A</ref>

Tijerina won the endorsement of the ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', which said that "the picture of crisis after crisis ... abuse, fraud, and waste ... the mess we find outselves in ... results in the absence of effective leadership at the top", which the publication said could be remedied by "new leadership" from a "successful businessman-rancher".<ref>"Editorial Board announces endorsements for Primary", ''Laredo Morning Times'', February 18, 2014, p. 4A</ref> Tijerina also won the backing of ''LareDOS'', a monthly news journal. Editor and publisher Maria Eugenia Guerra said that the support for Tijerina is the first for any candidate for office in the twenty years the magazine has been in publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tanoforcountyjudge.com/?page_id=19|title=Tano receives first ever endorsement by ''LareDOS''!, February 25, 2014|publisher=tanoforcountyjudge|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>

This time in a two-candidate field, Tijerina unseated Valdez by a wide margin, 17,514 (65 percent) to 9,446 (35 percent).<ref name=electionreturns>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/articles/2014/03/05/front/news/doc53163d1f07dab734472217.txt|title=Final primary election results released|work=Laredo Morning Times|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref> With the absence of a Republican opponent and barring a successful [[write-in candidate]] in the November 4 [[general election]],  Tijerina will assume the office on January 1, 2015.

In July 2015, Judge Tijerina, following up from a commissisoners court request, called for a [[grand jury]] investigation of County Auditor Leo Flores. The request came in a letter to Webb County [[District Attorney]] Isidro R. "Chilo" Alaniz. Tijeria alleges the misappropriation of funds from restricted accounts. Flores predicted that any investigation will reveal nothing irregular: "Nothing inappropriate or illegal has been done by my office. The truth will surface, and I look forward to that time. ..."<ref>Kendra Ablaza, "Investigation request: Tijerina alleges misappropriation of funds by auditor", ''Laredo Morning Times'', July 22, 2015, pp. 1, 7A</ref>

On July 23, 2015, the occasion of [[Donald Trump]]'s Republican presidential campaign visit to Laredo, Tijerina said that he welcomed the opportunity to show the New York City business tycoon "our legacy of hard-working, generous, and honorable citizens. I hope that an accurate image of our Hispanic community is highlighted ... our community is the perfect example of Hispanic heritage, progress, and potential."<ref>Kendra Ablaza, "Trump visits Laredo: To meet with law endorcement, ''Laredo Morning Times'', July 213, 2015, pp. 1, 7A</ref> Trump was greeted on his arrival in the city by Mayor [[Pete Saenz]], a Democrat, and Randy Blair, the Webb County Republican chairman. In his three-hour visit, Trump, who wore a white sports cap for protection from the South Texas sun, had been scheduled to meet with representatives of the [[United States Border Patrol]], but the BP union nixed those plans at the last minute.<ref>Kendra Ablaza, "3 hours in Laredo: Donald Trump tours border", ''Laredo Morning Times'', July 24, 2015, p. 1</ref>

In May 2016, Tijerina faced a $12 million budget shortfall in county revenues caused by a decline in monies from oil and natural gas mineral property [[tax]]es. To reign in the deficit, the county has frozen hiring for vacant positions and is considering a voluntary separation plan for county employees already eligible to retire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/front-news/article_c14aa8c6-197e-11e6-bbd5-731e64f08c3d.html|title=County mulls ways to offset $12 million budget shortfall|author=Gabriela A. Trevino|publisher=''Laredo Morning Times''|date=May 13, 2016|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}</ref>

In July 2017, Tijerina announced that while he opposes [[Texas Senate]] Bill 4, which requires local law-enforcement officers to cooperate with federal authorities in apprehending [[illegal immigrant]]s, he does not favor joining a lawsuit against the measure because of the likely loss of millions in state and federal funds to Webb County governmental entities. Commissioner John Galo said: "We have to obey whatever the law is. But to be threatened for voicing our concerns over it, I find that unacceptable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/local/politics/article/Webb-County-Commissioners-Court-votes-against-11362530.php|title=Webb County Commissioners Court votes against 'show me your papers' lawsuit: The County Attorney’s Office fears a loss of funding|publisher=''The Laredo Morning Times''|date=July 25, 2017|author=Julia Wallace|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}</ref>

In the Democratic primary election held on March 6, 2018, Tijerina defeated Assessor-Collector Patricia Barrera, who gave up her office to make the race for county judge. He now faces a Republican challenge in the November 6 general election from Alfonso Ignacio "Poncho" Casso (born February 9, 1958), a businessman, former member of the Laredo City Council, and a previous unsuccessful candidate for mayor. Casso proposes a four-year freeze in higher property taxes in Webb County. In the 2018 budget, the commissioners court adopted the same tax rate as in 2017 but collected nearly $8 million more in revenue because of increases in property valuations and new developments. Casso said that, if elected county judge, he would make the annual property appraisals irrelevant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lmtonline.com/local/politics/article/Casso-announces-campaign-for-judge-12827178.php|title=Former City Councilman announces campaign for Webb County judge|author=Julia Wallace|publisher=''The Laredo Morning Times''|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}</ref>

As widely expected, Tijerina handily defeated Casso, 37,179 votes (76.3 percent) to 11,533 (23.7 percent). Casso trailed ticket mate [[U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Cruz]] in Webb County by 2,280 votes; Cruz finished his race against Democrat [[Beto O'Rourke]] with 28 percent of the Webb County ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lmtonline.com/local/politics/article/Final-voting-results-from-the-November-2018-13371054.php|title=Final voting results from the November 2018 general and special elections in Webb County|publisher='The 'Laredo Morning Times''|date=November 7, 2018|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}</ref>

In July 2017, Tijerina and his wife were sued for more than $1 million regarding injuries sustained by three individuals involved in an automobile accident in April on the Bob Bullock Loop in which Cayetano Tijerina, the couple's 16-year-old son, was cited for having failed to yield the right of way. Leticia, Roberto, and Valerine Gutierrez, occupants of one of the vehicles, seek damages for alleged pain and suffering relating to the collision.
