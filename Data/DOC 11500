Like most of these small iTunes only releases, there's no entry at [[Allmusic]] (see [http://www.allmusic.com/album/itunes-session-mw0002615943 here]) and most other notable places on the web. Cannot find anything of value on a google search either. Non-charting, non-notable release per [[WP:NALBUMS]].
