The '''Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District''' is the public [[school district]] of [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. The district is an independent public entity, and is governed by the district Board of Education, whose members are elected in non-partisan elections for staggered, three-year terms. The board selects a [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]], who is the district's chief administrative official. The district's offices are located in Todd Elementary School.

The district has three schools: Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School and [[Briarcliff High School]]. It has about 1,535 students, and spends an average of $24,858 per pupil and has a [[student–teacher ratio]] of 11:1 (the national averages are $12,435 and 15.3:1 respectively). The district is a part of the Putnam-Northern Westchester [[Board of Cooperative Educational Services]]. The Briarcliff Manor UFSD won first place for the small district category of the 2008 Digital School Districts Survey and currently provided 1 to 1 devices to all students in grades 4 through 12.

== History ==
In 1865, a one-room schoolhouse was built on land donated by John Whitson on the south side of Pleasantville Road, between the [[Pocantico River]] and the [[New York & Putnam Railroad]] (now [[NY Route 9A]]/[[New York State Route 100|100]]).<ref>{{cite map|author=Frederick.

George A. Todd, Jr. was the first teacher and superintendent of the school.<ref name="pamphlet"/><ref name="LodgeBook"/> In 1867, the school was moved to the White School, named thus due to its exterior paint.<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=31}}

Its replacement building, Briarcliff Public School, was built in 1898 on the site of the White School. The building failed to meet requirements set by New York's commissioner of education, and thus in 1910, it became the Briarcliff Community Center, a social organization established by the village.{{refn|group=nb|The organization ceased to exist in 1927; the building burned down in 1928, shortly after scheduled demolition to make way for the Briarcliff-Peekskill Parkway.<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=75}}}} Around the same time, in 1908, $50,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000|1908}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) was voted for Briarcliff Manor to buy a plot by Law Memorial Park, and the school moved again, to the [[Spanish Renaissance architecture|Spanish Renaissance-style]] Grade School building, which was built there the following year.<ref name="1977history"/>{{rp|page=50}} Students would attend that school from [[kindergarten]] to [[ninth grade]] and have the option to then attend the nearby [[Ossining High School]]. In 1918, the Briarcliff school began educating students through high school; in 1928, a dedicated wing for high school students was built onto the Grade School building. The enlarged school accepted students from Croton, Hawthorne, North White Plains, Valhalla, and as far as [[Granite Springs, New York|Granite Springs]].<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=68}}

In 1953, Todd Elementary School opened to free space at the Law Park grade school for middle- and high-school students.<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=153}} The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the Grade School building.<ref name="Changing Landscape"/>{{rp|page=154}} The district under its current name was officially established in 1974.<ref name="1977history"/>{{rp|page=58}}

In 1980, [[Pace University]] began leasing the middle school building, and the middle school was moved to a portion of the new high school building. The Grade School building was demolished in 1996, and a [[retirement home]] was built on its site the following year. In the early 2000s, the current Briarcliff Middle School was constructed adjoining to the high school.<ref name="Centennial"/> The wing was completed in 2003 at a cost of $24 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|24000000|2003}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) in the same red-brick-and-glass style as the high school wing.<ref name="NewWing"/> In 2008, the school district won first place for the small district category of that year's Digital School Districts Survey.<ref name="DSDS"/>

===Supreme Court loan===
In the 1970s, the school district made an indefinite loan of four sculptures to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. The works, plaster [[frieze]] [[relief]]s designed and sculpted by [[Adolph Weinman]] in the 1930s, were models for Weinman's final marble panels that were installed in the Supreme Courtroom in 1935. The models are six inches tall and two feet wide, compared with the 7-foot-tall final products.<ref name="Weinman1">{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Colleen|title=Briarcliff schools, U.S. Supreme Court have rare bond|newspaper=The Journal News|publisher=Gannett Company|url=http://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2017/09/18/rare-bond-between-briarcliff-school-district-and-u-s-supreme-court-spans-decades/639153001/|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>

Weinman's son, [[Robert Weinman]], donated the models to the school district in the late 1950s; Weinman was a resident of Briarcliff, and his children attended school in the district.<ref name="Weinman2">{{cite news|last=Barron|first=Sam|title=Supreme Court Displays Sculptures Loaned From Briarcliff Schools|newspaper=Briarcliff Daily Voice|url=http://briarcliff.dailyvoice.com/schools/supreme-court-displays-sculptures-loaned-from-briarcliff-schools/721768/|date=December 25, 2017|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref> The Supreme Court curator had contacted Robert Weinman seeking any models; Weinman directed him to the school district. The models were being kept in the basement of the former middle school, and were moved to the lobby of the [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]] in 1974, where they have been on display since.<ref name="Weinman1"/>

The court's curator sought out the district to donate the pieces around 2010, as part of a larger effort for donation or sale of works on loan to the Supreme Court. The school board had the pieces insured and voted to keep the models in the district's ownership, with a renewable annual lease to the court; as the work's tie to Briarcliff is valued in the district. The district is the only school to have a loan agreement with the Supreme Court.<ref name="Weinman1"/>
