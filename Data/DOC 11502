Other monarchs do not have similar pages and it's questionable how useful such a page would be. [[User:XinaNicole|XinaNicole]] ([[User talk:XinaNicole|talk]]) 01:49, 28 April 2014 (UTC) 

*'''Delete''' fits nowhere. Name of article is incorrect. Content is unfortunate. [[User:Crusoe8181|Crusoe8181]] ([[User talk:Crusoe8181|talk]]) 09:58, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I have listed this AfD as it was never transcluded, and the heading was not added. Should be fine now, and run for seven days from today. --[[User:kelapstick|kelapstick]]<sup>([[User talk:Kelapstick#top|bainuu]]) </sup> 14:37, 16 September 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - These offices have all their own articles/lists, like [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]]. It's not a good idea to separate some and then join with others in a random manner which has nothing to do with the encyclopedic subject.

*'''Delete''' per [[WP:TNT]].  A list ''in theory might be created'' with such information, but this is a complete mess. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 20:42, 24 September 2014 (UTC)
