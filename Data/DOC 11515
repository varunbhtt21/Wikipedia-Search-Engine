For a "list" you think it have more then 1 person. Plus looks like she does not even have a page! [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 02:01, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' okay that person has a page-which was made by the same person which is also under the category of lists of Nicaraguan film historians-which that seems like a misuse of a cat with just one person, also-I can't find a list for any other country for this.

*'''Comment'''-author of this page wrote on my page that they endorse this deletion. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 03:14, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Reply'''-Yes I agree with the deletion of the page because I couldn't find any other film historian from Nicaragua just one.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Lisdip1|Lisdip1]] ([[User talk:Lisdip1|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lisdip1|contribs]]) 05:37, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
