"'''[[The Day-Dream|The Sleeping Beauty]]'''" is a poem written by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], and published in 1830; it was later expanded and published in 1842 as "The Day-Dream". Based on the fairy tale ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', the poem (as with many of Tennyson's adaptations of existing literary works) focuses on a single aspect of the story, the appearance of the eponymous character as she sleeps.

This illustration by [[William Edward Frank Britten|W. E. F. Britten]] was published in 1901 to accompany a reprinting of "The Sleeping Beauty". It accompanies the poem's final lines: "She sleeps, nor dreams, but ever dwells / A perfect form in perfect rest."
