'''''Murdering Oscar (And Other Love Songs)''''' is the second solo album by [[Patterson Hood]]. The album's songs were written from 1994 to 2004, and recording began in early 2005 in [[Athens, Georgia]]. ''Murdering Oscar'' was released on June 23, 2009 on Hood's own label, Ruth St. Records, and on [[ATO Records]]. The music consists of guitar chords and [[reverberation|reverb]] on some tracks, while others also feature piano. The lyrics address topics that affected Hood around the time ''Murdering Oscar''{{'}}s songs were written, such as the birth of his child and his success with the [[Drive-By Truckers]].

The album received mainly favorable reviews from critics, who praised it for being optimistic and mature in its handling of both positive and negative themes. Some also commended it for addressing these themes in a compassionate manner, and for being exceptionally personal compared to his previous work with the Drive-By Truckers. However, others criticized it as inferior to Hood's previous work with them. ''Murdering Oscar'' peaked at No. 153 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' chart.

==Background and recording==
Half of the songs on ''Murdering Oscar (And Other Love Songs)'' were written when Hood moved to [[Athens, Georgia]] in 1994, before the Drive-By Truckers were established,<ref name=Billboard/> and soon after his previous band, Adam's House Cat, disbanded.<ref name=uncut/> The other half were written in 2004, shortly after Hood's child was born.<ref name=Paste/> However, the songs were not recorded until 2005,<ref name="popmatters">{{cite web | url=https://www.popmatters.com/95172-patterson-hood-murdering-oscar-and-other-love-songs-2496038061.html | title=Patterson Hood: Murdering Oscar (And Other Love Songs) | work=[[PopMatters]] | date=June 21, 2009 | accessdate=3 May 2014 | author=Henderson, Stuart}}</ref> with recording starting in early January of that year at [[David Barbe]]'s Athens studio Chase Park Transduction. In addition to Hood, most of the instruments on ''Murdering Oscar'' were played by former Truckers sidemen Barbe, [[Will Johnson (musician)|Will Johnson]], and Scott Danbom, as well as Hood's father [[David Hood]].<ref name=making/><ref name=popmatters/>

Jewly Hight compared ''Murdering Oscar'' to ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', writing that while [[Axl Rose]] "obsessively retooled Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy in 14 studios over 13 years, all the while stringing along the public with empty promises of a finished album," Hood handled his long-in-the-making album rather differently—namely, by leaving the album essentially unchanged from its recording in 2005 to its release four years later.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/music/article/13018261/patterson-hoods-solo-album-murdering-oscar-is-a-striking-blast-from-the-past | title=Patterson Hood's solo album Murdering Oscar is a striking blast from the past | work=[[Nashville Scene]] | date=June 18, 2009 | accessdate=May 7, 2014 | author=Hight, Jewly}}</ref> Hood has attributed this delay between the songs' recording in 2005 and ''Murdering''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> release four years later to "record industry bullshit".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2010-09-24/murdering-oscar/ | title=Murdering Oscar | work=[[Austin Chronicle]] | date= September 24, 2010 | accessdate=May 11, 2014 | author=Powell, Austin}}</ref> The album was released on June 23, 2009, on Hood's own Ruth St. Records label.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268868/drive-by-trucker-patterson-hoods-love-songs-due-this-summer |title=Drive-By Trucker Patterson Hood's 'Love Songs' Due This Summer |last=Vrabel |first=Jeff |date=April 17, 2009 |website=Billboard |access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref>

"Murdering Oscar" tells a tale of a "morally elastic hitman" inspired by the [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (1989).<ref name=pitchfork/><ref name=allmusic/> "Pollyanna", the oldest song on the album, blends "filthy guitars" and "lucid, hopeful piano".<ref name=Paste/> "Pride of the Yankees" is a "bleak, uncharacteristic piano waltz."<ref name=Paste/> The "poppy" "I Understand Now" finds Hood happy and content with his life, and coming to understand, as an adult, the advice he received in his youth.<ref name=pitchfork/><ref name=tucker/> "Screwtopia" is "a sardonic portrait of suburban domestic tranquility" that "seems almost wistful".<ref name=pitchfork/> The "optimistic" "Granddaddy" is about having a child and growing old.<ref name=Paste/><ref name=xgau/> "Belvedere" is a "bad-date song" about "a creepy guy", according to Hood.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2009/06/patterson_hood_live_last_night.html | title=Patterson Hood: Live Last Night | work=[[Washington Post]] | date=June 26, 2009 | accessdate=September 7, 2014 | author=McKenna, Dave}}</ref> "The Range War" is a cover of a [[Todd Rundgren]] song from ''[[Runt. The Ballad of Todd Rundgren]]''.<ref name=pitchfork/> "She's a Little Randy" finds Hood sounding silly.<ref name=pitchfork/> "Foolish Young Bastard" is "a put-down aimed at an old manager."<ref name=pitchfork/> "Heavy and Hanging" was written in response to [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide in 1994.<ref name=pitchfork/> "Walking Around Sense" displays a sound similar to that of [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]], and some have speculated that the song may be criticizing [[Courtney Love]]'s parenting ability.<ref name=allmusic/> "Back of a Bible" is a love song Hood wrote to his wife in the back of a motel Bible while touring.<ref name=tucker/>

Different critics made different comparisons between the album and the work Hood did with the Drive-By Truckers: [[Ken Tucker]] wrote that "Where the music made by the Drive-By Truckers can expand to epic proportions without becoming overblown, Hood's solo songs are smaller scale, more intimate",<ref name=tucker>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106093822 | title=Patterson Hood: Drive-By Boss Does 'Murder' | website=[[NPR]] | date=June 30, 2009 | accessdate=May 15, 2014 | author=Tucker, Ken}}</ref> while ''PopMatters''{{'}} Stuart Henderson wrote that "None of the songs here would be out of place on either of the last two Truckers albums", and that "[t]he sound, then, remains the same, but just a little less the same."<ref name=popmatters/> Henderson also argued that the music of ''Murdering Oscar'' discusses variations on the story of "the lonely, forgotten everyman", which he called one of Hood's favorite themes.<ref name=popmatters/> Jesse Cataldo, writing in ''Slant'', criticized the album for being far inferior to Hood's work with the Truckers, saying that on ''Murdering Oscar'', "Hood falters, resulting in an uninterrupted stream of watery drivel that drifts by much too slowly."<ref name="slant">{{cite web | url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/patterson-hood-murdering-oscar-and-other-love-songs | title=Murdering Oscar (And Other Love Songs) | work=[[Slant Magazine]]| date=June 15, 2009 | accessdate=October 16, 2014 | author=Cataldo, Jesse}}</ref> He attributed this in part to the absence of the Truckers' other songwriter, [[Mike Cooley (musician)|Mike Cooley]].<ref name=slant/> It was ranked 316th on ''[[the Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 2009 [[Pazz & Jop]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazznjop/albums/2009/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219231042/http://www.villagevoice.com/pazznjop/albums/2009/|archivedate=February 19, 2010 | title=Albums — All Votes | publisher=[[Village Voice]] | accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> 39th on [[Robert Christgau]]'s 2009 "Dean's List",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans09.php | title=2009: Dean's List | publisher=Robert Christgau | accessdate=October 7, 2014 | author=Christgau, Robert}}</ref> and was named the fifth best album of 2009 by [[Steven Hyden]] of ''[[the A.V.
