The '''Abenaki Indian Shop and Camp''' is a historic Native American site in the [[Intervale, New Hampshire|Intervale]] section of [[Conway, New Hampshire]].  The site is a camp established by [[Abenaki people|Abenakis]] who were lured to the area by the prospect of making baskets and selling them to visitors to the resort areas of the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in the late 19th century, and operated into the late 20th century.  The site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1991.<ref name="nris"/>  It is located on Intervale Cross Road, about one mile east of [[New Hampshire Route 16]],<ref name=NRHP/> and is now a local public park.

==Description and history==
The former Abenaki Indian Shop and Camp is located on the north side of Intervale Cross Road, separated from the road by a railroad right-of-way.  It is a parcel of land {{convert|3.8|acre|ha}} in size, most of which is forested in mixed hardwoods.  At the southern end is a single-story wood frame building with a gabled roof, and a descriptive plaque set in a stone.  A short way north of this are a grouping of small shingled gable-roofed cabins, set around a small clearing in the woods.

Chief [[Joseph Laurent]], an Abenaki leader from [[St. Francis, Quebec]], came to the area in 1884, and established a seasonal camp on the site, which was then owned by a local hotel. Laurent and other Abenaki produced baskets and other handicrafts as a tourist attraction for the hotel guests, and sold them the wares they produced. The Abenaki were descended from the area's original Native American population, who were driven from the area during the colonial period. The shop was originally a service shed built by the [[Maine Central Railroad]]; it was purchased by Laurent around 1900. Laurent is also credited with construction of the cottages in which the Abenaki lived. The business was continued by Laurent's son Stephen into the late 20th century.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=91000218}}|title=NRHP nomination for Abenaki Indian Shop and Camp|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref> Since 1985, the property has been owned by the town, which now operates it as a small park with interpretive signage describing its history.
