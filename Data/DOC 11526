After eight years Manning parted ways with [[EMI]]. Her third album, ''Folkyo'', was released on December 19, 2006, and saw Manning write, co-produce, engineer and perform. She released the album on her own label, LeParc Records,<ref name="allmusicfolkyo"/> and even raised funds to finish production by working at a construction camp in Northern British Columbia for the Winter of 2006. Collaborators included [[Ian Brown]] from [[Matthew Good Band]] and Christian Thor-Valdson from Copyright. 

===Reception===
''Folkyo'' received positive reviews, praising the album's musical intricacy and Manning's voice and writing,<ref name="theflagship"/> as well as its complex tones and clever lyrics.<ref name="partyinks"/>

According to a ''Toronto Quarterly'' article in 2012, "[Manning's] songwriting is sincere and superbly crafted, her finger-picking skills are unmatched and her voice is truly unmistakable with a timbre that reminds one of [[Roy Forbes]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Dolly Parton]] all at once."<ref name="torontoquartlery"/>
