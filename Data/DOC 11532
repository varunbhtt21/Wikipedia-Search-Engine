Title : Lower Sagehen Creek Hiking Trail
Text : {{One source|date=February 2015}}

The '''Lower Sagehen Creek Hiking Trail''' follows Sagehen Creek, a [[tributary]] of the [[Truckee River]] on the east slope of the central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the western [[United States]]. The stream lies north of [[Lake Tahoe]] and the town of [[Truckee, California]], and near the [[California]]/[[Nevada]] border.

The [[headwaters]] and upper [[Drainage basin|watershed]] of the creek west of [[California State Route 89]] comprise the {{convert|9000|acre|adj=on}} Sagehen Experimental Forest and [[Sagehen Creek Field Station]], a research and education facility of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Below (east of) Highway 89, the Lower Sagehen Creek Hiking Trail follows the creek to its terminus at [[Stampede Reservoir]].

==Wildflowers==

The trail is famous for [[wildflower]]s, especially in late May to early June, when fields of [[Camassia|camas lilies]] bloom en masse, creating the illusion of a purple haze lying on the meadow. But the lilies are not the only attraction, with a wide variety of blossoms appearing in both shaded and sunny habitats along the way. [[Wyethia|Mule's ears]], [[Ranunculus|buttercups]], [[purshia]], [[bistort]], various [[penstemon]]s, mahala mat, and shooting stars are common.

==Hiking the trail==
The hike is relatively flat and easy, running about {{convert|2.5|mi}} to the lake through shady forest and open meadows. It is typically done as an out-and-back, though it is possible to combine the trail with others in the area for a longer outing. In early season, the area can be marshy and wet, requiring appropriate footwear and mosquito protection.

==Access==
The trailhead lies at 39.4341 N, 120.2047 W, outside of Truckee, roughly {{convert|7.2|mi}} north of [[Interstate 80]] on California Highway 89. There is no signage, but there is an obvious pullout parking spot for 8-10 cars on the east (downstream) side of the road where the creek crosses beneath the highway.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tahoeloco.com/archives/2057 |title=Hike of the week: Sagehen Creek |publisher=TahoeLoco.com |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}</ref> There are no trash or restroom facilities at the trailhead, but visitors can use the Donner Picnic Area a few miles south of the trailhead on Highway 89.

==Monitoring==
[[Sagehen Creek Field Station]] encourages hikers to use the [[iNaturalist]] app to submit their observations of plants and animals photographed in the area. These observations are used in research and monitoring efforts in the basin to track presence/absence of species and their locations.
