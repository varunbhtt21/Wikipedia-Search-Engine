The '''1994 [[ECAC Hockey]] Men's Ice Hockey Tournament''' was the 33rd [[ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|tournament]] in league history. It was played between March 8 and March 19, 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=ECAC Tournament|url=http://www.augenblick.org/chha/ecac_trn.html|publisher=College Hockey Historical Archives|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> Preliminary and quarterfinal games were played at home team campus sites, while the 'final four' games were played at the [[Herb Brooks Arena|Olympic Arena]] (subsequently renamed Herb Brooks Arena) in [[Lake Placid, New York]]. By winning the tournament, [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey|Harvard]] received the [[ECAC Hockey|ECAC]]'s automatic bid to the [[1994 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].

==Format==
The tournament featured four rounds of play. The two teams that finish below tenth place in the standings are not eligible for tournament play. In the preliminary round, the seventh and tenth seeds and the eighth and ninth seeds each play a single game to determine the final qualifying teams for the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals the first seed and lower ranked qualifier, the second and higher ranked qualifier, the third seed and sixth seed and the fourth seed and fifth seed played a modified [[Playoff format#Best-of-three playoff|best-of-three]] series, where the first team to receive 3 points moves on. After the opening round every series becomes a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] game. In the semifinals, the highest seed plays the lowest remaining seed while the two remaining teams play with the winners advancing to the championship game and the losers advancing to the third place game. The tournament champion receives an automatic bid to the [[1994 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].
