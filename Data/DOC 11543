She telephones Finch that she is in town and will call on him at 4 p.m. A rehearsal of the wedding ceremony is scheduled for 5 o'clock. A reporter is called in to assist Finch out of his dilemma. He suggests getting someone to pose as Finch's sweetheart to get him out of difficulty. The reporter gets the actress to dress as a [[Femme fatale|vamp]] and appear on the scene.
