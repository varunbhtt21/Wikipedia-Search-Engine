* ... that Maryland [[Maryland House of Delegates|Delegate]] '''[[Torrey C. Brown]]''', a physician, once assisted in saving the life of a fellow legislator who suffered a heart attack during a debate?
:*
<small>Created by [[User:Marylandstater|Marylandstater]] ([[User talk:Marylandstater|talk]]). Self nominated at 02:40, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* There may be a few close paraphrasing issues as per [http://toolserver.org/~dcoetzee/duplicationdetector/compare.php?url1=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTorrey_C._Brown&url2=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jhu.edu%2Fjhumag%2F0608web%2Falumnews.html&minwords=2&minchars=13]. It's pretty minor, but as we're talking the main page would be good for {{user|Marylandstater}} to double check it. Also not happy with the fair use rationale for the photo within the article. Not having another photo of the subject is not a strong enough fair use rationale. Other than that meets the criteria. Appropriate length, new, and doesn't violate BLP (recently deceased biography). I would make one suggestion though.
:*<s>'''Alt1 hook''' – ... that Maryland [[Maryland House of Delegates|Delegate]] '''[[Torrey C. Brown]]''', a physician, once assisted in saving the life of a fellow legislator who suffered a heart attack during a debate?</s>

:::*'''Done''':  I corrected the paraphrasing issues, removed the questioned photo and used the alternate hook that was suggested.
