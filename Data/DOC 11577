The result was    '''keep'''.

Sources do not constitute significant independent coverage.  The sources that are independent are just a passing mention; the sources that are actually about the topic are non-independent. <span style="border:2px solid #0918E8;background:#067D06;">[[User:TheCascadian|<font color="white">'''The'''</font>]]'''[[User talk:TheCascadian|<font color="white">Cascadian</font>]]'''</span> 02:41, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

I think this article is useful. As I am currently writing a sip client I only found this SIP lib and think it is awful that WP has only one article about sip libraries. There is no other sip lib currently in WP. For me this article contains much information which I am interested in. IMHO it would be better to find more appreciated sources but to create a AfD. --[[User:Txt.file|Txt.file]] ([[User talk:Txt.file|talk]]) 03:41, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - Notability established by [[http://books.google.de/books?id=dG0X53pla8IC&pg=PA198&dq=osip+sip&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sfZdU6uQKMKRtAbx84HAAw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=osip%20sip&f=false] and [http://www.roseindia.net/voip/free-voip-software-development-library.shtml] and offline sources listed in reference section of the article. ~[[user talk:Kvng|KvnG]] 06:48, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I'm not convinced that the sources cited amount to significant discussion in secondary literature.  And if the wikipage contains information useful to software developers, well, [[WP:NOTMANUAL]]. [[User:GoldenRing|GoldenRing]] ([[User talk:GoldenRing|talk]]) 13:24, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Of the sources given under 'references', the first one is just a link to download it and has no other information than a list of files, the second one is a license that does not appear to mention the article's subject anywhere (searched for OSIP with the find tool), the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh ones are all primary sources i.e. the websites of companies that promote this product, the eighth one doesn't have an awful lot in it, the ninth one only briefly mentions Antisip (but not OSIP), the tenth one is another primary source, the eleventh one does not mention OSIP, and the twelfth one is an email from a mailing list. The others are books which I haven't bothered to check. The first-person language - 'we did this and that' - also needs to go. Finally, [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/eXosip|an afc submission remarkably similar to this article]] was declined multiple times for various reasons. I would !vote one way or another except that I know diddly about afd and I'm too lazy to check the book sources, but at the very least, the 'we' business and the download page being used as a 'source' should be taken out.

*:Also just noticed the intro doesn't seem to summarise the article and isn't at all sourced. That can't be right. [[User:Cathfolant|Cathfolant]] ([[User talk:Cathfolant|talk]]) 00:04, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Comments''': I have removed many references to avoid the page to be a manual ([[WP:NOTMANUAL]]). 

:I have also removed the links that seems inadequate and all third party and commercial software. I kept the notable ones (which appears in wikipedia).

:About above comment "The first-person language - 'we did this and that' - " : those are quotations from books. They can't be changed. Those are reliable sources only and prove the notability. At no place "we" is used beside in the quotations. So the comment is very unfair and not applicable to the article.

:eXosip article was rejected a third time. However, it seems unfair to use such argument. New wikipedia authors have to learn and make their experience.

::It wasn't clear that they were direct quotes from books. If that's true they should be formatted differently or something. They could also be paraphrased - a section consisting entirely of material pulled straight from books seems a bit odd.

*<s>'''Delete'''</s> The book references only give examples of the oSIP library in use. They don't, in my opinion, provide "significant coverage" of the oSIP library sufficient to assert notability per [[WP:N]]. Nor does anything else mentioned in the article as it currently stands. &mdash;[[User:Gorgan almighty|gorgan_almighty]] ([[User talk:Gorgan almighty|talk]]) 00:04, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
** Changed to '''Weak Keep'''. I still feel the encyclopedia would be better served with an article about GNU projects rather than individual articles about barely notable projects, but I agree that the Linux Magazine reference asserts notability. Now can we please clean it up? &mdash;[[User:Gorgan almighty|gorgan_almighty]] ([[User talk:Gorgan almighty|talk]]) 17:12, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment'''. I've added a few additional sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OSIP&diff=608947545&oldid=606479087 [[User:Jodi.a.schneider|Jodi.a.schneider]] ([[User talk:Jodi.a.schneider|talk]]) 11:29, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

::: '''Weak keep'''. It meets GNG and appears to be widely used; there are scholarly citations far beyond those mentioned in the article.[[User:Jodi.a.schneider|Jodi.a.schneider]] ([[User talk:Jodi.a.schneider|talk]]) 14:12, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
