== History ==
===Founding===
[[File:Emm Gryner belts out a tune.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Band member [[Emm Gryner]] (pictured in 2005), contributes vocals and bass]]
In 2011 [[Emm Gryner]] approached fellow Canadian singer-songwriter [[Dayna Manning]] about forming a [[American folk music|folk]] band, and Manning's childhood friend and violinist Laura C. Bates joined soon thereafter.<ref name="torontoquartlery"/> Gryner and Manning had co-billed a number of stages early in their careers,<ref name="tsabout"/> and had both been raised in [[Ontario]].<ref name="stmarys"/>

They named the trio Trent Severn, after [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] in Southern Ontario.<ref name="stmarys"/> All three women contribute to the songwriting and the vocals,<ref name="stmarys"/> and frequently reference [[Canadian culture]] and landscapes in their music.<ref name="stmarys"/> They also typically do all instrumentals themselves, with Manning on banjo or guitar, Gryner with a bass and [[stomp box]], and Bates with a [[fiddle]]<ref name="tsabout"/>/[[violin]]<ref name="postcity"/> and sometimes percussion.<ref name="tsabout"/> They sold out a number of their early shows, also playing on [[CBC Radio]]'s ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]''.<ref name="torontoquartlery"/>

===Debut===

They released their self-titled 10-track debut album on Nov 6, 2012, under the imprint [[Dead Daisy Records]].<ref name="torontoquartlery"/> Excluding a guest appearance by [[Joel Plaskett]] on the track “Bluenose On a Dime” and percussion by Dave Tolley,<ref name="postcity"/> all the music is arranged and performed by the band.<ref name="torontoquartlery"/> The writing, recording, and mixing process overall had taken fourteen months.<ref name="torontoquartlery"/>

The album received heavy airplay on [[CBC Radio]],<ref name="stmarys"/> and reviews were generally positive.<ref name="torontoquartlery"/> According to one reviewer, the album "contains a distinctly folk feel reminiscent of [[Joni Mitchell]] or [[Gordon Lightfoot]]."<ref name="stmarys"/> ''Post City'' praised the balanced feel between tracks, stating "For the most part, the album [has a] laid-back, twangy trend, punctuated by a couple of fast-paced and upbeat numbers here and there. The result is a warmly nostalgic record padded with darkly pensive instrumentation...Trent Severn sing and play with the weight carried by old souls, but they can still throw in a wink with playful verses and jaunty songs."<ref name="postcity"/>

===Touring===
The band was nominated for two 2013 [[Canadian Folk Music Awards]].<ref name="nomineescfma"/> Trent Severn tours frequently and plays both large and small events, many informal and outdoors.<ref name="stmarys"/> In 2013 Manning arranged an original folk version of "[[O Canada]]" with three part vocal harmony,<ref name="ocanada"/> which Trent Severn performed at the flag raising ceremony on [[Parliament Hill, Ottawa]] on July 1, 2013.<ref name="canadadaydream"/>

The band has an ongoing campaign to have people send postcards from across Canada.<ref name="stmarys"/> On March 15, 2013, they became the first band to receive a phone call to a concert from space, when they played a live song for Commander [[Chris Hadfield]] while he was on the international space station.<ref name="chadyoutube"/> On [[Canada Day]]<ref name="stmarys"/> of that year the band was part of Hadfield's first performance back on earth, of "[[Space Oddity]]" by [[David Bowie]].<ref name="spaceoddit"/>
