'''Inder Jit Malhotra''' (17 March 1929 – 24 March 1993) was a member of the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the [[Parliament of India]], representing the constituency of  [[Jammu (Lok Sabha constituency)|Jammu]].<ref>http://164.100.47.132/lssnew/biodata_1_12/1241.htm</ref><ref>http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/comb/combalpha.htm#13lsm</ref> A member of the [[Indian National Congress]] party, he served in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th formations of the Lok Sabha from 1959 until he retired from office in 1977 from [[Kathua (Lok Sabha constituency)|Kathua]] and Jammu.<ref>http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lsdeb/ls10/ses6/01310393.htm</ref> Prior to 1967, he was elected by the [[Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] to represent Jammu as a [[Member of Parliament]]. Direct elections for parliamentary seats by [[Jammu and Kashmir]] constituents began in 1967, when the 4th Lok Sabha was formed.

The son of [[Thakur Das Malhotra]], Inder Jit Malhotra was first elected to Parliament by the Legislative Assembly following the tragic and unexpected death of his father, who held the seat previously and suffered a fatal heart attack while delivering a political speech. He completed his undergraduate education in India, and then pursued graduate study in the United States, earning a Master in Journalism from the [[University of Oregon]] and a Master of Science in Agriculture from [[Kansas State University]].<ref>http://164.100.47.132/lssnew/biodata_1_12/1241.htm</ref>
