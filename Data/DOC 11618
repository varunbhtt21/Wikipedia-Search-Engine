'''Martian regolith simulant''' (or '''Martian soil simulant''') is a terrestrial material that is used to simulate the chemical and mechanical properties of [[Martian regolith]] for research, experiments and [[prototype]] testing of activities related to Martian regolith such as dust mitigation of transportation equipment, advanced [[life support system]]s and [[in-situ resource utilization]].

==Variations==

===JSC Mars-1 and JSC Mars-1A===
After the [[Viking program|Viking landers]] and the [[Sojourner (rover)|Mars Pathfinder's rover]] landed on Mars, the onboard instruments were used to determine the properties of the [[Martian soil]] at the landing sites. The studies of the [[Martian soil]] properties led to the development of JSC Mars-1 Martian regolith simulant at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dielectric Properties of Martian Soil Simulant|url=http://empl.ksc.nasa.gov/Publications/Dielectric%20Properties%20of%20Martian%20Soil%20Simulant.pdf|publisher=NASA Kennedy Space Center|accessdate=10 May 2014|author=J.G.

The studies of the cone, which is located between [[Mauna Loa]] and [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]], indicate that the tephra is a close spectral analog to the bright regions of Mars.<ref name=jscmars1>{{cite book|title=JSC Mars-1: Martian regolith simulant|date=March 1997|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Exploration XXVIII|author=Allen, C.

When the original supply of JSC Mars-1 ran out, there were needs for additional material. NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] contracted Orbital Technologies Corporation to supply 16 [[tonne|metric tons]] of lunar and Martian simulants. The company also made an additional eight tons of Martian simulant available for other interested parties to purchase.<ref>{{cite web|title=JSC-1A Lunar and Martian Soil Simulants|url=http://www.spacefoundation.org/programs/space-certification/certified-products/space-educational-product/jsc-1a-lunar-and-martian|publisher=Planet LLC|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=orbitecpr>{{cite news|title=Get Hands-on with Another Planet: Martian Soil Simulant Now Available|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/10/prweb563991.htm|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Orbitec Press Release|date=26 October 2007}}</ref>. However, as of 2017 JSC Mars-1A is no longer available.

After milling to reduce its particle size, JSC Mars-1A can [[geopolymer]]ize in alkaline solutions forming a solid material. Tests show that the maximum [[Compressive strength|compressive]] and [[flexural strength]] of the 'martian' geopolymer is comparable to that of common clay bricks.<ref name=Alexiadis2016/>

===MMS===
MMS or Mojave Mars Simulant was developed in 2007 to address some issues with JSC Mars-1. While JSC Mars-1 did simulate the color of Martian regolith, it performed poorly in many qualities, including its [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] tendencies—it had undergone [[weathering]] that attracts water, making it more [[clay]]-like. MMS, however, was hygroscopically inert due to minimal weathering and the way it was crushed, which allowed it to better simulate that feature of Martian regolith, among others. MMS was found naturally as whole rocks in a volcanic formation near the town of [[Boron, California]], in the western [[Mojave desert]]. After crushing, [[basalt]] sands were processed and graded into particular sizes, MMS Coarse and MMS Fine. MMS Dust consists of smaller basalt particles matching the particle size distribution of [[Martian dust]]. A separate volcanic event created red-colored [[cinder]] which is mined and crushed to create MMS Cinder.<ref name=mojave/> As of 2017, MMS is no longer available outside of NASA centers.

===MGS-1===
MGS-1 or Mars Global Simulant was developed starting in 2018 as the first mineralogically accurate Martian regolith simulant<ref name="mgs1">{{cite journal |last1=Cannon |first1=Kevin |title=Mars global simulant MGS-1: A Rocknest-based open standard for basaltic martian regolith simulants |journal=Icarus |date=January 2019 |volume=317 |issue=1 |pages=470–478 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2018.08.019 }}</ref>. It is based on the Rocknest soil in [[Gale (crater)|Gale crater]] on Mars that has been analyzed extensively by the [[Curiosity (rover)|NASA Curiosity rover]]. MGS-1 is produced by mixing pure minerals together in accurate proportions, with a realistic particle size distribution. The simulant is available from the not-for-profit [https://sciences.ucf.edu/class/exolithlab/ Exolith Lab] at the [[University of Central Florida]]. MGS-1 does not include perchlorates by default, so cannot be used to test the effects of that aspect of the Martian regolith.<ref name="mgs1"/><ref name="toxicmars">{{cite web |title=Toxic Mars: Astronauts Must Deal with Perchlorate on the Red Planet |url=https://www.space.com/21554-mars-toxic-perchlorate-chemicals.html |website=space.com |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> However, end users can spike the material with perchlorate salts or other superoxide species.

==Health risks==
[[File:Martian regolith simulant - dust.JPG|thumb|Fine dusts of JSC MARS-1A inside a container<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Holly|title=SEEING RED: Mars exhibit coming to Brazosport Planetarium (091012 mars 3)|url=http://thefacts.com/news/article_a4087982-fb05-11e1-994a-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=image&photo=|publisher=The Facts, Clute, TX|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>]]
Exposure to regolith simulants may pose some health risks due to the fine particles and the presence of crystalline silica. JSC Mars-1A has slight hazard on inhalation and eye contact which may cause irritation to eyes and [[respiratory tract]]. There has been research into the toxicity of the simulants to the body cells. JSC MARS-1 is considered to have dose-dependent [[cytotoxicity]]. Therefore, it is recommended for precautions to minimize fine dust exposure in large-scale engineering applications.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Latch|first=JN |author2=Hamilton RF, Jr |author3=Holian, A |author4=James, JT |author5=Lam, CW |title=Toxicity of lunar and Martian dust simulants to alveolar macrophages isolated from human volunteers.|journal=Inhalation Toxicology |date=January 2008 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=157–65 |pmid=18236230 |doi=10.1080/08958370701821219|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.1877 }}</ref>

Although percholorates were discovered on Mars in 2008 by the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]], none of the simulants include percholorates. This reduces the health risk posed by the simulants compared to actual [[Martian soil]].  Early simulants predated this discovery, but the latest simulant, MGS-1, still does not include them.<ref name="mgs1"/>.

==Structural use==
A study at [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]] showed that Martian regolith could be formed by itself into very strong bricks, with application of pressure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Engineers investigate a simple, no-bake recipe to make bricks from Martian soil |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170427091723.htm |accessdate=January 13, 2019 |work=ScienceDaily |date=April 27, 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-01157-w| pmid = 28450723| pmc = 5430746| issn = 2045-2322| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 1151| last1 = Chow| first1 = Brian J.| last2 = Chen| first2 = Tzehan| last3 = Zhong| first3 = Ying| last4 = Qiao| first4 = Yu| title = Direct Formation of Structural Components Using a Martian Soil Simulant| journal = Scientific Reports| date = 2017-04-27}}</ref>
