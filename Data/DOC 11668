The '''John Cordes Prioleau House''' is a historic residence in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

The house was built on property acquired in 1808 by John Cordes Prioleau from his father, the third generation of the Prioleau family to own the land. By 1816, Prioleau was living in his new house. In 1821, the property was expanded with the purchase of the adjacent lot to the south along Ropemaker Lane. In 1855, the house began being used as a school. In 1894, William Bachman Chisolm bought the house and made several alterations to it, bringing it up to the taste of the 1890s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19481220&id=EwtFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BBQLAAAAIBAJ&pg=5203,5326248 | title=Do You Know Your Charleston? | work=News & Courier | date=December 20, 1948 | accessdate=April 27, 2014 | author=Stoney, Samuel Gaillard | location=Charleston, South Carolina | pages=14}}</ref>
