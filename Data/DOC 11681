"'''Problem'''" is a song by the American singer [[Ariana Grande]], featuring the Australian rapper [[Iggy Azalea]]. It was written by both alongside [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh|Ilya]] and [[Max Martin]], being produced by the latter two with [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with [[Carolina Liar|Peter Carlsson]] serving as a vocal producer. The song was released by [[Republic Records]] on April 28, 2014, as the [[lead single]] from Grande's second studio album ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014). "Problem" is an [[uptempo]] [[dance-pop]] song with influences of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music, which comprises a melody based on [[drums]], [[saxophone]] loops, and [[trumpets]]. The chorus features uncredited background vocals from American hip hop artist [[Big Sean]]. Lyrically, Grande has stated that the song is about "the feeling of being absolutely terrified to re-approach a relationship that's gone sour – but you want to more than anything."

The song debuted at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] selling 438,000 copies in its first week on sale, earning Grande her biggest digital song sales week ever. The song later peaked at number two, surpassing "[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]" as her highest-charting single in the United States at the time. It also became Azalea's second-highest charting single in the US, after her own single "[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]". "Problem" remained in the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first sixteen weeks of its chart run, making its number three debut on May 7, 2014 and dropping out of the top ten on August 27, 2014. It topped the US [[Mainstream Top 40]] and [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic]] charts. Internationally, the single debuted at the top of the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top ten of the charts in most other territories, including Australia, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Greece. "Problem" became the first song to top the UK Singles chart based on both sales and streaming.

To promote the song, Grande performed it first at the [[2014 Radio Disney Music Awards]], followed by the [[2014 iHeartRadio Music Awards]], on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' and at the [[2014 Billboard Music Awards]]. The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by Nev Todorovic and premiered on [[Vevo]] on May 30, 2014. It won "Best Pop Video" at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] and has been viewed more than 1.1 billion times. The song itself won "Best Song" at the [[2014 MTV Europe Music Awards]].

As of 2018, the single has sold 3.<!--pure sales per Billboard citation-->7 million copies in the US and has been certified sextuple [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in March 2016. It ultimately reached combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 9 million units worldwide,<ref name=worldwidesalesifpi/> becoming [[List of best-selling singles|one of the best-selling singles of all time]].

==Critical reception==
[[File:Iggy Azalea - ACL Music Festival (5).jpg|thumb|upright|Iggy Azalea contributed a verse to "Problem"]]
Mike Wass of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] described the song as "an odd blend of [[1990s in music#Pop|'90s pop]] and current urban trends but there's no denying that it's catchy."<ref name="idolator" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the song a "dramatic reinvention," and also notes, "The idea that Grande was collaborating with bad girl du jour Iggy Azalea prompted all kinds of speculation, and the result is more or less what everybody expected: Grande's enviable pipes are still the centerpiece, but she also invites a sax-drunk loop, sexy whisper tracks, and Azalea's Jay Z-referencing high-speed verse to the party as well."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Kyle|title=Ariana Grande teams up with Iggy Azalea for new single 'Problem'|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/04/28/ariana-grande-new-single-problem-iggy-azalea/|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> ''Music Times'' commented that "the saxophone-filled track continues the pattern set by Grande's 2013 debut album ''Yours Truly'' by being heavily influenced by the '90s R&B scene. This time, 'Problem' pulls from the funky, funky streets with a jazz-influenced riff. An overwhelming (but welcome) dose of saxophone leads the song before the more modern drum-filled beat drops."<ref name="autogenerated3" /> In addition, [[4Music]] said "Ariana's sweet-sounding vocals contrast brilliantly with Problem's sexy sax and Iggy's gritty rap."<ref name="4music">{{cite episode|series=This Week's Fresh Music Top 20|title=This Week's Fresh Music Top 20|airdate=July 25, 2014|network=[[4Music]]}}</ref>

Pitchfork named it "Best New Track", saying that it "bears all the hallmarks of a future smash, as if the future wasn't actually right now."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goble|first1=Corban|title=Ariana Grande: 'Problem' [ft.

The cranky sax, the whispered chorus, the airy harmonies and Iggy's snarky feature all tied in with a juicy modern beat." Lindner continued by calling it "the freshest pop song of the moment", commending the song's production for its "more than a few unexpected throwbacks", comparing the [[saxophone]] loops to [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s 2004 single "[[Get Right (song)|Get Right]]" saying "It's the same notes over and over, but its attitude doesn't let you zone out", while the whispers in the chorus echoes to the [[Ying Yang Twins]]' 2005 single "[[Wait (The Whisper Song)|Wait]]."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Linder|first1=Emilee|title=Ariana Grande's 'Problem' Has More Than A Few Unexpected Throwbacks|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1817447/ariana-grandes-problem-5-unexpected-throwbacks-in-her-new-track/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> In July 2014, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' listed the song as one of the "10 Best Songs of 2014 (so far)" saying that "the snappy R&B of Ariana Grande's breakout hit '[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]' feels minimalist compared to the multi-faceted bubblegum of 'Problem'".<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Best Songs of 2014 (So Far): Critics' Picks|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/6150405/10-best-songs-of-2014-so-far-critics-picks|date=July 10, 2014|accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, Pitchfork named it the 33rd best song of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9555-the-100-best-tracks-of-2014/7/|title=The 100 Best Tracks of 2014|work=Pitchfork Media}}</ref>
