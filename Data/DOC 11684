The '''tornado outbreak of April 27–30, 2014''' was a relatively widespread, damaging and deadly [[tornado outbreak]] that struck the [[Central United States|central]] and [[southern United States]] in late April 2014. The storm complex responsible for the outbreak produced multiple long-track [[tornado]]es – seven were deadly, causing 35 fatalities.<ref name="AP">[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-tornadoes-kill-35-over-2-days-1.2625256 U.S. tornadoes kill 35 over 2 days], [[CBC News]] (via the [[Associated Press]]), April 29, 2014.</ref> One additional death occurred in [[Florida]], due to severe flooding associated with this system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Widespread flooding turns deadly in Florida|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/devastating-flooding-turns-deadly-in-fla/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>

==Meteorological synopsis==
A strong mid-level [[Shortwave (meteorology)|shortwave]] [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] developed into a closed [[low-pressure area]] as the system occluded over the central [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] on April 27, 2014. An associated surface cyclone reached peak intensity while a trailing cold front moved eastward across eastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma and northern Texas. There were two areas where severe weather was expected, morning pre-frontal convection from Kansas and Oklahoma into Missouri and Iowa and warm sector [[supercell]] development across southeast Oklahoma and northeast Texas into Arkansas. The [[Storm Prediction Center]] indicated this system for 6 days in advance on its 4–8 day outlook.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apr 27, 2014 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

===Quapaw, Oklahoma–Baxter Springs, Kansas===
[[File:Quapaw, Oklahoma April 27, 2014 tornado damage.jpg|thumb|A home destroyed by the tornado in [[Quapaw, Oklahoma]]]]
The first significant tornado of the outbreak touched down over an open field at 5:29&nbsp;p.m. CDT (2229&nbsp;UTC) on April 27 to the southwest of [[Quapaw, Oklahoma]] and caused EF0 damage to a ranch.<ref name="NWSTulsa">{{cite web|work=National Weather Service office in Tulsa, Oklahoma|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=May 3, 2014|title=Event Summary – 27 April 2014 Quapaw and Octavia Tornado Event|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov//tsa/?n=weather-event_2014april27}}</ref> It caused minor damage to homes and downed trees as it neared [[U.S. Highway 69A (Oklahoma)|U.S. Highway 69A]]. Shortly thereafter, it struck the town of Quapaw at high-end EF2 strength and caused extensive damage. The local fire station was largely destroyed, and some industrial buildings sustained heavy damage. Homes in town were shifted off of their foundations or sustained loss of roofs and walls. Two people seeking shelter from the tornado in their car were struck by debris from the building they were next to; one of the occupants was killed while the other was injured. A total of 12&nbsp;people were injured in the town, 7&nbsp;of whom required hospitalization.<ref name="NWSTulsa"/> A total of 50&nbsp;structures were damaged or destroyed in Quapaw.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bryan Painter|publisher=News OK|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=May 4, 2014|title=Quapaw tornado update|url=http://newsok.com/quapaw-tornado-update/article/4744580}}</ref> The storm continued northeast and crossed the Oklahoma–Kansas state line, causing EF1-strength damage to outbuildings and downing trees and power poles. It soon moved directly through the town of Baxter Springs at high-end EF2 strength, where many homes and businesses lost their roofs, several of which had their exterior walls collapse. 90 homes and 11 business were destroyed, and an additional seven businesses and 85 homes suffered damage in Baxter Springs.<ref>http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=506202</ref> A total of 34&nbsp;people were injured in town, 9&nbsp;of whom were hospitalized.<ref name="KMBC">{{cite web|author=Peggy Breit|publisher=KMBC-TV|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=May 4, 2014|title=34 people injured in Baxter Springs, Kansas tornado|url=http://www.kmbc.com/news/25-people-injured-in-baxter-springs-kansas-tornado/25690778}}</ref> The tornado continued northeast and eventually dissipated {{convert|2.5|mi|km|}} from the town at 5:42&nbsp;p.m. CDT (2242&nbsp;UTC).<ref name="NWSSpringfield">{{cite web|work=National Weather Service office in Springfield, Missouri|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=May 3, 2014|title=April 27th, 2014 Baxter Springs Kansas Tornado |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/sgf/scripts/localdata.php?loc=appevents&data=2014/2014apr27/user2.htm}}</ref> Overall, the tornado remained on the ground for 13&nbsp;minutes along a {{convert|11.25|mi|km|}} path, causing 1&nbsp;death and 37 injuries.<ref name="NWSTulsa"/><ref name="NWSSpringfield"/>

This particular tornado was unusual in that no [[tornado warning]] was issued for Quapaw before it struck the town. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service later stated that radar signatures showed no signs of a tornado until it was already over the town and by the time the warning was issued, it had moved into Kansas.<ref name="TulsaWorld">{{cite web|author=Michael Dekker|publisher=Tulsa World|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=May 4, 2014|title= Official: Tornado developed rapidly over Quapaw with no time to issue warning |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/state/official-tornado-developed-rapidly-over-quapaw-with-no-time-to/article_ceaf5c88-cf2e-11e3-8a10-0017a43b2370.html}}</ref> The warning came only minutes before the tornado struck Baxter Springs, catching residents off-guard and forcing them to scramble for shelter.<ref name="KMBC"/>

===Mayflower–Vilonia, Arkansas===
[[File:April 27, 2014 Vilonia tornado aerial damage.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of the Parkwood Meadows subdivision in Vilonia, depicting several homes completely leveled and swept clean off their foundations. All of these homes lacked anchor bolts and their walls were not properly secured.<ref name="NWSLittleRock"/>]]
At 7:06&nbsp;p.m. on April&nbsp;27 (0006&nbsp;UTC on April&nbsp;28), a weak tornado touched down in extreme western [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]], roughly {{convert|6|mi|km|}} east of [[Paron, Arkansas|Paron]], and tracked north-northeast. Within a minute, the tornado dramatically intensified and struck a small residential area at EF3 intensity. There, two homes were destroyed and another was severely damaged. One of the homes was built with bolts along the foundation perimeter and was reduced to a bare slab, normally indicative of EF5 strength; however, it was found that the anchor bolts were not secured with nuts and washers, and nearby vehicles were not moved, which indicated a lesser intensity. Three people were killed in that area. The storm weakened as it turned more northeasterly and moved through a forested area. Damage to trees and homes in this area was rated EF1. At 7:14&nbsp;p.m. (0014&nbsp;UTC), it struck [[Northpoint, Arkansas|Northpoint]] as an EF2, causing severe damage to several homes. Roofs were removed entirely from homes, though the walls on these structures remained mostly intact. After briefly crossing [[Lake Maumelle]], the tornado caused significant tree damage between [[Roland, Arkansas|Roland]] and [[Natural Steps, Arkansas|Natural Steps]] with some trees being stripped of their foliage and debarked. Moving through an unpopulated area, the tornado intensified before crossing the [[Arkansas River]] and entering [[Faulkner County, Arkansas|Faulkner County]] around 7:26&nbsp;p.m. (0026&nbsp;UTC).<ref name="LittleRockSurvey">{{cite web|work=National Weather Service Office in Little Rock, Arkansas|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014|title=April 27, 2014 Arkansas tornado surveys|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/lzk/gis/tor042714a.kml|format=.KML}}</ref>

The tornado entered Faulkner County and immediately struck the River Plantation subdivision at the southwest edge of [[Mayflower, Arkansas|Mayflower]]. Here, EF4 damage took place  with large, two-story homes being leveled with only piles of debris left on their foundations. On the northeast side of the subdivision, one person was killed after debris struck the door of her [[storm shelter]] and opened it, exposing her to the tornado. The storm shelter's door was found to have been of sub-standard construction. Near where this fatality took place, large concrete road barriers were blown over and moved, and calculations revealed that this was also likely indicative of EF4 intensity.<ref name="LittleRockSurvey"/><ref name="American Meteorological Society">{{cite web |url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/27SLS/webprogram/Paper254346.html |title= Damage Survey of the Mayflower-Vilonia, Arkansas Tornado |last1=Marshall |first1=Timothy |date=November 6, 2014 |website=ams.confex.com |publisher=American Meteorological Society |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Just outside the subdivision, a power substation sustained major damage. Continuing northeast, the storm tore across the south edge of Mayflower and crossed [[Arkansas Highway 365]] and [[Interstate 40]], tossing semi-trucks, cars, and road equipment from the highway. A business district in this area experienced mainly EF3 damage, with [[Semi-trailer truck|18-wheelers]] tossed, industrial buildings damaged or destroyed, and some nearby homes heavily damaged. A [[recreational vehicle]] dealership on the other side of the highway was completely destroyed at EF4 intensity (though meteorologist/civil engineer Tim Marshall applied an EF3 rating at this location due to structural flaws), along with most of the RVs; three of which were found wrapped around a nearby billboard. A vehicle repair shop, millwork company, construction company, and church in southern Mayflower were also destroyed, and a home improvement store was badly damaged.<ref name="ncdc.noaa.gov">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=504760</ref> In addition to the fatality in the storm shelter, two other people were killed in Mayflower.<ref name="ArkansasDeaths"/> The tornado then crossed [[Lake Conway]], downing numerous trees and causing a mixture of EF2 and EF3 damage to homes along the lakeshore. Some block-foundation frame homes along with multiple mobile homes were swept into the lake by the tornado. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission lost a clubhouse, shop, horse barn, residence, metal carports, shower house, and several dog kennels in this area, and eventually removed 627 tons of tornado debris from the lake.<ref name="ncdc.noaa.gov"/> The tornado then caused mainly EF2 damage as it struck areas in and around [[Saltillo, Arkansas|Saltillo]]. Numerous homes, mobile homes, sheds, barns, trees, and a church were damaged or destroyed in the Saltillo area. Two homes near Saltillo had only interior walls left standing, with the damage to those homes rated EF3.<ref name="LittleRockSurvey"/>

Further northeast, the tornado began to re-intensify dramatically as it approached the [[U.S. Route 64 in Arkansas|Vilonia Bypass (U.S. Route 64)]], reaching EF4 strength for a second time. Just southwest of the bypass, some poorly-anchored homes were obliterated and swept from their foundations, and cars were tossed hundreds of yards away. Another frame home was left with only interior walls standing, and two mobile homes were obliterated with the frames thrown up to two streets away. Two children were killed in these homes.

Shortly before 7:50&nbsp;p.m. (0050&nbsp;UTC), the tornado moved into the town of [[Vilonia, Arkansas|Vilonia]] as a high-end EF4,<ref name="LittleRockSurvey"/> a town which was struck by [[2011 Super Outbreak#Vilonia, Arkansas|an EF2 tornado]] that killed four people on April&nbsp;25, 2011, three years and two days prior.<ref>{{cite web |author=Alexander Smith |publisher=NBC News |date=April 28, 2014 |accessdate=May 2, 2014 |title=Tornado Hits Vilonia, Arkansas, for 2nd Time in Just Three Years |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/deadly-tornado-outbreak/tornado-hits-vilonia-arkansas-2nd-time-just-three-years-n91176 |archivedate=May 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PGraWwwG?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/deadly-tornado-outbreak/tornado-hits-vilonia-arkansas-2nd-time-just-three-years-n91176 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The EF4 Tornado first struck the recently built [[Vilonia School District|Vilonia Middle School]], destroying the top floor and causing most walls to collapse.<ref name="LittleRockSurvey"/> With winds estimated as high as {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and the circulation spanning .75 miles,<ref name="vilonia"/> the tornado moved through the town center. Numerous homes and businesses were destroyed with only piles of debris or bare slabs left behind, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards and mangled beyond recognition, some of which were crushed into small balls or stripped down to their frames. Trees in town were completely debarked and denuded, low-lying shrubs were completely stripped and debarked, and extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2014/04/aerial-assessment-of-southern-states-tornado-damage/#1 |title=Aerial assessment of southern states tornado damage |last1=Gordon |first1=Kalani |date=April 30, 2013 |website=The Dark Room |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |access-date=March 4, 2014}}</ref> An aerial flyover revealed an extensive swath of ground scouring through the town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecabin.net/latest-news/2014-04-28/video-aerial-footage-mayflower-violnia-tornado#.VQMjzY7F-oy |title=Video: Aerial footage of Mayflower, Vilonia tornado |date=April 28, 2014 |website=thecabin.net |publisher=The Log Cabin Democrat |access-date=March 13, 2015}}</ref> A dollar store, a strip mall, two auto repair shops, the old city hall, a gas station, a church life center, a real estate office, an investment firm, an auto parts store, and a fried fish restaurant were all completely destroyed in downtown Vilonia.

Entire rows of homes were reduced to bare slabs at this location, though it was revealed that the homes were nailed rather than bolted to their foundations, preventing a rating higher than EF4.<ref name="LittleRockSurvey"/>

Continuing past Vilonia, the tornado weakened to EF3 strength as it passed just south of Williams Lake. A large metal arena building and a mobile home were destroyed in that area, with a few other structures sustaining EF1 damage nearby. Shortly after 8:00&nbsp;p.m. (0100&nbsp;UTC) the storm moved through densely forested areas and into [[White County, Arkansas|White County]], just west of [[El Paso, Arkansas|El Paso]]. The tornado briefly regained EF2 status and destroyed two manufactured homes.<ref name="LittleRockSurvey"/> One person was killed in one of the manufactured homes at this location.<ref name="ArkansasDeaths">{{cite web |publisher=Arkansas Matters |date=April 29, 2014 |accessdate=May 2, 2014 |title=Remembering the Arkansas Tornado Victims |url=http://www.arkansasmatters.com/story/d/story/remembering-the-arkansas-tornado-victims/22658/7tw_zTLrSU60eqHbqeIBbQ |archivedate=May 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PGspSgwf?url=http://www.arkansasmatters.com/story/d/story/remembering-the-arkansas-tornado-victims/22658/7tw_zTLrSU60eqHbqeIBbQ |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> It soon dissipated at 8:06&nbsp;p.m. (0106&nbsp;UTC) roughly {{convert|1|mi|km|}} north-northeast of El Paso near a forested area.<ref name="LittleRockSurvey"/>

Overall, the tornado remained on the ground for an hour, from 7:06&nbsp;p.m. to 8:06&nbsp;p.m. (0006&nbsp;– 0106&nbsp;UTC), and traveled along a {{convert|41.3|mi|km|}} path.

The final rating of this tornado was a source of controversy, and the National Weather Service office in Little Rock noted that if this tornado occurred prior to the change to the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]] in 2007, it likely would have been rated as an F5 due to numerous homes being swept clean from their foundations. However, it was revealed that almost every home in Vilonia lacked anchor bolts and were anchored with cut nails instead. The new scale accounts for homes that use cut nails instead of anchor bolts, which do not effectively provide resistance against violent tornadoes. The final decision on an EF4 rating was based on this as well. However, meteorologist/civil engineer [[Timothy P. Marshall]] noted in his survey of the damage that the rating assigned was "lower bound", and despite the presence of construction flaws, this doesn't rule out "the possibility that EF5 winds could have occurred."<ref name="NWSLittleRock"/><ref name="American Meteorological Society"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2014/05/05/meteorologist-defends-ef4-rating-on-vilonia-tornado |title=Meteorologist defends EF4 rating on Vilonia tornado |last1=Brantley |first1=Max |date=May 5, 2014 |website=Arkansas Times |publisher=Arkansas Times |access-date=March 4, 2015}}</ref> Further inspection from surveyors revealed that one home that was swept away along E Wicker St. was indeed properly bolted to its foundation. However, an inspection of the context surrounding the house revealed that small trees in a ditch near the home were still standing, and that the residence had possibly been pummeled by heavy debris from downtown Vilonia, exacerbating the level of destruction. Surveyors decided against an upgrade to EF5 as a result.<ref name="NWSLittleRock"/>

===Louisville, Mississippi===
[[File:Louisville2014Tornado.JPG|thumb|left|EF4 damage in Louisville]]
This violent and long-tracked wedge tornado tracked across northern Mississippi and through the town of [[Louisville, Mississippi|Louisville]] on the evening of the 28th, killing ten people, injuring over eighty and leaving major damage in its wake. The tornado touched down in [[Leake County, Mississippi|Leake County]], initially snapping numerous trees at EF1 intensity as it moved through heavily forested areas.<ref name="Louisville EF-4 Tornado">{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jan/?n=2014_04_27_28_29_winston_tor |title=Louisville EF-4 Tornado |date=May 3, 2014 |website=NWS Jackson, Mississippi |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref> The tornado proceeded to reach EF2 intensity as it completely destroyed a mobile home and a metal building. Three cars were tossed nearby, and a frame home lost most of its roof, sustaining EF1 damage. Maintaining EF2 intensity, the tornado crossed into [[Winston County, Mississippi|Winston County]] at the [[Attala County, Mississippi|Attala]]/[[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]] border. Numerous trees were snapped and a house sustained roof damage at that location. The tornado then weakened momentarily, causing only EF1-strength tree damage as it moved through dense forest. Continuing northeast, the tornado reintensified dramatically and reached EF3 strength as it heavily damaged or destroyed several homes and metal chicken houses.<ref name="Louisville EF-4 Tornado"/> Some of the homes sustained collapse of their exterior walls. Slightly further along the path, a large area of trees along Hartness Rd sustained extreme denuding and debarking, with only stubs of the largest branches remaining. The severity and consistency of the debarking/denuding was severe enough that surveyors applied an EF4 rating at that location.<ref name="Louisville EF-4 Tornado"/> Numerous chicken houses were destroyed at EF3 intensity nearby.<ref name="Louisville EF-4 Tornado"/>

Slight weakening occurred beyond this point, with consistent EF2 damage occurring: a house had its roof torn off, a mobile home was completely destroyed, and numerous trees were snapped. The tornado then regained low-end EF4 intensity, where a large complex of metal chicken houses was completely obliterated with little trace of them left.<ref name="Louisville EF-4 Tornado"/> A nearby cell phone tower was toppled, and several homes at the edge of the path sustained roof damage. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it moved northwest of [[Noxapater, Mississippi|Noxapater]], sweeping away a brick building and a brick home, obliterating a mobile home, and debarking numerous trees. The tornado then weakened slightly, snapping numerous trees and power poles and destroying chicken houses at EF3 intensity.<ref name="Louisville EF-4 Tornado"/> After that, the tornado weakened further, but maintained EF2 intensity as it made a dramatic turn to the north, roughly following and eventually crossing [[Mississippi Highway 15|Highway 15]]. Many trees and power poles were snapped, homes had their roofs torn off, and many mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area. One mobile home frame was found wrapped around a tree in this area.<ref name="Louisville EF-4 Tornado"/>
