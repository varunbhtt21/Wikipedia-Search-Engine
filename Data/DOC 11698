==Plot==
Sawaki (Shin'ichi Tsutsumi) is a postman. He has an old friend Noguchi (Keisuke Horibe) who, unknown to him, had become a [[yakuza]]. Noguchi was being spied by the police for a long time. One day Sawaki delivers a letter to him and stays at his place for a while. During his stay Noguchi puts a package of drugs into Sawaki's letter bag. His finger, which he cut off as a symbol of loyalty to his gang, also accidentally falls into the bag. Viewing his relationship with Noguchi, the police think that Sawaki is a member of the yakuza and follow him. On reaching home, Sawaki finds a suicide note in his bag written by a cancer patient to her aunt. He rushes to the hospital to see the girl Kyoko (Kyoko Toyama) and falls in love with her. He meets a hit man Joe ([[Ren Osugi]]) there who tells him how he had won the contract killing competition called the "Killer of killers". The police profiler (Tomoro Taguchi), who was following Sawaki, comes to the conclusion that Sawaki is a member of the criminal gang. Meanwhile, Naguchi discovers that the finger he had cut was no longer in his house. All this marked the beginning of problems for Sawaki.

{{Quote box|width=200px|bgcolor=#FFFFFF|align=left |quote="Postman Blues is a film in which absolutely all the characters are so completely crazy that neutralize their absurd plans against each other and the film may find itself with sleepwalking to an end, which must appear in a very bizarre way as logical."|salign=right|source=critic.de <ref name=critic>{{cite web|title=Postman Blues-TV-critic.de|url=http://www.critic.de/tv/empfehlung/sabu-postman-blues-2473/|publisher=critic.de|accessdate=28 April 2014|language=German}}</ref>}}
The film received mixed reviews from critics but was hailed as one of the best works of Hiroyuki Tanaka.<ref>{{cite web|title=Postman Blues - Zelluloid.de|url=http://www.zelluloid.de/filme/index.php3?id=8783|publisher=zelluloid.de|accessdate=28 April 2014|language=German}}</ref> The film was commercially successful and was declared a hit at the Japanese box office. Though the story appeared a bit complicated but the screenplay led the audience to enjoy the movie.<ref name=power/> The action and the dialogues of the movie were also appreciated. Cinematographer Kuriyama Shuji was appreciated for implementing the change of camera work from high action scenes to love scenes.<ref name=power/> The Japanese film critics praised the film by calling it ' both a superb parody of the gangster genre and a masterful exercise in style and storytelling.' <ref>{{cite web|title=Postman Blues|url=http://www.japansociety.org/event_detail?eid=4bba7a79|publisher=japansociety.org|accessdate=28 April 2014|date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

The film also received negative reviews from a few foreign film critics. Peter Bradshaw of Theguardian.com called the film a "chaotic Yakuza thriller, which has a lot of energy and pace, but is let down by uncertain, and slightly callow, undertones of comic sentimentality."<ref>{{cite web|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=Postman Blues (Posutoman Burusu)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/83284/postman-blues|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> French critics said that "''Postman Blues'' could have been an intelligent extension of his first film that surprised many people."<ref name=iken>{{cite web|title=Iken-eiga - Critiques du film - Postman blues|url=http://www.iken-eiga.fr/film-critique-1070-Postman-blues.html|publisher=iken-eiga.fr|accessdate=28 April 2014|language=French}}</ref> It was even called a disappointment<ref name=iken/> and an innocent black comedy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Postman Blues (1997)|url=http://dvd-world.biz/filmblogg/?p=8788|publisher=dvd-world.biz|accessdate=28 April 2014|language=Norwegian}}</ref>
