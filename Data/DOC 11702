'''Bernard G. Amend''' (1 January 1821 – 6 April 1911) was a [[Germany|German]]-born pharmacist. He ran an important pharmacy and scientific supply business in New York, NY which was sold to [[Fisher Scientific]] in 1940. He is also known for contributing to the founding of the [[American Chemical Society]] and for his mineralogy collection.

==Biography==

He emigrated to the United States in 1848 and took a position as chemist in a small pharmacy, which was then located at the corner of 18th Street and Third Avenue in New York, just north of the neighborhood called [[Little Germany, Manhattan|Little Germany]].. The owner retired in 1851, and Amend took over the business. With old college friend, Carl (Charles) Eimer, he renamed the company "Eimer & Amend" and soon the company became the country's leading importer of drugs and chemicals. In 1874 they added laboratory supplies to their inventory.

In 1886 Amend built a new seven-story brick building in the location of the prior business, called the Eimer & Amend building.<ref name="mineral">{{cite web|url=http://www.minrec.org/labels.asp?colid=3|title=Bernard G. Amend (1821-1911)|accessdate=28 Apr 2014}}</ref>
