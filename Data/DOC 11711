Title : Chronology of indoor American football video games
Text : The following is a '''chronology of [[indoor American football]] video games'''. There have been five games released on the subject of indoor American football. The first game was ''[[Arena Football (1988 video game)|Arena Football]]'' in 1988, which was re-designed and released in 1992 under the same name. ''[[Arena Football '95]]'' was an unreleased game for the [[Atari Jaguar]], but the prototype has since surfaced and it was subsequently released on the Jaguar by [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] publishers. The most recent indoor American football game is ''[[Arena Football: Road to Glory]]'', which was released on February 21, 2007. It was a sequel to the 2006 [[EA Sports]] title ''[[Arena Football (2006 video game)|Arena Football]]''.

To date, although several indoor American football leagues have come and gone, the only one to have lent a license to a video game product has been the [[Arena Football League]].
