This article doesn't state how this random conspiracy theorist is in any way notable, and searches of his name seem to mostly turn up results of the "this guy is nuts" variety. He seems to have invented the [[Montauk Project]] from whole cloth, so if this article is deleted, that one is on pretty shaky ground.
