Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
|Description = This is the American Performance Technologies - Motovox logo found on the company's home page. 
|Source = powerapt.com
|Article = American Performance Technologies
|Purpose = to serve as the primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the entity in question.
|Replaceability = Because it is a non-free logo, there is almost certainly no free representation. Any substitute that is not a derivative work would fail to convey the meaning intended, would tarnish or misrepresent its image, or would fail its purpose of identification or commentary.
|Minimality = The image is placed in the infobox at the top of the article discussing American Performance Technologies, a subject of public interest. The significance of the logo is to help the reader identify the organization, assure the readers that they have reached the right article containing critical commentary about the organization, and illustrate the organization's intended branding message in a way that words alone could not convey.
|Other information = Use of the logo in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy, logo guidelines, and fair use under United States copyright law as described above.
