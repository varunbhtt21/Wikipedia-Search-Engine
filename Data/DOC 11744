'''CA-SBR-3186''' is an archaeological site located in the central [[Mojave Desert]] in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], [[California]]. The site, which is located on an [[alluvial fan]] on the north side of the [[Soda Mountains]], includes 174 [[cairn]]s. The cairns are approximately {{convert|12|cm}} tall and {{convert|1|m}} across, making them relatively small compared to similar formations. The cairns are estimated to have been built in the late prehistoric period due to the site's relative lack of aging. Archaeologists have speculated that indigenous peoples built the cairns as a method of controlling water flows.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=Mark Q.|title=Some Thoughts On the Possible Function of Some Cairn Complexes in the Southwestern Great Basin|journal=Nevada Archaeologist|date=1987|volume=6|issue=1|page=24|url=http://www.nvarch.org/NV%20Archaeologist/NV%20Archaeologist%20Vol06(1)%201987-Modified.pdf#page=26}}</ref>
