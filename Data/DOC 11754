==Description and history==
[[File:PikePlacePigWithSign.jpg|thumb|right|The statue in 2019]]

The [[Smithsonian Institution]] describes ''Rachel'' as a "life-size, realistic figure" of a sow piggy bank.<ref name=Smithsonian/> The Pike Place Market Foundation calls it the "mascot" of [[Pike Place Market]].<ref name=PPMF/> The bronze sculpture depicts a pig with a money slot on the top of its head and measures approximately {{convert|36 x 66 x 16|in|cm}} and weighs {{convert|550|lbs|kg}}.<ref name="Times-2011">{{cite news |last=O'Hagan |first=Maureen |date=February 6, 2011 |title=Rachel, Pike Place brass pig, survives crash—Rear-ended taxi careens into statue Rachel knocked off cement base |page=B2 |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/pig-vs-prius-and-the-winner-is/ |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref> Bronze [[footprint]]s are on the sidewalk leading to the pig figure. One nearby plaque reads: "Market Foundation Piggy Bank. Made possible by a gift from Fratelli's Ice Cream, August 17, 1986".<ref name=Smithsonian/> Another states that money deposited into the piggy bank benefits local human service organizations.<ref name=Smithsonian/>

The sculpture was surveyed by the Smithsonian's [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program in April 1995 and was deemed "well maintained".<ref name=Smithsonian/>

On February 5, 2011, ''Rachel'' was struck by a [[taxicab]] and was knocked off its concrete base.<ref name="Times-2011"/><ref>{{cite news |date=February 5, 2011 |title=Taxi crashes into Pike Place Market pig statue |publisher=[[KING-TV|KING 5 News]] |url=http://www.king5.com/news/Taxi-crash-decks-Pike-Place-Market-pig-statue-115373199.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204073145/http://www.king5.com/news/Taxi-crash-decks-Pike-Place-Market-pig-statue-115373199.html |archivedate=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref> The sculpture suffered cosmetic damage, including a {{convert|10|in|cm}} crack along the left ear and a dent on its left side, and was repaired at Gerber's studio on Whidbey Island. ''Rachel'' returned to the Pike Place Market on March 18, 2011, after a tour of Seattle landmarks in a vintage farm truck.<ref>{{cite news |last=Frause |first=Sue |date=March 5, 2011 |title=Whidbey Island's Rachel the Pig ready to return to the Pike Place Market |url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/whidbey/2011/03/05/whidbey-islands-rachel-the-pig-ready-to-return-to-the-pike-place-market/ |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Payne |first=Patti |date=March 17, 2011 |title=Rachel the pig returns to her market post |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/03/this-big-piggy-comes-home.html |work=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]] |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref>

''Rachel'' was joined by a "cousin" named ''Billie'', installed in July 2011 at the Western Avenue entrance to the market.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 25, 2011 |title=Celebrate as Rachel Turns 25 – Plus, Welcome Billie the Pig to Pike Place Market! |url=https://www.downtownseattle.com/2011/07/celebrate-as-rachel-turns-25-plus-welcome-billie-the-pig-to-pike-place-market/ |publisher=Downtown Seattle Association |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}</ref>
