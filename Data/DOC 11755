:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Photo is public domain. Hook is proper length and format, and its fact is supported by online reference. The article's date and length are appropriate. Every paragraph in the article body has at least one reference. The article appears neutrally written from reliable sources, and appears free from copyright violation and too-close paraphrasing. Approved. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 23:22, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] There are too many fundamental factual errors to allow this proceed at the present time. In the JSC MARS-1 paragraph, the technical term "size fractions" from FN3 has been rendered "fractions of the size" here, "mm" becomes "milliliters", "palagonitic tephra" becomes "paragonetic tephra", and the phrase "has been cited to contain" is not worded well. The pictured ash, the 1A, is not sourced as Hawaiian in the article (the Material safety sheet sourced does not mention Hawaii at all); however, this web page (http://www.orbitec.com/store/simulant.html) does support it and could be used in the 1A paragraphs. Also, the sentence about sizes reads as if "no less than 13 microns" is a separate size, instead of it being the smallest size of particle in the other two categories.

:::*Thanks for the suggestion. I have made those changes. Please review and see now if there is still any factual error. Thanks. [[User:Z22|Z22]] ([[User talk:Z22|talk]]) 03:23, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

::::*[[User:Z22|Z22]], I'm sorry it's taken me so long. I don't see any issues with the changes, but I had noticed a couple of in MMS section. I've just done a significant revision of that section, because I felt it didn't quite hold together. I've added some material and also removed parts that didn't seem to work based on that MMS source. Please take a look and let me know what you think. Thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 00:42, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::*Thanks for your edit, [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]]. It is better described now at the beginning of that section. I guess you are right about the part that you removed. It was strictly about the future MMS-derived simulants which may not be directly associated with this article. So, what's the next step on this?

::::::*Glad you like it, [[User:Z22|Z22]]. Before this goes to a final review, I think there needs to be an ALT hook that revises the current text somewhat: the article does mention both JSC MARS-1 and MMS, and both appear to be used by researchers, but only the former uses the Hawaiian volcanic ash. One possibility is to word the hook so it has to be the Hawaiian material. For example,
:::::::*'''ALT1''': <s>... that the original '''[[Martian regolith simulant|Martian soil simulant‎]]''' ''(pictured)'' used by Mars researchers was made from Hawaiian volcanic ash?</s>
:::::::If the JSC one was the first created, then this could work, so long as a source and the text clearly supports it, but if there were others before it, it wouldn't work. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 02:11, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::*'''ALT2''': ... that the '''[[Martian regolith simulant|Martian soil simulant‎]]''' ''(pictured)'' used by NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] is made from Hawaiian volcanic ash?  
:::::::If we want to be more correct, then we ALT2 is the best because it is directly supported by the inline citation and also the picture is of JSC-MARS-1A which is not the original, but the current one used by NASA. [[User:Z22|Z22]] ([[User talk:Z22|talk]]) 02:27, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::*That sounds fine. I've struck ALT1. I made a tiny change to your ALT2: "was made" → "is made", since it's the current one. Since I've made a bunch of edits to the article, I really shouldn't be the one to do the final review, so I'll put out a call for a new reviewer.

:*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Reviewer needed to check ALT2 hook and also to recheck the article. Many thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 03:43, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Okay! The new work is good, and the sources still support the hook. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 13:10, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
