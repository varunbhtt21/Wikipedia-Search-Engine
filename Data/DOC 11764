The '''Childs Restaurant Building on Surf Avenue''' is a [[New York City]] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|designated landmark]] on Surf Avenue at West 12th Street in [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]].  It was completed in 1917 for [[Childs Restaurants]], an early [[restaurant chain]] and one of the largest in the [[United States]] at that time.  Its design, by John Westervelt, Childs' in-house architect, shows "elements of the Spanish Revival style."<ref name=LPC>{{cite web|title=Childs Restaurant Building|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2410.pdf|publisher=New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|accessdate=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326214451/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2410.pdf|archive-date=26 March 2013|dead-url=yes}}</ref> The company built a much larger [[Childs Restaurant Building on the Coney Island Boardwalk|Childs location]] on the [[Coney Island Boardwalk]] in 1923, but continued to operate the Surf Avenue location until 1943.

In later years the building was used for other restaurants and nightclubs.  In 2007 the property was acquired by [[Coney Island USA]], a local arts organization that is headquartered in the building, which currently houses a theater, a bar, and exhibition and office space.<ref name=ConeyIslandUSA>{{cite web|title=About Coney Island USA|url=http://www.coneyisland.com/about-coney-island-usa|publisher=Coney Island USA}}</ref> The building was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]] in 2010.<ref name=LPC/>

The building sustained considerable damage in [[Hurricane Sandy]] on 31 October 2012. With the help of many volunteers, Coney Island USA repaired the worst of the damage and reoccupied the building by spring 2013.<ref name=Timeout>{{cite web|title=Coney Island after Sandy: See who's back for the 2013 season|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/coney-island-after-sandy-see-whos-back-for-the-2013-season|publisher=Timeout New York|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>
