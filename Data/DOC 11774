'''David Jonathan Stensrud''' (born 1961) is an American meteorologist recognized for numerical modeling and forecasting of hazardous [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] and [[Mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] weather and for incorporating new data into models.<ref name="Vita">{{cite web |last = Stensrud |first = David |title = Vita |date = 2 Oct 2012 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/stensrud/public_html/Vita.html |accessdate = 2014-04-27 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}</ref>

Stensrud earned a B.A. in [[meteorology]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. At [[Pennsylvania State University]] (PSU) he earned M.S. in meteorology in 1985 with the thesis ''On the Development of Boundary Layer Rolls from the Inflection Point Instability'' and in 1992 a Ph.D. with the dissertation ''Southward Burst Mesoscale Convective Systems: An Observational and Modeling Study''.<ref name="SOM">{{cite web |title = David Stensrud |publisher = University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology |url = http://som.ou.edu/profiles.php?facID=182 |accessdate = 2014-04-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140429050553/http://som.ou.edu/profiles.php?facID=182 |archivedate = 2014-04-29 |dead-url = yes }}</ref> He joined the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) in 1986 as a research meteorologist and is an adjunct professor at the affiliated [[University of Oklahoma]] (OU). He was an inaugural awardee of the [[Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers]] (PECASE) in 1996 and was a contributor to the Physical Science Basis portion of [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[IPCC]], an organisation that was co-awarded the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name="awards"/> He is a Fellow of the [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS) and a member of [[Sigma Xi]] and [[Chi Epsilon Pi]].
