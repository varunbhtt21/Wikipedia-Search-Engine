*'''Delete''' No indication of notability, reads like a CV.  Probably '''speedy''' A7. [[User:GoldenRing|GoldenRing]] ([[User talk:GoldenRing|talk]]) 13:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::Note this article is [[User:Cbnauert]]'s first and, so far, only contribution to the project, though I assume it's done in good faith, especially since the user seems to be part of an education programme in public administration.

*'''Delete''' Hired manager of local government of a city of about 45,000 people. More appropriate for LinkedIn. Not notable.

*'''Delete''' Page is properly formatted and referenced but far from notable. I can't seem to find any other pages on City Managers. [[User:Meatsgains|Meatsgains]] ([[User talk:Meatsgains|talk]]) 02:05, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
