'''[[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens]]''' was a large [[zoo]], [[amusement park]], exhibition hall complex and [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] stadium in [[Belle Vue, Manchester|Belle Vue]], [[Manchester]], England, opened in 1836. The brainchild of John Jennison, the park was intended to entertain the genteel [[middle class]]es, with formal gardens and dancing on open-air platforms during the summer, but they soon became one of the most popular attractions in [[Northern England]]. Jennison set out a small amusements area in Belle Vue during the 1870s, which was expanded in the early 20th century to become what was advertised as the "showground of the world". Popular rides included the {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} Bobs [[roller coaster]] and the Scenic Railway. Grand firework displays were given from 1852 and there was an annual Christmas circus from 1922. The Kings Hall, opened in 1910, housed [[The Hallé|the Hallé Orchestra]] for several years and hosted concerts by artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[The Who]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. At its peak Belle Vue occupied {{convert|165|acre|km2}} and attracted more than two&nbsp;million visitors a year. The zoo closed in September 1977 after its owners decided they could no longer afford losses of £100,000 a year. {{TFAFULL|Belle Vue Zoological Gardens}}

*'''Support''', despite being one of the biggest contributors to the article and well known for being reluctant to appear on the main page. I make an exception in this case though, because I finished the article off for WebHamster, another one of those chased off this project because he was perceived not to fit in with the Californian culture of civility. If it does appear on the main page then I hope he'll see it and think "I wrote that!"
