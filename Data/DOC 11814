===4th Crawfish Bowl===
The 4th Annual Red-White Crawfish Bowl was held Saturday, March 1. The game was modified from previous years.  While the team was divided into Red and White teams as in previous years, the game pitted offense against defense.  The White team consisted of offensive players while the Red team was made up of defensive players.  Scoring was adjusted to include normal scoring for the offense with the addition of additional points for scoring plays longer than 20 yards.  The defense scored on turnovers, three-and-outs, and stops.  The White team (offensive players) won 50–18 with the modified scoring.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Teams Wins 2014 Crawfish Title Bowl|url=http://www.lamarcardinals.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/030114aaa.html|publisher=Lamar University Department of Athletics|date=March 1, 2014|accessdate=October 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020172226/http://www.lamarcardinals.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/030114aaa.html|archive-date=October 20, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
