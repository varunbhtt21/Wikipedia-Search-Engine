I've listed this article for peer review because the centennial is coming up (April 24, 1915). I think it's a good idea to have it looking nice until then.

'''A few copyediting comments''', not a complete review. (Note that I'm just copying text without links.) This is my imperfect understanding of what reviewers are looking for at FAC. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 
*Have the issues identified in the old FAC ([[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Armenian Genocide/archive1]]) been addressed?
*"The word genocide was coined in order to describe these events.": According to the cited source, Lemkin coined the word to describe the Holocaust. Most readers would take "these events" to be the events you're describing in that paragraph.
*"grouped together under the name Armenian millet (community)": In what way were they grouped?
*"There, the Armenians were subject": Where?
*"system held up in Muslim countries": "held up" isn't the phrase you want here.
*"if we want to appreciate what uncontrolled Turkish rule meant, alike to Armenians and to Greeks. It did not mean religious persecution; it meant unutterable contempt...  They were dogs and pigs; and their nature was to be Christians, to be spat upon": Does this provide actual and relevant information about the treatment of Armenians? If not, then the tone isn't encyclopedic.
*"... by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law; they ...": Does "they" refer to Christians and Jews, or just Christians? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 03:13, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

Thank you for the extensive review. I'll make some adjustments accordingly. I'd also appreciate it if other users, such as {{user|Armen Ohanian}} and {{user|Diranakir}} to have a look at this and provide their two cents as well.
