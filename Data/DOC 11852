The result was '''delete'''. Hoax or not, there is not a single source in the article. However, the problem is that the article was hijackecd in March 2014 - the old article about the Manila radio station was overwritten by the text on non-notable provincial radio station. For this reason, I restore the previous version. It used to have a link to the station website, which is working, but blacklisted (to be found in the history); right now the article is unsourced. If someone wants to delete the old article a new AfD should be opened.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 07:34, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

Does not exist and it is clearly a hoax.

*'''Redirect to [[My Only Radio#MOR Stations Nationwide]]''' As usual for these Filipino radio stations, many of them are repeaters of national radio networks with no local content, which this one is. However, the "defunct" DZUR article should have its own AfD because the reason for it being defunct is possibly for illegal broadcasting through its entire history. That article makes multiple mentions of it being a pirate operation, but attempts to [[WP:WEASEL]] out of verifying that with peacock language about how it brought a format to its service area. It is highly unlikely this station and DZUR/defunct could legally hold the same calls at the same time, not to mention the unreferenced hat for the defunct article has a date of '''April 2008''', suggesting an inappropriate article restoration removed by the information for the real DZUR. <font face="Myriad Web">'''[[User:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:royalblue4">Nate</span>]]''' <span style="color:dark blue">•</span> <small>''([[User_talk:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:darkgoldenrod">chatter</span>]])''</small></font> 20:58, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as probable hoax. Claiming to be established in 2002, it is not listed in the NSO 2010 Philippine Yearbook [http://www.census.gov.ph/sites/default/files/Chapter_20_communication_0.pdf]. --[[User:Bluemask|Bluemask]] ([[User talk:Bluemask|talk]]) 08:49, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
** Comment - I know this comment is not counted, but I would like to say this guys: (To Fauzan) Yes I know it was existed, but I consider all parts of the articles that had been made by an IP address (which I suspected Petermusngi again) was truly and positively a hoax. DZUR callsign is actually and originally used by 107.9 U-Radio here in the Philippines before it was inactive in the year 2013. I tried to move back the page from [[DZUR (defunct)]] to this article but a message revealing that some parts of the article contains a spam. I wouldn't really considerate this article as a hoax, but having an M.O.R. Pampanga is not really true. And one thing, it is very funny that M.O.R. Pampanga-hoax will be reached thru the areas of Region 4-a and b which freaks me out, hence ABS-CBN Corporation told me that their transmitter in Manila is located in Antipolo which is part of Rizal province. So I made a suspicion about this article, you know, kinda freak me out.
