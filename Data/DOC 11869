Booral is a coastal [[suburbs and localities (Australia)|locality]] within the [[Fraser Coast Region]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]].<ref name=qpn>{{cite QPN|46633|Booral|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> In the [[census in Australia#2011|2011 census]], Booral had a population of 1,449 people.<ref name="ABS">{{Census 2011 AUS|id= SSC30203 |name=Booral (SSC)|accessdate=28 April 2014|quick=on}}</ref>

==History==
The name ''Booral'' is a [[Kabi]] language word meaning either ''tall'' (relating to the sky god ''Beiral'') or ''burrall'' meaning ''place of shell mounds''.<ref name=qpn/> Many shell mounds have been found along the coastline, arising from [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] people feasting on shellfish. Aboriginal people travelled from the [[Bunya Mountains]] to trade [[bunya nut]]s for shellfish. It is believed Aboriginal people inhabited the area for over 6,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Booral|url=http://booral.org.au/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52%3A-Breif-History-of-Booral&catid=34%3Ageneral-information&Itemid=1|publisher=Wendy Reed|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

==Community associations==
The Booral Community Association Inc is a group of volunteers who seek to promote the interests of the community at all levels of government. A major issue for the group has been the restriction of foreshore access to only certain property holders rather than to the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Booral Identities|url=http://booral.org.au/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47%3Apeople-of-booral-queensland&catid=34%3Ageneral-information&Itemid=1|publisher=Wendy Reed|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>
