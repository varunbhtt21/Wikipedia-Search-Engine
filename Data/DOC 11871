== Pay-as-you-drive insurance ==
In 2008, Real Insurance was the first insurance company to offer [[Usage-based insurance|pay-as-you-drive]] (PAYD) insurance in Australia, whereby the car insurance premium is reduced for drivers with low kilometres usage.<ref name=PAYG>{{cite web|title=Hollard's Real Insurance Rolls Out World's First "Trust-based" Pay Only As You Drive Product Using Exigen Insurance Solutions|url=http://www.exigeninsurance.com/news-events/press-releases/PAYD.html|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> Such drivers can specify in advance the number of kilometres they plan to drive, in return for reduced premiums.<ref name="PAYG"/>
Setting the maximum number of kilometres at the start of the policy eliminates the privacy issues inherent in other types of [[Usage-based insurance|usage-based car insurance]], which may require drivers to have a monitoring device installed to track the kilometres they drive.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Paefgen|first1=Johannes|first2=Thorsten |last2=Staake |first3=Frederic |last3=Thiesse |title=Resolving the Misalignment between Consumer Privacy Concerns and Ubiquitous IS Design: The Case of Usage-based Insurance |journal=International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) |url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2012/proceedings/ISSecurity/6/ |date=2012}}</ref>
