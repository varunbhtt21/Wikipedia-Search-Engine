[[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] '''Allison Digby Tatham-Warter''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (21 May 1917 – 21 March 1993), also known as '''Digby Tatham-Warter''' or just '''Digby''', was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He was most known for carrying an umbrella into battle.<ref name=peg>{{cite web|url=http://www.pegasusarchive.org/arnhem/tatham_warter.htm |title=Major Digby Tatham-Warter |publisher=Pegasus Archive |date=17 September 1944 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Digby was born in [[Atcham]], [[Shropshire]], [[England]]. He was the second son of Henry de Grey Tatham-Warter, a landowner with several estates in the south west of England. Digby's father fought in the [[World War I|First World War]] with the [[Artists Rifles]]; he was [[Chemical warfare|gassed]] in the [[Trench warfare|trenches]] and died when Digby was 11.<ref name=sax>{{cite web|url=http://www.saxonlodge.net/showmedia.php?mediaID=587 |title=Histories: Digby Tatham-Warter (1917–1993): The Tatham Family of County Durham |publisher=Saxon Lodge |date= |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> Digby was educated at [[Wellington College, Berkshire]]. In 1935 he was accepted into the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saxonlodge.net/getperson.php?personID=I0973&tree=Tatham#cite1 |title=Allison Digby Tatham-Warter b. 26 May 1917 Atcham d. 21 Mar 1993 Nanyuki, Kenya: The Tatham Family of County Durham |publisher=Saxon Lodge |date= |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

==Early military career==
Digby graduated from Sandhurst as an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] with the rank of [[second lieutenant]] on 21 January 1937 and was commissioned into the Unattached List for the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] with a view to joining the Indian Army due to his family connections. He was attached to the 2nd Battalion, [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]] in [[British Raj|India]] from 13 March 1937, and subsequently transferred to that regiment 27 April 1938 (never joining the Indian Army) so that he would be able to continue his hobbies of [[tiger hunting]] and [[pig sticking]].<ref name=sax /><ref>October 1937 Indian Army List</ref><ref>London Gazette 26 April 1938</ref>

==Second World War==
When the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out, Digby was not initially sent to fight in Europe. His sister Kit served in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] and was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945 (France)|French Croix de guerre]] while serving with the [[Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit|Hadfield-Spears Unit]]. Upon hearing of his brother John's death at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in late 1942 with the [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)|2nd Dragoon Guards, The Queen's Bays]], Digby volunteered for the [[airborne forces]] and transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]]. He was appointed as the [[company commander]] of A Company of the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd Parachute Battalion]], part of the [[1st Parachute Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Parachute Brigade]] of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|1st Airborne Division]]. He was stationed in [[Grantham]], Lincolnshire during training. His tiger hunting exploits were well known, and his reputation was enhanced as he was able to obtain the use of an American [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]] aeroplane in which he flew all the company officers in the camp to London for a party at [[The Ritz London Hotel|the Ritz]].<ref name=sax />

A Company was then chosen by the battalion's [[commanding officer]], [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Frost (British Army officer)|John Dutton Frost]], to lead the 2nd Parachute Battalion in the [[Battle of Arnhem]], part of [[Operation Market Garden]], because of Digby's reputation of being an aggressive commander. In preparation Digby, concerned about the unreliability of radios, educated his men on how to use [[bugle calls]] that had been used during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] for communication in case the radios failed. He also took an umbrella with his kit as a means of identification because he had trouble remembering passwords and felt that anyone who saw him with it would think that "only a bloody fool of an Englishman" would carry an umbrella into battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/family/bunburyfamily_lisnavagh/bunburyfamily_lisnavagh_hcmassy.html |title='The Major' Hugh Caruthers Massy (1914–1987)|publisher=Turtle Bunbury |date= |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>

A Company were dropped away from the target of [[John Frost Bridge|Arnhem Bridge]] and had to go through [[Arnhem]] where the streets were blocked by German forces. Digby led his men through the back gardens of nearby houses instead of attempting to advance through the streets and thus avoided the Germans.<ref name=peg /> Digby and A Company managed to travel 8 miles in 7 hours while also taking prisoner 150 German soldiers including members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. During the battle, Digby wore his [[red beret]] instead of a helmet and waved his umbrella while walking about the defences despite heavy mortar fire. When the Germans started using tanks to cross the bridge, Digby led a [[bayonet charge]] against them wearing a [[bowler hat]]. He later disabled a German [[armored car (military)|armoured car]] with his umbrella, incapacitating the driver by shoving the umbrella through the car's observational slit and poking the driver in the eye.<ref name=peg />

Digby then noticed the [[Military chaplain|chaplain]] pinned down by enemy fire while trying to cross the street to get to injured soldiers. Digby got to him and said "Don't worry about the bullets, I've got an umbrella". He then escorted the chaplain across the street under his umbrella. When he returned to the front line, one of his fellow officers said about his umbrella that "that thing won't do you any good", to which Digby replied "Oh my goodness Pat, but what if it rains?"<ref name=mam>{{cite book | first =Jon E. | last =Lewis  | title =The Mammoth Book of Heroes| publisher = Constable & Robinson | location =  | year = 2012| isbn = 1780337256 | chapter = Obituary: Digby Tatham-Warter}}</ref> Digby was later injured by shrapnel, which also cut open the rear of his trousers but continued to fight until A Company had run out of ammunition. Despite the radios being unreliable as Digby had predicted and the bugle calls being used most in the battle, the message "out of ammo, God save The King" was radioed out before Digby was captured.<ref>{{cite book | first =Allan | last =Mallinson  | title = The Making of the British Army| publisher = Random House | location =  | year = 2009| isbn = 1409085813 | page = 488}}</ref>

Because of his injury, Digby was sent to St Elizabeth's Hospital but escaped out of a window with his second in command Captain Tony Frank, when the German nurses had left them alone. After creating an escape compass from buttons on his uniform, Digby and Frank headed towards Mariendaal. Upon arriving, they were hidden by a Dutch woman who spoke no English before being put in contact with her neighbour. He disguised them as painters and moved them to Derk Wildeboer's house. Wildeboer was a local leader of the [[Dutch Resistance]] in [[Ede, Netherlands|Ede]]. They then met Menno de Nooy of the Dutch Resistance who gave them a bicycle. Wildeboer had a fake [[Dutch identity card]] made for Digby to allow him to pose as Peter Jensen, a [[deaf-mute]] son of a lawyer.<ref name=peg /> Digby used the bicycle to visit fellow soldiers in hiding and the Germans did not recognise him despite him helping to push a Nazi staff car out of a ditch and German soldiers being billeted in the same house that he was staying in.<ref name=peg /> Digby then gathered 150 escaped soldiers to head towards the front line. This was known as [[Operation Pegasus]]. Digby and the soldiers cycled to the [[Rhine]] and Digby flashed a [[V sign|V for Victory]] sign using [[Morse Code]] with his [[flashlight|torch]]. Members of [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] then ferried them across the river. Upon return to the United Kingdom, Digby was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref name=mam />

== Post-Second World War ==
After the war ended, Digby served in British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]] before being appointed to the 5th [[King's African Rifles]] in [[British Kenya]] in 1946, where he also bought two estates in [[Eburru]] and [[Nanyuki]].<ref name=peg /> During the [[Mau Mau Uprising]], Digby raised a volunteer mounted police force at his own expense and led them into battle against the [[Mau Mau]].<ref name=sax /> After that, he retired to run his estates. He also created the concept of the modern [[safari]] where animals would be photographed rather than hunted.<ref name=sax /> During [[Kenyan independence]], it is reported that the British Defence staff told the [[British High Commissioner]] to "look after Tatham-Warter".<ref name=sax />

==Death==
Digby died in Nanyuki on 21 March 1993.<ref name=mam />

==In popular culture==
Tatham-Warter served as the inspiration for the character of Major Harry Carlyle, who likewise carried an umbrella into battle, in the 1977 film ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]''. The role was played by [[Christopher Good]]. Although Tatham-Warter survived the Second World War, Carlyle is depicted as being a casualty of the Battle of Arnhem.
