==Life==
The only son of John Rae (1677–1754), a barber-surgeon with a background in [[Stirlingshire]], he was born in [[Edinburgh]]. In 1741 he was apprenticed to the surgeon Robert Hope, on whose death he was apprenticed to George Lauder. After passing four examinations he became, on 27 August 1747,  a Freeman (Fellow) of the [[Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite | title=List of fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh: from the year 1581 to 31st December 1873 | url=https://archive.org/details/b21465812 | year=1874 | publisher=Royal College of Surgens of Edinburgh | accessdate=4 March 2018 }}</ref> In 1764–5 he filled the office of [[List of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Deacon or President]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Rae, James|volume=47}}</ref>

Rae was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] on 7 July 1766. There he gave practical discourses on cases of importance. In October 1776 his fellow surgeons made a determined attempt to found a professorship of surgery in the [[University of Edinburgh]], and to appoint Rae the first professor. They were defeated by [[Alexander Monro (secundus)|Alexander Monro]] ''secundus'', who then managed persuade the authorities to convert his own chair of anatomy into one of anatomy and surgery, despite the fact that he had never been a practising surgeon.<ref name="DNB"/>

Rae did in Edinburgh what [[Percivall Pott]] did in London, in establishing the teaching of clinical surgery. In 1772 he asked the College of Surgeons to "recognise and support a course of lectures on the whole art of surgery..."<ref name="Miles, A. 1918 p79">Miles, A. (1918). The Edinburgh School of Surgery before Lister ;London: A. & C. Black. p79</ref> The College readily agreed and recommended their apprentices to attend the course.

From 1764 Rae had also gave lectures on diseases of the teeth.<ref>Minutes Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. 24 January 1764</ref> Boyes claims that this was the first course of lectures in dentistry to be given in Britain.<ref>Boyes,J (1953)  ''James Rae'' Proc Roy Soc Med  Volume: 46 issue: 6, page(s): 457-460. https://doi.org/10.1177/003591575304600612</ref> He established a reputation as a dentist and was "among the first, (if not the first) in Edinburgh to rescue that department from the ignorant and unskilled hands in which it was then placed."<ref name="Miles, A. 1918 p79"/>

Rae married, in 1744, Isobel, daughter of Ludovic Cant of Thurstan. By her he had two sons and several daughters. The elder son William joined the Incorporation of Surgeons on 18 July 1777, settled in London, where he married Isabella, sister of [[Robert Dallas]], and died young. John, the younger brother, was one of the  first fellows of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], where he was admitted on 14 March 1781. He became President in 1804–5, and, like his father, was known as a dentist. He died in 1808. Among Rae's daughters were: Elizabeth Keir, who founded the Institution for the Relief of Incurables; Elizabeth (Isabella), mother of [[Marjorie Fleming]]; and Margaret, mother of [[William Fettes]].<ref name="DNB"/><ref>{{cite ODNB|id=9376|title=Fettes, Sir William|first=Alexia|last=Lindsay}}</ref>
