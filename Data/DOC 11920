[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The first three sources should be formatted as well. The ref checks out ok, and I’ll AGF the offline sources. Article is new enough (created April 28, 2014), long enough (5875 characters of prose). The picture checks out ok as well. However, there are a few grammatical errors that will need to be fixed. “After creating an escape compass from buttons on his uniform, Digby and Frank headed towards Mariendaal where they were hidden by a Dutch woman who spoke no English before being put in contact with her neighbour who disguised them as painters and moved to the leader of the Dutch Resistance, Bill Wildeboor's house.” This sentence runs on and on and is quite confusing. There are a few instances like this in the article.

::Hiya. I appreciated that Diva is already reviewing this, but I'm going to raise a quick concern if this is to appear on DYK. The use of a children's 'choose your own adventure' book isn't really appropriate as a source (Arnhem EDGE).

:::I was using the factual part where it says what really happened. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 07:09, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::I appreciate that might be the case, but it doesn't make it any more reliable. For instance, the last radio message is frequently mentioned in sources on the Battle of Arnhem, but they themselves admit that it is 'recalled' by German forces; it was not picked by the Allies. There's certainly no suggestion in any of them that Digby sent the message. A children's adventure book just isn't a reliable source.

:::::As a further illustration of the problems with using a children's book; Tatham-Warter and Frost were not in the same hospital. Frost was immediately removed to Germany and after a short stay in a German hospital, ended up in a POW camp.

[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] It seems that the issues brought up have been fixed. Good to go.
