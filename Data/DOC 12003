'''Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl Ferrers''' (22 June 1677 – 14 April 1729), styled '''Hon. Washington Shirley''' until 1714 and '''Viscount Tamworth''' from 1714 to 1717, was a British nobleman and soldier.

The second but first surviving son of [[Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers]] (by his first wife, Elizabeth Washington), he matriculated at [[Trinity College, Oxford]] in 1693. In 1697, he was commissioned an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[Coldstream Guards]]. He left the regiment at some time after 1702.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Mackinnon |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Mackinnon |title=Origin and Services of the Coldstream Guards |volume=II |publisher=Richard Bentley |location=London |year=1833 |page=468 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WJCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA468}}</ref> From 1713 until 1715, he sat for [[Fore (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Fore]] in Ireland, apparently on his wife's interest. Upon the death of his nephew [[Robert Shirley, Viscount Tamworth]] in 1714, he adopted that title as [[heir apparent]] to his father. He succeeded to the earldom in 1717, but the estates were much diminished by his stepmother's [[jointure]] and bequests to his brothers and half-brothers.

He had married Mary Levinge (d. January 1740), daughter of [[Sir Richard Levinge, 1st Baronet]], around 1704. They had three daughters:
*Lady Elizabeth Shirley (1704 – 17 August 1734), married [[Joseph Gascoigne Nightingale]] and had issue. A remarkable monument to the couple exists in [[Westminster Abbey]].
*[[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Lady Selina Shirley]] (1707–1791), married [[Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon]]
*Lady Mary Shirley (25 September 1712 – 12 August 1784), married [[Thomas Needham, 9th Viscount Kilmorey]], without issue

Appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire|Lord Lieutenant]] and [[Custos Rotulorum of Staffordshire]] in 1725, he died in 1729. The earldom, for lack of male issue, passed to his brother [[Henry Shirley, 3rd Earl Ferrers|Henry]], a lunatic.
