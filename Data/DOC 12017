[[Scott Yanow]] of [[AllMusic]] states "Bassist Sam Jones' recordings as a leader have generally been underrated, but virtually every one is well-planned and recommended... The solos are colorful and purposeful, the material fairly diverse, and the results consistently swinging yet rarely predictable".<ref name="Allmusic">Yanow, S., [http://www.allmusic.com/album/changes-things-mw0001879779 Allmusic Review] accessed April 28, 2014</ref>
