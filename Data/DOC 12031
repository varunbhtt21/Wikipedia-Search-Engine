Title : Wikipedia:Top 25 Report/April 13 to 19, 2014
Text : =Top 25 Report: Most Popular Wikipedia Articles of the Week (April 13 to 19, 2014)=

← [[Wikipedia:Top 25 Report/April 6 to 12|Last week's report]] – [[Wikipedia:Top 25 Report/April 20 to 26, 2014|Next week's Report]] →

''Summary:'' If I were the kind of person who made snap judgments based on flimsy evidence, I'd say our readership is in a funk. Compare this week's [[Easter]] queries to [[Wikipedia:Top 25 Report/March 24 to 30, 2013|last year's]]; they're down by 50%. Also, compare this week's "[[The Lion and the Rose|Purple Wedding]]" on ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', which saw the death by poisoning of that loathsome sprog [[Joffrey Baratheon]], to [[Wikipedia:Top25/June 2 to 8 2013|last year's "Red Wedding]]", down by ≈40%. It's a recurring trend; the Golden Globes, the Oscars and several other annual events are noticeably lower in the rankings from last year. Are people just not able to summon the necessary enthusiasm? Although the barrage of worrisome news appears to have faded from the list this week, perhaps its cumulative weariness has had an impact. The high position for anniversary of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], a topic of interest mainly to British readers and so not usually likely to reach the top 25, shows that our readers are in a mood of sombre reflection. One counter-trend to the overall slump is [[Reddit]], which has seen seven topics in the last two weeks.  

For the week of April 13 to 19, the 25 most popular articles on Wikipedia, as determined from the report of the [[User:West.andrew.g/Popular pages|5,000 most viewed pages]], were:

|Well, it took a week, but ''Game of Thrones'' is back on top. Could it have something to do with [[Joffrey Baratheon|a certain homicidal brat]] getting his [[The Lion and the Rose#In King's Landing|long overdue comeuppance]]?

|[[File:Wüger Kreuzigung.jpg|left|100x100px]]
|It's Easter week this week, and it seems people were more drawn to its dark side this year, the day that commemorates ("celebrates" isn't really the word) the torture and crucifixion ([[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]) of Jesus Christ, as opposed to Easter Sunday (below) which celebrates his [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]].

|[[File:Hillsborough Memorial, Anfield.jpg|left|100x100px]]
|The worst football disaster in British history, in which [[human crush]] led to the death of 96 spectators and the injury of nearly 800 more, got some often vociferous attention during the week of its 25th anniversary on 15 April, with some questioning whether the steps taken to prevent its recurrence have inflicted more harm than intended.

|[[File:Victory over the Grave.jpg|left|100x100px]]  
|It's hard to remember these days, under the onslaught of bunnies, chocolate eggs and marshmallow peeps, that Easter, not Christmas, is the most sacred date of the Christian calendar. Doubtless a lot of people learned that this week, along with some fairly eye-raising information about the events it actually celebrates.

|[[File:Heartbleed.svg|left|100x100px]]
|Despite its virus-y name, this isn't a virus; it is a [[security bug]] in the "[[Heartbeat (computing)|heartbeat]]" (basically a repeated "Is All Well?" signal) in the [[OpenSSL]] program, which is widely used to provide security for internet sites. It is estimated to have affected 17 percent of all sites using the program, which spooked Netizens en masse this week as they rushed to change their potentially compromised passwords.

|[[File:Göbekli Tepe, Urfa.jpg|left|100x100px]]
|Southeastern Turkey is home to some of the earliest known urban settlements in the world; so old we don't have names for the people who built them. The Göbekli Tepe site features ritualistic structures that may be as much as 12,000 years old, as pointed out in a thread on [[Reddit]] this week.

||[[File:Amazon.com-Logo.svg|left|100x100px]] 
|This article has been veering wildly (and suspiciously) around the view graph for several weeks, but at least now its presence on the list has a reason: [[Amazon Fire TV]], announced this week, is a digital streaming device to watch online content on a HDTV. How it distinguishes itself from the three or four other such devices currently on the market is a matter of some dispute.

|[[File:Gabriel Garcia Marquez.jpg|left|100x100px]]
| The [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning [[Colombia]]n author of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' and ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'', who introduced [[magic realism]] to the wider world, died this week at the age of 87, receiving eulogies from across the globe.

|[[File:Joffrey Baratheon Flag.png|left|100x100px]]
|[[George R. R. Martin]]'s still unfinished (hint hint, George) tale of dynastic struggle in a [[fantasy world]] has reappeared in the top 25 in the wake the current fourth season of its TV adaptation, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

|align="right"|331,947
|[[File:The Amazing Spider-Man 2 2014-04-05 18-17.png|left|100x100px]] 
|It's not surprising that this was released in foreign markets before its home territory; the original ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' made $822 million worldwide, with the domestic and international grosses split roughly 50/50. The rebooted ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (film)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (this film's predecessor) made $752 million worldwide, but with international grosses now comprising 2/3 the total. This radical shift in Hollywood's biosphere has taken place in just a decade, and it is already altering hunting strategies, for good or ill; even after just one week in a few small territories, this movie has already made $47 million.

|[[File:Lunar eclipse April 15 2014 California Alfredo Garcia Jr1.jpg|left|100x100px]] 
|Lunar eclipses are not uncommon (there will be [[Tetrad (astronomy)|three more]] before the end of next year) but the fact that for this one totality was visible from the United States probably accounts for its added Wiki-popularity.

|Disney's Oscar-winning juggernaut got a shot in the arm thanks to its release on DVD on March 18. Despite this, it has already overtaken ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' as Disney's highest-grossing film in theatres.

|I don't normally go for one-day spikes, but this one had a (very small) additional bump and happened to coincide with the onetime ''[[Blackadder]]'' star and erstwhile [[Doctor House]]'s debut [[bluesman]] concert in [[New Zealand]].

|This massacre conducted by Japanese troops during their [[Japanese invasion of China|invasion of China]] in 1937 is also known as the "Rape of Nanking". That isn't a metaphor; up to 20,000 women were raped, and often subsequently murdered or brutally mutilated, as discussed on a Reddit thread this week.

|[[File:N.E.R.D @ Pori Jazz 2010 - Pharrell Williams 1.jpg|left|100x100px]]
|The seven-time [[Grammy]] winner got into the news this week thanks to a [[YouTube]] video of [[British Muslims]] dancing to his hit [[Motown]] riff "[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]". The video has topped 1.2 million views and has spawned copies across the world. Despite overwhelmingly positive reaction, certain killjoys in the Islamic community still felt the need to declare the video ''[[haram]]'', or blasphemous, presumably because it showed people being happy.

* Number of views needed to reach Top 25 this week: 275,436. Last week: 284,259.

==Exclusions==

* This list excludes the Wikipedia main page, non-article pages (such as redlinks), and anomalous entries (such as DDoS attacks or likely automated views). Please keep in mind that the explanations given for these articles' popularity are, fundamentally, guesses. Just because I can't find a reason for an article to be included doesn't mean there isn't one; conversely, just  because a plausible reason is found for a view spike, that doesn't mean it wasn't due to a bot. 

*There are a number of articles that reappear frequently in the top 25 for no determined reason, and have been excluded as likely being due to automated views. Please feel free to discuss any removal on the talk page if you wish.

** [[Java]]/[[JOP]]: Since both of these articles are tied (verbally at least) to the [[Java (programming language)|programming language]], it seems likely that this is a bot searching for that. 
** [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]]: I'll believe that [[Climategate]] was #1 during a typhoon, but that it got more hits than [[Thanksgiving]] on Thanksgiving? No. 
** [[IPv6]]: I have to face facts; I allowed this into the top 25 for months as it is the kind of issue that would appeal to web denizens (ala [[Bitcoin]]) but its insane popularity is just too high explain by human interest alone. It's getting help. 
** [[Ddd]]: Hello? Spambot here. Just checking in. 
** [[History of Bălţi]]: There is simply no logical way to explain the sudden rise of this hyper-obscure article except as the result of a traffic-checking botnet, à la [[cat anatomy]]
** [[Alive]]/[[Alive!]]: Links to disambigs with no apparent reason for being. 

*Specific exclusions this week:

**[[Off-the-Record Messaging]]:  Obscure technical topics frequently suddenly rocket to the top briefly for no apparent reason, only to just as suddenly disappear, never being seen again
**[[Lexus LFA]]: suspicious one-day spike.
