"'''Eez-eh'''" (stylised as "'''eez-eh'''") is a song by English rock band [[Kasabian]] from their fifth studio album, ''[[48:13]]''. The song was released as the lead single to promote the album<ref name="NME">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/kasabian/76964 |title=Kasabian announce 'stripped back' new album, '48:13' – full details |work=[[NME]] |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> on 29 April 2014.

==Composition==
The single embraces a slight change in style for Kasabian, with the track resembling electronic dance music – more so than their previous work. In an interview, Sergio Pizzorno revealed that the song's production was inspired by [[Giorgio Moroder]], who had said 120BPM was a 'magic tempo'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/nme-video/kasabian-eez-eh-is-an-invite-to-a-whole-other-world/3515272827001 |title=Kasabian: '{{'}}Eez-Eh' Is An Invite To A Whole Other World video |work=[[NME]] |accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref> The song title is derived from the pronunciation of the word 'easy' in a [[Leicester]] accent. Frontman Tom Meighan described the song as a "working class anthem" and said he would like the song to have the same effect on people as "[[Born Slippy .NUXX|Born Slippy]]", a well-known 1996 number two single by electronic group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/kasabian/news/tom-eez-eh-is-like-born-slippy-but-better/ |title=Kasabian: eez-eh is like Born Slippy but better |publisher=[[XFM]] |accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>

Commenting on the song's lyrics – which include lines such as "I've got the feeling that I'm gonna keep you up all night – Pizzorno said: "It's more a conversation that me and Tom [Meighan] might have at five or six in the morning. There have been so many nights in hotel rooms where me and Tom will stay up all night talking and it's about that."<ref name="NME Daly">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/eez-eh-track-review-have-kasabian-still-got-it |title='Eez-Eh' Track Review: Have Kasabian Still Got It? |first=Rhian |last=Daly |work=[[NME]] |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>

==Reception==
According to ''[[NME]]'' magazine, the song is "pure '90s [[Rave music|rave]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/various-artists/15251 |title=20 Tracks You Have To Hear This Week (23/4/2014) |work=[[NME]] |date=22 April 2014 |accessdate=7 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705183819/http://www.nme.com/reviews/various-artists/15251 |archive-date=5 July 2014 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> Rhian Daly also noted that the track is "far from being a serious take on the world's issues," and Kasabian keeps things "tongue-in-cheek, cartoon-like and – most importantly – fun."<ref name="NME Daly"/>
