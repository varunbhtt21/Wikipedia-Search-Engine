The result was '''No consensus'''. Article needs to be moved to a better title and needs cleanup, but that is not for AfD to discuss/decide. Merge as suggested by {{u|Colapeninsula}} is also an option, but that is also something that can be decided on the article's talk page.

*'''Delete''' as ''very'' discriminate crufty bollocks. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 12:05, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::I call that indiscriminate per [[WP:DISCRIMINATE]] because it just looks like a random list of songs pertaining to Hurricane Katrina. Some of them don't even have articles!--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 12:24, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Mainly non-notable songs/artists. And now to play "Rock Me Like a Hurricane" while I watch that [[Sideshow Bob]] episode. '''[[User:Lugnuts|<font color="002bb8">Lugnuts</font>]]''' <sup>[[User talk:Lugnuts|Dick Laurent is dead]]</sup> 17:47, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''.  Actually this is quite a good list-article topic and/or a category.  Per the guideline [[wp:CLT]], categories and lists and navigation templates are mutually supportive.  I expect that sources will exist clearly to support the individual items, and the topic of the category also.  I see no assertion of [[wp:BEFORE]] being met;  the nom is merely, well, an ass-ertion of bollocks.... :) --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 01:22, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per doncram.  A better title would be nice, but I can't think of one. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 03:04, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per above - Non notable <s>cruft</s> shite. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 16:59, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. I don't see any of the references (such as some of them are) mentioning the charity aspect at all. Only one or two even make the unsourced claim. They're all works ''about'' the disaster. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 01:35, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*:Yes I think it should be renamed to '''List of Hurricane Katrina-themed songs''' or similar, as I agree it is not documented that origianlly listed songs or those added by my contributions are actually charity songs.  It is a notable topic, though, with numerous sources about the set of songs, IMHO.  About a Requested Move that is for Talk page discussion, not AFD. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 03:58, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
'''Comment'''.  Searching within Wikipedia on "List of songs about" brings me to a lot of similar list-articles, e.g. [[List of songs about the Vietnam War]], and many more, generally within [[:Category:Lists of songs about a topic]] (category which I just added to the list-article).  This is a fine list-article topic, there are enough songs to make a substantial list, and there is coverage specifically on the topic of songs about Katrina.  I voted "Keep" further above, already. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 23:00, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Delete.''' Inherently biased. Implies the ol' "''appeal to pathos''" and [[WP:SOAPBOX|Wikipedia is not soapbox or means of promotion.]] --[[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 02:20, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' A large percentage of songs are unreferenced, the songs listed as being critical of the response could potentially be considered libelious if no reference has been cited to back up this claim. [[User:Amortias|Amortias]] ([[User talk:Amortias|T]])([[Special:Contributions/Amortias|C]]) 20:50, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. A notable event that has a large amount of songs written about/for it. Article needs work, but that's not a reason to delete. Could also use a better title, as someone stated above. —&nbsp;[[User:Status|<span title="User page" style="color:black;">Status</span>]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Status|<span title="Talk">talk</span>]] · [[Special:Contributions/Status|<span title="Contribs">contribs</span>]]) 22:43, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Weak keep''' There's an argument for notability of the topic.[http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2010/08/the_top_five_hurricane_katrina.php][http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/08/28/f-katrina-new-orleans-hip-hop-remembers-hurricane/][http://www.avclub.com/article/after-the-deluge-29-remarkable-works-inspired-by-h-60684] Notable songs for charity/fundraising/awareness could be merged to [[Hurricane Katrina disaster relief#Cultural and sporting responses]]. Notable songs criticising response could be merged to [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina]]. Article is currently in poor state and non-notable, unreferenced songs should be removed; but keeping would allow clean-up and consideration whether to merge. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 13:52, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' and clean up/merge as {{U|Colapeninsula}} suggests.  The current list isn't good, but given that musical responses were a significant part of the cultural response to Katrina, this is a better approach than deletion. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 14:06, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
