== Company history ==

[[Aquafadas]], a company working on creative software for Flash, HTML5, photo, and video editing, created the application MyComics to allow the reading of comics on mobile in 2006.

This application was made available in 2008, to enable the reading and storing of comics on iPhone and iPod Touch. A reading system adapted to low resolution screens was also available. In October of the same year, the company launched a comics library on both devices, in partnership with the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]], [[Fnac]] and [[SNCF]]. This library included the official selection of the festival, and was downloaded over 150 000 times.

In December 2008 "The Adventures of Lucky Luke n°3", at {{Interlanguage link multi|Lucky Comics (publisher)|fr|3=Lucky Comics|lt=Lucky Comics}} was published on both devices. The comic made a 50 000 € turnover. In April 2009, "Les Blondes" 10th volume was the top-selling comic for 10 months on the AppStore.

After, in August 2009, the AveComics application was launched on iPhone, iPod Touch and [[BlackBerry]]. The company's website was launched in September when more than 100 titles were available on smartphones and computers.
