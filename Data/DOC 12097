'''[[Wells Cathedral]]''' is a [[Church of England]] place of worship in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], [[Somerset]] dedicated to [[St Andrew the Apostle]], and is the seat of the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]]. The present building dates from 1175 to 1490, an earlier church having been built on the site in 705. With its broad west front and large central tower, it is the dominant feature of its small [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]] and a landmark in the Somerset countryside. The architecture of the cathedral presents a harmonious whole which is entirely [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and mostly in a single style, the [[Early English Gothic]] of the late 12th and early 13th centuries. In this Wells differs from most other English medieval cathedrals, which have parts in the earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architectural style. Unlike the many English [[Cathedral#Late Middle Ages: monastic and secular cathedrals|cathedrals of monastic foundation]], Wells has an exceptional number of surviving secular buildings associated with its chapter of [[Canon (priest)|secular canons]], such as the [[Bishop's Palace, Wells|Bishop's Palace]] and the [[Vicars' Close, Wells|Vicars' Close]], a residential street which has remained intact from the 15th century. The cathedral is a [[scheduled monument]] and is designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade I [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed building]]. {{TFAFULL|Wells Cathedral}}
