'''''14 - Diaries of the Great War''''' (titled ''Great War Diaries'' when aired on the [[BBC]]) is a 2014 international documentary drama series about [[World War I]]. It uses a mix of acted scenes, archive footage, and animation. All episodes were directed by [[Jan Peter]], series authors were Jan Peter and [[Yury Winterberg]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/6694/2470168/-14-tagebuecher-des-ersten-weltkriegs-drehstart-zu-einzigartigem-filmprojekt-am-13-mai-im-elsass|title=Drehstart zu einzigartigem Filmprojekt am 13. Mai im Elsass|publisher=Pressemitteilung vom|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> In a dramatic advisory capacity, Dutch producer and screenwriter [[Maarten van der Duin]] and BBC-author [[Andrew Bampfield]] worked on the film's development. The series is based on an idea by [[Gunnar Dedio]], producer at the film company [[LOOKSfilm]] and Ulrike Dotzer, the Head of Department [[Arte|ARTE]] at [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]].

== Story ==
The individual episodes of the series tell the story of the First World War, not from the perspective of politicians and the military; but from the perspective of soldiers, housewives, factory workers, nurses and children. In total there are 14 main characters. Meaningful scenes from their lives are re-enacted and intertwined. The result is not only a political or military history of the First World War, but a story that poignantly captures the feelings and moods of the people.

Overall, the selection of the diaries and subsequent development work took four years.

In her very personal letters to Paul she writes about her jealousy and her great desire for intimacy, tenderness and a child. Later the couple give birth to a son.

In the spring of 1915, the 22-year-old travelled with a ship full of volunteers who wanted to fight for their original homeland. In Europe, however, the fighting caused D'Aquila to have psychological issues. After the initial enthusiasm, D’Aquila was taken by disillusionment of a war that manifested itself in all its atrocity. He was forcibly consigned to a mental hospital with poor conditions characteristic of the time period, most particularly suspicion from the doctors that he was faking his issues to avoid the front. D'Aquila died on 26 April 1975 at the age of 82 years<ref>V. D'Aquila, ''Io, pacifista in trincea. Un italoamericano nella Grande guerra'', a cura di C. Staiti, prefazione di E.
