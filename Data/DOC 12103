Title : Metropolis of Nicaea
Text : The '''Metropolis of Nicaea''' ({{lang-el|Μητρόπολις Νικαίας}}), was an ecclesiastical province (since the mid-4th century a [[metropolitan bishop]]ric) of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in the city of [[Nicaea]] in the province of [[Bithynia]] (now [[Iznik]] in [[Turkey]]). A prestigious see due to its proximity to the [[Byzantine]] capital, [[Constantinople]], and the location of two [[Ecumenical Councils]] in 325 and 787, the metropolitan see of Nicaea remained important until its conquest by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1331. The Christian element in the diocese diminished rapidly after that, with the flight of the Greek population and the [[Islamization]] of the remainder. As a result, the seat of the diocese was moved to [[Cius]]. The metropolis remained active until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in the early 1920s. It remains a [[titular see]] of the Patriarchate of Constantinople as well as being, since the mid-15th century, a [[Nicaea (titular see)|titular archbishopric]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

== History ==
[[Nicaea]] was an important and prosperous city in [[Late Antiquity]], and its local church flourished as a result. The [[First Ecumenical Council]] was held in the city in 325, and under Emperor [[Valens]] (r. 364–378), the local see was removed from the purview of its neighbour and rival, [[See of Nicomedia|Nicomedia]], and raised to the status of a separate [[metropolitan bishop|metropolis]].{{sfn|Foss|1991|pp=1463–1464}} In the fifth century it took three [[suffragan]]s from the jurisdiction of Nicomedia, and later six. In 787 a second Ecumenical Council (the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council|Seventh]]) was held there, ending the first period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]].<ref name="CE">{{Cite CE1913 | wstitle = Nicaea | first = S. | last = Vailhé}}</ref> In the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' from the 8th to the 15th centuries, Nicaea steadily occupies the eighth place in the metropolitan sees subject to the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].{{sfn|Nesbitt|Oikonomides|1996|p=104}} 

The city remained important throughout the middle Byzantine period (7th–12th centuries). Following the rebellion of [[Nikephoros Melissenos]], his Turkish allies captured the city in 1081, and it became the first capital of the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk Turkish]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] until its [[Siege of Nicaea|recapture]] by the [[First Crusade]] in 1097.{{sfn|Foss|1991|pp=1463–1464}}<ref name="CE"/> After the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|capture]] of Constantinople and the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204), the city became the capital of the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and the seat of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in exile until the [[recapture of Constantinople]] in 1261.{{sfn|Foss|1991|pp=1463–1464}} Among the 46 bishops recorded by [[Le Quien]] (''Oriens Christianus'', Vol. I, 639–56), the most notable are: [[Theognis of Nicaea|Theognis]], the first known bishop, excommunicated in 325; Anastasius in the 6th century; Peter, [[Theophanes the Branded]], [[Ignatios the Deacon]] and [[Gregory Asbestas]] in the 9th century; [[Eustratius of Nicaea|Eustratius]] in the early 12th century; and [[Basilios Bessarion]] in the 15th century.<ref name="CE"/>

The city was captured, after a [[Siege of Nicaea (1328–31)|long siege]], by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1331.{{sfn|Foss|1991|pp=1463–1464}} The long resistance of the city, as well as the exodus of its Greek Orthodox population to still Byzantine-controlled lands and the rapid Islamization that followed the conquest (the phenomenon of [[crypto-Christianity]] notwithstanding) quickly diminished the Greek Orthodox element in the population.{{sfn|Moustakas|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=5527&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_1 1. Πρώιμη οθωμανική περίοδος]}} Already in 1354, when [[Gregory Palamas]] visited the city, he found the local Christian population much depleted,{{sfn|Foss|1991|pp=1463–1464}} and in a partial census of Nicaea itself dating to 1454/5, only seven Christian households are recorded.{{sfn|Moustakas|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=5527&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_1 1. Πρώιμη οθωμανική περίοδος]}} Although the entire region of Bithynia suffered a sharp decline in the numbers of its Christian element during and after the Ottoman conquest, throughout the early Ottoman period the Patriarchate retained active all of its Byzantine-era metropolises—apart from Nicaea also Nicomedia, [[Metropolis of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] and [[Metropolis of Prussa|Prussa]]—a number totally disproportionate to the demographic realities on the ground. Apart from the desire to maintain in existence historical and prestigious sees like Nicaea, this practice was most likely the result of their proximity to the seat of the Patriarchate in Constantinople, which allowed their bishops to both administer their dioceses and play an active role in the central administration of the Church. This practice became formalized in the 18th century, when the bishops of the dioceses closest to Constantinople (i.e. Bithynia and [[Eastern Thrace]]), who typically resided in the Ottoman capital and were members of the Patriarchate's permanent synod, were elevated to "Elder" (γέροντες) metropolitans and formed a group with the power to check and counsel the Patriarchs.{{sfn|Moustakas|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=5527&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_2 2. Η καθιέρωση της αρχής του γεροντισμού]}}

Nevertheless, as a result of the scarcity of the Christian element in Nicaea itself the seat of the metropolis was moved to the nearby port of [[Cius]], whose local archbishopric was consequently abolished. The date of the transfer is unknown, but may have been as early as the late 14th century. The local church of the Dormition (or Theotokos Pazariotissa, as it was known) served as the cathedral of the metropolis at least since its renovation in 1692.{{sfn|Moustakas|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=5527&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_3 3.

The metropolis experienced a revival in late Ottoman times, as a result of the general demographic upswing of the Orthodox (not just Greek) population in this period. By the early 20th century, it encompassed 26 parishes, including Greek-speaking, Armenian-speaking and [[Karamanlides|Turkish-speaking]] Christians. According to the (not always reliable) pre-[[World War I]] census of the Patriarchate, the metropolis encompassed 33,470 people.{{sfn|Moustakas|2003|loc=[http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=5527&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_4 4.
