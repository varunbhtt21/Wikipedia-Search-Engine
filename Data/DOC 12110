==Plot==
Emilia-Romagna, Italy, early seventies. A Unesco agent discovers that blood is contained in a bottle of wine produced by a well-known Italian winery. A couple of hippies in their wanderings come across Antonio who accompanies them to the villa where he lives with his sister and brother-in-law. In the sumptuous house the two young men meet strange characters: a gypsy woman, a prostitute and a disquieting drunkard. The landlord, Michelino Croci, reassures them by saying that he is only a wine producer and loves to host strange people. In reality, Mr. Antonio is a madman who created a mechanism, a sort of robot capable of sucking blood from human bodies.

==Style==
Italian film critic and historian Roberto Curti described the film as mixing elements from the gothic genre, the thriller and a little bit of science fiction.{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=100}}

==Production==
Shortly after the release of director Riccardo Ghione's previous film ''A cuore freddo'', Ghione was working on his next film titled ''Vampiro 2000'' which was shot in the village of [[Fiorenzuola d'Arda]].{{sfn|Curti|2018|p=77}} Ghione announced a different film during this period, an adaptation of ''Il male oscuro'', the autobiography by [[Giuseppe Berto]], which never came to fruition.{{sfn|Curti|2018|p=78}} ''Vampiro 2000'' eventually became retitled as ''Il pratto macchiato di rosso''.{{sfn|Curti|2018|p=78}}

==Release==
''Il pratto macchiato di rosso'' was distributed theatrically in Italy by Drago Film and had its premiere on 2 March 1973 in Fiorenzuola d'Arda.{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=100}}{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=102}} The film grossed a total of 56,364,000 [[Italian lire]] domestically on its initial release.{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=100}} According to Curti, after the film's release it vanished into obscurity to only be brought back to attention on a home video release around 2017.{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=102}} 

==Reception==
Curti declared that ''Il prato macchiato di rosso'' retained a small level of notoriety in the village of [[Fiorenzuola]] where the memory of the shooting of the film remained vivid still in 2018.{{sfn|Curti|2018|p=80}}
