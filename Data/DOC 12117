Non-notable boxer does not meet [[WP:NBOX]] or [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:PRehse|Peter Rehse]] ([[User talk:PRehse|talk]]) 09:32, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per substantial coverage in reliable independent sources such as [http://sports.yahoo.com/news/douglin-doesn-t-deny-da-132300949--box.html here]. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 20:55, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::That article is about his mother and the novelty of a female boxing trainer, especially one with a regular job.[[User:Mdtemp|Mdtemp]] ([[User talk:Mdtemp|talk]]) 16:16, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::That article is just one example, and it's about the boxer and his relationship with his mother as the article title, the photo and the article itself make clear. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 17:12, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::That article is referenced in the article but it and the other references are not enough to show notability (substantial coverage).  It was in effect a human interest piece.[[User:PRehse|Peter Rehse]] ([[User talk:PRehse|talk]]) 17:25, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Fails [[WP:NBOX]] and notability is not inherited from your mother.  His Golden Gloves titles are nice but not enough to show notability.[[User:Mdtemp|Mdtemp]] ([[User talk:Mdtemp|talk]]) 16:16, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Fails NBOX.  Seems like every boxer has a human interest story, but not every boxer is notable.  Currently fails GNG.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 16:23, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Coverage, yes; substantial coverage in what we require for athletes and any other requirements listed at [[WP:NBOX]], no. Do not see enough [[WP:SIGCOV]] to warrant a standalone article.
