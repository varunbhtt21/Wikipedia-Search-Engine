An Italian reporter named Luciano (Leonard Mann) is on an express train in Greece when a murder occurs. As the train goes into a darkened tunnel, the murderer takes the opportunity to kill a woman on the train with a letter opener. Since the letter opener belonged to Luciano, the people on the train blame him for the girl's murder.
