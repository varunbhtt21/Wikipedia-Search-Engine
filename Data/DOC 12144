==Plot == 
A young dancer named Mara witnesses the slashing murder of a pharmacist, and becomes stalked by a cat-faced killer. She moves in with her boyfriend Luca for protection. Several other people begin turning up murdered, one drowned in a bathtub and one scalded to death. An escaped murderer named Pasquale Ferrante seems the most likely suspect to Luca, since most of the victims were jurors at Ferrante's murder trial. 
Luca later learns the trail of clues leads way back to World War II and events involving a group of Nazi collaborators.<ref>Luther-Smith,Adrian (1999). ''Blood and Black Lace: The Definitive Guide to Italian Sex and Horror Movies''. Stray Cat Publishing Ltd. p. 21</ref>
