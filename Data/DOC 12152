'''Gemenefkhonsbak''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian ruler ("king") of [[Tanis]] during the [[25th Dynasty]].

==Biography==
Little is known of him. According to [[Kenneth Kitchen]], he ruled Tanis from around 700 to c. 680&nbsp;BCE<ref name=Kdates>Kenneth Kitchen, ''The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650&nbsp;BC)'', 1996, Aris & Phillips Limited, Warminster, {{ISBN|0-85668-298-5}}, table 23B, although these dates are uncertain.</ref> some time after the fall of the last Tanite [[pharaoh]] of the [[22nd Dynasty]], [[Osorkon IV]], which occurred shortly after 716&nbsp;BCE. Like many of the [[Nile Delta]] governors, he proclaimed himself king, adopting a [[royal titulary]].<ref name=K357>Kitchen, op. cit. §&nbsp;357</ref>

His successor as ruler of Tanis could have been [[Pedubast II|Sehetepibenre Pedubast]].<ref name=K357/>

==Attestations==
Few monuments bearing his name were found. The better known among these is a [[hieratic]] [[stele]] from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] and now in the [[Museo Egizio]] of [[Turin]]; on this stele,  this king is depicted while spearing a foreigner who lies before [[Osiris]].<ref name=Sauneron/> According to [[Miroslav Verner]], a [[scaraboid seal]] of unknown origin reading ''Shepeskare'', which [[Flinders Petrie]] attributed to pharaoh [[Shepseskare]] of the [[5th Dynasty]] at the beginning of the 20th century, may instead belong to Gemenefkhonsbak.<ref>Miroslav Verner (2000), ''Who was Shepseskara, and when did he reign?'', in: Miroslav Bárta, Jaromír Krejčí (editors), ''Abusir and Saqqara in the Year 2000'', Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Oriental Institute, Prague, {{ISBN|80-85425-39-4}}, p.&nbsp;582, [http://egyptologie.ff.cuni.cz/pdf/AS%202000_mensi.pdf available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201084444/http://egyptologie.ff.cuni.cz/pdf/AS%202000_mensi.pdf |date=2011-02-01 }}.</ref>
