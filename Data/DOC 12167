== Conferences  ==
Students for Cooperation hosts between 2-3 conferences a year usually referred to as Summer,<ref>http://www.students.coop/brighton-summer-conference/</ref> Autumn<ref>http://www.students.coop/edinburgh-autumn-conference/</ref><ref>http://www.students.coop/edinburgh-autumn-conference-2016/</ref> and Winter<ref>http://www.students.coop/norwich-winter-conference/</ref> Conferences. These conferences move between different locations - generally in different university cities in which student cooperatives are based. These conferences feature forums for debate and discussion about the direction of Students for Cooperation, workshops to train individuals in member cooperatives and sessions provided by guest speakers from the wider [[British co-operative movement|Co-operative Movement]].

The conferences also facilitate General Meetings in which policy proposals can be submitted by member cooperatives for Students for Cooperation to adopt.<ref>http://www.students.coop/about-us/democracy/</ref>

The founding conference was held at the University of Birmingham and featured a guest speaker from [[North American Students of Cooperation]].<ref>http://www.students.coop/students-for-co-operation-conference/</ref><ref>https://www.thephone.coop/about-us/blog/2014/february/the-future-of-co-operation/</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2014/mar/26/co-ops-uk-growth</ref>

== National Body of Student Housing Cooperatives (NBSHC) ==
Students for Cooperation through funding obtained from the [[East of England Co-operative Society]] contracted Acorn Co-operative Support <ref>[http://www.acorncoopsupport.org.uk/ Acorn Coop Support Website]</ref> to undertake a primary report <ref>[http://www.students.coop/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Feasibility-Study-for-a-National-Body-of-Student-Housing-Co-ops.pdf Feasibility Study for a National Body of Student Housing Co-ops]</ref> into the establishment of a National Body of Student Housing Cooperatives to address issues holding back the growth of existing student housing cooperatives and establishment of new ones across the UK. The report in part was inspired by the successes seen in the US and Canada by the work of [[North American Students of Cooperation]]. Students for Cooperation was recommended to raise the sum of £20,000 of initial seed funding to cover costs of legal work and registration of the National Body and is currently seeking this funding.<ref>[http://www.students.coop/creating-a-national-body-of-student-housing-co-operatives Creating a National Body of Student Housing Co-operatives]</ref>
