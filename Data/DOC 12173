Title : Hematopoietic stem cell niche
Text : Many human blood cells, such as [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs), immune cells, and even platelets all originate from the same progenitor cell, the [[hematopoietic stem cell]] (HSC). As these cells are short-lived, there needs to be a steady turnover of new blood cells and the maintenance of an HSC pool. This is broadly termed [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoiesis]].<ref name=Birbrair>{{Cite journal|last = Birbrair|first = Alexander|last2 = Frenette|first2 = Paul S.|date = 2016-03-01|title = Niche heterogeneity in the bone marrow|journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language = en|pages = 82–96|doi = 10.1111/nyas.13016|issn = 1749-6632|volume=1370|issue = 1|pmid=27015419|pmc=4938003}}</ref> This event requires a special environment, termed the '''hematopoietic stem cell niche''', which provides the protection and signals necessary to carry out the differentiation of cells from HSC progenitors.<ref name=Birbrair/> This niche relocates from the [[yolk sac]] to eventually rest in the [[bone marrow]] of mammals. Many pathological states can arise from disturbances in this niche environment, highlighting its importance in maintaining hematopoiesis.<ref name=Birbrair/>

==Hematopoiesis==
Hematopoiesis involves a series of differentiation steps from one progenitor cell to a more committed cell type, forming the recognizable tree seen in the adjacent diagram. Pluripotent long-term (LT)-HSCs self-renew to maintain the HSC pool, as well as differentiate into short-term (ST)-HSCs.<ref name=Birbrair/> Through various knock-out models, several transcription factors have been found to be essential in this differentiation, such as [[RUNX1]] and [[TAL1|SCL]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Orkin SH|year=2000|title=Diversification of haematopoietic stem cells to specific lineages|journal=Nat.

ST-HSCs can then differentiate into either the common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). The CLP then goes on to differentiate into more committed lymphoid precursor cells. The CMP can then further differentiate into the [[megakaryocyte–erythroid progenitor cell]] (MEP), which goes on to make RBCs and platelets, or the [[CFU-GM|granulocyte/macrophage progenitor]] (GMP), which gives rise to the granulocytes of the innate immune response. MEP differentiation was found to be contingent upon the transcription factor [[GATA1]], whereas GMP differentiation needs [[SPI1]]. When expression of either was inhibited by [[morpholino]] in zebrafish, the other lineage programming pathway resulted.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Galloway JL, Wingert RA, Thisse C, Thisse B, and Zon LI|year=2005|title=Loss of gata1 but not gata2 converts erythropoiesis to myelopoiesis in zebrafish embryos|journal=Dev.

There are 2 types of hematopoiesis that occur in humans:
#'''Primitive hematopoiesis''' – blood stem cells differentiate into only a few specialized blood lineages (typically isolated to early fetal development).
#'''Definitive hematopoiesis''' – multipotent HSCs appear (occurs through the majority of human lifetime).

==Historical development of the theory==
The pioneering work of [[James Till|Till]] and [[Ernest McCulloch|McCulloch]] in 1961 experimentally confirmed the development of [[blood cell]]s from a single precursor [[hematopoietic stem cell]] (HSC), creating the framework for the field of [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoiesis]] to be studied over the following decades.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Till J. E.|author2=McCulloch E.|year=1961|title=A direct measurement of the radiation sensitivity of normal mouse bone marrow cells|journal=Radiat.

During this time, the field exploded with studies aimed at determining the components of the "hematopoietic [[stem cell niche]]" that made this possible. Dexter observed that [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal stromal cells]] could maintain early HSCs ''ex vivo'', and both Lord and Gong showed that these cells localized to the [[Endosteum|endosteal margins]] in [[long bone]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Dexter T.M.|author2=Allen T.D.|author3=Lajha L.G.|year=1977|title=Conditions controlling the proliferation of hemopoietic stem cells in vitro|journal=J.

==Niche localization through early fetal development==

===Yolk sac and the hemangioblast theory===

Despite the vast work done in this field, there is still controversy over the origins of definitive HSCs. Primitive [[Haematopoiesis|hematopoiesis]] is first found in the [[blood islands]] (Pander's islands) of the [[Umbilical vesicle|yolk sac]] at E7.5 (embryonic day 7.5) in mice and 30dpc (30 days post-conception) in humans. As the embryo requires rapid [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)|oxygenation]] due to its high [[Mitosis|mitotic activity]], these islands are the main source of [[red blood cell]] (RBC) production via fusing [[Endothelium|endothelial cells]] (ECs) with the developing embryonic circulation.

The [[hemangioblast]] theory, which posits that the RBCs and ECs derive from a common progenitor cell, was developed as researchers observed that receptor [[knockout mice]], such as [[Kinase insert domain receptor|flk1]]-/-, exhibited defective RBC formation and vessel growth.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Shalaby F, Ho J, Stanford WL, Fischer KD, Schuh AC, Schwartz L, Bernstein A, Rossant J|year=1997|title=A requirement for Flk1 in primitive and definitive hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis|journal=Cell|volume=89|issue=6|pages=981–990|pmid=9200616|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80283-4}}</ref> A year later, Choi showed that [[Precursor cell|blast cells]] derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells displayed common gene expression of both hematopoietic and endothelial precursors.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Choi K, Kennedy M, Kazarov A, Papadimitriou JC, Keller G|year=1998|title=A common precursor for hematopoietic and endothelial cells|journal=Development|volume=125|issue=4|pages=725–732|pmid=9435292|url=http://bmg.fc.ul.pt/Disciplinas/Regula_e_Diferenc/artigos/G%20Keller%201998%20Hemangioblast.pdf}}</ref> However, Ueno and Weissman provided the earliest contradiction to the hemangioblast theory when they saw that distinct ES cells mixed into a [[blastocyst]] resulted in more than 1 ES cell contributing to the majority of the blood islands found in the resultant [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ueno H, Weissman IL|year=2006|title=Clonal analysis of mouse development reveals a polyclonal origin for yolk sac blood islands|journal=Dev.

===Aorta-gonad-mesonephros region===

Definitive hematopoiesis then occurs later in the [[aorta-gonad-mesonephros]] (AGM), a region of embryonic mesoderm that develops into the ventral wall of the dorsal [[aorta]], at E10.5 in mice and 4wpc (4 weeks post-conception) in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang LD, Wagers AJ|year=2011|title=Dynamic niches in the origination and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells|journal=Nat.

==Niche relocation through late fetal development==

===Placenta and the fetal liver===

Hematopoiesis then moves from the AGM to the placenta and fetal liver at E11.5 in mice and 5wpc in humans. While the engraftment of HSCs at these sites are still being elucidated, the interaction between the chemokine [[Stromal cell-derived factor 1|CXCL12]] expressed by [[stromal cell]]s and its receptor [[CXCR4]] expressed on HSCs has been proposed as one mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ma Q|displayauthors=etal|year=1998|title=Impaired B-lymphopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and derailed cerebellar neuron migration in CXCR4- and SDF-1-deficient mice|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=95|issue=16|pages=9448–9453|pmid=9689100|pmc=21358|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.16.9448}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Mcgrath KE, Koniski AD, Maltby KM|displayauthors=etal|year=1999|title=Embryonic expression and function of the chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4|journal=Develop Biol|volume=213|issue=2|pages=442–456|pmid=10479460|doi=10.1006/dbio.1999.9405}}</ref> In addition, the cytokine-receptor binding of [[Stem cell factor|SCF]] and [[CD117|KIT]] have been recognized for its importance in HSC function and amplification of the [[Chemotaxis|chemotactic]] induction of CXCL12.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Christensen JL, Wright DE, Wagers AJ, Weissman IL|year=2004|title=Circulation and chemotaxis of fetal hematopoietic stem cells|journal=PLoS Biol|volume=2|issue=3|page=e75|pmid=15024423|pmc=368169|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020075}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Broxmeyer HE|displayauthors=etal|year=1991|title=The kit receptor and its ligand, steel factor, as regulators of hematopoiesis|journal=Cancer Cells|volume=3|issue=12|pages=480–487|pmid=1726456}}</ref>

Additional factors that are important in HSC migration during this period are [[Integrin]]s, [[CDH2|N-cadherin]], and [[Osteopontin]] that can stimulate [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt signaling]] in HSCs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Qian H|displayauthors=etal|year=2007|title=Distinct roles of integrins α6 and α4 in homing of fetal liver hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells|journal=Blood|volume=110|issue=7|pages=2399–2407|doi=10.1182/blood-2006-10-051276|pmid=17586725}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Martin, MA, Bhatia, M|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Analysis of the human fetal liver hematopoietic microenvironment|journal= Stem Cells and Development|volume=14|issue=5|pages=493–504|pmid=16305335|doi=10.1089/scd.2005.14.493}}</ref> Transcription factors such as [[PITX2]] must be expressed in stromal cells to support normal HSC function.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kieusseian A|displayauthors=etal|year=2006|title=Expression of Pitx2 in stromal cells is required for normal hematopoiesis|journal=Blood|volume=107|issue=2|pages=492–500|pmid=16195330|doi=10.1182/blood-2005-02-0529|pmc=1895608}}</ref> Like with the AGM, the relocation of fetal liver HSCs coincides with the differentiation of functional units, in this case hepatoblasts to [[hepatocyte]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Shiojiri, N.|year=1997|title=Development and differentiation of bile ducts in the mammalian liver|journal=Microsc.

===Bone marrow===

Hematopoiesis then moves to the [[bone marrow]] at E18 in mice and 12wpc in humans, where it will reside permanently for the remainder of the individual's lifetime. In mice, there is a shift from the fetal liver to the spleen at E14, where it persists for many weeks postnatally while it occurs simultaneously in the bone marrow.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wolber, FM|displayauthors=etal|year=2002|title=Roles of spleen and liver in development of the murine hematopoietic system|journal=Exp.

HSCs in the bone marrow do not show the same characteristics as those in other niches. HSCs in fetal liver display increased cell divisions, whereas adult bone marrow HSCs are mostly [[G0 phase|quiescent]].<ref name="Orkin SH 2008"/> This difference stems, in part, from signaling discrepancies in the two niches. Sox17 has been identified as crucial for the generation of fetal, but not adult, HSCs.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Kim I, Saunders TL, Morrison SJ|year=2007|title=Sox17 dependence distinguishes the transcriptional regulation of fetal from adult hematopoietic stem cells|journal=Cell|volume=130|issue=3|pages=470–483|pmid=17655922|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.06.011|pmc=2577201}}</ref> Inactivation of Runx1 in adult HSCs does not impair function, but rather prevents the differentiation of specific lineages.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ichikawa M, Asai T, Saito T|displayauthors=etal|year=2004|title=AML-1 is required for megakaryocytic maturation and lymphocytic differentiation, but not for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells in adult hematopoiesis|journal=Nat.

==Composition of the bone marrow niche==
In addition to the [[cytokine]]s and cell signaling molecules mentioned above, the HSC niche in the bone marrow provides soluble factors, forces, and cell-mediated interactions necessary to maintain the hematopoietic potential of the stem cells located there. This niche is generally separated into 2 sections:
#'''Endosteal niche'''-the outer edge of the bone marrow that contains osteocytes, bone matrix, and quiescent HSCs.
#'''Perivascular niche'''-the inner core of the bone marrow that contains actively dividing HSCs, sinusoidal endothelium, CARs (CXCL12-abundant reticular cells), and MSCs ([[Mesenchymal stem cell]]s).

===Acellular factors===
Recent studies have used hypoxic-staining dyes, such as [[Hoechst stain]], to show that quiescent LT-HSCs and osteoblasts are found in hypoxic and poorly perfused areas of the bone marrow, while ECs and MSCs were found in well-perfused areas.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Parmar K, Mauch P, Vergilio JA|displayauthors=etal|year=2007|title=Distribution of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow according to regional hypoxia|journal=Proc.

It has also been found that calcium ions can act as chemotactic signals to HSCs via the [[G protein–coupled receptor]] (GPCR) [[calcium-sensing receptor]] (CaSR).

Thirdly, the [[Shear stress|shearing forces]] experienced by HSCs from circulating cells has been suggested to play a role in hematopoietic activation. Fetal HSCs in the [[Aorta-gonad-mesonephros|AGM]] have shown upregulated Runx1 in response to these forces, which would result in significant hematopoietic regulation in these cells.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Adamo L|displayauthors=etal|year=2009|title=Biomechanical forces promote embryonic haematopoiesis|journal=Nature|volume=459|issue=7250|pages=1131–1135|doi=10.1038/nature08073|pmid=19440194|pmc=2782763|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/197850}}</ref> Despite the differences between the AGM and bone marrow, both are subjected to the circulation, and it is entirely possible that these same forces exist in this adult stem cell niche.

===Cellular factors===
Osteoblasts, bone-forming cells, interact with HSCs and provide proliferative signals. Studies that have increased or decreased osteoblasts have shown a similar increase or decrease, respectively, in the number of HSCs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Calvi LM|displayauthors=etal|year=2003|title=Osteoblastic cells regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche|journal=Nature|volume=425|issue=6960|pages=841–846|doi=10.1038/nature02040|pmid=14574413}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Visnjic |first=D |year=2004|title=Hematopoiesis is severely altered in mice with an induced osteoblast deficiency|journal=Blood|volume=103|issue=9|pages=3258–3264|pmid=14726388|doi=10.1182/blood-2003-11-4011}}</ref> Coculturing endosteal cells with HSCs was also found to be sufficient in maintaining their differentiation potential long-term, presumably through the secretion of the cell signaling molecules previously mentioned.<ref name=Chitteti>{{cite journal|author=Chitteti BR|displayauthors=etal|year=2010|title=Impact of interactions of cellular components of the bone marrow microenvironment on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell function|journal=Blood|volume=115|issue=16|pages=3239–3248|pmid=20154218|pmc=2858485|doi=10.1182/blood-2009-09-246173}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Nakamura Y|displayauthors=etal|year=2010|title=Isolation and characterization of endosteal niche cell populations that regulate hematopoietic stem cells|journal=Blood|volume=116|issue=9|pages=1422–1432|pmid=20472830|doi=10.1182/blood-2009-08-239194}}</ref> These HSCs that interact with the endosteal osteoblasts display a quiescent phenotype, as shown in both ''ex vivo'' and ''in vivo'' imaging studies, whereas HSCs that are more actively dividing show less interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kohler A|displayauthors=etal|year=2009|title=Altered cellular dynamics and endosteal location of aged early hematopoietic progenitor cells revealed by time-lapse intravital imaging in long bones|journal=Blood|volume=114|pages=290–298|pmid=19357397|doi=10.1182/blood-2008-12-195644|issue=2|pmc=2714205}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Lo Celso C|displayauthors=etal|year=2009|title=Live-animal tracking of individual haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in their niche|journal=Nature|volume=457|pages=92–97|doi=10.1038/nature07434|pmid=19052546|pmc=2820276|issue=7225}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Xie Y|displayauthors=etal|year=2009|title=Detection of functional haematopoietic stem cell niche using real-time imaging|journal=Nature|volume=457|pages=97–101|pmid=19052548|issue=7225|doi=10.1038/nature07639}}</ref> These results of less active HSCs interacting with the endosteal niche agree with previous results looking at the activity state of HSCs throughout the bone marrow.

In addition to osteoblasts, HSCs interact with many mesenchymal cells as they make their way to the sinusoids in the perivascular niche. Removal of [[Nestin (protein)|nestin]]-expressing MSCs has shown a significant decrease in LT-HSCs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Méndez-Ferrer S|displayauthors=etal|year=2010|title=Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche|journal=Nature|volume=466|pages=829–834|pmid=20703299|doi=10.1038/nature09262|pmc=3146551|issue=7308}}</ref> These cells secrete high levels of CXCL12 and closely associate with sympathetic nerves that influence cytokine-induced migration of HSCs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tzeng YS|displayauthors=etal|year=2011|title=Loss of Cxcl12/Sdf-1 in adult mice decreases the quiescent state of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and alters the pattern of hematopoietic regeneration after myelosuppression|journal=Blood|volume=117|pages=429–439|pmid=20833981|doi=10.1182/blood-2010-01-266833|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Katayama Y|displayauthors=etal|year=2006|title=Signals from the sympathetic nervous system regulate hematopoietic stem cell egress from bone marrow|journal=Cell|volume=124|issue=2|pages=407–421|pmid=16439213|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.041}}</ref> Similar to these cells, CAR cells have correlated with reduced HSCs and LT-HSC activity when ablated.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Omatsu Y|displayauthors=etal|year=2010|title=The essential functions of adipoosteogenic progenitors as the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell niche|journal=Immunity|volume=33|issue=3|pages=1–13|pmid=20850355|doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2010.08.017}}</ref> One difference between these cell types, despite the similarity in function, is that CAR cells may be found in both endosteal and perivascular niches, while nestin-positive MSCs are found exclusively in the perivascular niche.

Finally, both ECs and adipocytes have been suggested to influence HSC activity in the bone marrow.

===Cancer===
Of the many transcriptional regulators of hematopoiesis, nearly all induce [[leukemia]] when aberrant. [[Chromosomal translocation]] is a hallmark of leukemia, and SCL-induced translocation deregulates expression at the [[Locus (genetics)|locus]], while Runx1-induced translocation results in [[Fusion protein|chimeric fusion proteins]]. These chimeric transcription factors can result in the improper repression or activation of the target gene, as well as the inappropriate recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Rosenbauer F, Tenen DG|year=2007|title=Transcription factors in myeloid development: balancing differentiation with transformation|journal=Nat.
