:({{Find sources|Current Research In Drug Discovery (Journal)}})
Non-notable new journal published by "Science Publications" (listed on [[Jeffrey Beall]]'s list of [[Predatory open-access publishing|predatory OA publishers]]). Not indexed in any ''selective'' databases, no independent sources. Does not meet [[WP:NJournals]] or [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 10:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

the journal itself is not on the Beall's list anyway, in my opinion, you cannot judge the journal in this simple way.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Giancarlobasile|Giancarlobasile]] ([[User talk:Giancarlobasile|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Giancarlobasile|contribs]]) 16:45, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:*'''Comment''' Even disregarding the fact that this is a journal published by a shady publisher at best, there is not a shred of evidence that this meets our notability criteria (or ever will). That you are willing to tie your name and reputation to this kind of stuff is your responsibility. What we list in WP or not is the community's. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 19:17, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

Ok I share your point of view we will post again when suitable references will be available, please delete
