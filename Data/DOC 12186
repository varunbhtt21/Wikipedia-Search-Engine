'''Šiprage''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Шипраге}}) is a settlement municipality in the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republika Srpska]] entity, [[Kotor Varoš]] Municipality.

The administrative status of this [[populated place]] was changed – from the [[local community]] has grown a municipality in the [[Kotor-Varoš (srez)|County of Kotor Varoš]]<ref name="pod2.stat.gov.rs">{{cite web|url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/G1953/pdf/G19534001.pdf |title=UKUPNO STANOVNI[TVO PO NARODNOSTI |website=Pod2.stat.gov.rs |accessdate=2017-06-01}}</ref> – in order to ensure in the 1954th back to the level of local community.

==Name==
The modern name is derived from noble–bey (Omer-bey) family '''Šipraga'''.<ref name="a1892"/> It is unclear whether their ancestors represent autochthonous population or they migrated into the area and acquired spacious property in the valley of the river Vrbanja and its tributaries. According to the oral traditions and cadastre records, their expansion started from [[Pougarje (valley)|Pougarje]] (slopes of [[Vlašić (Bosnian mountain)|Vlašić]] Mountain) in the valley of River [[Ugar (river)|Ugar]].

==Geography==
Šiprage is on the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja river]], on its south-eastern upstream line of the [[Banja Luka]] (about 60&nbsp;km) and the [[Kotor Varoš]] (30&nbsp;km) and the Center is part of the local community. Located in the long valley between several mountain ranges: north-east Šipraško Brdo (Šiprage's Hill) with Glavić top, 950 m, south: Jasik (769 m), to the southeast of the complex Šahinovina–Stražbenica (848 m), west: Radohova (top: Kape, 950 m) and the north-west: Borčići (799 m) with Hrastik.<ref name="ReferenceA">Vojnogeografski institut, Ed.

The settlement, along with Vrbanja and its tributaries, is about three long and two kilometers wide. It is rich in sources of drinking water, one of which is (along the [[Crkvenica]]) used to supply the local aqueduct network. In the place, in Vrbanja confluence there are flowing: Musić potok (stream), [[Crkvenica]] and Bakin potok (Grandmother's Creek), on the right side, but [[Ćorkovac]], Zagradinski potok (Creek) and [[Demićka]] on the left riverside.

==Climate==
In the Šiprage local and around area there is [[climate|moderate continental climate]], with the expressed four [[season]]s: [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]]. On the hills around the mountain and subalpine, annual fluctuations in temperature and rainfall are relatively high, but with the long-term stability.

==Nature and ecology==
In the Šiprage's Valley and on the surrounding slopes, along with the Vrbanja river and its tributaries, there stretches the surface of arable [[land]], with belts of mixed deciduous and coniferous [[forest]]s ([[spruce]] and [[abies]], [[white pine|white]] and [[European Black Pine|black pine]]) and mixed [[Woodland|wood]]s of [[beech]] and [[hornbeam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xk.geoview.info/siprage_kotor_varos,2008871p|title=Siprage (KOTOR VAROS)|work=geoview.info|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> In these ecosystems and mountain meadows there are big and small [[game (hunting)|game]] ([[bear]], [[wild boar]], [[wolf]], [[fox]], [[rabbit]], [[hedgehog]], [[badger]], [[marten]] and weasel, [[hedgehog]], etc.), including [[Bosnian endemic quarry mammals]].

Pastures, cutters and a catchment area covering the life of the natural community ([[biocenosis]]) of the associated [[vegetation]] zones. But upstream from the [[Obodnik]] village and all the way to Tomina Luka (Tom's field) in its upper flow, the Vrbanja confluence belongs to the salmonid waters. However, at first the [[grayling (species)|grayling]], after [[huchen]] too, and now [[brown trout]] will gradually fade away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opstinakotorvaros.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LOKALNI-EKOLOSKI-AKCIONI-PLAN-OPSTINE-KOTOR-VAROS-2.pdf|editor=Đurašinović D. |title=Lokalni eklološki akcioni plan Općine Kotor Varoš/Local environmental action plan of the Kotor Varoš Municipality|website=Opstinakotorvaros.com|p=74}}</ref> Grayling is completely missing in the 1970s, and the survival of trout endanger numerous natural and anthropogenic factors. It is especially extreme flooding during 2000th. There are the irrational fishing and [[pollution]] with sludge and secondary by-products of exploitation of [[forest]] [[resource]]s. Picking a [[fish]] stock is trying to compensate for the regular stocking of, which in turn leads to the question of local [[population]]s [[gene pool]], because of the [[autochthon (nature)|autochthon]]ous specificities, even in the source area of the flows of the Vrbanja river and its tributaries.

==History==

According to sources, the first settlement in the [[Vrbanja river]] valley dates to the [[Neolithic]]. This area was then inhabited by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe of [[Maezaeis]], and in the 4th century BC [[Celts]].<ref name=<"MS">{{cite book|author=Mesihović S.|year=2011|title=Rimski vuk i ilirska zmija – Posljednja borba|editor=Filozofski fakultet|place=Sarajevo|isbn= 978-9958-625-21-3}} pp 2–33.</ref><ref name=<"AK">{{cite book|author=Abdić K.|year=2014|title=Ilirski narodi sjeverozapadne Bosne i Hercegovine|editor= Filozofski fakultet|place=Sarajevo: pp 56-63}}</ref>

From the Roman period there are several sites in Šiprage at the mouth [[Crkvenica]] – in [[Vrbanja river]] ("at the field of Omer Bey Šipraga," 1891), discovered the remains of an early Christian [[basilica]] (3rd - 5th century).<ref>Radimsky V.

One of the best preserved stećak is submerged in River Vrbanja, in the immediate proximity of its primary location.

In the Middle Ages, Šiprage belonged to the state of Bosnia, part of the province of [[Donji Kraji]] ("Lower regions"), and was later occupied by the [[Ottomans]] (1519).<ref name="auto">Malcolm N.

(1986): Bosna i Hercegovina / Bosnia and Herzegovia / Bosnien und Herzegowina. Svjetlost, Sarajevo, pp 31-68</ref>  In 1878 the region became part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], and in 1918, [[Yugoslavia]].

During [[World War II]], Šiprage was a Partisan stronghold, and site of the 12th Division Hospital (in Demić gorge), serving its 5th Corpus. In the area of Šiprage, at the very beginning of the war, there were several local partisan unit forces that were later included in larger formations.
On 6 January 1944, the Germans broke through the partisan defence lines on the Raskršće locality between the villages of [[Stopan]] and Kerle, and the next day entered (at sunrise, 7 January) the centre of Šiprage, where they stayed until 15 January 1944.

The town was bombed and attacked by Germans and [[Chetniks]], including the units of [[Draža Mihailović]]. During the „6th Enemy Offensive" in Bosnia, the 12th Division's Mobil Hospital was established for their 5th Corpus (1943/1944); the hospital survived despite multiple [[Luftwaffe]]'s bombing on nearby Šiprage). As a precaution, the Hospital was relocated to the surrounding villages and further to [[Korićani]]. Then it was about 600 injured and patients moved into the village of [[Stopan]] and Lozići, then in Palivuk, [[Čudnić]] and [[Kruševo Brdo]]. After the passage of the Offensive against, for ten days (at 15 January 1944), it was returning again in Šiprage. Later it turned out that even enemy forces did not have precise information about its location.<ref>Petrić N., Ed. (1985): Opštine Kotor-Varoš i Skender-Vakuf u NOB-u 1941-1945.

===Bosnian War===
During the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95), Bosnian Serb Police and Army forces destroyed the surrounding Bosniak villages, especially those upstream along the Vrbanja to [[Kruševo Brdo]], as well as Bosniak and Croat villages downstream to [[Banja Luka]], and in the whole of central Bosnia.<ref>Gutman R.

One of the 18 camps for detained Bosniaks from the Kotor Varoš Municipality was at the Police station (MUP) in Šiprage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bosnjaci.net/prilog.php?pid=48921.|title=SRPSKO-CRNOGORSKI-HRVATSKI KONCENTRACIONI LOGORI - GENOCIDNE TVORNICE SMRTI — Bosnjaci.Net|website=www.bosnjaci.net|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>
