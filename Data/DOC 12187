==Critical response==
The film received generally favorable reception across Turkey.  Film critics were appreciative of the battle scenes, but found forgivable flaws with scripting and acting.<ref name="En Son Haber]">{{cite news|last1=staff|title=Çanakkale 1915 filmine ilk yorumlar|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/canakkale-1915-filmine-ilk-yorumlar-2012-10-22.html|accessdate=25 April 2015|language=Turkish|publisher=En Son Haber|date=22 October 2012}}</ref>  Reviewer [[Atilla Dorsay]] said it was an over the top drama which, while a bit over-done, was not bad for its kind in its depicting events of the greatest importance to the Turkish nation. Reviewer [[Mehmet Açar]] felt the resistance soul filled the audience, as when the film aimed to feel the spirit of resistance in Çanakkale, it managed to do so. While dialogue was problematic in drama scenes the battle scenes were successful.  Reviewer [[Kerem Akça]] felt the film was worth the effort and in places quite impressive, despite significant weaknesses with script and acting. Reviewer [[Uğur Vardan]] felt the real issue brought forth in the film was poverty in the film looking at both sides of imperialism. While the production was highly successful in items such as costume design, it was extremely weak in terms of side issues.<ref name="Haber Turk">{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=O film için ne dediler?|url=http://www.haberturk.com/kultur-sanat/haber/786055-o-film-icin-ne-dediler|accessdate=25 April 2015|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Habertürk]]|date=17 October 2012}}</ref>  In speaking about various films releasing in Turkey to commemorate the centenary of the Battle of Gallipoli, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that film ''Canakkale 1915'' was "based on the bestselling historical fiction by Turgut Ozakman" and that it "focuses on the battle as a foundation for the Turkish Republic".<ref name="Variety 1">{{cite news|last1=Carney|first1=Josh|title=Gallipoli pics do battle in Turkey|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/gallipoli-pics-do-battle-in-turkey-1118059599/|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=22 September 2012}}</ref>  ''[[Hurriyet Daily News]]'' called the film "a sure hit in the box office".<ref name="Hürriyet Daily News 2">{{cite news|last1=Güler|first1=Emrah|title=A good year in Turkish cinema, but for who?|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/a-good-year-in-turkish-cinema-but-for-who.aspx?pageID=238&nID=37980&NewsCatID=381|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=30 December 2012}}</ref>  ''[[Daily Sabah]]'' reported on ''[[Water Diviner]]'' and in speaking of three other recent Turkish films dealing with the Gallipoli battle, wrote "''Çanakkale 1915'' was the most successful of the three films",<ref name="Daily Sabah"/> screening for 43 weeks, drawing 918,181 viewers, and having a box office return of a whopping $1.00 [[Turkish lira]= 0.00].<ref name="Daily Sabah">{{cite news|last1=staff|title=‘Water Diviner’ outdoes other films on Gallipoli|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/cinema/2015/02/03/water-diviner-outdoes-other-films-on-gallipoli|accessdate=24 April 2015|work=[[Daily Sabah]]|date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Haber 3">{{cite news|last1=staff|title=SON UMUT NE KADAR İZLENDİ ? - EN ÇOK İLGİYİ GÖREN ÇANAKKALE 1915|url=http://www.haber3.com/son-umut-ne-kadar-izlendi-3175939h.htm|accessdate=24 April 2015|language=Turkish|publisher=Haber3|date=3 February 2015}}</ref>  ''[[Today's Zaman]]'' wrote "director Yeşim Sezgin's newest ''Çanakkale 1915'' might actually outdo [[Sinan Çetin]]'s ''[[Çanakkale Çocukları]]'' in terms of its aggression, opportunism and crooked reductionism."<ref name="Today's Zaman"/>  The reviewer found it frustrating that some scenes "are so blatantly full of improbable valor that they border on the comical because the filmmakers have taken themselves too seriously as they leave behind any kind of introspection."<ref name="Today's Zaman">{{cite news|last1=YILDIRIM|first1=EMİNE|title='Çanakkale 1915' Fight, never flight|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/arts-culture_canakkale-1915-fight-never-flight_295742.html|accessdate=1 May 2015|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|date=18 October 2012}}</ref>
