I am not seeing how this passes [[WP:PRODUCT]] and [[Wikipedia:Notability (software)]]. One inline ref is not accessible without subscription; the other is from [[Network World]], which itself seems like a publication of dubious notability. A review in two or three niche websites is not enough to make software notable. <sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 10:22, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
