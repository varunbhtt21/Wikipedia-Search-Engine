==Reception==
In a contemporary review, Paul Taylor (''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'') gave the film a negative review, calling it "a wholly inane and incoherent thriller, which scarcely seems to have benefited form the attentions of no less than six credited screenwriters." and that it featured a  "bored-looking Fabio Testi, when not shooting gratuitous fill-ins (schoolgirls in the showers; an abortion sequence) from silly angles, Negrin peppers the proceedings with would-be enigmatic close-ups of car radiator grilles, a madonna statue and a watching eye, plus titillating flashbacks to the fatal party"<ref name="mfb">{{Cite magazine
