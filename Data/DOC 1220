The '''Honda Indy V8''' engine is a 3.5-litre [[naturally-aspirated]] [[V8 engine|V8]], developed and produced by [[Honda Performance Development|HPD]]-[[American Honda Motor Company|AHM Co.]] in partnership with [[Ilmor|Ilmor Engineering]] (reassembly, arrangement, preparation, maintenance, trackside support and tune-up) for [[IndyCar Series]].[http://news.honda.com/newsandviews/article.aspx?id=2003051246602] Honda Indy V8 was a highly-successful [[IndyCar Series]] engine supplier from [[2003 IndyCar Series season|2003]] to [[2011 IndyCar Series season|2011 season]]s before replaced by [[Honda Indy V6]] at [[2012 IndyCar Series season|the following season]]. Honda Indy V8 was unveiled at 2002 Detroit Auto Show and assembled at [[Honda Performance Development|HPD]] power assembly plant in Santa Clarita, California, USA in early 2003.

==1st Generation (2003-2004)==
[[Honda Performance Development|Honda]] debuted [[IndyCar Series]] as engine supplier in [[2003 IndyCar Series season|2003 season]] after a [[Champ Car|CART]] successful era. Developed jointly by [[Honda Performance Development|HPD]] with under support from [[Ilmor]] and designated as HI3R, engine's capacity was 3.5-liter. Honda supplied [[Andretti Green Racing]], [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Team Rahal]], [[Fernández Racing]] and [[Access Motorsports]] teams. Honda's 2003 stats were 3 pole positions, 6 fastest laps and 2 wins. A revised engine named HI4R was used in [[2004 IndyCar Series season|2004]] until new regulations came into effect at the [[2004 Indianapolis 500]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hondabeat.com/racing_details.php?ID=82|title=Indy: Honda's 2004 Engine|work=HondaBeat.com|date=September 10, 2004}}</ref>
===Applications===
*Dallara IR3
*G-Force GF09
==2nd Generation (2004-2006)==
Honda designed a new engine to address the 2004 IRL rule change which required reduced displacement. Developed once again by [[Ilmor]] and designated as HI4R-A,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/05/21/196015.html|title=2004 Indy 500: BorgWarner Louis Schwitzer Award Presented to Honda|publisher=The Auto Channel|date=May 21, 2004}}</ref> its capacity was 3.0-liter and debuted at the [[2004 Indianapolis 500]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/news/2005/c050119.html|title=Honda Unveils Stout Lineup to Defend IRL Titles|publisher=Honda Motor Co.|date=January 19, 2005}}</ref> With subsequent evolutions named HI5R and HI6R, Honda was clearly dominant engine, scoring 33 poles, 35 fastest laps, 41 wins totally in three seasons including 3 [[Indianapolis 500]]s. Since [[Chevrolet]] and [[Toyota Racing Development|Toyota]] leaves [[IndyCar Series]] after [[2005 IndyCar Series season|2005 season]], [[Honda Performance Development|Honda]] won exclusive tender [[IndyCar Series]] engine supplier for [[2006 IndyCar Series season|2006]] to [[2011 IndyCar Series season|2011 season]].
===Applications===
*Dallara IR4
*Panoz GF09B
*Panoz PZ09C
==3rd Generation (2007-2011)==
This family was designed as a replacement for the HI6R but enlarged to better accommodate variable valve timing and Active Fuel Management while still generating good performance. HI7R-HI11R's capacity reverted to 3.5-liters respectively since [[2007 IndyCar Series season|2007 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/54176|title=IRL to revert to 3.5-litre engines|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=Autosport.com|date=August 31, 2006|accessdate=August 31, 2006}}</ref> HI7R-HI11R engine was developed and assembled by [[Honda Performance Development|Honda]] in Santa Clarita, California, USA ([[Honda Performance Development]]'s current headquarters) but remained under support from [[Ilmor|Ilmor Engineering]] for R&D, trackside support, engine arrangement, tune up and engine maintenance. HI7R-HI11R engine supplied for all [[IndyCar Series]] teams. HI7R-HI11R was highly-successful engine with 86 pole positions, fastest laps and wins respectively including [[2008 Nikon Indy 300]] exhibition race and 5 [[Indianapolis 500]]s. Due to the [[IndyCar Series]] chassis and engine development freeze beginning in [[2008 IndyCar Series season|2008]], [[IndyCar Series]] kept the Honda Indy V8 3rd generation model until [[2011 IndyCar Series season|2011 season]] for cost reasons.

During that time, since the IndyCar Series had only one engine manufacturer, Honda focused on minimizing engine failure and minimizing costs instead of defeating rivals. As such, the engines were moderately de-tuned. The engines proved themselves to be quite durable. There had been no engine failures at Indy from 2006 to 2010, which also lowered the number of crashes. Most of the engines, including those used for the Indy 500, were used for multiple races and were intended to last 1,200&nbsp;miles (1,931&nbsp;kilometers) between rebuilds.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leveling the playing field |publisher=MachineDesign.com |url=http://machinedesign.com/ContentItem/58501/Levelingtheplayingfield.aspx |first=Victoria |last=Reitz |accessdate=2003-04-13 |date=2006-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173806/http://machinedesign.com/ContentItem/58501/Levelingtheplayingfield.aspx |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }}</ref> The Honda engines were only available via lease arrangement from Honda, which, for the 2010 full season, cost $935,000 U.S. per season, per car.<ref>{{cite news |title =IndyCar confirms rule changes, cost savings |publisher=Racer.com |url =http://www.racer.com/indycar-confirms-rule-changes-cost-savings/article/161135/ |first= |last= |accessdate=2010-08-23 |date=2010-01-12}}</ref>

The HI7R-HI11R were rev-limited to 10,300 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and produced approximately 650 [[Horsepower|hp]]. The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder. The crankshaft is made of alloy steel, with five main bearing caps. The pistons are forged aluminum alloy, while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel. The electronic engine management system is supplied by [[Motorola]], firing a [[Capacitor discharge ignition|CDI]] ignition system. The engine lubrication is a dry sump type, cooled by a single water pump.

After Honda was focused on new engine from 2012 onwards, IndyCar Series froze Honda Indy V8 engine development started from 2009 season onwards.
