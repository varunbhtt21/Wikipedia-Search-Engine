"'''Don't Stop'''" is a song by Australian [[pop rock]] band [[5 Seconds of Summer]], taken from their self-titled debut album, ''[[5 Seconds of Summer (album)|5 Seconds of Summer]]'' (2014). The song was released on 16 June 2014 through [[Capitol Records]] and [[Hi or Hey Records]] as the album's second single.

==Critical reception==
Amy Davidson of [[Digital Spy]] gave the song 4/5 stars, stating "[[Blink-182]] may have released their first song long before any of the Aussie four-piece were even born, but that hasn't deterred 5SOS from being the band's loyal understudies. 'Don't Stop' sees them jolting new life into an otherwise flagging [[pop punk]] genre, charging ahead as leaders of the revival."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a576833/5-seconds-of-summer-dont-stop-single-review-pop-punk-revival.html|title=5 Seconds of Summer: 'Don't Stop' single review - 'Pop-punk revival'|last=Davidson|first=Amy|date=12 June 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> It is also described as a [[power pop]] track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/11/12/five-seconds-summer-best-songs-playlist/18918013/|title=5 Seconds of Summer Best Songs|work=[[AZ Central]]|date=12 November 2014}}</ref>
