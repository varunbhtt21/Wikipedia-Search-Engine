:({{Find sources|Harry Weisman}})
Unsourced biography. I am unable to find any sources that discuss the subject in any depth. Fails [[WP:BIO]]. - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 10:44, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' unless anyone can find sources - I can't. [[User:GoldenRing|GoldenRing]] ([[User talk:GoldenRing|talk]]) 12:54, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Speedy Delete''' under [[WP:CSD#A7]].  No claims of significance here.  A watch repairman.  The Claim that his prowess was so great that his watches were used for artillery timing seems unremarkable: in 1917, a spring-wound watch was about the most accurate timepiece available (whether tuned by Weisman or not) -- artillerymen would have no other sources of timekeeping for "artillery timing" (whatever that is).
