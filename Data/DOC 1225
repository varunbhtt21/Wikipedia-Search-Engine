::I removed the claim that it is a Senecan tragedy, though you might make something of the inspiration from Seneca, as this is a bit of a dud article at the moment; aside from the emasculated plot summary it's two lines.

::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] New and large enough, is referenced and not written in a biased way. Correct people are credited. Hook links to article, Hook is in article, referenced and confirmed by source. [https://books.google.com.au/books?ei=7KtYU92GHoXa2QWA4IHYCg&id=AGIqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Titus+Andronicus&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Comnenus] Hook is 177 characters is short enough. I am going to remove the stub rating as this would disqualify it, really it's a start class. Good to go.
