Does not appear to meet [[WP:PROF]]. PROD was removed by author. [[User:Narutolovehinata5|Narutolovehinata5]] <sup>[[User talk:Narutolovehinata5|t]][[Special:Contributions/Narutolovehinata5|c]][[WP:CSD|csd]][[Special:Newpages|new]]</sup> 11:03, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. The author has moved the article to the Wikipedia namespace and then moved the resulting redirect. An admin will have to sort this out. [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 19:02, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. It is written in the first person, so does not even pretend to be an article. [[User:Imaginatorium|Imaginatorium]] ([[User talk:Imaginatorium|talk]]) 20:08, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I moved it back to article space so that discussion here can continue. It looks like a cv rather than an article, so I think [[WP:NOTLINKEDIN]] applies, and it would also be inappropriate to have this in userspace. He has enough books published (even discounting the edited volumes) that there's a chance of collecting enough independent reviews of them to pass [[WP:AUTHOR]] or maybe even [[WP:PROF]], but I doubt there's much worth saving from this autobiography. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 20:16, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Little sign of impact on scholarly literature. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 22:24, 28 April 2014 (UTC).
* '''Delete'''. It looks like this was copied from his CV. Like [[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) stated, this article would have to be completely overhauled to focus on his works. As it is, it should be removed. --[[User:Kbabej|Kbabej]] ([[User talk:Kbabej|talk]]) 18:14, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
