Title : Log-space computable function
Text : A '''log-space computable function''' is a function <math>f\colon \Sigma^\ast \rightarrow \Sigma^\ast</math> that requires only <math>O(\log n)</math> memory to be computed (this restriction does not apply to the size of the output). The computation is generally done by means of a [[log-space transducer]].

== Log-space reductions ==

The main use for log-space computable functions is in [[log-space reduction]]s. This is a means of transforming an instance of one problem into an instance of another problem, using only logarithmic space.

== Examples of log-space computable functions ==

* Function converting a problem of a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] that [[machine that always halts|decides]] a language ''A'' in log-space to [[ST-connectivity]].<ref>Sipser (2006) International Second Edition, p. 328.</ref>
