'''''48:13''''' is the fifth studio album by English rock band [[Kasabian]]. The album, produced by the band's leader, songwriter, guitarist and second vocalist [[Sergio Pizzorno]]<ref name="qromag">{{cite web|url=http://www.qromag.com/interviews/kasabian/ |title=Kasabian Interview |website=Qromag.com |first=Shaun |last=Gordon |date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/kasabian/news/kasabian-announce-new-album-4813 |title=Kasabian Announce New Album '48:13' |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> and named after its total running time, was released in Germany on 6 June 2014 and in the UK on 9 June 2014.<ref name="German release"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kasabian.co.uk/announcing-new-album-4813/ |title=Announcing the new album 48:13 |website=kasabian.co.uk |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> The album entered at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in its first week of release making it the band's fourth consecutive UK number one album. The album received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics who often praised the music but criticized the lyrics. The lead single "[[Eez-eh]]" was released on 29 April 2014. The second single, "[[Bumblebeee]]", was released on 3 August 2014. The video, directed by [[Alex and Martin|Alex Courtes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vevo.com/watch/kasabian/bumblebeee/GB1101400307|title=bumblebeee - Kasabian|work=VEVO|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> was released in late July.

''48:13'' represents a return to the hip hop influenced sound of their [[Kasabian (album)|debut album]] combined with the space-rock and neo-psychedelic sound of their more recent releases. ''48:13'' is notable for being the band's only album in which Pizzorno's lead vocal duties outweigh that of [[Tom Meighan]], with 5 tracks being sung by Pizzorno, 4 sung by Meighan and 3 tracks which feature both on lead vocals.

==Background==

On 13 November 2013, Kasabian posted a teaser video on their official [[YouTube]] channel, announcing that the band's guitarist [[Sergio Pizzorno]] had been in the studio for the previous six months working on material for the new record.<ref name="Sergery">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTMOdUoKv-E |title=KASABIAN: THE SERGERY ... |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> In an interview with ''QRO'' magazine, the band also revealed that the album would be produced by Pizzorno, who also co-produced their 2011 album ''[[Velociraptor!]]''.<ref name="qromag"/>

On 28 April 2014, Pizzorno said in a statement announcing the release of ''48:13'', "I felt that we had the confidence to be more direct, more honest with this album. I started to strip away layers rather than to just keep adding." Kasabian vocalist [[Tom Meighan]] added, "Less is more, you know? It's direct. It is what it is. Just listen to it. We've had the confidence to lay ourselves bare. Serge has stripped it right back. It's unbelievable."<ref name="MTV"/><ref name="NME full details"/>

Kasabian have listed [[Kanye West]], [[Joe Strummer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IdVutLtQqc|title=Kasabian Interview: How Kanye West Inspired New Album '48:13'}}</ref> [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Death Grips]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Beastie Boys]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/87320/kasabian-our-new-albums-influenced-by-nirvana-+-kanye-west|title=KASABIAN: 'OUR NEW ALBUM'S INFLUENCED BY NIRVANA + KANYE WEST'}}</ref> as influences for the album.

[[Digital Spy]]'s Lisa Wright commented that "Kasabian are not quite up to [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]]'s level of social commentary," but concluded that "when Kasabian accept what they do best and run with it – and at least half of ''48:13'' stays resolutely in this spirit – they're the lairy masters of undeniably pumped-up hedonistic fun."<ref name="Digital Spy"/> Michael Hann of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the album is "properly exciting" and the band members "never forget that their purpose is to entertain," however, "the lyrics throughout are reliably terrible."<ref name="Guardian"/> James Hall of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote a scathing review of Meighan's lofty ambitions for the album, surmising that "no moulds were broken during the making of this album".<ref name="Telegraph"/>
