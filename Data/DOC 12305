The private home of former South African [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Jacob Zuma]], situated about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} south of the rural town of [[Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal|Nkandla]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], commonly referred to as the '''Nkandla homestead''' has been the subject of considerable controversy. The use of public funds to make improvements to the compound, which were said to be for security reasons, which cost over R246 million led to significant media coverage and political opposition. A report of the [[Public Protector (South Africa)|Public Protector]] found that Zuma unduly benefited from these improvements and the Constitutional Court subsequently found that Zuma and the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] failed to uphold the country's constitution after he failed to comply with the Public Protector's report on the matter. Zuma finally apologised for using public money to fund his private residence and in April 2016 he was asked to resign by prominent public figures, including anti-apartheid activist [[Ahmed Kathrada]], due to the scandal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anti-apartheid veteran Kathrada calls for Zuma to resign|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35951006|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> The controversy is sometimes referred to as '''Nkandlagate'''.

The compound is situated on land owned by the [[Ingonyama Trust]], the legal entity that owns the traditional land administered by [[Zulu King]] [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu]] on behalf of the state for the benefit of its occupants.<ref name=news24>[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Zuma-doesnt-own-Nkandla-compound-20121005 "Zuma doesn't own Nkandla compound"] (2012-10-05) ''News24''</ref>

==Improvements made to the compound==
The South African government public works department built a helipad, underground bunkers, security and their accommodation, a firepool, a chicken-run, and fencing around the entire complex. According to the ministerial handbook, the department can spend R100,000 on security improvements at the private houses of public officials. Any costs above that must be covered by the official. Over R200,000,000 has appeared to be allocated by the department.<ref name=news24/> The [[Nkandla compound firepool controversy|controversial firepool]] that was built is described as being part of "questionable security renovations".<ref>{{cite web | last=Laing | first=Aislinn | title='Security' swimming pool lands South Africa's Zuma in hot water | website=[[The Telegraph (U.K.)|The Telegraph]] | date=November 29, 2013 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/10483595/Security-swimming-pool-lands-South-Africas-Zuma-in-hot-water.html | accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref>

Statements by spokesmen have mentioned an apartheid-era law, the [[National Key Points Act, 1980|National Key Points Act]], as explanation for the spending discrepancy, but that spending should come from a different department.<ref>[http://www.citypress.co.za/Opinions/Blogs/I-cant-say-anything-about-Nkandla-even-I-cant-defend-it-20121108 "I can’t say anything about Nkandla, even I can’t defend it" (8 November 2012) ''City Press'']</ref> The leaked documentation also hints at vastly inflated prices for the work done, much of it not going out to tender, and huge consulting fees.<ref name=city>[http://www.citypress.co.za/SouthAfrica/News/Nkandla-prices-a-joke-20121110 "Nkandla prices a joke" (10 November 2012) ''City Press'']</ref>

==History==
Prior to the upgrades, then Deputy President Jacob Zuma was suspended from his post pending his rape trial and allegation of racketeering and corruption. On 6 April 2009 charges against him were dropped by the National Prosecuting Agency, citing political interference. On 9 May 2009 he was inaugurated as the fourth post-apartheid President of South Africa. A month later between the 18th and 29 May a security assessment was carried out at his private residence in Nkandla.<ref name="Mail & Guardian">{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-06-06-who-paid-the-r20m-for-zumas-nkandla-houses|title=Who paid the R20m for Zuma's Nkandla houses?|publisher=[[Mail & Guardian]]|date=6 June 2014|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> Construction started on 29 August 2009.

===''Mail & Guardian''===
The initial story was uncovered by the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' journalists Mandy Rossouw and Chris Roper.<ref name="Zuma's R65m Nkandla splurge">{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2009-12-04-zumas-r65m-nkandla-splurge|title=Zuma's R65m Nkandla splurge|publisher=[[Mail & Guardian]]|date=4 December 2009|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> During that period, it was reported that the expansion to the compound would cost R65 million, paid for by the taxpayer. Expansion to the compound included the installation of a [[helipad]], visitors' center, private [[military hospital]] and parking lot.<ref name="Zuma's R65m Nkandla splurge"/> ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'''s investigative unit, the ''amaBhungane'', uncovered that the initial phase would include building a double-storey house and a guest house at a projected cost of over R19.4 million.<ref name="Mail & Guardian"/> As soon as the story broke out, government denied having a hand in the upgrades. The public work spokesperson contradicted initial statements by the government, "Please note that there is no work or extension project taking place at President Jacob Zuma's compound at Nkandla."<ref name="Zuma's R65m Nkandla splurge"/> During the site visit at the compound by the journalists, a contractor working at the site speculated that the costs of the expansion were likely to later increase.<ref name="Zuma's R65m Nkandla splurge"/>

===Complaints===
Between 13 December 2011 and 12 December 2012 complaints were lodged to the [[Public Protector]]. The first complaint was by a public member{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} who expressed concern over the revelations and requested an investigation into the misuse of state funds, allegations which were published by the M&G. On 30 September 2012, former [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] parliamentary leader{{clarify|date=March 2015}}<!-- NAME? --> also lodged a similar complaint, as did three other members of the public between October and November 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Public Protector==
[[Public Protector]] [[Thuli Madonsela]]'s final report on security upgrades to the compound titled "Secure in comfort" was published on 19 March 2014. The provisional report, published by the Mail & Guardian on 29 November 2013, was entitled "Opulence on a Grand Scale".<ref>{{cite news|title=Nkandla: It's still opulence on a grand scale|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-03-19-news-analysis-its-still-opulence-on-a-grand-scale|accessdate=3 June 2015|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=20 March 2014}}</ref> In both the provisional and final reports Madonsela found that Zuma had benefited unduly from the R246 million the state had spent on the upgrades.<ref>{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Sarah|title=Nkandla report: Zuma unduly benefited from upgrades|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-03-19-nkandla-report-zuma-unduly-benefitted-from-upgrades|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=19 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321101254/http://mg.co.za/article/2014-03-19-nkandla-report-zuma-unduly-benefitted-from-upgrades|archivedate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

"Like all South Africans I have recently read in the media the appalling story of the sums of taxpayers’ money being spent on the private residence of President Jacob Zuma. This is opulence on a grand scale and as an honest, loyal, taxpaying South African I need to understand how this is allowed to happen. Strangely civil society is quiet. This is wrong and highlights the complete disregard which this Government has for the citizens of this country. Where is this money coming from and how has it been approved?"<ref name="Public Protector"/>''

The investigation was conducted in terms of the provisions section 182 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 182 |url=http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/a108-96.pdf |accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref> 1996 (the Constitution) and sections 6 and 7 of the Public Protector Act, 1994 (the Public Protector Act).<ref>{{cite web |title=Public protector act |url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1994-023.pdf |accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref> Part of the investigation was also conducted in terms of sections 3 and 4 of the Executive Members’ Ethics Act, 1998 (the Executive Members’ Ethics Act).<ref name="pprotect.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.pprotect.org/legislation/docs/EXECUTIVE+MEMBERS+ETHICS+ACT+82+OF+1998.pdf|title=Legislation - PPSA Internet|website=www.pprotect.org}}</ref>

===Ministerial Handbook===
In her investigation,{{clarify|date=March 2015}}<!-- IS THIS IN HER REPORT, OR ONLY IN COMMENTS MADE TO THE PRESS? --> Madonsela said that the Ministerial Handbook had a maximum security spending of R100 000 should The Minister of Public Works issue approval. Since the house at Nkandla is privately owned by the President, he would only be granted R100 000 for security measures. Therefore the President would have acted in violation of the Ministerial Handbook.

===Delays===
On 13 January 2013 the Public Protector informed the President that she would be unable to conclude her report within the prescribed 30 day period -  Section 3(2) of the Executive Members' Ethics Act states that: "if the Public Protector reports at the end of the 30 day period that the investigation has not been completed, the Public Protector must submit a report when the investigation has been completed".<ref name="pprotect.org"/> The President suggested to Public protector that she had failed to comply with the 30 day period and to report that the investigation was ongoing and whether the process was justifiable.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The President and his lawyers tried to negate the validity of the investigation by requiring the Public protector to indicate whether President had the power to condone any non-compliance.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} There is no provision in the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], that authorises the President to condone any action or omission of the Public Protector.

===Security concerns===
The security cluster, which is composed of government ministers, raised security questions about the conclusion of the investigation.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Eventually the Public Protector was taken to court on 8 November 2013 for not giving the security cluster enough time to study the Provisional Report released beforehand.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Constitutional Court judgement===
{{main|Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others; Democratic Alliance v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others}}

On 31 March 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] delivered a unanimous ruling stating that the Public Protector's report was binding and Zuma and the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] failed to uphold the country's constitution. The court ordered National Treasury to determine the amount that Zuma must pay back and ordered Zuma to do so within 45 days of the court's approval of the National Treasury report.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Thamm|first1=Marianne|title=Nkandla ConCourt ruling: President Zuma and National Assembly in breach of Constitution|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-03-31-nkandla-concourt-ruling-president-zuma-and-national-assembly-in-breach-of-constitution/#.Vvz5raT5jIW|accessdate=31 March 2016|work=Daily Maverick|date=31 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Breach of Constitution |url=http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3834/24efe59744c642a1a02360235f4d026b.pdf |accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref>

==Political fallout==
Police prevented [[Helen Zille]] from approaching the compound on 4 November 2012, she intended "to see what a R250-million renovation with public money looks like."<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-11-04-police-stop-zille-at-nkandla "Police stop Zille at Nkandla" (4 November 2012) ''Mail & Guardian'']</ref> She was referring to the security upgrades of R246 million which is multiple times larger than security upgrades to previous presidents' homes.<ref name=cp>{{cite web | title=Our expensive president |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/213945724/Our-expensive-president |publisher=City Press | date=23 March 2014 | accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=beeld1>{{cite news|title=Doen nou die regte ding|url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2014/03/23/11/gvranjeni-B2-02-043_30_0_397285415.html |accessdate=24 March 2014 |newspaper=Beeld |date=23 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=beeld2>{{cite news|title=Nkandla |url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/2014/03/20/4/10goedoonkandla_30_0_389668235.html |accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=Beeld|date=20 March 2014}}</ref> Zuma's spokesperson [[Mac Maharaj]] said the opposition party adopted a "cowboy style" approach to getting the answers it wanted, and questioned Zille's use of the word "compound" to describe the homestead.<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-11-05-zille-mac-go-at-each-other-over-nkandla "Zille, Mac go at each other over Nkandla" (5 November 2012) ''Mail & Guardian'']</ref>

[[COSATU]], a member of the governing tri-partite alliance, asked for the overpricing to be reviewed.<ref>[http://www.cosatu.org.za/show.php?ID=6686 "COSATU wants Public Protector to reveal truth about Nkandla" (12 November 2012) ''COSATU'']</ref>

Shortly after the publication of Madonsela's report, the DA sent a bulk [[Short Message Service|text message]] to Gauteng voters ahead of the [[2014 South African general election|2014 general election]] which reads: "The Nkandla report shows how Zuma stole your money to build his R246m home. Vote DA on 7 May to beat corruption. Together for change." The ANC submitted an urgent application to the [[Gauteng Division|South Gauteng High Court]] to stop distribution of the text message on the grounds that it violated the Electoral Act. On 4 April 2014, the court ruled that the wording of the message was [[fair comment]] and dismissed the ANC's application with costs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Setumo|title=Nkandla SMS court case postponed|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/04/01/nkandla-sms-court-case-postponed|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=Business Day|date=1 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501111929/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/04/01/nkandla-sms-court-case-postponed|archivedate=1 May 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ANC case against DA 'Zuma stole your money for Nkandla' sms dismissed with costs|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/04/04/anc-case-against-da-zuma-stole-your-money-for-nkandla-sms-dismissed-with-costs|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=Times LIVE|date=4 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404210757/http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/04/04/anc-case-against-da-zuma-stole-your-money-for-nkandla-sms-dismissed-with-costs|archivedate=4 April 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>  The ANC was granted leave to appeal the decision.<ref>{{cite news|title=ANC granted leave to appeal in DA SMS case|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/anc-granted-leave-appeal-da-sms-case/|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=City Press|date=12 April 2014}}</ref> On 6 May 2014, the Electoral Court ruled that the DA must retract the text message, finding that it wrongly targeted Zuma personally instead of the systematic failures highlighted in Madonsela's report.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grobler|first=Andre|title=Court orders DA to retract Nkandla SMS|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-05-06-court-orders-da-to-retract-nkandla-sms|accessdate=7 May 2014|newspaper=Mail & Guardian|date=6 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507080132/http://mg.co.za/article/2014-05-06-court-orders-da-to-retract-nkandla-sms|archivedate=7 May 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> The court case was ultimately won by the DA when the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] set aside the Electoral Court ruling on 19 January 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=DA's 'Zuma stole money' SMS okay, says Constitutional Court|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2015/01/19/das-zuma-stole-money-sms-okay-says-constitutional-court|accessdate=14 February 2015|work=Business Day|agency=SAPA|date=20 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214151648/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2015/01/19/das-zuma-stole-money-sms-okay-says-constitutional-court|archivedate=14 February 2015}}</ref>
