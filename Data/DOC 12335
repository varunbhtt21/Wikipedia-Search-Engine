Title : COQ6
Text : {{Infobox_gene}}

'''Coenzyme Q6 monooxygenase''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the COQ6 [[gene]].<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: Coenzyme Q6 monooxygenase | url =  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51004 }}</ref>

==Function==

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the ubiH/COQ6 family. It is an evolutionarily conserved monooxygenase required for the biosynthesis of [[coenzyme Q10]] (or ubiquinone), which is an essential component of the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]], and one of the most potent lipophilic [[antioxidant]]s implicated in the protection of cell damage by [[reactive oxygen species]]. [[Gene knockdown|knockdown]] of this gene in mouse and zebrafish results in decreased growth due to increased [[apoptosis]].<ref name="entrez"/>

== Clinical significance ==

Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive coenzyme Q10 deficiency-6 (COQ10D6), which manifests as [[nephrotic syndrome]] with [[sensorineural deafness]]. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.<ref name="pmid21540551">{{cite journal |vauthors=Heeringa SF, Chernin G, Chaki M, Zhou W, Sloan AJ, Ji Z, Xie LX, Salviati L, Hurd TW, Vega-Warner V, Killen PD, Raphael Y, Ashraf S, Ovunc B, Schoeb DS, McLaughlin HM, Airik R, Vlangos CN, Gbadegesin R, Hinkes B, Saisawat P, Trevisson E, Doimo M, Casarin A, Pertegato V, Giorgi G, Prokisch H, Rötig A, Nürnberg G, Becker C, Wang S, Ozaltin F, Topaloglu R, Bakkaloglu A, Bakkaloglu SA, Müller D, Beissert A, Mir S, Berdeli A, Varpizen S, Zenker M, Matejas V, Santos-Ocaña C, Navas P, Kusakabe T, Kispert A, Akman S, Soliman NA, Krick S, Mundel P, Reiser J, Nürnberg P, Clarke CF, Wiggins RC, Faul C, Hildebrandt F | title = COQ6 mutations in human patients produce nephrotic syndrome with sensorineural deafness | journal = J.
