Unnecessary duplication and no logic to have a separate article. All information already there in the separate articles. So merge into [[Indian general election, 1951]],[[Indian general election, 1957]],[[Indian general election, 1962]],[[Indian general election, 1967]] and [[Indian general election, 1971]].

*'''Support''' Completely pointless when there are individual articles for the elections and a main [[Elections in India]] article. [[User:Number 57|<font color="orange">Number</font>]] [[User talk:Number 57|<font color="green">5</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Number 57|<font color="blue">7</font>]] 11:51, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - A prod of the article was previously contested because content had been copied from this article into other articles (I think the ones that Shyamsunder is suggesting a merge to, but I'm not sure).  If content was copied, then the history needs to be kept somewhere, so the article can't be deleted.  Instead it could be redirected to one of the articles where content was merged (or anywhere else that is appropriate).

**Perhaps just redirect to [[Elections in India]]? [[User:Number 57|<font color="orange">Number</font>]] [[User talk:Number 57|<font color="green">5</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Number 57|<font color="blue">7</font>]] 15:44, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
