Fiji mainly rely on foreign imports for their daily needs since those are not being produced locally. Fiji mainly traded with Australia and New Zealand, and Indonesia saw this as an opportunity to enter the local market. Indonesian exports to Fiji are mainly daily products such as paper, fiber, textiles, electrical equipments, home appliances and electronics, furniture, gift and craft, fashion products, convenience foods, coffee, shampoo, soap, detergent, plastics, chemicals, automotive and parts, and also agricultural equipments.<ref name="KBRISuva"/>
