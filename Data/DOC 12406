'''Elm Grove''' is a mainly residential area of [[Brighton]], part of the English coastal city of [[Brighton and Hove]].  The densely populated district lies on a steep hill northeast of the city centre and developed in the second half of the 19th century after the laying out of a major west–east road, also called Elm Grove.  Terraced houses, small shops and architecturally impressive public buildings characterise the streetscape: within the area are a major hospital, two churches (all with [[listed building]] status) and a [[List of former board schools in Brighton and Hove|former board school]], as well as Brighton's oldest council houses and an interwar council estate.

The long, steep road has its origins in a cross-country [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]],<ref name="Fines6"/> and it remained a rural track until the 19th century.  It is now known for its mature elm trees,<ref name="BHUCS43">{{cite web |url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/downloads/conservation/UrbanStdy_Hanover_Elm_Grove_final.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hanover & Elm Grove Neighbourhood |date=January 2009 |work=Brighton & Hove Urban Characterisation Study |publisher=Brighton & Hove City Council (Design & Conservation Team) |location=Brighton |page=43 |accessdate=28 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PB3X7nfk?url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/downloads/conservation/UrbanStdy_Hanover_Elm_Grove_final.pdf |archivedate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> and although their numbers have declined some still line the steep road, which links the main road to [[Lewes]] with [[Brighton Racecourse]] and the city's eastern suburbs.  The road is also a busy bus route, but a tram route which ran along it and a railway branch line which passed through the area by viaduct and tunnel closed in the 20th century.  Although surrounded on several sides by other inner suburbs such as [[Hanover, Brighton|Hanover]] and [[Round Hill, Brighton|Round Hill]], Elm Grove is close to large areas of open space such as Race Hill, Tenantry Down and [[Cemeteries and crematoria in Brighton and Hove|Brighton's extensive Victorian cemeteries]].

Brighton and Hove City Council's ''Urban Characterisation Study'' of the Hanover and Elm Grove districts describes the Elm Grove area{{#tag:ref|Under the name "Hartington character area" within the ''Hanover and Elm Grove neighbourhood''.<ref name="BHUCS45"/>|group=note}} as a "high density [[Victorian era|Victorian]] residential area following the contours of the steep valley side".

There is also limited tree cover, except for Elm Grove itself which is lined with mature [[elm]] trees.<ref name="BHUCS45"/>  Elms are ideally suited to Brighton's chalky soil and salt-laden air.

Elm Grove (the road) forms the northern limit of the Hanover suburb.  Although developed at a similar time to the streets to the north, Hanover originally had a solidly working-class character, with many streets of small terraced houses.  Although terraced housing is also common north of Elm Grove, there is a much wider range of housing styles and sizes, and the area developed a more mixed character as a result.<ref name="Fines63">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=63.}}</ref>  Brighton's extensive chain of Victorian cemeteries, set into an undulating {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} valley formerly used as farmland, lie immediately north of Hartington Road and separate the Elm Grove district from the [[Bear Road, Brighton|Bear Road/Coombe Road district]],<ref name="NEB51">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=51.}}</ref> another hillside area of dense terraced housing.<ref name="NEB21">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=21.}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Derelict Villa, 18 Wellington Road, Brighton (December 2013).JPG|thumb|right|The area's earliest houses were detached villas on Wellington Road.  Number 18, derelict in 2014, is the only survivor.]]
Several [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]] have been identified running across the area covered by the city of Brighton and Hove.  One ran west–east inland from the coast along the line of the present Old Shoreham Road.  After crossing the [[London to Brighton Way]] possibly where Preston Circus is now, it continued eastwards up the east side of the Wellesbourne valley on to the ridge of the [[South Downs]] to [[Lewes]], where it became a [[Ridgeway (road)|ridgeway]] as it crossed [[Newmarket Hill, Sussex|Newmarket Hill]] and [[Kingston near Lewes|Kingston Hill]].<ref name="Fines6">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=6.}}</ref>

Brighton Racecourse opened on [[Whitehawk Hill]] to the northeast of Brighton in 1783,<ref name="Fines28">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=28.}}</ref> and the ancient track—which climbed a long, steep west-facing slope at this point—was used by people visiting it from central Brighton.  As the town grew, it became a more important route, and in 1852 elm trees were planted along each side<ref name="EncB63">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§63.}}</ref> by [[Amon Henry Wilds]] on behalf of the Brighton Town Commissioners, for whom he had previously served as an officer.<ref name="BTBP217">{{Harvnb|Dale|1976|p=217.}}</ref>  The name Elm Grove was given at this time.  The only building north of the road was Hanover Mill, a [[post mill]] erected {{circa}} 1838 and demolished in the 1890s when Bernard Road was built on the site.<ref name="EncB63"/>  Lewes Road itself was mostly undeveloped as well,<ref name="Antram179">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=179.}}</ref> apart from six [[almshouse]]s built on the south side of its junction with Elm Grove.  These were the first part of what later became the [[Percy and Wagner Almshouses]] after six more were added in 1859.<ref name="NEB8–9">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|pp=8–9.}}</ref>

[[File:Housing at Elm Grove-Wellington Street junction, Brighton (January 2014).JPG|thumb|left|Housing development had reached Wellington Street ''(right)'' by 1864.]]
The first residential development took place between 1854 and 1858 at Melbourne Street and on Wellington Road,<ref name="EncB49">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=§49.}}</ref> which led northeastwards from the bottom of Elm Grove.  Of the detached villas in spacious grounds, only one remains, at number 18.

[[File:Housing on Hartington Road, Brighton (January 2014).JPG|thumb|right|Hartington Road's housing is later, larger and predominantly features red brick.]]
The top (east) end of the road was undeveloped until the late 19th century, except for the Brighton Workhouse—built in 1865–67 to replace an earlier building established in the [[West Hill, Brighton|West Hill]] area in 1822.<ref name="Antram177">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=177.}}</ref>  (The new workhouse also housed one of three fire-hoses which the town's earliest fire department, the Brighton Fire Establishment, could use in conjunction with its fire engines.)<ref name="NEB123">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=123.}}</ref> Residential development gradually spread eastwards up the hill from the 1860s, though.  Between 1859 and 1864 Elm Grove itself was built up as far as Wellington Street, which was also laid out at the time.  Infill development within this area continued in the late 1860s with Hastings Road and Franklin Road, followed in the early 1870s by Agnes Street, Franklin Street, De Montfort Road, Fairlight Place and St Martin's Place.<ref name="EncB49"/>  Meanwhile, the [[Kemp Town branch line]] had opened in 1869,<ref name="Harding3"/> forming the eastern limit of the residential area until 1880 when Bonchurch Road, Brading Road and Totland Road were built further up the hill on a north–south alignment parallel with the line.  Newmarket Road, Upper Wellington Road and Normanton Street filled in more gaps in the meantime, and Elm Grove itself was continuously built up as far as Totland Road by 1884.  Hartington Road, the area's other major road, developed between 1885 and 1889 (north side) and a decade later on the south side.  East of Bernard Road to the top of the hill remained undeveloped until 1900 but was quickly built up thereafter.  The latest building took place around the junction of Whippingham Road and Hartington Road, between 1915 and 1919.<ref name="EncB49"/>

Among the houses built during this period of intense development were Brighton's earliest [[council house]]s.  Two landowners donated land north of Elm Grove in 1897, and simple [[Polychrome|polychromatic]] brick cottages were built to commemorate [[Queen Victoria#Diamond Jubilee|Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee]].

[[File:William Clarke Park, Hartington Road, Brighton (January 2014).JPG|thumb|right|William Clarke Park occupies a former railway cutting.]]
