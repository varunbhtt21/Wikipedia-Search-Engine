The '''La Barrancosa Dam''', formerly known as '''Jorge Cepernic Dam''', is a [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] being built on the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]] about {{Convert|115|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Puerto Santa Cruz]] in [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina]]. It was renamed after the former governor of Santa Cruz [[Jorge Cepernic]]. A consortium led by China's [[Gezhouba Group]] was awarded the contract to build the Jorge Cepernic Dam and the [[Néstor Kirchner Dam]] upstream in August 2013. The consortium will also fund the construction. Both dams are expected to cost nearly US$4.8 billion.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://en.mercopress.com/2013/08/22/china-will-build-and-finance-two-dams-in-patagonia-equivalent-to-10-of-argentine-power-demand | title=China will build and finance two dams in Patagonia equivalent to 10% of Argentine power demand | date=22 August 2013 | accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> It will be built by the firm ''Electroingeniería'', led by Osvaldo Acosta and Gerardo Ferreyra.<ref>[http://www.perfil.com/economia/Represas-Kirchner-y-Cepernic--La-ultima-gran-joya-de-los-reyes-de-la-obra-publica-20130803-0029.html Represas Kirchner y Cepernic | La última gran joya de los reyes de la obra pública] {{es}}</ref> The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and its power station will have an installed capacity of 600 MW.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.obraspublicas.gov.ar/documentos/Libros_Respresas/Libro_Ingles.pdf | title=Hydroelectric Projects in the Santa Cruz River | work=Water and Energy National and Regional Integration | agency=Government of Argentina |page=95| accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

In July 2015 machines arrived in Santa Cruz for the construction of the dams.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151009200506/http://www.minplan.gob.ar/noticia/21931/arribaron-maquinas-para-las-represas-kirchner-cepernic.html Ministerio de Planificación - Arribaron máquinas para las Represas Kirchner-Cepernic <nowiki>[web.archive.org]</nowiki>]</ref>
