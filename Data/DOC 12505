'''Edward Hide''' (born 12 April 1937)<ref>{{cite web|title=Dobbin among those celebrating on Wednesday|url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/news/dobbin-among-those-celebrating-on-wednesday/281675|website=Racing Post|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref> was a multiple [[British Classic Races|classic]] winning [[British people|British]] [[jockey]]. He was, for a time at his peak, the sixth most successful jockey in British racing history<ref name=YP091113/> and remains the ninth most successful jockey over 30 years after his retirement.<ref name="RP">{{cite web|last1=Porteous|first1=Lewis|title=Spencer in good company as he rides 2,000th British winner|url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/spencer-in-good-company-as-he-rides-2-000th-british-winner/296638|website=Racing Post|accessdate=14 August 2017}}</ref>

During his career he was mainly seen on the northern and Scottish racing circuit. In 1974 he set a record of 137 winners for a jockey based in the north of Britain, a record which stood until [[Kevin Darley]] passed it in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=Greg|title=Racing: Darley's determination finds reward: A northern-based jockey's 138th winner means there is no place for Hide in the record books|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing-darleys-determination-finds-reward-a-northern-based-jockeys-138th-winner-means-there-is-no-1506413.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=14 August 2017|date=24 November 1993}}</ref> Hide was, however, also successful on big race days in the south, his classic race victories being the 1973 [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] on [[Morston (horse)|Morston]], two [[1,000 Guineas]] - [[Waterloo (horse)|Waterloo]] (1972) and Mrs McArdy (1977) - and two [[St. Leger Stakes|St. Legers]] on [[Cantelo]] (1959) and [[Julio Mariner]] (1978). Other big race victories included the [[Lincoln Handicap|Lincoln]] (three times), [[Northumberland Plate]], [[Magnet Cup]], [[November Handicap]], [[Nunthorpe Stakes]], [[July Cup]], [[King's Stand Stakes]] and the 1967 [[Ayr Gold Cup]] on Farm Walk.<ref name=Record010324/> He was identifiable to racing fans by a toothy grin.<ref name=Record010324/>

He retired in 1986 after riding 2,593 winners in Britain. Only eight jockeys have ridden more winners in Britain as of 2017, and Hide's total is the highest for a rider who was never British champion jockey.<ref name="RP"/> At first, he planned to be a [[Jockey Club]] stewards' secretary, but was turned down for the role. Instead, he ended up as agent to [[Walter Swinburn]], followed by a spell as assistant trainer to [[John Gosden]] and as a racing manager. He also bred horses, including the winners of around 80 races from a farm near [[Malton, North Yorkshire]].<ref name=Record010324/> More recently, he was in the news when it was revealed a lifetime racecourse entry badge he had been given after his retirement was surprisingly retracted. His case was taken up by the [[Professional Jockeys' Association]].<ref name=RP090823/>

His nephew, Philip Hide, was a [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] jockey on the southern circuit<ref name=Record010324/> and became a racehorse trainer after his retirement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goulding|first=Chris|title=Former jockey Philip Hide's new career|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/horseracing/357844/Former-jockey-Philip-Hide-s-new-career|work=express.co.uk|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
