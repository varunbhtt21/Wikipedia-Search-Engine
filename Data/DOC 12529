== History ==
During the gothic times, there were a fortress at the place of recent chateau, and at the year 1550 was listed as deserted. At 1560 were the ruins rebuilt as chateau. 
In the 17th century, one hundred years after Libochovice was declared the town by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I.]], there was a huge fire, which destroyed almost half of the city. However, it was not for the first time. The city underwent three fires altogether, during which also Libochovice chateau was severely damaged. 

The current image of the chateau comes from the 17th century, when it was bought by Gundakar of [[Dietrichstein]]. He asked Italian architect Antonio della Porta to restore it. Therefore, the Italian influence is evident. Antonio della Porta renewed this chateau between years 1683 - 1690, economic buildings were restored between years 1690 - 1697.

Next renewing of chateau was between years 1900 - 1914 by E. Fiala. 

The park was designed in French style by Jan Tulipán. During the 19th century, it was re-designed in English style and later restored again in the original design.
