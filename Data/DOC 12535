'''Li Jingda''' (李景達) (924-971<ref name=SGCQ19>''[[Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms]]'', [[:zh:s:十國春秋/卷019|vol. 19]].</ref>), né '''Xu Jingda''' (徐景達), [[courtesy name]] '''Zitong''' (子通), nickname '''Yushi''' (雨師), formally '''Crown Prince Zhaoxiao''' (昭孝太弟), was an imperial prince (but not [[crown prince]]) of the [[History of China|Chinese]] [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period]] state [[Southern Tang]].

== Background ==
Xu Jingda was born in [[924]], as the fourth son of his parents [[Li Bian|Xu Zhigao]] and [[Empress Song (Southern Tang)|Lady Song Fujin]].  (Older than he were [[Li Jing (Southern Tang)|Xu Jingtong]], [[Xu Jingqian]], and [[Li Jingsui|Xu Jingsui]]; a younger half-brother, Li Jingti (李景逷), born of Lady Zhong, would be born later.)  At that time, Xu Zhigao was newly made the junior regent for the state of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]], and there happened to be a severe drought, causing Xu Zhigao much distress.  He sacrificed for rain, and it happened that Xu Jingda was born that day.  Xu Zhigao was happy and believed his birth to be a good omen, and therefore gave him the nickname of Yushi (meaning, "army of rain").  As he grew in childhood, it was said that he had an impressive appearance and a direct, magnanimous disposition, unlike other children, and Xu Zhigao much favored him.<ref name=SGCQ19/>  At some point, he married a daughter of the senior Wu general [[Li Decheng]].<ref name=SGCQ7>''Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms'', [[:zh:s:十國春秋/卷007|vol. 7]].</ref>

== During Li Bian's reign ==
In [[937]], Xu Zhigao, then regent, had Wu's emperor [[Yang Pu]] yield the throne to him, ending Wu and starting a new state of [[Southern Tang]].  While Xu Jingda's older brothers Xu Jingtong (whose name was then changed to Xu Jing) and Xu Jingsui were given princely titles later that year, Xu Jingda initially was not, but was only given the title of Duke of Shouyang.  (The other older brother, Xu Jingqian, had died shortly before the state transition due to illness.)<ref name=ZZTJ281>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷281|vol. 281]].</ref>  In [[939]], he, and the rest of his family, took the family name of [[Li (李)|Li]], which was his father's birth name.  (Xu Zhigao also took a new personal name and became known as Li Bian.)  Li Jingda received a princely title shortly after — variously referred to as Prince of Xuancheng<ref name=ZZTJ282>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷282|vol. 282]].</ref> or Prince of Xin.<ref name=SGCQ19/>  As a result of the name change, a controversy developed over whether he could remain married to his wife Princess Li, as a marriage between two people of the same family name was disallowed under Chinese traditions against endogamy.  Li Bian decreed that due to Li Decheng's great accomplishments, the marriage shall remain valid, and that the princess was to take on the new family name of Nanping (as her father Li Decheng carried the title of Prince of Nanping).<ref name=SGCQ7/>  Throughout the years, Li Bian, impressed by Li Jingda's open disposition, had considered making him the heir to the throne, and the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Song Qiqiu]] had also often praised his talent.  However, Li Bian hesitated, and eventually did not do so, because Li Jing was older.<ref name=ZZTJ283>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷283|vol. 283]].</ref>  (Still, Li Jing was never created [[crown prince]], although his title of Prince of Qi was ceremonially greater than any other prince's as it was a title that both Li Bian and his adoptive father [[Xu Wen]], who was Li Bian's predecessor as regent, had carried (in Xu Wen's case, posthumously).)<ref name=ZZTJ281/><ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷276|vol. 276]].</ref>

== During Li Jing's reign ==
Li Bian died in [[943]], and Li Jing succeeded him as emperor.  Li Jing created Li Jingda the greater title of Prince of E.  Li Jingda apparently also received additional titles of defender of the eastern capital Jiangdu (江都, in modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]), military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]] — a completely honorary office as Tianping was then the territory of Southern Tang's northern neighbor [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]]), and honorary chancellor title of ''Shizhong'' (侍中).<ref name=ZZTJ283/>

Later in the year, believing that it was Li Bian's wish, Li Jing publicly declared his intent to eventually pass the throne, in order, to Li Jingsui and Li Jingda.  He thus gave the title of Prince of Qi to Li Jingsui and had Li Jingsui move into the eastern palace — the traditional residence for crown princes, although Li Jingsui did not receive that title at that time — and gave Li Jingsui's old title, Prince of Yan, to Li Jingda.  Li Jingsui and Li Jingda also, respectively, were made the generalissimo of the armies of all circuits and deputy generalissimo.  They tried to decline these honors, but Li Jing would not let them.<ref name=ZZTJ283/>

Meanwhile, by [[945]], Song Qiqiu was in retirement, but unhappily so.<ref name=ZZTJ283/><ref name=ZZTJ285>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷285|vol. 285]].</ref>  In [[945]], Li Jingda's staff member Xie Zhongxuan (謝仲宣) argued to Li Jingda that leaving Song, whose reputation as a top adviser to LI Bian was well-known, in retirement would merely cause the people to be disappointed.  Li Jingda relayed Xie's arguments to Li Jing, who agreed, and therefore had Li Jingda go see Song to recall him to the imperial government.<ref name=ZZTJ285/>

In [[947]], Li Jing formally created Li Jingsui crown prince.  He gave the Prince of Qi title to Li Jingda, and the Prince of Yan title that Li Jingda carried to his (Li Jing's) oldest son [[Li Hongji]], who previously was Prince of Nanchang.  Li Jingda and Li Hongji were also made generalissimo and deputy generalissimo, respectively.  Meanwhile, in the frequent feasts that Li Jing had with family members and close associates, Li Jing's close associates [[Feng Yanji]], Feng Yanlu (馮延魯), Wei Cen (魏岑), and [[Chen Jue (Southern Tang)|Chen Jue]] spent much time in flattery and inappropriate humor, drawing frequent rebukes from the stern Li Jingda.  On one occasion, Feng Yanji, who actually had no part in Li Jing's plan to eventually pass the throne to Li Jingsui and Li Jingda, wanted to nevertheless create the impression that he was involved, to draw gratitude from the two princes.  He thus pretended to be drunk, and he caressed Li Jingda's back and stated, "You should not forget me!"  Li Jingda, finding this inappropriate, was incensed, and he immediately went to see Li Jing, requesting Feng's execution.  Li Jing had to spend much time dissuading him.  The official Zhang Yi (張易), however, later pointed out to Li Jingda that his repeated attempts to remove Li Jing's close associates were not having the effect that he wanted, and might create incentive for them to falsely accuse him.  Li Jingda saw Zhang's point and agreed; after that, he often declined to attend feasts to avoid conflict with Li Jing's associates.<ref name=ZZTJ286>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷286|vol. 286]].</ref>

In [[956]], Southern Tang was under a major attack by its northern neighbor [[Later Zhou]] (which had succeeded Later Jin's successor state [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]]).  Li Jing commissioned Li Jingda to command the main Southern Tang army to face the main Later Zhou army, commanded by the Later Zhou emperor [[Chai Rong|Guo Rong]].  However, he also commissioned Chen as Li Jingda's army monitor, and Chen became effectively in command.  (The official [[Han Xizai]] tried to argue against this, pointing out that there was no one more trusted and honored than Li Jingda, and that having an army monitor was inappropriate.)<ref name=ZZTJ293>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷293|vol. 293]].</ref>  Indeed, it was said that because Li Jingda lacked talent in military matters,<ref name=SGCQ19/> he essentially was only signing orders that Chen had already decided on, and that the army had low morale as a result.  In particular, one of the tasks that Li Jingda's army, 50,000-men strong, was supposed to carry out was to relieve the Later Zhou siege on the important border city Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern [[Lu'an]], [[Anhui]]), but while the army advanced to Hao Prefecture (濠州, in modern [[Chuzhou]], [[Anhui]]), not far from Shou, it did not advance further to actually engage the Later Zhou sieging army.  He did dispatch some generals to make repeated attempts to advance toward Shou, but each time was repelled by the Later Zhou forces.  He also rejected the proposal by Shou's commander Liu Renzhan (劉仁瞻) for Liu to lead his army out of the city for a pitched battle with the Later Zhou army.  Faced with the continuing siege, Liu fell ill.  Further, at this time, Chen tried to strip the successful, but often disobedient general Zhu Yuan (朱元) of his command, causing Zhu to surrender to Later Zhou and further weakening the Southern Tang position.  A final attempt by Li Jingda's army to assault the Later Zhou sieging army resulted in a crushing defeat for Southern Tang, with the generals Xu Wenzhen (許文稹), [[Bian Hao]], and Yang Shouzhong (楊守忠) all captured.  Li Jingda and Chen had to flee back to the capital [[Nanjing|Jinling]].  With Liu near death from his illness, the Southern Tang garrison at Shou surrendered.<ref name=ZZTJ293/>

In light of the mounting defeats, Li Jingsui, who had previously declined the crown prince position, again offered to yield the position, pointing out that he was unable to aid the state while Li Hongji, who was in charge of the southeastern front with [[Wuyue]] (which, as a Later Zhou vassal state, had tried to invade Southern Tang as well but had been repelled by Li Hongji's subordinate Chai Zaiyong (柴再用)).  Li Jingda also offered to resign as generalissimo.  Li Jing agreed this time, creating Li Hongji crown prince to replace Li Jingsui, while sending Li Jingsui and Li Jingda out of the capital to serve as regional governors, as they requested.  In Li Jingda's case, he was initially given the titles of generalissimo of Zhexi (浙西, i.e., Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]])) as well as the commandant of Zhenhai's capital Run Prefecture (潤州).  However, as Zhenhai was then still involved in the campaign against Later Zhou, he declined it, and was thereafter made the commandant of Fu Prefecture (撫州, in modern [[Fuzhou, Jiangxi|Fuzhou]], [[Jiangxi]]).  (Li Jing was eventually able to negotiate a peace agreement with Guo, with Southern Tang formally becoming a vassal state to Later Zhou and ceding all of its territory north of the [[Yangtze River]] to Later Zhou.)<ref name=ZZTJ294>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷294|vol. 294]].</ref>  It was said that after the defeat at Shou, Li Jingda spent much of his time in drinking, and that, at Fu Prefecture, he did not attend much to the governance of the circuit (i.e., Zhaowu Circuit (昭武), headquartered at Fu) and entrusted the matters to his staff members.<ref name=SGCQ19/>

== During Li Yu's reign ==
Li Jing died in [[961]], and was succeeded by his son [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Li Congjia]], who then changed his name to Li Yu.<ref name=XZZTJ2>''[[Xu Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:續資治通鑑/卷002|vol. 2]].</ref>  (Li Hongji had died earlier, and was succeeded as crown prince by Li Congjia, who was his younger brother.)<ref name=ZZTJ294/>  Li Yu bestowed on Li Jingda the additional honorary titles of ''Taishi'' (太師) and ''Shangshu Ling'' (尚書令), showing great respect to him.<ref name=SGCQ19/>

Li Jingda died in [[971]].  By his own wishes, he was buried at [[Mount Lu]].  Li Yu posthumously honored him crown prince.<ref name=SGCQ19/>
