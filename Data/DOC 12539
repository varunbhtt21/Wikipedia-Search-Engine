The '''On the Run Tour''' was a co-headlining stadium [[concert tour|tour]] by American performer [[Beyoncé]] and [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Jay-Z]], also known as duo [[The Carters]]. The joint tour came shortly after the two had finished their own solo tours — Beyoncé's [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] and Jay-Z's [[Magna Carter World Tour]] (both 2013–2014). The tour's name spins off from the 2013 song "[[Part II (On the Run)]]", included on Jay-Z's album ''[[Magna Carta Holy Grail]]'', on which Beyoncé features. An official poster for the tour was released along with the announcement of the venture, showing Beyoncé and Jay-Z embracing whilst dressed in black ski masks, following the [[Fugitive|criminal "on the lam"]] narrative found in the couples' 2002 first single together, "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]" and "Part II (On the Run)".

To promote the tour, a [[wikt:faux|faux]] [[Trailer (promotion)|movie trailer]] video was premiered in May 2014 entitled "Run" (stylized as "RUN"). The video, which features eight celebrity [[cameo appearance]]s, showcases the couple in a variety of [[Bonnie and Clyde]] style, action and gun packed situations. The tour itself was noted to follow this same theme throughout, with similar video interludes incorporated into the production of the show. Critics generally lauded the tour, praising the extravagant set list, dynamic and detailed theme and story of the show and both artists' performance abilities, however some felt the on stage chemistry between the couple was not what it could have been.

Due to the large demand and tickets selling out in minutes in multiple locations, extra tour dates were added to the itinerary. The tour became a commercial success, grossing $96 million in the first 19 North American shows and $109.7 million in total as well as attendance totalling at 979,781. It was the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2014, according to ''[[Pollstar]]'s'' annual year end tour chart. The show [[On the Run Tour: Beyoncé and Jay-Z (TV program)|was broadcast in its entirety]] on September 20, 2014, airing on the US television network [[HBO]], following the taping of the two concerts in Paris, France, where the tour concluded.

Rumours of a co-headlining stadium tour from Beyoncé and Jay-Z first circulated on April 15, 2014, when [[Page Six]] reported that a source had revealed the "[[Supercouple|power couple]]" would be partaking in a 20 stadium US tour starting in late June and that a performance in New York could take place on July 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pagesix.com/2014/04/15/beyonce-and-jay-z-to-go-on-tour-this-summer/|title=Beyoncé & Jay Z touring together this summer|work=[[Page Six]]|first=Stephanie|last=Smith|date=April 15, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Confirmation of the rumours started to arise when it was reported that the [[Pasadena City Council]] were holding a meeting to decide whether to approve the couples' proposed concert on August 2, 2014 at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. The vote on the matter took place because the Rose Bowl – nestled within an affluent, residential neighbourhood – has a limited number of events permitted per year of twelve, which can only be extended if approved by the city council. The concert was ultimately reported to be the eighteenth approved event of 2014 for the Rose Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2014/04/22/proposed-jay-z-beyonce-concert-gets-pasadena-city-councils-approval/|title=Proposed Jay Z, Beyonce Concert Gets Pasadena City Council's Approval|work=[[KTLA]] (Channel 5)|first=Melissa|last=Pamer|date=April 22, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>

The tour was "conceived and launched fast compared to most stadium tours" according to Live Nation, who noted that most tours of this nature take more than a year of planning, compared to the On the Run Tour that took around one month. "It came together quite quickly, around mid-March", Omar Al-Joulani of Live Nation North America commented. "By April, we had everything together, and once the routing was in place we had about three weeks until the tour was announced."<ref name="100 million" /> Following the general sale of tour dates, fans were left concerned as the July 11, 2014 show in [[East Rutherford]], [[New Jersey]] remained pending to go on sale for many weeks, despite all other dates already being available to the public. Some reports stated that the reason for this was that the state of New Jersey had implemented a legislation resulting in 95% of tickets for an event having to be available to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.tickpick.com/jay-z-and-beyonce-at-metlife-stadium-maybe-not/|title=Jay Z and Beyonce at MetLife Stadium?

The tour was stated to have a running theme throughout the performances of being "on the run" by the ''[[Miami New Times]]'', whether it is from "the media, their place in pop music, the haters, the bullshit and sometimes even each other". When explaining the concept of the tour and its accompanying videos in a telephone conversation to New York-based director Dikayal Rimmasch, Jay-Z stated "We're not trying to do this literally, it's not that we're Bonnie and Clyde. We're on the run from everything. On the run from becoming a cliché. On the run from doing the same thing again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/beyonce/news/beyonce-and-jay-z-unveil-first-bang-bang-film|title=Beyoncé And Jay Z Unveil First 'Bang Bang' Film|publisher=[[MTV]].

Beyoncé was backed by an all female band during her solo songs, whilst Jay-Z was accompanied by other male instrumentalists; however both artist's musicians collaborated for the majority of the performance. Video interludes filled with "cop chases and other violent outbursts" carried the storytelling between songs. The performances of the joint tour was said to be split up similarly to Jay-Z's previous joint venture with [[Kanye West]], the [[Watch the Throne Tour]]. Beyoncé and Jay-Z would take turn holding down the stage, beginning with several songs by Beyoncé first, followed by duets and afterwards Jay-Z rapping his songs.<ref name="Miami New Time">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2014/06/jay-z_beyonce_review_photos_on-the-run_tour_miami_2014.php|title=Jay Z and Beyonce's On the Run Tour – Sun Life Stadium, Miami|work=[[Miami New Times]]|first=Kat|last=Bein|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref> Both artists sported multiple outfits from a variety of fashion designers throughout the performances of the tour. In Beyoncé's case, makeup artist Sir John Barnette commented on her quick changes backstage between performances, comparing them to "[[Daytona 500]]" with every member of her team working on a separate part of her look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.style.com/beauty/beautycounter/2014/07/beyonce-shine-free-makeup-trick/?_osource=twitter|title=Beyoncé's Trick For Beating Summer Shine|publisher=[[Style.com]]|date=July 17, 2014|accessdate=July 18, 2014}}</ref>

Both Beyoncé and Jay-Z sported multiple outfits throughout the different performances of the tour. One of the more prominent designers for the tour was [[Versace]], in which Beyoncé wore both a fishnet and leather Atelier black bodysuit (complete with a plunging neckline, a fishnet head mask and high heel combat boots), as well as a colourful Atelier bodysuit from the designer. The leather Atelier black bodysuit took approximately 200 hours to craft and was used for the opening number of the tour, "'03 Bonnie & Clyde".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beyonce.com/on-the-run-tour-fashion-lineup-versace-wardrobe/ |title=OTR Fashion Lineup: Versace |publisher=Beyonce.com.

[[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]] designed a "bondage body suit" worn by Beyoncé during the show, as well as multiple pieces by [[Nicola Formichetti]] for [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]]. One of these included the previously mentioned denim outfit, which was "made from the company's patented Jogg Jean material, accented with hand-applied hardware and studwork, [[Swarovski]] crystal elements and black [[leather]] accessories", worn for the performance of "[[Run the World (Girls)]]". Formichetti commented on the outfit, saying "Every classic cops and robbers story blurs the lines between the good and bad, we wanted Beyoncé's to be both. Her look is one part police officer and two parts jailbait."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonce.com/otr-fashion-lineupdiesel-2/ |title=OTR Fashion Lineup: Diesel 2 |publisher=Beyonce.com.

Biker gangs that developed in the United States after World War II served as an inspiration for the outfit; Beyoncé's was meant as a tribute to her hometown and a reminder of her roots. It took 4–5 hours to add the word Texas to the leather jacket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonce.com/otr-fashion-lineupdiesel/ |title=OTR Fashion Lineup: Diesel |publisher=Beyonce.com.

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Beyoncé Jay Z Seattle 4.jpg|thumbnail|left|220px|The tour was generally well received by critics. Beyoncé was praised for her performance abilities and choreographed routines with her background dancers, and can be seen performing "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".]]
The opening night of the tour received generally positive reviews: ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Erica K. Landau praised the Miami concert, summarizing it as "[a] tantalizing spectacle, [with] triumphant vocals, palpable sensuality and booty-shaking anthems".<ref name="usrev">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/06/25/beyonce-jay-z-on-the-run-joint-tour-launch-miami/11366065/|title=Terrific together: Beyonce and Jay Z go live|work=[[USA Today]]|first=Erica|last=K.

She felt that potential "witty banter" between the couple was lost with the use of the video pieces between the songs.<ref name="Miami New Time" /> Jon Caramanica in a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined that each entertainer gave the other the opportunity to be the center of attention, while acknowledging their different types of success. He concluded "Jay-Z allowed for breezy enjoyment; Beyoncé demanded full and reverent attention".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/arts/music/beyonce-and-jay-z-kick-off-shared-on-the-run-tour.html|title=Opposites Attracting (and Complementing)|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jon|last=Caramanica|date=June 27, 2014|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref>

The following concerts for the duration of the tour were also met with high praise from critics:  Merecedes J. Howze of ''[[New Pittsburgh Courier]]'' praised the "consistent" show in Cincinnati, stating "The duo has proven numerous times that their union, professionally and personally, is unstoppable."

He continued his review, "Nor is there much to behold beyond its stars: no long catwalks, elaborate sets, or even a visible band.

Graham Slaughter of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' concluded in his review, "If there's anything to be learned from the On the Run tour, it's that tight timing, a dynamic storyline and legendary talent make a 42-song concert not just enjoyable, but rather unforgettable. Performers be warned: the bar on dual concerts has forever been raised."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2014/07/10/beyonc_jay_z_raise_bar_on_dual_concerts_review.html|title=Beyoncé, Jay Z raise bar on dual concerts: review|work=[[Toronto Star]]|first=Graham|last=Slaughter|date=July 10, 2014|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}</ref> Lorraine Ali of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' who attended the first of two shows in Pasadena, California, also gave a positive review noting that the concert showcased how a marriage should work with the spouses "balancing out each other's weaknesses with individual strengths" on stage.

[[File:Beyoncé Jay Z Seattle 3.jpg|thumbnail|right|220px|Jay-Z was commended for holding down the stage and working the crowd alone for most of his solo performances.]]
The only European shows in Saint-Denis, France, were also lauded by critics. Lewis Corner of [[Digital Spy]] gave the second show a five star review. He praised the performance abilities of both artists, explaining "When left to [Jay-Z's] own devices on stage, the rapper is forceful and beguiling. It takes little for him to have thousands waving their hands to 'Tom Ford', as he looks dapper in honour of the designer. But when Beyoncé rises up out of the stage in a denim military outfit to the question 'bad bitch?' and then storms into 'Run The World (Girls)', the track's sentiment couldn't resound more. Without doubt, she lives up to her hype as one of the world's best performers. Slick movement, tight choreography, innocent attitude and effortless vocals instantly escalate the atmosphere of the show."<ref name="Paris">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a596512/beyonce-jay-z-on-the-run-in-paris-live-review.html#~oPOMbruRwnBoYS|title=Beyoncé, Jay Z On The Run in Paris – live review|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Lewis|last=Corner|date=September 13, 2014|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref> Simon Harper of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' felt that both performers had immediately apparent different performance approaches and both commanded an "incredible presence and deafening screams from the French crowd", however concluded that Beyoncé just finished on top as the better of the two, finalising his all positive review with "The music world's most powerful and influential partnership couldn't fail to demonstrate the reasons for their rise to dominance... As the On The Run tour comes to its conclusion, it's clear to see that Mrs. Carter emerges on top.

Tickets for the tour were priced at $40 to $275, so that wherever fans were on the "ticket chain", they had an opportunity to attend the show. "We made sure we had affordable tickets as well as the higher-priced tickets that we know the market can bear.

In September 2014, it was announced that a trilogy of videos entitled "Bang Bang" were to be released as a short film leading up to the broadcast of the tour special. The short film (in which multiple scenes are found in video interludes and backdrops throughout the tour) was directed by New York-based filmmaker and photographer Dikayl Rimmasch. Together with war photographer William Kaner, Rimmasch put together the filmmaking approach and aesthetic of the series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/09/beyonce-and-jay-z-bang-banb-short-film-part-one|title=Watch Part One of Beyoncé and Jay Z's "Bang Bang" Short Film|work=Complex|publisher=Complex Media Inc.|first=Zach|last=Frydenlund|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> Inspired by [[French New Wave]] cinema, the short film was created using custom camera rigs that Rimmasch had designed, 50-year-old Russian lenses and lighting effects by Archie Ciotti and Scott Spencer and followed an incredibly fast, shoot-from-the-hip recording style.<ref name="Bang Bang">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowness.com/day/2014/9/15/4140/beyonce-and-jay-z-bang-bang-part-one|title=Beyoncé and Jay Z: Bang Bang, Part One|work=[[Nowness]]|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915162638/http://www.nowness.com/day/2014/9/15/4140/beyonce-and-jay-z-bang-bang-part-one|archivedate=September 15, 2014|df=}}</ref> However, following the release of part one of the trilogy, the remaining two videos never came to surface on their scheduled release dates.
