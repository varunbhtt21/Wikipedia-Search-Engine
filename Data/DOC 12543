==Discovery==
A specimen was first collected by William A. Hilton from beneath stones in [[Claremont, California]].  It was classified and named as ''Tarsotomus macropalpis'' by [[Nathan Banks]] whose report in 1916 was<ref name=ncm>{{citation |author=Banks, Nathan |title=New Californian Mites |journal=Journal of Entomology and Zoology |volume=Vol. 8 |number=No. 1 |date=March 1916 |page=13}}</ref> {{quote|text=A large species, rather sparsely bristly. Body nearly twice as long as broad, broadest at [[humerus|humeri]]; [[cephalothorax]] tapering in front, one eye spot each side close to margin and much nearer hind than front end of cephalothorax: legs long, but none of the [[femur|femora]] as long as the cephalothorax, the [[tibia]] (penultimate joint), however, as long as the cephalothorax; body and legs with erect bristles, only a few very long ones, some on the basal joints are serrate or hairy, and the outer frontal pair, which are thicker than the others, also hairy. Claws with rows of bristles beneath; [[palp]]i very large and heavy, with two [[apical (anatomy)|apical]] claws, the large one with a few teeth on inner side, hairs of thumb very short.|sign=Nathan Banks |source=Journal of Entomology and Zoology, March 1916}}

==Speed record==
The mite has been recorded at a speed of 322 body lengths per second ({{convert|0.225| m/s|mph||abbr=on}}).<ref name="HT28April2014"/> This is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian [[tiger beetle]] ''[[Cicindela eburneola]]'', the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, which has been recorded at {{convert|1.86| m/s|mph||abbr=on}} or 171 body lengths per second.<ref name="InsectRecords">{{cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_39.shtml |title=Chapter 39: Fastest Runner |author=Merritt, Thomas M. |date=31 July 1999 |work=Book of Insect Records |publisher=University of Florida |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110111245/http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_39.shtml |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df= }}</ref> The [[cheetah]], the fastest land animal, which has been clocked at a peak of {{convert|64|mph|km/h m/s|abbr=on|0}},<ref name="CheetahSpeed">{{cite journal |title=Timed running speed of a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) |author=Sharp, N.

High speed photography was used to record the speed of the mite, both in natural conditions and in the laboratory. The equivalent speed for a human running as fast as this mite would be {{convert|1300|mph|km/h|abbr=on|-2}}.<ref name="ScienceDaily"/>

Besides the unusually great speed of the mites, the researchers were surprised to find the mites running at such speeds on concrete at temperatures up to {{convert|60|°C|°F}}. This is significant because that temperature is well above the lethal limit for the majority of animal species. In addition, the mites are able to stop and change direction very quickly.<ref name="ScienceDaily"/>

The discovery pushes the limits of what is known about the physiology of animal movement and the limits on the speed of living structures. This finding is considered by the research team as opening new possibilities in the design of [[robot]]s and in [[biomimetics]].<ref name="ScienceDaily"/>
