The '''Cabinet of Milomir Minić''' was elected on 25 October 2000,<ref>[http://www.srbija.gov.rs/pages/article.php?id=33639]</ref> after the defeat of [[Slobodan Milošević]] on the [[Yugoslavian general election, 2000|presidential election]]. At that point, and after the resignation of the Serbian Prime Minister [[Mirko Marjanović]], it became clear that the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] would lose the next [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2000|early parliamentary election]], so this transitional government was formed, based on the agreement signed on 16 October by [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] (SPS), [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] (DOS) and [[Serbian Renewal Movement]] (SPO).<ref>[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&mm=10&dd=24&nav_category=1&nav_id=14572]</ref>
