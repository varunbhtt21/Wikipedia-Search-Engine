==Plot==
Shibaki is a high-school boy whose only interest is girls. Except he's been branded as the most perverted boy at school and girls avoid him like the plague. One day he finds a book in the library about how to summon witches. He tries it as a joke, but it turns out to be the real thing. An apprentice witch named Rurumo appears to grant him a wish. Shibaki helps Rurumo and she in return refuses to take his soul. When the story starts, Shibaki wishes he could see Rurumo again. His wishes is granted immediately as Rurumo falls from the sky and crash lands in front of him. He finds out that as punishment for not taking his soul she's been busted down to an apprentice witch. Now, she must complete the task of getting Shibaki to use up 666 magic tickets that grant wishes before she can become a witch again. However, what she doesn't know is that each time he uses a ticket it shortens his life. When the last ticket is used up, Shibaki will die. Shibaki knows this because Rurumo's familiar black cat Chiro tell him as part of the "contract" for giving him the tickets. Now, Shibaki has a choice, make a wish and help Rurumo become a witch again or resist the temptation and try to save his own life.

==Characters==
;{{Nihongo|Kōta Shibaki|柴木 耕太|Shibaki Kōta}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Makoto Takahashi]]}}
:A high school student. Because of his various perverted actions in the past, which earned him the title {{Nihongo|"Pervert Shibaki"|ヘンタイシバキ|Hentai Shibaki}}, every girl alienates him, leading to an empty school life. He is part of his school's resident {{Nihongo|Mysterious Discovery|不思議発見クラブ|Fushigi Hakken Kurabu}} Club, but he's not interested in the [[occult]].

;{{Nihongo|Rurumo|るるも}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Suzuko Mimori]]}}
:A witch who made a contract with Shibaki. Her full name is {{Nihongo|'''Rurumo Magi Mojiruka'''|マジ＝モジルカ・ルルモ|Maji Mojiruka Rurumo}}. When Shibaki uses the tickets given to him, she can use magic to grant his wishes. On the outside, she looks like a normal middle school girl, and people usually assume she's a cosplayer, due to her clothes. She is expressionless and reticent to the extreme, but is by nature more shy than others, also being very clumsy and oblivious. After defying various rules, she was made to spend 60 years in prison.

;{{Nihongo|Chiro|チロ}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Misato Fukuen]]}}
:She's Rurumo's magical [[familiar]], a purple-furred cat. Chiro is the one that informs Shibaki that once he uses up all 666 tickets that Rurumo gave him, he will die. She is able to transform into a human girl at will, in which form she becomes a tan-skinned teenage girl. She used to be a stray cat, who tried selling magic wands for a living, but Rurumo offered her to become her familiar, for which she's very thankful.

;{{Nihongo|Shibaki's Mother|柴木の母|Shibaki no Haha}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]}}
:Shibaki's mother, whom he fears very much due to her violent tendencies, whereby she would, at times, threaten him with a knife, especially when she thinks he might be doing something illegal, such as abducting minors.

However, Rurumo doesn't know the owner of the tickets dies once they're used up. When Shibaki learns this from Rurumo's cat familiar, Chiro, he swears never to use the tickets again.

Rurumo then tries to look surprised, since Kōta was trying to surprise her.
