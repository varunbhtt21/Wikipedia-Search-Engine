==Early life==
Denise Coates is the eldest daughter of [[Peter Coates]], chairman of [[Stoke City F.C.]] and a director of Bet365, and is married to Richard Smith, a director at Stoke City Football Club. She earned a first class degree in [[econometrics]] from the [[University of Sheffield]].<ref name="Staffordshire University">{{cite web|title=Denise Coates CBE|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/events/graduation/2012/honoraries/denise_coates/index.jsp|website=Staffordshire University|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref>

==Business career==
While at school, Coates started work in the cashiers' department within the family bookmaking firm, Provincial Racing, where she would mark up bets. After leaving university she trained as an accountant within the family business, before being given the opportunity to take over the small chain of shops. Having turned around the shops' fortunes, Coates obtained a loan from [[Barclays]] to acquire a neighbouring chain. In 1995, she became managing director of the betting shop estate.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|last1=Pagano|first1=Margareta|title=Against the odds: Denise Coates's good fortune|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/against-the-odds-denise-coatess-good-fortune-9169196.html|accessdate=10 February 2018|work=The Independent|date=4 March 2014}}</ref>

==Bet365==
In January 2000, Coates purchased the domain name Bet365.com.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Bowers|first1=Simon|title=Denise Coates: the hidden 24/7 woman behind Bet365|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/08/denise-coates-woman-bet365-gambling|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref> While working in a temporary building on a car park near one of her shops, she spent a year creating a new online betting site. Bet365.com was launched in 2001. The business borrowed £15&nbsp;million from RBS against the family's betting shop estate. In 2005 these shops were sold to [[Gala Coral Group|Coral]] for £40&nbsp;million which also paid off the loan to RBS.

Bet365 has grown into one of the world's largest online gambling companies, with $2&nbsp;billion in revenues and facilitating $45&nbsp;billion in bets in the year through March 2016. The company also owns a majority stake in Stoke City Football Club. In 2015, Bet365 moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its favourable regulations. Coates still runs the company alongside her brother, and co-CEO, [[John Coates (businessman)|John Coates]].

Coates is the majority shareholder with 50.01% of Bet365. Her personal fortune is estimated at $5.1&nbsp;billion, as of February 2018.<ref name="Forbes profile"/>
