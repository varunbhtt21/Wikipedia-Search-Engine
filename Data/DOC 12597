==Plot==
The game focuses on Aoi who, having lost his direction in life, returns to his hometown of Kazegaura where a gentle breeze blows through the streets. On the hill lined with windmills, he meets a wheelchair-ridden girl named Kotori and together they watch a glider overhead in awe. With his childhood friend Ageha in town, and the super-repeat student Amane, they restore the soaring club in order to fulfill a dream: [[morning glory cloud|to soar in the skies]].

The central theme of the story is loss, both physical and emotional.<ref name="Eisenbels">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/if-my-heart-had-wings-the-kotaku-review-876585712|title=If My Heart Had Wings: The Kotaku Review|last=Eisenbels|first=Richard|date=23 July 2013|work=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=20 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="Vincent">{{cite web|url=http://www.japanator.com/review-if-my-heart-had-wings-29205.phtml|title=Review: If My Heart Had Wings|last=Vincent|first=Brittany|date=31 July 2013|work=[[Japanator]]|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>

Main characters:

*{{nihongo|Aoi Minase|水瀬 碧|Minase Aoi}}: Aoi Minase is the main protagonist of the visual novel. He was a member of the cycling club at his previous school, but unfortunately, injuries to his legs in an accident forced him to retire and return to his hometown of Kazegaura.

*{{nihongo|Kotori Habane|羽々音 小鳥|Habane Kotori}}: A slender, beautiful girl with long, black hair who is bound to a wheelchair whom Aoi meets on a hill of windmills. Though she is strong willed and speaks with confidence she is at times a cry baby. Her sole reason for transferring to Keifuu Academy is that the school is completely barrier free. She has no interest in the classes which teach specialty fields. Because of this, she is completely cut off from her those around her. She was on the verge of quitting school, until Aoi convinces her to join the soaring club.{{anime voices|[[Hoshizaki Iria]]}}.
*{{nihongo|Ageha Himegi|姫城 あげは|Himegi Ageha}}: A fashionable, cheerful, beautiful young girl who has a playfully flirtatious air about her.

Now, after five years apart, they meet again. {{anime voices|[[Moka Choko]]}}.
*{{nihongo|Amane Mochizuki|望月 天音|Mochizuki Amane}}: A tall, gorgeous, and very stylish girl, she is senior to most of the main characters.

*{{nihongo|Asa Kazato|風戸 亜紗|Kazato Asa}}: Asa is a girl with a bright and warm air about her. She is Yoru's twin sister and a first-year at Keifuu Academy.

She and her sister provide their secret base as a garage for the glider. {{anime voices|[[Yukito Saori]]}}.
*{{nihongo|Yoru Kazato|風戸 依瑠|Kazato Yoru}}: Yoru is Asa's twin. She has a cool personality and is rather indifferent about others with her head up in the clouds.

Their grandfather is the chairman of Keifuu Academy. {{anime voices|[[Arisugawa Miyabi]]}}.
