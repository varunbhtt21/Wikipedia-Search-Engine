Notability; doesn't seem to meet [[WP:COMPANY]]; closest claim is " Harris Kyriakides is recommended for its Litigation, Real Estate, and Corporate and M&A Practice by Legal 500,[7], Best Lawyers International[8], and International Bar Guides.[9]" These are directories not of obvious import to this non-lawyer, and the claim is of questionable accuracy (for example, Legal 500 recommendation is only for Corporate and M&A, and calls the company "third tier".) Other links sound suggestive but are less so; the text at the US Embassy site, for example is in a realm explained "Inclusion does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation by the U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service." Text from Embassy site is the same as for Best Lawyers site and Martindale site, suggesting all come from the subject; text at International Bar Guides is clearly written in the voice of the subject, and text at Chambers & Partners is noted as coming from subject.

:*Just a nit: it's not a non-notable person; it's a non-notable law firm, named after the non-notable person who heads it up. [[User:TJRC|TJRC]] ([[User talk:TJRC|talk]]) 21:10, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
