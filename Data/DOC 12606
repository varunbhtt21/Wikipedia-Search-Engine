The '''Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands''' is the principal legal adviser to the [[Government of the British Virgin Islands]].<ref>Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 58(2)</ref>  Under the [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands]] the Attorney General sits ''ex officio'' in both the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands]]<ref>Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, section 63(1)</ref> and in the [[Cabinet of the British Virgin Islands]],<ref>Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 47(1)</ref> but is not permitted to vote in either.  The Attorney General also sits on the Committee for the Prerogative of Mercy<ref>Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 44(1)</ref> and on the National Security Council.<ref>Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 57(1)(d)</ref>

The office traces its origins back to the reintroduction of democracy in the British Virgin Islands pursuant to the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1950|1950 general election]].  At that time the Legislative Council (as the House of Assembly was then known) had to look to the [[Attorney General of the Leeward Islands]] for support.  This was regarded as unsatisfactory and following the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1954|1954 general election]] Herman Besson was appointed to the title of Legal Assistant to the Legislative Council.  In 1959 the title of the office was changed to Crown Attorney, and subsequent to the introduction of Ministerial Government following the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1967|1967 general election]] the office was titled Attorney General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |pages=195–199 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 }}</ref>

The Attorney General is supported by two senior law officers: the Solicitor General (in relation to civil matters) and the Director of Public Prosecutions (in relation to criminal matters).

When appearing in court, by convention the Attorney General sits one row in from the row reserved for [[Queen's Counsel]].

The current Attorney General is Baba Aziz.<ref name=Aziz>{{cite news|url=http://bvinews.com/new/baba-aziz-appointed-attorney-general/|title=Baba Aziz appointed attorney general|work=BVI News|accessdate=15 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119013642/http://bvinews.com/new/baba-aziz-appointed-attorney-general/|archive-date=19 January 2015|dead-url=yes}}</ref>  Mr Aziz also formerly served as acting Attorney General for over a year between 24 June 2010 and 6 November 2011.

==Qualifications==
Since 2007 in order to be qualified to be appointed as Attorney General a person must be eligible to be admitted as a lawyer in the British Virgin Islands, and must have not less than 10 years experience practising law.<ref>Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 95(5)</ref>  However, this was not always the case, and various past Attorneys General were either not admitted in the British Virgin Islands and in some cases were not even eligible to be admitted in the British Virgin Islands.<ref>The longest ever serving Attorney General was [[Cherno Jallow]] QC, who was only admitted as a lawyer in Gambia, and was thereby ineligible for admission to practice as a lawyer in the British Virgin Islands.</ref>

By law, since 2007 no person may be appointed to the office of Attorney General unless he or she is a [[Belonger status|Belonger]] to the Virgin Islands unless, in the opinion of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, there is no such person who is suitably qualified and able and willing to be so appointed.<ref>Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 95(6)</ref>  In practice, every single Attorney General appointed since 2007 has been a non-Belonger, and only one Attorney General in the history of the British Virgin Islands was a belonger at the time they were appointed ([[Dancia Penn]]).<ref>Several Attorneys General settled in the British Virgin Islands and were naturalised after leaving office.</ref>

==List of Attorneys General of the British Virgin Islands==
A total of 26 persons have been appointed to the office (including as Crown Attorney or Legal Assistant prior to 1967, and persons who were appointed as acting Attorney General), of whom 20 have been men and six have been women.  Three have been [[Queen's Counsel]] (although two were appointed to the rank during office), and the remaining 23 have been from the [[junior barrister|Outer bar]] or [[solicitor]]s during their time as Attorney General.<ref>Two former Attorneys General were subsequently elevated to Queen's Counsel later in their careers: [[Joseph Archibald]], QC and Lewis Hunte, QC.</ref>  The longest serving Attorney General to date has been [[Cherno Jallow]], who served just under eight years (including time as acting Attorney General).
