The '''2014 Bentiu massacre''' occurred on 15 April 2014 in the town of [[Bentiu]], in the north of [[South Sudan]], during the [[South Sudanese Civil War]]. The attack has been described by ''[[The Economist]]'' as the "worst massacre" of the ongoing civil war.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21601244-civil-wars-worst-massacre-ensures-war-will-get-still-bloodier-new A new depth of horror], economist.com.</ref>

==Prelude==
Prior to the attack, people had sought refuge in places of worship and healing,<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/23/an-abomination-slaughter-in-the-mosques-and-churches-of-bentiu-south-sudan/?tid=pm_pop An ‘abomination’: Slaughter in the mosques and churches of Bentiu, South Sudan], washingtonpost.com.</ref> while a local radio station featured rebel commanders warning certain ethnic groups, except the [[Nuer people|Nuer]]s, that they were coming for them, calling on the other groups to rape the non-Nuer women.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/23/an-abomination-slaughter-in-the-mosques-and-churches-of-bentiu-south-sudan/?tid=pm_pop An ‘abomination’: Slaughter in the mosques and churches of Bentiu, South Sudan], washingtonpost.com.</ref>

==Attack==
UN human rights investigators said that after rebels wrested Bentiu from government forces in heavy battles, the gunmen spent two days hunting down those who they believed opposed them.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/sudan-rebels-slaughtered-hundreds-ethnic-massacres-un-115333412.html S.Sudan rebels slaughter 'hundreds' in ethnic massacres: UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421190849/http://news.yahoo.com/sudan-rebels-slaughtered-hundreds-ethnic-massacres-un-115333412.html |date=April 21, 2014 }}, news.yahoo.com.</ref> The killers, identified by the United Nations as forces of the Nuer-led [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition|SPLM/A-IO]], went from place to place, from mosque to church to hospital, separating people by ethnicity and religion and shooting the ones left behind.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/23/an-abomination-slaughter-in-the-mosques-and-churches-of-bentiu-south-sudan/?tid=pm_pop An ‘abomination’: Slaughter in the mosques and churches of Bentiu, South Sudan], washingtonpost.com.</ref> Civilians were killed in the town's main hospital, in a Catholic church and especially in the [[Kali-Ballee mosque]],<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/23/south-sudan-bentiu-massacre-humanitarian-workers South Sudan: Bentiu atrocity will not be the last unless pleas for help are heard], theguardian.com.</ref> where hundreds had taken shelter and where the rebels "separated individuals of certain nationalities and ethnic groups and escorted them to safety, while the others were killed," according to a UN report.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/sudan-rebels-slaughtered-hundreds-ethnic-massacres-un-115333412.html S.Sudan rebels slaughter 'hundreds' in ethnic massacres: UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421190849/http://news.yahoo.com/sudan-rebels-slaughtered-hundreds-ethnic-massacres-un-115333412.html |date=April 21, 2014 }}, news.yahoo.com.</ref> One of those who only barely escaped death during the massacre was the prominent former [[warlord]] and pro-government commander [[Peter Par Jiek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyamile.com/2017/04/09/breaking-news-another-senior-government-general-feared-dead-in-an-ambush-near-wau-western-bhar-el-ghazal/|title=BREAKING NEWS: Another Senior Government General Feared Dead in an Ambush near Wau, Western Bhar el Ghazal|work=Nyamile|author=|date=9 April 2017|accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref>

A week after the attack, bodies still littered the streets.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/23/south-sudan-bentiu-massacre-humanitarian-workers South Sudan: Bentiu atrocity will not be the last unless pleas for help are heard], theguardian.com.</ref>

==Casualties==
South Sudan's government said the death toll from the massacre exceeded 400.<ref name="JazeeraBen" /> In the main mosque alone, "more than 200 civilians were reportedly killed and over 400 wounded," the UN mission in the country said.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/sudan-rebels-slaughtered-hundreds-ethnic-massacres-un-115333412.html S.Sudan rebels slaughter 'hundreds' in ethnic massacres: UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421190849/http://news.yahoo.com/sudan-rebels-slaughtered-hundreds-ethnic-massacres-un-115333412.html |date=April 21, 2014 }}, news.yahoo.com.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/23/an-abomination-slaughter-in-the-mosques-and-churches-of-bentiu-south-sudan/?tid=pm_pop An ‘abomination’: Slaughter in the mosques and churches of Bentiu, South Sudan], washingtonpost.com.</ref>

According to a source, many of the victims were [[Sudan|Sudanese]], in particular traders from [[Darfur]] as well as soldiers from the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM), a Sudanese rebel group from Darfur accused of supporting the South Sudanese government. According to the source, JEM fighters removed their uniforms and hid in the mosque, before being shot. However, a Sudanese human rights group rejected this claim, saying those killed were unarmed civilians.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/23/south-sudan-bentiu-massacre-humanitarian-workers South Sudan: Bentiu atrocity will not be the last unless pleas for help are heard], theguardian.com.</ref>

Many other victims were civilians as well as [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] soldiers belonging to the [[Dinka people]], an ethnic group which had traditionally supported Kiir's government.{{sfnp|Small Arms Survey|2014}}

==Aftermath==
{{further|2014 retreat from Western Bahr el Ghazal}}
Rebel leader, [[Riek Machar]], said his forces were not behind the killings<ref name="JazeeraBen2" /> and rebel spokesman [[Lul Ruai Koang]] said, "the government forces and their allies committed these heinous crimes while retreating."<ref>[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/04/24/south-sudan-sacks-army-chief-over-bentiu South Sudan sacks army chief over Bentiu], sbs.com.au.</ref>

The massacre at Bentiu greatly increased the animosity of Dinkas against ethnic Nuer in [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] which had previously been largely peaceful and unaffected by the civil war. Families of Dinka soldiers killed at Bentiu attacked a Nuer SPLA soldier at Mapel, [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]], in April 2014, resulting in inter-tribal clashes and the massacre of up to 200 Nuer soldiers by Dinka soldiers. This violence led to the mass desertion of Nuer SPLA members in Bahr el Ghazal who then fled north into [[Sudan]] in course of a [[2014 retreat from Western Bahr el Ghazal|long march]].{{sfnp|Small Arms Survey|2014}}
