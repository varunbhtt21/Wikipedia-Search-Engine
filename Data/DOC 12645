'''William Fraser Rae''' (1835–1905) was a Scottish journalist and author.

==Life==
Born in [[Edinburgh]] on 3 March 1835, he was the elder son of George Rae and his wife, Catherine Fraser, both of Edinburgh. After education at [[Moffat Academy]] and [[Heidelberg University]], he entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] as a student on 2 November 1857, and on 30 April 1861 was [[called to the bar]]. But he then gave up the law for a career as a journalist.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Rae, William Fraser|volume=3}}</ref>

Rae edited for a time about 1860 ''The Reader'', and early joined the staff of the ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', sympathetic to its liberal politics, as a special correspondent in Canada and the United States. Throat trouble led him to spend time at Austrian health resorts.<ref name="DNB"/>
 
In his last years Rae felt his lack of recognition. He reviewed for ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenæum]]'', whose editor [[Norman MacColl]] was a close friend, and spent his time mainly at the [[Reform Club]]; he had joined in 1860, and was chairman of the library committee from 1873 till his death. He died on 21 January 1905 at 13 South Parade, [[Bath, Somerset]], and was buried at Bath.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Works==
On his articles for the ''Daily News'', Rae based the volume ''Westward by Rail'' (1870; 3rd edit. 1874), sequel ''Columbia and Canada: Notes on the Great Republic and the New Dominion'' (1877). There subsequently appeared ''Newfoundland to Manitoba'' (1881; with maps) and ''Facts about Manitoba'' (1882); reprinted articles from ''[[The Times]]'', the source also  for ''Austrian Health Resorts, and the Bitter Waters of Hungary'' (1888; 2nd edit. 1889). In ''The Business of Travel'' (1891) he described the methods of [[Thomas Cook & Son]], the travel agents, and a visit produced ''Egypt to-day; the First to the Third Khedive'' (1892).<ref name="DNB"/>

Rae saw success as the translator of [[Edmond About]]'s ''Handbook of Social Economy'' (1872; 2nd edit. 1885) and [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s ''Notes on England'' (1873; 8th edit. 1885). Taking up English political history of the 18th century, in 1874 he brought out''Wilkes, Sheridan, and Fox: or the Opposition under George III'', which echoed the style of [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]]. On the question of the [[identity of Junius]], he wroteoften in ''The Athenæum'' from 1888, for over the decade: with [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]] and the ''Athenæum'' tradition, he rejected the identification of Junius with [[Sir Philip Francis]].<ref name="DNB"/>

With the aid of [[Lord Dufferin]] and others connected with the family, Rae researched [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] and tried to improve his reputation. ''Sheridan, a Biography'' (2 vols. 1896) dispelled some rumours, but failed as a whitewash. In 1902 he published ''Sheridan's Plays, now printed as he wrote them'', with ''A Journey to Bath'', an unpublished comedy by [[Frances Sheridan]].<ref name="DNB"/>

Rae wrote the preface to Charles W. Vincent's ''Catalogue of the Library of the Reform Club'' (1883; 2nd and revised edit. 1894), and contributed to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''. He published anonymously in 1873 ''Men of the Third Republic'', and translated ''English Portraits'', from [[Sainte-Beuve]], in 1875. In fiction, Rae wrote [[three-volume novel]]s: ''Miss Bayle's Romance'' (1887), followed by ''A Modern Brigand'' (1888), ''Maygrove'' (1890), and ''An American Duchess'' (1891).<ref name="DNB"/>

==Family==
Rae married, on 29 August 1860, Sara Eliza, second daughter of James Fordati of the Isle of Man and London. She died at [[Franzensbad]], where Rae and herself were frequent autumn visitors, on 29 August 1902; she left two daughters.<ref name="DNB"/>
