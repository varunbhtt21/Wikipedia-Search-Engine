Was between this and a prod-from the looks of it though its a model who has done charity work but not anything major that goes to Wikipedia standards-while I do have to admit she sounds noble, its not quite notable guidelines.

*'''Redirect''' to [[Donald Sterling]]. She's not really independently notable: she's mainly known for her role in the Sterling racism controversy ([[WP:BLP1E]]). She got a bit of earlier local coverage about her marital breakdown with Sterling[http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/03/07/wife-of-clippers-owner-sues-woman-she-alleges-had-affair-with-her-husband/] but that's only there because of him, not her. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 16:54, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' as per above. I'm not seeing coverage in reliable sources to establish notability for this person beyond her involvement in the (most recent) Donald Sterling incident. <small><span style="border:1px solid">[[User:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:black">&nbsp;Gongshow&nbsp;</span>''']]</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color:black">[[User_talk:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:#ffffff">talk</span>''']]</span></small> 06:08, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-yeah a redirect does sound the best-considering that it is basically a inherited issue. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:39, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect'''. No sources. &mdash; [[User:Goethean|goethean]] 17:40, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. As was previously stated non-notable, no sources etc.. There should be no redirect just a clear and simple delete. [[User:TheGoofyGolfer|TheGoofyGolfer]] ([[User talk:TheGoofyGolfer|talk]]) 23:31, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. Multiple sources exist now. [http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/28/us/who-is-v-stiviano/][http://abcnews.go.com/US/stiviano-woman-accused-leaking-racist-rant/story?id=23500430][http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/v-stiviano-donald-sterling-girlfriend-maria-perez.html?mid=google][http://www.nj.com/nets/index.ssf/2014/04/donald_sterlings_girlfriend_what_you_should_know_about_v_stiviano.html] etc.  So the "no sources" argument probably won't hold up; on the other hand [[WP:BLP1E]] fits, and most likely counsels a redirect.--[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 00:04, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to o [[Donald Sterling]]. Not currently notable except for her association with Sterling.  [[WP:BLP1E]] advises to not create a standalone article in this case.—[[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]] ([[User talk:Bagumba|talk]]) 06:33, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
