The '''Capheaton Treasure''' is an important [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] silver hoard found in the village of [[Capheaton]] in Northumberland, north-east [[England]]. Since 1824, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=6318&plaA=6318-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>

==Discovery==
The hoard was discovered in 1747 in the village of Capheaton near [[Kirkwhelpington]] in [[Northumberland]]. Some of the treasure was melted down soon after it was found. That which survived was bequeathed by the antiquary and philanthropist [[Richard Payne Knight]] to the British Museum in 1824.

==Description==
The six objects that compose the treasure date from the 2nd/3rd Centuries AD and depict a range of religious and mythological subjects.  They are unfortunately only fragments of highly decorated silver vessels they may have formed part of a [[temple]] treasure. Four of them are the handles of silver vessels, probably [[skillet]]s, while the other two are the base and a fitting for a silver vessel. The subjects represented on the handles include the goddess [[Minerva]] above a temple, the deity [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], below which is a seated figure of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] with the flanking figures of [[Bacchus]] and [[Ariadne]] below and six of the [[Twelve Labours of Hercules]].
