Not much to report this week. The same post-Easter celebrations (4/20, Earth Day) were popular again this year, except last year we were still reeling from the [[Boston Marathon bombing|Boston Marathon bombing]].

|This year [[Easter Sunday]] coincided with [[4/20]], the potheads' celebration, and ubertoker Snoop Dogg marked the date both with a sell-out concert  at the [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] and a video of a "real Easter bunny" posted on [[Instagram]]. Those two together, may be enough to explain his massive one-day surge a day later, or may not, but I'm not about to diss Snoop Dogg.

|It's hard to remember these days, under the onslaught of bunnies, chocolate eggs and marshmallow peeps, that Easter, not Christmas, is the most sacred date of the Christian calendar. Doubtless a lot of people learned that this week, along with some fairly eye-raising information about the events it actually celebrates.

||[[File:Amazon.com-Logo.svg|left|100x100px]] 
|This article has been veering wildly (and suspiciously) around the view graph for several weeks, but at least now its presence on the list has a reason: [[Amazon Fire TV]] is a digital streaming device to watch online content on a HDTV. How it distinguishes itself from the three or four other such devices currently on the market is a matter of some dispute.

|[[File:UCSC 420 celebration.jpg|left|100x100px]]
| This curious "holiday", which falls on April 20 (for obvious reasons) refers to the mysterious number 420 and its long link to marijuana usage. While it may not quite be to cannabis what [[Oktoberfest]] is to beer, it no doubt aspires to be.

|It's not surprising that this was released in foreign markets before its home territory; the original ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' made $822 million worldwide, with the domestic and international grosses split roughly 50/50. The rebooted ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (this film's predecessor) made $752 million worldwide, but with international grosses now comprising 2/3 the total. This radical shift in Hollywood's biosphere has taken place in just a decade, and it is already altering hunting strategies, for good or ill; even after just two weeks overseas, this movie has already made $132 million.
