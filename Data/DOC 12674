'''USS ''Allen''''' was a [[row galley]] built in 1814 at [[Vergennes, Vermont]], by [[Adam and Noah Brown]]. She was commissioned during the summer of 1814, with [[Sailing Master]] William M. Robins in command. She became a unit of Commodore [[Thomas Macdonough]]'s squadron on [[Lake Champlain]] and participated in the [[Battle of Lake Champlain]] in September 1814, during which the American squadron captured the remnants of the British squadron under Captain [[George Downie]]. After the [[War of 1812]], she remained in active service for another decade. She was sold at [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall, New York]], sometime in late 1824 or early 1825.
