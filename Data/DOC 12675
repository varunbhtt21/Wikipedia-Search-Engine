*'''Merge''' to [[Stardock]], trimming down to just the essential facts. I have only been able to find one small capsule review on [http://download.cnet.com/Stellar-Frontier/3000-2095_4-10060116.html CNet]. —<B>[[User:Torchiest|Torchiest]]</B> <sup>[[User talk:Torchiest|talk]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-3ex;">[[Special:Contributions/Torchiest|edits]]</sub> 13:06, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

It describes the game as "an online multiplayer 2D scrolling space shooter with some very attractive graphics" and mentions the Admiral's Club (it was basically moved to a free-to-play model). There's also a [http://www.ecomstation.com/news.phtml?action=fullnews&id=686 brief news item] relating to its bundling with eComStation (not sure if it actually happened), and a [http://www.scoug.com/warpexpowest/pictures/album3/album.html photo] of the developer Doug Hendrix.
