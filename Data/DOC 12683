Title : Admission, discharge, and transfer system
Text : {{globalize|date=December 2014}}
An '''admission, discharge, and transfer''' ('''ADT''') '''system''' is a backbone system for the structure of other types of business systems. An ADT system is one of four types of core business systems: ADT, financial, scheduling, and [[Acute medicine|acuity]] (McGonigle, D., & Mastrain, K., 2012). Core business systems are systems used in a health care facility for financial payment, [[quality improvement]], and encouraging [[best practices]] that research has proven beneficial. 

Used in health care, an ADT system is usually the foundation for other types of [[health care informatics|health care information systems]] because it holds valuable patient information such as a [[medical record]] number, age, name, and contact information. Using the ADT system, patient information can be shared, [[medical privacy|when appropriate]], with other health care facilities and systems (McGonigle, D., & Mastrain, K., 2012). ADT systems can also be used as an alert system upon a patient's admission (Pittet, D., Safran, E., et al., 1996). This can be helpful if a patient has had a [[medical history|history]] of an infectious disease or heart ailments. When admitted, the ADT system may alert the admitting staff that the patient needs to be in an [[Hospital-acquired infection#Isolation|isolation room]] or on a cardiac floor, for example.
