# [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]).  I'm excited to see an upcoming photography event in MA (thanks [[User:Kevin Rutherford|Kevin]]!), but I won't be able to attend.  I highly recommend checking out the [[c:Commons:Unvisited_app|Unvisited app]] for Android and iPhone, developed by the prolific Massachusetts photographer [[User:Faolin42|Faolin42]].  I used it recently on a photo trip and found it very useful. [[User:Emw|Emw]] ([[User talk:Emw|talk]]) 12:39, 5 June 2014 (UTC)
