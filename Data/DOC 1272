It looks like a duck to me. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bgwhite&diff=604575647&oldid=604572311] & [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bgwhite&diff=604575946&oldid=604575701] (made a mistake today). Claiming [[Bihar]] to be a North Indian state based on some research work [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patna&diff=603543793&oldid=603483342] and fringe theories.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shivamsetu&oldid=604623089#Bihar_is_an_integral_part_of_northern_india] Ignoring all the government sources (calling them as unreliable, piece of shit etc), Indian media sources, International media etc and giving links of cultural area website, opinions of political leaders and a religious site. 

IPs continued edit-warring and removing contents without explaining on [[Patna]] and [[Bihar]] articles until the pages get protected. Now canvassing other editors and has made personal attacks.
