== Synopsis ==
Set in an affluent, upper middle class village in the suburbs, ''The Animals'' chronicles a day in the life of Jake ([[Albie Casiño]]), Trina ([[Dawn Jimenez]]), and Alex ([[Patrick Sugui]]), who go through the musings that every kid in high school has to deal with. All Jake wants to do is have a good time, Alex just wants to fit in, and Trina simply wants more. A vivid picture is painted of life in high school after the final bell rings, as well as a different side of the Philippines, and what is happening to its privileged children.<ref>*http://cinemalaya.org/film_the-animals.htm</ref>
