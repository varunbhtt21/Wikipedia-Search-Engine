Title : He's a Pirate
Text : "'''He's a Pirate'''" is a 2003 track composed by [[Klaus Badelt]] and [[Hans Zimmer]] for the 2003 [[Disney]] film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''. It is featured on the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] album of the film and is used at the beginning of the credits for the film.

The track has been subject to a number of remix versions collected in an EP titled ''Pirates Remixed'' and separate singles released notably by [[Tiësto]] in 2006 and by [[DJ Rebel|Rebel]] in 2014. Renditions of the track were also used for the credits of the four ''Pirates'' sequels.

==Production==
[[Hans Zimmer]] was initially asked to score the film, but he gave the assignment to his colleague Klaus Badelt since he was working on another project at that time. However, he ended up writing most of the themes, including "He's A Pirate".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=205 |title=Breaking the rules with Hans Zimmer |publisher=Soundtrack.Net |date=2006-06-01 |accessdate=2015-01-25}}</ref>
