The '''Franco-Tahitian War''' or '''French–Tahitian War''' (1844–1847) was a conflict between the [[July Monarchy|Kingdom of the French]] and the [[Kingdom of Tahiti]] and its allies in the South Pacific archipelago of the [[Society Islands]].

== Prelude ==
Tahiti was converted to Protestant Christianity by the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) in the early 19th century. In 1836, Queen [[Pōmare IV]] of Tahiti, under the influence of British consul and former LMS missionary [[George Pritchard (missionary)|George Pritchard]], evicted two French Catholic missionaries from the islands in order to maintain the dominance of Protestantism in the island kingdom. Seeing this as an affront to the honor of France and the Catholic religion, [[Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout]], the French consul in Tahiti,<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BucExpl-t1-body-d19-d9.html|title=Explorers of the Pacific: European and American discoveries in Polynesia|last=Buck|first=Peter Henry|date=1953|publisher=[[Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum]]|year=|isbn=|location=Honolulu|pages=85–86|language=en|chapter=J.

Four years later, claiming the Tahitians had violated the treaty, Dupetit Thouars returned and forced the Tahitian chiefs and the queen to sign a request for French protection which he sent back to Europe for ratification.<ref name="Gonschor">{{cite book|last=Gonschor|first=Lorenz Rudolf|title=Law as a Tool of Oppression and Liberation: Institutional Histories and Perspectives on Political Independence in Hawaiʻi, Tahiti Nui/French Polynesia and Rapa Nui|location=Honolulu|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|date=August 2008|hdl=10125/20375|pages=35–38, 42–51}}</ref>

Pritchard had been away on a diplomatic mission to Great Britain during the incident with the admiral and returned to find the islands under French control. Encouraged by Pritchard, Queen Pōmare resisted in vain against French intervention, writing to [[Queen Victoria]], asking for British intervention, and to King [[Louis Philippe I]] of France.<ref name="Garrett1982" /><ref name="Woman">{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Patricia|title=‘Think of Me as a Woman’: Queen Pomare of Tahiti and Anglo-French Imperial Contest in the 1840s Pacific|journal=Gender & History|date=April 2006|volume=18|issue=1|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell|oclc=663096915|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0424.2006.00417.x|pages=108–129}}</ref> In November 1843, Dupetit Thouars deposed the queen for her continued resistance and formally annexed the islands, placing [[Armand Joseph Bruat]] in charge as colonial governor.

In the absence of their queen, the Tahitian populace loyal to the [[Pōmare Dynasty]] revolted against the French forces which included a few pro-French Tahitian chiefs. At the Battle of Mahaena, on April 17, 1844, a force of 441 French soldiers defeated an under-equipped native force twice its size. A total of fifteen French soldiers and 102 Tahitians died in this battle.<ref name="Layton2015">{{cite book|last=Layton|first=Monique|title=The New Arcadia: Tahiti's Cursed Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sdhCgAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=FriesenPress|location=Victoria, BC|isbn=978-1-4602-6860-5|oclc=930600657|page=177}}</ref> Following the defeat of the native forces at Mahaena, the two sides engaged in guerrilla warfare in the fortified valleys of the Tahitian countryside.<ref name="Kirk2012" />

On the second front, the French attempted to conquer and annex the three neighboring island kingdoms in the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]]. These were Raiatea under King [[Tamatoa IV]] (where Pōmare had sought refuge), [[Huahine]] under Queen [[Teriitaria II]], and [[Bora Bora]] under King [[Tapoa II]]. These islands had traditionally owed formal allegiance to the Pōmare family which the French interpreted as actual jurisdiction.<ref name="Gonschor" /><ref name="Matsuda">{{cite book|last=Matsuda|first=Matt K.|chapter=Society Islands: Tahitian Archives|title=Empire of Love: Histories of France and the Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_BBr0sZM5kC|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-534747-0|oclc=191036857|pages= 91–112}}</ref>
A naval blockade of Raiatea by French captain [[Louis Adolphe Bonard]] was lifted when the warriors of Huahine under Queen Teriitaria "massacred" the French forces at the Battle of Maeva, in which eighteen French marines were killed and forty-three were wounded.<ref name="Kirk2012">{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Robert W.|title=Paradise Past: The Transformation of the South Pacific, 1520–1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klglH_7KkxsC&pg=PA151|year=2012|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=978-0-7864-9298-5|oclc=817224972|pages=151–154}}</ref><ref name="Matsuda" />

Although Great Britain never intervened militarily, the British Navy officer [[Henry Byam Martin]] and commander of [[HMS Tremendous (1784)|HMS ''Grampus'']], was sent to the Society Islands to spy on the conflict. He was charged with investigating Queen Pōmare's suzerainty claims to the other islands.

The guerrilla conflict came to an end in defeat of the Tahitians at Battle of Punaruu in May 1846 and the capture of Fort Fautaua on December 17, 1846.<ref name="Layton2015" /><ref name="Kirk2012" /> In February 1847, Queen Pōmare IV returned from her exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate. Although victorious, the French were not able to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency [[Moorea]] continued to be ruled under the French protectorate.<ref name="Matsuda" /><ref name="Cambridge">{{cite book|author1=Adolphus William Ward|author2= George Peabody Gooch|title=The Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory02warduoft|volume=2|year=1991|publisher=CambridgeUniversity Press|location=Cambridge|oclc=1327327|pages=182–185}}</ref><ref name="histoire.assemblee507">{{cite web|url=http://histoire.assemblee.pf/articles.php?id=507|title=La guerre franco-tahitienne (1844–1846)|work=Histoire de l'Assemblée de la Polynésie française|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> A clause to the war settlement, known as the [[Jarnac Convention]], was signed by France and Great Britain, in which the two powers agreed to respect the independence of Queen Pōmare's allies in Huahine, Raiatea, and Bora Bora.<ref name="Gonschor" /><ref name="OlsonShadle1991">{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=James Stuart|last2=Shadle|first2=Robert|title=Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&pg=PA329|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=978-0-313-26257-9|oclc=21950673|page=329}}</ref> The French continued the guise of protection until the 1880s when they formally annexed Tahiti and the Leeward Islands (through the Leewards War which ended in 1897), forming [[French Polynesia]].<ref name="Gonschor" />
