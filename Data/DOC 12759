'''David McClure''' [[Royal Scottish Academy|RSA]] [[Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour|RSW]] (20 February 1926 â€“ 20 February 1998) was a Scottish artist and lecturer. He is most well known for his paintings of still lifes, interiors, figures and family portraits as well as his landscape and townscape paintings of Scotland, Italy, Sicily and Spain where he lived and travelled throughout his life.

Born in [[Lochwinnoch]] in 1926, McClure graduated in the early 1950s from [[Edinburgh College of Art]].  In his early career he spent significant periods working in Spain, Italy, Sicily and later Norway. He spent the majority of professional life in [[Dundee]] where he lived with his wife and family and taught at [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art]] (now part of the [[University of Dundee]]) from 1958 and spent the last two years of his career there as head of painting, a post he took over from his friend, colleague and fellow artist, [[Alberto Morrocco]], before retiring in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |title=David McClure |url=http://www.scottish-gallery.co.uk/artist/david_mcclure |website=The Scottish Gallery |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==

McClure was born in [[Lochwinnoch]] in 1926 and attended Queen's Park School in [[Glasgow]]. During the [[Second World War]] David served as a [[Bevin Boy]] in the mines of [[West Lothian]]. Some of his earliest known works depict these times; mining scenes and portraits of the miners themselves as well as [[Surrealism|surrealist]] and [[Cubism|cubist]] landscapes depicting pitheads and bings, richly influenced by the works of [[Graham Sutherland]]. Previously he had been studying English and History at [[Glasgow University]] but his mining experiences seemed to have help determine that an already strong interest in the visual arts developed into a need to paint. On his father's side of the family were several generations of Lochwinnoch furniture designers and manufacturers; many of the great, [[River Clyde|Clyde-built]] liners were fitted out with Lochwinnoch furniture and decorative woodwork. His father, Robert, in his spare time was active in the local art society and went to drawing classes, even painting portraits of locals' prize pets or racing pigeons. David first enrolled in the Fine Art course at Edinburgh, his time divided between History of Art at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and Drawing and Painting at the Art College. Tellingly, after a year, he moved solely to the Art College and to painting.

McClure studied at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] from the late 1940s, where his contemporaries included [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[John Houston (painter)|John Houston]] and [[David Michie]] and where students came under the influences of the major Edinburgh figures of the time such as [[Anne Redpath]], [[William Gillies]], [[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]], [[William MacTaggart]] and [[Robert Henderson Blyth]]. His art was enriched by his regard for the French Post-Impressionists masters such as [[Matisse]], [[Gauguin]], [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], [[Chagall]] and [[Redon]], painterly and richly coloured in a long-standing Scottish tradition. Always informed by an intellectual rigour and reference to the wider history of art, literature and music, it is generally celebratory of the good things in life and nature.

== Travel and work ==

In 1952 McClure was awarded a Travelling Scholarship by the Art College which saw him working in France, Spain and Italy. In 1955 they awarded him an [[Andrew Grant (MP)|Andrew Grant Scholarship]] which led to a period of travelling and painting in Scotland, Florence and Sicily where he concentrated on landscape and townscape scenes with some still life painting. After Sicily, McClure returned to Scotland where he taught at Edinburgh College of Art, while continuing to paint. During this period he was commissioned as the artist involved in the reconstruction of the King's room at [[Falkland Palace]], Fife where his murals and ceiling paintings can still be seen today.

The rest of his professional life was spent in [[Dundee]], where he lived with his family and taught from 1958 at [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art]] (now part of the [[University of Dundee]]), where he earned a reputation as an inspirational and caring teacher. McClure had a strong adherence to the core values of sound drawing, the importance of tradition, art history, and learning the craft of painting. He found time to work with students who were less gifted and was appreciated for his rigorous intellect which made an impact on the college. He is remembered at Duncan of Jordanstone for ''opening the minds of staff and students'' alike and spent the last two years of his career there as head of painting a post he took over from his great friend, colleague and fellow Scottish artist, [[Alberto Morrocco]], before retiring in 1985. After his retirement from College, David continued to paint full-time in his studio at the family home at Strawberry Bank, Dundee. During this period he periodically suffered from ill-health, but not until the very end did this affect his painting indeed in his last years he produced what some regard as some of the finest, direct landscapes of his career inspired by summer visits to North-West Sutherland. Such was his determination and commitment to his art that he had an oxygen cylinder rigged up in his studio with a lengthy lead and mask.<ref name="David McClure">{{cite news |title=David McClure |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/david-mcclure-1.352973 |date=24 February 1998 |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>
