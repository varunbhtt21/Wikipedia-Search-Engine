===Albums, singles, EPs and other ventures ===
Brendan has written and produced two albums prior to his appearance on The Voice of Ireland. He released his debut solo album ''To Where I Begin'' on 14 November 2014, following its lead single ''Sweet Love''. He promoted the song by performing on ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' on 31 October 2014, its release date. The album's second single ''Safe and Well'' was released on 10 April 2015. The song was promoted with a performance on [[The Voice of Ireland]] on 12 April 2015.

Brendan began work on his second studio album in early 2015, working with songwriters such as [[Don Mescall]]. Throughout 2015 he released numerous original songs to his [[SoundCloud]] account to coincide with his gigs in the UK & Ireland. However, a follow up album to ''To Where I Begin'' has not been officially released.

McCahey announced on 24 May 2016 via [[Instagram]] that a new EP titled ''Too Tight'' would be released towards the end of June. To coincide with this announcement, a demo of a song titled ''Guide You Through'' was released to his [[SoundCloud]] account. McCahey also announced that he would upload even more songs to [[iTunes]] that year. After much delay, the EP was released in June 2017.

McCahey is continuously gigging as a solo artist and, from time to time, as part of his country group, The Goodgollys. He also continues to upload cover versions of his favourite songs to his SoundCloud account, while still creating original music in the background.

It was announced in January 2018 that McCahey was in the running to represent Ireland in the 2018 [[European Song Contest]], competing against past winners [[Pat Byrne]] and [[Keith Hanley]].
