== Work ==

His book ''Media Ecologies'' examines the interactions of complex media systems in current art practices. Drawing on the theories of [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Félix Guattari]], and [[William Burroughs]], Fuller explores unorthodox and non-traditional uses of media. The book analyzes interventionist art projects by BIT (Bureau of Inverse Technology), Irational.org, pirate radio projects, surveillance video projects, and the work of conceptual artist [[John Hilliard (artist)|John Hilliard]]. According to WorldCat, this book is in 890 libraries<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/software-studies-a-lexicon/oclc/232299603&referer=brief_results   WorldCat Book listing]</ref> In ''Evil Media'',  Fuller and co-author Andrew Goffey examine media power in the form of information systems, addressing, as the book states, "the gray zones in which media exist as corporate work systems, algorithms and data structures, twenty-first century self-improvement manuals, and pharmaceutical techniques."<ref>Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey, ''Evil Media'' (MIT Press, 2012), back cover book description.</ref>
Fuller is also a media artist. He has collaborated with a number of art collectives, including I/O/D, Mongrel, MediaShed, and The Container Project. Along with Lev Manovich and Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Fuller co-founded the MIT Press book series ''Software Studies''.
