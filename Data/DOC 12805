== Synopsis ==
An unaccredited tour guide and a heartbroken tourist form a romantic bond as they explore the wilds of Philippine Islands.

== Cast ==
* [[Louise delos Reyes]] as Julie
* Alexis Petitprez as Zach
* [[Irma Adlawan]] as Marie
* Natasha Villaroman as Stacy
* Chanel Latorre as Karen

== Production ==
Producer Kenneth Au wrote the original screenplay, but it was deemed too ambitious.  He hired director Adlawan to revise the storyline to fit a more modest budget. However, the theme of the struggle between the head and the heart was kept. Au stated that the title has a double meaning: 'ISLAND' presents the more than 7,000 islands of the [[Philippines]] and the character Zach, play by Alexis Petitprez heading to the island for personal reasons; 'DREAMS' represents Julie's ambition to become famous and that we all have dreams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islanddreamsthemovie.com/journey.html|title=About Island Dreams|work=islanddreamsthemovie.com|accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref>

Adlawan invited Santos to collaborate on ''Island Dreams''.  Santos, who had always wanted to make a romantic comedy, agreed and set out to make a film that would be "up to international standards".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://statusmagonline.com/features/gino-m-santos-guns-and-horses-july-2013-interview/|title=Gino M.

== Reception ==
Rito P. Asilo of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' wrote, "The film is so adorable that it's easy to disregard its implausibilities [...] Moreover, ''Island Dreams'' will win you over with its infectious optimism and charming whimsy, anchored on the vibrant chemistry of Delos Reyes and Petitprez. For hopeless romantics, this is the movie to see!".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/126227/mmff-indies-offer-potpourri-of-cinematic-styles-and-treats|title=MMFF indies offer potpourri of cinematic styles and treats|last=Asilo|first=Rito P.|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=2013-12-20|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>
