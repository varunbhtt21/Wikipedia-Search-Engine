Title : Richard M. Hooley
Text : '''Richard Martin Hooley''' (April 13, 1822 â€“ September 8, 1893) was an American theatre manager, [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]] manager, and one of the earliest theatre managers in [[Chicago]].

Hooley was born in [[Ballina, County Mayo]], [[Ireland]], and educated in Manchester before first coming to the United States in 1844. After being associated for two years with [[Christy's Minstrels]], he organized a blackface minstrel company and toured England, returning to the United States by 1853. In 1855 he traveled to California and took over the management of Maguire's Opera House in San Francisco.

==Brooklyn theatre==

Hooley returned to New York around 1858, and opened a theatre in Brooklyn with Hooley's Minstrels in 1862. It was located at the southwest corner of Court and Remsen streets. Hooley sold his interest in the Brooklyn theatre (known as '''Hooley's Theatre''' or other names at other times) in 1878; the building was later demolished and replaced by [[Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh|Dime Savings Bank]], which remained at that location until 1908.<ref name="back">Floyd-Jones, Thomas.
