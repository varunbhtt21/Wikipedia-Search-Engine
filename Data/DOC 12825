'''''Hebrews''''' is the sixth full-length studio album by American rock band [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]]. On March 25, the band announced via their label, [[Equal Vision Records]]' blog that their new record entitled ''Hebrews,'' titled after front-man [[Max Bemis]]'s Jewish lineage, would be released on June 10, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blog.equalvision.com/post/80684558763/say-anything-announce-new-album-hebrews-to-be | title = Say Anything Announce New Album "Hebrews" | publisher = Equal Vision Records | date = 2014-03-25 | accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref> Early on in the recording process, it was announced that the album would be self-produced by [[Max Bemis|Bemis]], and engineered by [[Garron DuPree]]. On April 24, the first single from the album was released, titled "Six Six Six" via billboard.com, along with more details concerning the ambitious production and release of the upcoming record.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6069749/say-anything-six-six-six-song-premiere-max-bemis-talks-ambitious-new-hebrews | title = Say Anything 'Six Six Six' Song Premiere: Max Bemis Talks Ambitious New 'Hebrews' Album| publisher = billboard.com | date = 2014-04-24 | accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref> Most notably, front-man [[Max Bemis]] confessed that the forthcoming album features production that had been unprecedented to the band - the album features no guitars, an instead replaces traditional guitar-based riffs with orchestral string arrangements while maintaining the punk-influenced drive that has been attributed to the band in the past.

"Judas Decapitation" was released to radio on May 19, 2014.<ref name=FMQB>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=40076|title=FMQB Airplay Archive: SubModern Rock|publisher=Friday Morning Quarterback Album Report, Incorporated|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref> In October, the group went on a headlining Australian tour. [[Chris Conley]] of [[Saves the Day]] served as guitarist and backing vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaureview.com/news/tour-updates-confession-say-anything-torche-and-more|title=Tour Updates: Confession, Say Anything, Torche and more!|work=The AU Review|publisher=Heath Media|author=Horobin, Louise |date=September 5, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref>

==Background==

In an interview with Billboard magazine in December, 2013, Bemis spoke about the new record, divulging that the album was "about 80 percent done."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5820034/say-anythings-max-bemis-says-new-album-about-80-percent-done | title = Say Anything's Max Bemis Says New Album 'About 80 Percent Done'| publisher = billboard.com | date = 2013-12-10 | accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref> Furthermore, Bemis spoke covertly about the new record, claiming it to be "kind of a big shift for us in certain ways...some really crazy arrangements."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5820034/say-anythings-max-bemis-says-new-album-about-80-percent-done | title = Say Anything's Max Bemis Says New Album 'About 80 Percent Done'| publisher = billboard.com | date = 2013-12-10 | accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref>

Bemis went on to speak of the recording process with engineer [[Garron DuPree]], saying they "have been able to spread out the recording over the course of five months or so. It's definitely giving me a lot of time to tastefully arrange things that I wouldn't have necessarily had the time to do..." <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5820034/say-anythings-max-bemis-says-new-album-about-80-percent-done | title = Say Anything's Max Bemis Says New Album 'About 80 Percent Done'| publisher = billboard.com | date = 2013-12-10 | accessdate = 2014-04-28}}</ref>

The record features several guest appearances by the singers of various [[indie rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[emo]] bands:  [[Andy Hull]] of [[Manchester Orchestra]], Aaron Weiss of [[mewithoutyou]], [[Tom DeLonge]] of [[Blink 182]] and [[Angels & Airwaves]], Keith Buckley of [[Every Time I Die]], [[Matt Pryor (musician)|Matt Pryor]] of [[The Get Up Kids]] and [[Reggie and the Full Effect]], [[Chris Conley]] of [[Saves the Day]], Gareth and Kim Campesinos of [[Los Campesinos!]], [[Bob Nanna]] of [[Braid (band)|Braid]], Jon Simmons of [[Balance and Composure]], Brian Sella of [[The Front Bottoms]] and [[Jeremy Bolm]] of [[Touché Amoré]]. Additionally, the record features all the members of the band [[Eisley]]: Bemis' wife, [[Sherri DuPree-Bemis]], her sisters Stacy and Chauntelle, brother Weston and cousin Garron. Bemis' brother-in-law, [[Mutemath]] drummer Darren King, also appears on the record.

==Reception==

Hebrews received an 83 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating universal acclaim. Absolutepunk awarded the album an 88%, noting that it "isn't the return to form listeners may have been expecting from Say Anything; instead it's something entirely better." Stephanie Vaughan of Substream Magazine was highly positive, commending the album on pushing boundaries both lyrically and aesthetically.
