== Sanjangjanggi ==
'''Sanjangjanggi''' (三將象棋, 산장장기) is an janggi variant with an unusual rule.  In sanjangjanggi, the king can escape check only by capturing the checking piece with the king in the next turn.  Thus, [[double check]] is an automatic loss for the side with the checked king since the king cannot capture both checking pieces in a single move.<ref name=sanjangjanggi>김응술 9단, 《월간축산 5월호》, 농민신문사, 2009, 154쪽</ref>
