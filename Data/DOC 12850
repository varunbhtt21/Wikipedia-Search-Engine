Dahl began working for KSTP-TV on July 29, 1977 as a production assistant/meteorologist for the weather department as the station had eight others in what was dubbed by the station as "The Largest Television Weather Service in the World."  He eventually got on the air during a 1979 broadcast of KSTP-TV's morning news program "Country Morning," which aired from 6-7am on the weekdays.  He eventually moved through the ranks, eventually becoming Chief Meteorologist in 1986, replacing longtime chief Dennis Feltgen (who moved on to WUSA-TV, eventually KARE-TV in 1987). Today, he gives the weather forecast on weeknights for 5 Eyewitness News and also for the radio stations [[KS95]] and [[1500 ESPN]] Twin Cities.  He currently (as of 2017) shares the weather deal with morning weather meteorologist Ken Barlow and Jonathan Yuhas, both who had previously had been at KARE-TV during the 1990s and 2000s (Barlow was Chief Meteorologist of KARE after its longtime chief Paul Douglas moved to WBBM in Chicago in 1994, and moved to WCCO in 1997).  In 1998, the Minnesota Broadcaster's Association named him Broadcaster of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|last=5 Eyewitness News|title=Dave Dahl - Evening Chief Meteorologist|url=http://kstp.com/article/stories/s223.shtml|work=5 Eyewitness News|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>  Dahl also produced stories about tornado-chasing for [[The Weather Channel]] and [[The Discovery Channel]].
