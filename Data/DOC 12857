:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough. QPQ done. No close paraphrasing or copyvio found. Hook is good, but I can only find the Dominican Republic ban in the references provided. All I could find ws "banned by a few Latin American countries", but that is from a press release. And "a few" is not really "several". [[User:Edwardx|Edwardx]] ([[User talk:Edwardx|talk]]) 23:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::* Okay, then the alt hook should work
* '''ALT1''' ... that "'''[[La Popola]]'''" was banned in the [[Dominican Republic]] because of its sexual lyrics?
:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Thank you. That should have the same impact. Good to go. I've struck the old hook. [[User:Edwardx|Edwardx]] ([[User talk:Edwardx|talk]]) 13:33, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
