'''Alice Day Pratt''' was a teacher and author who at age 40 joined the last wave of government-sponsored [[homesteading]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].<ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia">{{cite web|last=Alzner|first=Cathy|title=Alice Day Pratt (1972&ndash;1963)|work=The Oregon Encyclopedia|publisher=Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/pratt_alice_day_1872_1963/#.U3uOWyiorqw|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref> Pratt, who was single, established a [[dryland farming|dryland farm]] and ranch near [[Post, Oregon|Post]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} east of [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]].{{sfn|Shirley|1998|pages=88&ndash;100}} The {{convert|160|acre|ha|adj=on}} parcel of land became hers through provisions of the [[Homestead Acts|Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909]].<ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"/> Living on her ranch, Broadview, from 1912 through 1930, she kept dogs, cats, horses, chickens, and cows and sometimes produced enough surplus to sell [[alfalfa]], hay, grain, milk, eggs, and vegetables.{{sfn| Shirley|1998|pages=88&ndash;100}} To supplement her income, she taught school in Post, [[Prineville, Oregon|Prineville]], and Conant Basin.<ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"/>

Born in Minnesota in 1872, Pratt grew up there and in South Dakota, later teaching in the [[Southern United States|South]] before moving to Oregon to start a new life. Living at first in a tent, Pratt worked Broadview primarily by herself with occasional help from neighbors and other homesteaders. They eventually helped her build a barn and a wooden house consisting of a single room measuring {{convert|12|by|20|ft|m|0}}. She wrote about her initial Broadview experience in ''A Homesteader's Portfolio'', first published in 1922. Cold, wind, snow, and drought eventually forced her to sell her dairy herd to repay a loan, and in 1930 she gave up dryland farming and moved east to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], to live with her mother and sister. Later relocating to [[New York City]], she retained possession of Broadview until 1950.{{sfn| Shirley|1998|pages=88&ndash;100}}

First published by The Macmillan Company, ''A Homesteader's Portfolio'' was reprinted by the [[Oregon State University Press]] in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|title=Formats and Editions of ''A Homesteader's Portfolio''|publisher=WorldCat|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/homesteaders-portfolio/oclc/28374978/editions?editionsView=true&referer=br|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}</ref> Pratt's other work includes ''Animal Babies'' and ''Animals of a Sagebrush Ranch'', both for juvenile readers, as well as ''Three Frontiers'', and the ''Alice Day Pratt Papers, 1960''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pratt, Alice Day|publisher=WorldCat|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3APratt%2C+Alice+Day.&qt=hot_author|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}</ref> Unpublished work includes a novel called ''Sagebrush Fires'', several short stories, and ''Teacher's Trek'', a memoir about her teaching experiences.<ref name=Gloss>{{cite web|last=Gloss|first=Molly|title=Alice Day Pratt and the Homestead Dream: Introduction to ''A Homesteader's Portfolio''|publisher=Oregon State University Press|url=http://osupress.oregonstate.edu/book/homesteaders-portfolio/intro|year=2011|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>
