The aim of the Piucture Assemble is to imprve the quality of montage pictures on different articles. The images we use for these pictures are all Creative Commons and therefore free for us to use. The work can begin. Picture Assemble is going to actually do something now. [[User:Wackslas|Wackslas - Holler at me]] ([[User talk:Wackslas|talk]]) 09:57, 8 August 2014 (UTC)

There are problems with the London picture as there is an edit war. [[User:Wackslas|Wackslas - Holler at me]] ([[User talk:Wackslas|talk]]) 16:46, 8 August 2014 (UTC)
