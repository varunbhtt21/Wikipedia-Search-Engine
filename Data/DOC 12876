The '''University of Medellín Theater''' is a 1,702-seat [[theater]], the largest in [[Medellín]], Colombia. It has hosted national and international plays and shows. Entertainers such as Cats, [[Chespirito]], Mayumaná, [[Emma Shapplin]], Los Vivancos, Raphael, [[José Luis Perales]], [[Paloma San Basilio]], and [[Bajofondo]] have performed there.

== History ==
The Theatre opened on 26 September 1985. In tribute to the originator of the project, the theater was baptized "Gabriel Botero Obregón" in 1988. Initially, the theater was for exclusive use by the University, but as it became larger, the school made it available for public performances.
