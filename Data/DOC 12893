Title : Swanwick writers' summer school
Text : {{Refimprove|date=June 2014}}

The '''Swanwick Writers' Summer School''' is an annual writers' conference held at The [[Hayes Conference Centre]], near Swanwick, Derbyshire. Founded in 1948, and first held in the summer of 1949, it is believed to be the oldest independent writers' school in the world. Established as a charity and run on a not for profit basis, it was inspired by the London Writers Circle. Early celebrities that featured at the School  included, [[Vera Brittain]], [[L.P. Hartley]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]<ref name="Hilliard">{{cite book|last=Hilliard|first=Christopher|title=To Exercise Our Talents: The Democratization of Writing in Britain|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Victor|title=The Fellowship of Swanwick|date=October 1949|publisher=Writer Magazine}}</ref>
The first chairman was [[Cecil Hunt]], a chairman of the London Writers' Circle. Early delegates included the booker prize nominee, [[Barbara Pym]], one of whose novels, ''No Fond Return of Love'', is inspired, in part, by Swanwick itself.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pym|first=Barbara|title=No Fond Return of Love|date=2002|publisher=Moyer Bell|location=Wickford}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cocking|first=Yvonne|title=A Thankless Task?|journal=Paper to The Barbara Pym North American Conference|date=19 March 2011}}</ref> Associated with the school for over fifteen years as member, host and lecturer was Booker Prize Winner [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]].

== The School ==

Established postwar, it formed part of the continuing process of democratization of writing begun by many amateur groups in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name="Hilliard"/> From its founding in 1948, the aim of the school has been to provide a social and educational framework for the development of creative writing skills.<ref name="Wandor"/> Its role in the establishment of creative writing in the UK has meant that it has been a platform for eminent speakers, from [[Hammond Innes]] in 1952 to Sir [[Terry Pratchett]].<ref name="Martin"/> It has also been closely associated with the development of women's writing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Sylvia|title=The Woman Writer: The History of the Society of Women Writers and Journalists|date=2009|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud}}</ref> Members range from seasoned authors with numerous published books to those new to writing. The inclusive community is designed to enable the sharing of experiences, best practice and support for individual writers' creative writing.
