Either delete or userfy looks to be the best for this one. Its a short article about 5 different buildings that don't even say what they are for and what this business center is. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 16:23, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': An unreferenced list of locations with not even a claim to notability. Any material on these could be developed in the [[:Bratislava#Economy]] article if necessary. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 06:16, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''&nbsp; Fails WP:V.&nbsp; No one knows if this is wp:notable, in fact, five buildings like this could easily be notable, so no prejudice to re-creation.&nbsp; [[User:Unscintillating|Unscintillating]] ([[User talk:Unscintillating|talk]]) 00:25, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
