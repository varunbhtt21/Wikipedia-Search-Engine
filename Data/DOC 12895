==Green Building Initiative==
The Capital is an extremely eco-friendly building. From its cooling devices, to its plumbing, to its utilization of natural light, it is tremendously energy-efficient. Every feature and function is based upon enhancement and performance-driven design which benefits both the occupiers and environment through minimal carbon footprint. The building’s design results in a 35 per cent increased energy-efficiency over conventional buildings. The Capital’s architectural positioning and low solar co-efficient double-glazed glass exterior ensures that it gets adequate daylight of 79.2 per cent for regular occupied spaces. The building is fitted with LED lights everywhere, to keep power-consumption to a minimum. The quality of the air in the building is 30 per cent higher than the requirement specified by ASHRAE 62.1.
