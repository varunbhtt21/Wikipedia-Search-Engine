'''Thomas Raffles''' (1788–1863) was an English [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, known as a dominant [[nonconformist]] figure at the [[Great George Street Congregational Church]] in [[Liverpool]], and as an abolitionist and historian.
==Early life==
The only son of William Raffles (died 9 November 1825), a solicitor, he was born in Princes Street, [[Spitalfields]], London, on 17 May 1788; he was first cousin to [[Stamford Raffles]]. His mother was a [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodist]], and he became one at ten years of age. In 1800 he was sent to a boarding-school in Peckham, kept by a Baptist minister, and among his schoolfellows was his lifelong friend [[Richard Slate]] the biographer. While there he joined the congregation of [[William Bengo Collyer]]. For some months in 1803 he was employed as a clerk at [[Doctors' Commons]], but returned to Peckham (October 1803) to prepare for the ministry.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Raffles, Thomas (1788-1863)|volume=47}}</ref>

Raffles studied at [[Independent College, Homerton|Homerton College]] (1805–9) under [[John Pye Smith]], was thought to show early promise as a preacher, and after declining a call to Hanover Street Chapel, went to George Yard Chapel, [[Hammersmith]]; he was ordained at Kensington Chapel on 22 June 1809. On the sudden death (5 August 1811) of [[Thomas Spencer (minister)|Thomas Spencer]], minister of Newington Chapel, Liverpool, Raffles was invited to succeed him. He preached at Liverpool in November 1811, accepted the call on 11 January 1812, began his ministry on 19 April, and was "set apart" on 28 May, the congregation having moved the day before to a new chapel in Great George Street.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Liverpool ministry==
The prominent ministry of Raffles in Liverpool lasted till 24 February 1862—he avoided politics, though he had liberal principles. He received the degree of LL.D. from [[Marischal College, Aberdeen]], on 22 December 1820, when his testimonials were signed by the Dukes of Sussex and Somerset; and in July 1830 the degree of D.D. from [[Union College]], U.S.A.<ref name="DNB"/>

In September 1833 Raffles declined an invitation to succeed [[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]] at [[Surrey Chapel]] in London. He was chairman of the [[Congregational Union of England and Wales]] in 1839. On 19 February 1840 his chapel in Great George Street was destroyed by fire. A new chapel on the same site was opened on 21 October. In the pulpit he wore cassock, gown, and bands.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Lancashire Independent College==
With [[George Hadfield (politician)|George Hadfield]], Raffles was one of the main founders in 1816 of [[Blackburn Academy]] for the education of Independent ministers, where [[Joseph Fletcher (minister)|Joseph Fletcher]] was the first theological tutor. The move of the institution to Manchester, as the Lancashire Independent College, was largely due to Raffles. From March 1839 till his death he was chairman of the education committee, and raised a large part of the money for the existing college buildings at [[Whalley Range, Greater Manchester|Whalley Range]], near Manchester, opened on 26 April 1843.<ref name="DNB"/>

The first professor of biblical criticism at the College was [[Samuel Davidson]], the author of the second volume in the tenth edition, 1856, of the ''Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures'' by [[Thomas Hartwell Horne]]. In the controversy raised by this publication, which produced Davidson's resignation in 1858, Raffles took the conservative side. On 20 June 1861 his services to the college were acknowledged by the foundation of the Raffles scholarship and the Raffles library.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Death==
Raffles died on 18 August 1863. He was buried on 24 August in the [[Grant Gardens|Liverpool Necropolis]], Liverpool.<ref name="DNB"/>
