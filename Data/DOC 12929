'''Hugh Armstrong Clegg''' (22 May 1920 – 9 December 1995) was a British academic who was a founder of the "[[National Board for Prices and Incomes]]" (1965–71) and later presided over the "[[Standing Commission on Pay Comparability]]" set up by [[James Callaghan]] in 1979.

Clegg was born in  [[Truro]]. Educated at the [[Methodist]] [[Kingswood School]], he rebelled by becoming a [[Communism|Communist]] for a period in his youth, but gained a scholarship to study [[Classics]] at [[Magdalen College]], [[Oxford University]]; he then served for five years in the army during the Second World War. After returning to Oxford, where he gained a first class degree in  [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] in 1947,<ref>Thompson (n.d.)</ref> he was persuaded by [[G. D. H. Cole]] to take up the study of [[industrial relations]]. He became a [[fellow]] of [[Nuffield College]] in 1949.<ref>Brown (1995).</ref>

In 1965 he was appointed to the "[[Royal Commission]] on [[Trade Union]]s and [[employers' organization|Employers' Association]]s" (also known as the "[[Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations|Donovan Commission]]") set up by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government under [[Harold Wilson]] to seek solutions to the problem of [[strike actions|strikes]] which plagued the British economy of the period. Clegg successfully argued in the Commission that strikes were caused by poor [[industrial management]], not by unions, effectively derailing [[Barbara Castle]]'s [[White Paper]], ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', which sought to establish legislative intervention in major disputes, and which the Commission had originally supported.<ref>Rogers (1996).</ref><ref>Thompson (n.d.)</ref>  He also became a member of the "National Board for Prices and Incomes" set up in 1965 to regulate a [[incomes policy|prices and incomes policy]],<ref>Brown (1995)</ref> but the intractable circumstances of [[labour relations]] in Britain meant that this initiative remained a "damp squib".<ref>Fishman (n.d.)</ref> The Board was wound down in 1971 and Clegg wrote a book on his experience entitled ''How to Run an Incomes Policy, and Why We Made Such a Mess of the Last One''.<ref>Brown (1995).</ref>

From 1967 to 1979 Clegg was Professor of Industrial Relations at [[Warwick University]] (the first to hold this appointment), and took part in the launch of [[Warwick Business School]], where he founded the Industrial Relations Research Unit<ref>Thompson (n.d.)</ref> in 1970. In 1979 James Callaghan requested Clegg to chair the "Standing Commission on Pay Comparability" with which it was hoped to tackle the public service disputes of the sort which had led to the '[[Winter of Discontent]]' of 1978–9.<ref>Brown (1995).</ref> The Commission was disbanded by the incoming government of [[Margaret Thatcher]],<ref>Moore (2014), pp. 475–6.</ref><ref>Thompson (n.d.)</ref> who blamed it for over-inflating the government wage bill.<ref>Rogers (1996).</ref>

Clegg wrote numerous studies, including a three volume ''History of British Trade Unions'' (published between 1964 and 1994). His book ''The System of Industrial Relations in Great Britain'' (1953, revised 1970 and 1979) was regarded as a major text on the topic. He died in Warwick in 1995 of a [[stroke]].<ref>Thompson (n.d.)</ref>
