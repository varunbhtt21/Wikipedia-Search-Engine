"'''Trouble'''" is a song recorded by English singer and songwriter [[Natalia Kills]] for her second studio album [[Trouble (Natalia Kills album)|of the same name]] (2013), appearing on it as its closing track. The song's lyrics were written about bad behavior and trouble, while musically, "Trouble" is a [[Tempo|midtempo]] '90s-esque [[pop rock]] number that emulates [[arena rock]]. The overall sound of the song was praised by [[Music journalism|contemporary music critics]], who also highlighted its placement on the album track listing.

The song has been performed by Kills in some live events. Despite not having been released as a single, director Emile Rafael filmed a video for "Trouble", that explores Kills and her on-screen boyfriend's use of [[recreational drugs]] and their relationship; it was released in February 2014. [[Martin Kierszenbaum]] produced a remix of "Trouble" which features [[Electronic music|electronic]] musician [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]].

==Background and release==
"Trouble" was recorded at Enormous Studios and [[Record Plant]], both located in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was written by Kills and American record producer [[Jeff Bhasker]], who also produced the song. Additional production was provided by [[Emile Haynie]] and Guillaume Doubet, who along with Bhasker, programmed all the musical instruments played in the song. Guitars were played by Bhasker and Jimmy Messer; keyboards and background vocals were helmed by the former. He also mixed the song. Audio engineering was handled by Bhasker and [[Pawel Sek]], while mastering was done by Chris Athens at the Chris Athens Masters, located in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name="notes"/>

==Composition and reception==
Musically, "Trouble" is an anthemic midtempo song,<ref name="muumuse1">{{cite web|title=That Girl Is A God Damn Problem: The Return of Natalia Kills|url=http://www.muumuse.com/2013/03/that-girl-is-a-god-damn-problem-the-return-of-natalia-kills.html/|publisher=[[MuuMuse]]|accessdate=11 January 2014|author=Stern, Bradley}}</ref> that is styled in the genre of 90s influenced [[pop rock]].<ref name="idolator"/><ref name="buzzworthy">{{cite web|author=Stern, Brad|title=Celine Dion, Natalia Kills, Tensnake + More: 5 Must-Hear Pop Songs Of The Week|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2013/09/03/celine-dion-natalia-kills-tensnake/|publisher=MTV Buzzworthy.

Jake Buck of ''Vada'' described it as being "the perfect ending to represent the album’s entire theme of badass, rawness, [and] honesty".<ref name="vada">{{cite web|author=Buck, Jake|title=That Natalia Kills is a Goddamn Problem|url=http://vadamagazine.com/07/09/2013/entertainment/natalia-kills-trouble|work=Vada|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=7 September 2013}}</ref> Bradley Stern from [[MuuMuse]] described it as "[[Ryan Tedder]]-meets-[[Fun (band)|Fun]]" while observing that the "cinematic quality" of [[Lana Del Rey]]'s music was present in the track.<ref name="muumuse1"/>

[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] editor Sam Lansky was very positive about "Trouble", favoring the "anthemic sound", which he described as evoking the catalog of English indie rock band [[Florence and the Machine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lansky, Sam|title=Natalia Kills' 'Trouble': Album Review|url=http://www.idolator.com/7481558/natalia-kills-trouble-review|publisher=Idolator.

==Music video==
Emile Rafael directed the official [[music video]] for "Trouble", with cinematography by Charlie Herranz.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Charlie Herranz|url=http://www.charlieherranz.com/#!natalia-kills/cs7a|title=Natalia Kills - 'Trouble'|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref> During an interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', Kills talked on the concept she went with for the visual. Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England at the age of 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt "closer to betterness" in parties, where she was exposed to [[recreational drugs]]. She started to consume them and she felt better with them for "a few short hours". "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears off you want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [.....] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." She further explained that she wanted to create an "honest video that showed both [her] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire."<ref>{{cite web|title=Natalia Kills Isn't Just Another Pretty-Faced Pop Star|url=http://www.elle.com/news/culture/natalia-kills-interview|accessdate=15 April 2014|date=24 February 2014|author=Catarinella, Alex|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Media]]}}</ref> The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' [[Vevo]] and [[YouTube]] accounts.<ref name="trouble">{{cite AV media|title=Trouble|people=Rafael, Emile|publisher=[[YouTube]] ([[Google]])|accessdate=15 April 2014|date=19 February 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hUP43YiyJc}}</ref>

The video begins with Kills walking around on a bridge, as she reminisces about her relationship with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted in the living room of a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to [[Hallucination|hallucinate]], images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having [[sexual intercourse]]. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of [[vodka]] on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.<ref name="trouble"/>

Writing for [[MTV News]], Brad Stern opined that the visual was a "big [[Parental Advisory]] warning in motion" due to its explicit themes, and found it resemblant of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s [[Quentin Tarantino filmography|filmography]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[MTV News]].

==Live performances==
