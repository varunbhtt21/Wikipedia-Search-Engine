The '''Centre for Environmental Policy''' (often abridged as CEP) is a department at [[Imperial College London]] in the Faculty of Natural Sciences. Its aim is to influence a wide range of environmental issues through research on the environmental, energy and health aspects of global problems. CEP's current Director is Professor Mark Burgman<ref>https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.burgman</ref>.

== History ==
The Centre for Environmental Policy was first established in 1977 as the ''Interdepartmental Centre for Environmental Technology'' (ICCET). ICCET was the first of many [[interdisciplinary]] centres within Imperial College London to cross traditional boundaries between departments. It aims “to produce quality research, teaching and advice on [[Environmental policy|environmental]] matters”.<ref name="Centre for Environmental Policy website">{{cite web|title=Centre for Environmental Policy website|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/environmentalpolicy/about|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> Whilst Imperial College is known for its scientific and technological activities,<ref name="Times Higher Education University Rankings">{{cite web|title=Times Higher Education University Rankings|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/subject-ranking/subject/life-sciences/institution/imperial-college-london|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> the Centre was established to combine these with the legal, medical, economic and sociological aspects of the environment, with particular emphasis on cross-linkages between the disciplines. CEP has since evolved to cover a wide range of science, technology and policy research, teaching within the broad disciplines of physical and natural environment and more specifically in the energy, agriculture and international development fields.

CEP focuses primarily on [[evidence-based policy]] making with an emphasis on [[social sciences]] relevant to the environment and to the interface between science and policy in key environmental subjects.<ref name="Centre for Environmental Policy Mission Statement">{{cite web|title=Centre for Environmental Policy Mission Statement|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/environmentalpolicy/about/centremission|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> This work is often carried out in collaboration with other departments at Imperial College London.

In addition to research opportunities, the department offers two [[Postgraduate degree|Postgraduate Taught and Research degrees]]  - [[PhD]]s and the [[MSc]] in [[Environmental Technology]].<ref name="Imperial College MSc in Environmental Technology website">{{cite web|title=Imperial College MSc in Environmental Technology website|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/environmentalpolicy/teaching/msc|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>

CEP is organized in functional groups around research topics, and teaching is related closely to the research groups by subject.
