'''Mount Gallatin''', also known as '''Boundary Peak 67''',<ref name=gnis/>
<ref>{{cite bcgnis|5242|Mount Gallatin|accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref> is a [[mountain]] in the [[Boundary Ranges]] along the [[British Columbia]]-[[Alaska]] border.

The [[Tasakili River]] begins to the north of Mount Gallatin, within Alaska, then crosses the border shortly after its source, flowing southeast at the foot of the mountain to the [[Stikine River]].<ref>{{cite gnis|1415190|name=Tasakili River|accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref>  Mount Gallatin is the peak immediately north of where the Stikine crosses the international boundary.  Just inside that boundary on the Canadian side, at the foot of Mount Gallatin, is the locality and former border post of [[Stikine, British Columbia|Stikine]], formerly known as Boundary.<ref name=bcgnis_stikine>{{cite bcgnis|id=7822|name=Stikine (locality)|accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref>

==Name origin==
In 1924 the USGS named the mountain after [[Albert Gallatin]], one of the US commissioners who negotiated the [[Treaty of Ghent]] which ended the [[War of 1812]].<ref name=gnis/>
