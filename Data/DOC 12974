Prodded as "No references, no claim of notability, fails [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:NSONGS]]." Prod removed and three references added, a self-promo, a wiki article and the common Allmusic write up. Still nothing to prove notability of this "9th track from their self-titled allbum" [[User:Richhoncho|Richhoncho]] ([[User talk:Richhoncho|talk]]) 17:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Nothing approaching notability in this article. Love the self-ref back to the Wiki article for the album though. '''[[User:Lugnuts|<font color="002bb8">Lugnuts</font>]]''' <sup>[[User talk:Lugnuts|Dick Laurent is dead]]</sup> 17:49, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
