Title : Category:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction tracking categories
Text : {{Wikipedia category|hidden=yes|tracking=yes|description=This is a [[wp:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction|WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction]] '''tracking category''', a category intended to build and maintain a list of pages for the Human–Computer Interaction Project primarily for the sake of the list itself. <!-- Rather than being part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme, this category is used to track subcategories by which the HCI Project team maintains the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction/Categories#Categorization scheme|Human–Computer Interaction Project category scheme]] or directs project members towards articles that need some work. -->

Do not add members to this list by editing this category.  Instead, if applicable, place this [[WP:Glossary#Category declaration|category declaration]] at the bottom of the Human–Computer Interaction Project page that is to become a member of this category.

These subcategories are the categories by which the status of all pages that are within the scope of the Human–Computer Interaction project are tracked. Examples of status being tracked include pages needing attention, the Class assessment parameter assigned to the articles, and the various page types. These subcategories are the [[Wikipedia:Categorization#Project categories|''project categories'']]. Do not include ''content categories''.}}
