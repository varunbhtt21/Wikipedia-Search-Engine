This is a [[wp:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction|WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction]] '''tracking category''', a category intended to build and maintain a list of pages for the Human–Computer Interaction Project primarily for the sake of the list itself. Rather than being part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme, this category is used to track all talk pages that have within them the [[template:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction|Human–Computer Interaction Project tag]] designating those pages as being within the scope of the Human–Computer Interaction Project.
<br>
This tracking category helps the HCI Project team to maintain the quality of articles that are within the scope of the project. This category provides a list of articles that have yet to be reviewed by project members for the Class assessment parameter.  Until such a review is conducted, a [[wp:Bots|bot]], based on rules developed by project members, automatically assigned a Class value using the Class assessment values given by other projects.
<br>
The class of these articles has been set either via [[User:Xenobot/A|inheritance]] or as stub due to the corresponding article page containing a stub template.
<br>
In both cases, an editor should confirm or amend the assessment made by the bot and remove the "<code>inherited=yes</code>" or "<code>auto=yes</code>" parameter after doing so. The parameters are within the Chicago project banner found in the talk page of the article.
<br>
''Do not manually add pages to this category by using its [[wp:glossary#Category declaration|category declaration]] within any pages, the category list is automatically generated by bots.  To remove members from this category follow the above instructions.''
