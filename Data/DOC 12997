I am completely unconvinced about the notability of the topic, and I can't really figure out what the organisation really does by reading the article. [[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 17:30, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''keep''' While the writing of the article has some issues, I think that the organization has some potential as its own article, with me finding several news reports on it. [[User:Staglit|Staglit]] ([[User talk:Staglit|talk]]) 23:28, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as [[WP:TOOSOON]]. There's no reason it couldn't be notable, and may be notable in the future, but the independent sourcing does not appear to be there at the moment. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 02:37, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
