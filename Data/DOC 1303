==Synopsis==

===Act 1===
At a cafe, Don Bucefalo, a music master, encounters some peasants who sing in praise of the harvest. He promises that his singing lessons will improve their lot.  One of the peasants is Rosa, whose husband, Carlino, has apparently been killed in the war.  She hopes to study singing and to become the spouse of Count Belprato. Don Marco, Rosa's neighbour, also loves her, and she and her friend, Agata, discuss Don Bucefalo and the opera which he plans to stage. A soldier (Carlino in disguise), arrives hoping to find Rosa. He hears her having a music lesson in her house with Don Bucefalo, and wonders whether she still loves him.  Outside her house, the men of the village are jealous, while the women are envious.

===Act 2===
Don Bucefalo's opera is on the way, though the villagers are dubious about the outcome. Bucefalo is trying, with difficulty, to write verses for Rosa and Agata to sing in the opera. Rosa, however, is delighted, but when the jealous Don Marco arrives he confronts Don Bucefalo. Suddenly, the enraged Carlino (still in disguise) appears and insults Rosa, while Don Bucefalo and Don Marco hide. When they are discovered, more accusations come forth.

===Act 3===
Don Marco and Don Bucefalo have stopped quarreling.  Don Marco is funding the opera and will be singing the principal bass role. Agata feels that her voice is as good as Rosa's, but Rosa gets all the attention. Count Belpranto still wishes to marry Rosa, but she is less certain than previously.  The orchestra is rehearsed at considerable length by Don Bucefalo. Suddenly, Carlino appears, removing his disguise, and is reunited with Rosa. After this, there are a number of alarms and excursions, but all ends happily.
