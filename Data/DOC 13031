'''Counterparty''' is a [[peer-to-peer]] financial platform and [[Distributed computing|distributed]], [[open source]] Internet [[Internet Protocol|protocol]] built on top of the [[Bitcoin]] [[blockchain]] and [[Computer network|network]]. It was one of the most well-known "Bitcoin 2.0" platforms in 2014, along with [[Mastercoin]], [[Ethereum]], [[Colored coin|Colored Coins]], Ripple and [[BitShares]].<ref name=two-point-oh>{{cite web|publisher=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-28/bitcoin-2-0-shows-technology-evolving-beyond-use-as-money|last=Kharif|first=Olga|date=2014-03-28|title=Bitcoin 2.0 Shows Technology Evolving Beyond Use as Money|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> In November of 2014, Counterparty added support for the [[Ethereum Virtual Machine]] to the Counterparty protocol and allowing all Ethereum decentralized applications to be run on the Bitcoin blockchain within the Counterparty protocol.<ref name=evm>{{cite web|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/11/12/bitbeat-bitcoin-2-0-firm-counterparty-adopts-ethereums-software/|last2=Casey|first2=Michael J.|last1=Vigna|first1=Paul|title=BitBeat: Bitcoin 2.0 Firm Counterparty Adopts Ethereumâ€™s Software|date=2014-11-12|access-date=2019-07-06}}</ref>

Counterparty has a native currency, '''XCP''', which was created during January 2014 by 'proof of burn', when 2140 BTC, worth between US$ 1.6 million and US$ 2 million at the time, were destroyed by sending them to a provably unspendable Bitcoin address.<ref name="brokaw">{{cite web|title=The People Who Burn Bitcoins|publisher=Minyanville|author=Alex Brokaw|date=2014-04-16|url=http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/editors-pick/articles/The-People-Who-Burn-Bitcoins-bitcoin/4/16/2014/id/54627|accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> XCP is used in the Counterparty protocol to create new assets, make bets and callback callable assets issued with Counterparty. Counterparty used proof of burn to issue XCP, instead of a more traditional fund-raising technique for altcoin launches, to keep the initial distribution of funds as fair and decentralized as possible, and to avoid potential legal issues.<ref name="brokaw" />

'''counterpartyd''' is the [[reference implementation]] of the Counterparty protocol, and '''Counterwallet''' is a deterministic web-wallet frontend to counterpartyd, in which all cryptography is handled client-side. Both are open source and hosted on GitHub.<ref name="bitcore">{{cite web|url=http://bitcore.io/blog/articles/counterparty-enabling-decentralization-with-insight/|author=Robby Dermody|accessdate=2014-04-26|date=2014-04-24|title=Counterparty: Enabling Decentralization with Insight|publisher=bitcore blog}}</ref>

In 2014, Counterparty was part of the first significant plan, led by global e-commerce company [[Overstock.com]], to issue and trade legal [[securities]] on a blockchain.<ref name=wired>{{cite web|publisher=Wired|access-date=2019-07-06|title=Overstock's Radical Plan to Reinvent the Stock Market with Bitcoin|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/overstock-and-cryptocurrency/|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=2014-07-30}}</ref> The initiative eventually became Overstock's tZERO.<ref>https://www.wsj.com/articles/overstocks-founder-bets-on-blockchain-not-bedsheets-1542969001</ref>
