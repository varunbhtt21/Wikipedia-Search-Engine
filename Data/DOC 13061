=== Impact on Greek swimming ===

Eleni Avlonitou had a significant impact on Greek swimming, serving as a role model in sport.<ref name=ethnikos /> The unprecedented for Greece image of a young girl winning gold medals in international games resulted in a surge of interest in swimming, which was until then an elite sport in Greece. While she dominated women's competition until she retired in 1980, Eleni Avlonitou was followed by a series of international class female swimmers. Vivi Protopappa, also of Ethnikos Gymnastikos Syllogos, who was also coached by Giorgos Mpias, followed by Sofia Dara and later Elli Roussaki of [[Olympiakos CFP]] kept swimming in the public eye until the early 1990s, by which time public interest had established a vibrant swimming scene in Greece.
