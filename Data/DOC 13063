The '''Ambassador of the United Kingdom to the Republic of Nicaragua''' is the [[United Kingdom]]'s foremost [[Diplomat|diplomatic representative]] in [[Nicaragua]], and in charge of the UK's [[diplomatic mission]] in [[Managua]].

Until 1945, UK envoys to [[Guatemala]] were [[Dual accreditation|also accredited]] to Nicaragua (see [[List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Guatemala]]), but there were occasionally consular representatives in the country. From 1976 to 1991 and 2004 to 2011 the ambassador to [[Costa Rica]] was also accredited to Nicaragua. From 2011 to 2015 the UK had a separate ambassador to Nicaragua, although he was resident in Costa Rica (he was married to the ambassador to Costa Rica). From 2015 the ambassador to [[Costa Rica]] is again also accredited to Nicaragua.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.uk/government/news/change-of-her-majestys-ambassador-to-costa-rica-nicaragua |title=Change of Her Majesty's Ambassador to Costa Rica & Nicaragua |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office |date=3 February 2015}}</ref>
