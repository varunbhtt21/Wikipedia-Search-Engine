FlightPath is designed to facilitate more accurate advising sessions on campus, as well as provide a complete history of past advising sessions.  Advisors may select which courses they wish a student to register in, up to several semesters in to the future, as well as leave comments for the student and other campus staff.  Students and advisors may also try out other degrees using the "What If?" tool, to see their courses applied to a different degree plan.

==Background==

===Origins===
FlightPath was created by [[University of Louisiana at Monroe|The University of Louisiana at Monroe]]'s Student Success Center,<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> but failing to find a software package which was both affordable and provided the required features.  The original release of FlightPath, in Fall of 2006, was functional but lacked the framework necessary for contributions from the open source community.  By 2012, FlightPath's core code had been modified to resemble many of the development framework features of [[Drupal]], a popular open-source CMS, making it now suitable for adoption by other universities.  FlightPath has since been made mobile-friendly, and is now part of ULM's mobile app.<ref>{{cite web
