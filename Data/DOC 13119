Title : 1988 United States men's Olympic basketball team
Text : The '''1988 United States men's Olympic basketball team''' represented the [[United States]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul, South Korea]]. The team was coached by [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]] of Georgetown University. This would be the first time that Team USA would win the bronze medal and the last time they were represented by a basketball team that didn't feature [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] stars.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/28/sports/seoul-olympics-men-s-basketball-after-16-year-wait-soviets-stun-us-again-82-76.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fO%2fOlympic%20Games&pagewanted=print|title=THE SEOUL OLYMPICS: Men's Basketball; After 16-Year Wait, Soviets Stun U.S. Again, 82-76 - The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> Meanwhile, other teams were able to use players that were de facto professionals but were still classified as amateurs. The most prominent example of this was the Soviet team, which used players who were being paid by the state. Also, unlike the American team the Soviets featured multiple players who had experience playing at the Olympic level.
