The celebrations were finally held on 7 August, under the chairmanship of Mr Sudhir Misri (as PAM President). The chief guest, Mrs Maya Hanoomanjee, the then Honorable Minister of Health, stated in her speech that she agreed to promulgate the Pharmacy Council Bill and to revisit the Pharmacy Act to bring it in line with other countries.<ref name="Pharmacists_Day">{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthpharmacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Email-news.pdf |title=Commonwealth Pharmacists Day |publisher=commonwealthpharmacy.org}}</ref> The Commonwealth Pharmacists Day is celebrated every year on 16 June around over 40 Commonwealth countries.<ref name="Commonwealth_Countries">{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-tech-soc.org/CPA.html |title=Commonwealth Pharmacists Association  |publisher=science_technology_and_society}}</ref><ref name="Pharmacy_Day">{{cite web|url=http://www.thevoiceslu.com/features/2009/june/13_06_09/June_16_is_Commonwealth_Pharmacy_Day.htm |title=Commonwealth Pharmacy Day  |publisher=The_Voice_Slu_online}}</ref>
