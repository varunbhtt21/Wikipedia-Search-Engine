This is a [[wp:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction|WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction]] '''tracking category''', a category intended to build and maintain a list of pages for the Human–Computer Interaction Project primarily for the sake of the list itself. Rather than being part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme, this category is used to track all talk pages that have within them the [[template:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction|Human–Computer Interaction Project tag]] designating those pages as being within the scope of the HCI Project.

This tracking category helps the HCI Project team to maintain the quality of articles that are within the scope of the HCI Project by grouping all articles that were given a "B" within the Class assessment parameter. These articles should be periodically audited to see if the B Class assignment is still appropriate.
}}

These articles are rated according to the [[Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment|Wikipedia 1.0 Assessment Scale]].

''Articles are automatically placed in this category when the corresponding rating is given. Do not put items in this category. Put them in the appropriate category by adding or editing the article's [[Template:WikiProject Human–Computer Interaction]] Talk page tag, as follows:''
