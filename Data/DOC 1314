'''Game of the Seven Kingdoms''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|{{linktext|七國象棋}}}}, <small>[[pinyin|p]]</small> ''qī-guó-xiàng-qí'' ;) is a seven-player [[Chess variant|variant]] of the game [[xiangqi]] ("Chinese chess"). It is traditionally ascribed to [[Sima Guang]], although he died well before the 13th century, to which this game is traditionally dated. There is skepticism regarding the game's 13th-century formulation.<ref>"The imbalance in the array must reflect on the play (assuming that the game was ever played), and can perhaps be attributed to the fact that a [[Go board|weiqi board]] rather than a bespoke board was used. The existence of pieces moving as [[Queen (chess)|Q]] and [[Bishop (chess)|B]] at least two centuries before their introduction into orthochess is a phenomenon few will credit. (Leventhal, ''Chess of China'')" {{harvcol|Pritchard|2007|p=343}} [But note that the queen and bishop were already present in Japan in the game of [[dai shogi]], invented in the 13th century and the most prestigious form of chess at the time in Japan.]</ref>
