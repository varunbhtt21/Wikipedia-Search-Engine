Title : Neuroendocrine differentiation
Text : {{Orphan|date=March 2017}}

'''Neuroendocrine differentiation''' is a term primarily used in relation to [[prostate cancer]]s that display a significant [[neuroendocrine cell]] population on histopathological examination. These types of prostate cancer comprise true neuroendocrine cancers, such as [[Small-cell carcinoma|small cell carcinoma]], [[carcinoid]] and carcinoid-like tumors, as well as prostatic adenocarcinoma exhibiting focal [[Neuroendocrine cell|neuroendocrine]] phenotype.<ref name="di Sant'Agnese, 1992">{{cite journal |author=di Sant'Agnese PA |title=Neuroendocrine differentiation in carcinoma of the prostate.

==Normal function==
Prostatic neuroendocrine cells, also known as endocrine-paracrine cells,<ref name="di Sant'Agnese, 1992" /> are part of a larger regulatory cell population scattered throughout the whole organism, collectively known as diffuse neuroendocrine system or [[APUD cell]]s.<ref name="di Sant'Agnese, 1992" /> Neuroendocrine cells are present in all regions of the human prostate, most notably around the ducts, but also in the acinar epithelium and prostatic urothelium; there is a significant inter-individual variability.<ref name="di Sant'Agnese, 1992" /><ref name="Abrahamsson, 1996">{{cite journal |author=Abrahamsson PA |title=Neuroendocrine differentiation and hormone-refractory prostate cancer |journal=The Prostate. Supplement |volume=6 |issue= |pages=3–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8630226|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(1996)6+<3::AID-PROS2>3.0.CO;2-T }}</ref> Two morphologic types have been described: the '''open type''', extending slender apical processes to the ductal or acinar lumen, and the '''closed type''' cells, which lack lumenal protrusions but display dendrite-like processes that extend between adjacent epithelial cells.<ref name="di Sant'Agnese, 1992" /><ref name="Abrahamsson, 1996" />

Neuroendocrine cells in the human prostate contain a diverse array of secretory products: [[serotonin]] (which is present in virtually all neuroendocrine prostatic cells, [[Chromogranin A|chromogranin A (CgA)]], [[synaptophysin]] and [[Enolase 2|neuron-specific enolase (NSE)]] (three proteins that are used as markers for neuroendocrine cells) [[calcitonin]] and other peptides of the calcitonin family ([[Calcitonin gene-related peptide|calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)]] and katacalcin, which colocalize to the calcitonin-containing cells), [[Gastrin-releasing peptide|bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)]], [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|thyroid stimulating hormone]]-like peptide, [[Parathyroid hormone-related protein|parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)]], alpha-[[Human chorionic gonadotropin|human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)]], [[somatostatin]], [[cholecystokinin]], [[Vasoactive intestinal peptide|vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)]], [[neuropeptide Y]], [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)]], and [[adrenomedullin]].<ref name="di Sant'Agnese, 1992" /><ref name="Abrahamsson, 1996" /><ref name="Sun et al., 2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun Y, Niu J, Huang J |title=Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer |journal=American Journal of Translational Research |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=148–62 |year=2009 |pmid=19956427 |pmc=2776313}}</ref> The physiology of their secretion and its regulation is incompletely understood. Regulatory cues might come through endocrine, paracrine (from neighboring neuroendocrine cells), autocrine or neurocrine routes. The open type cells may in addition receive regulatory signals from luminal molecules<ref name="Vashchenko and Abrahamsson, 2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vashchenko N, Abrahamsson PA |title=Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: implications for new treatment modalities |journal=European Urology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=147–55 |date=February 2005  |pmid=15661408 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2004.09.007}}</ref>
The developmental origin of these cells is as yet unknown. They are thought to arise from a different precursor than other epithelial prostatic cells, possibly through a neurogenic lineage of their own, which is therefore distinct from the secretory and basal cells that derive from urogenital sinus.<ref name="Vashchenko and Abrahamsson, 2005" />

==Role in prostate cancer==
The most heavily studied aspect of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer (but not the only one, as mentioned above) is the '''focal type''', which refers to a conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma that exhibits neuroendocrine foci at histopathological examination. Tumor xenografts of mice subjected to castration have been shown to undergo rapid regression with a dramatic drop in [[androgen receptor]] expression in tumor cells and a steep increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells<ref name="Jongsma et al., 1999">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Jongsma J, Oomen MH, Noordzij MA, etal |title=Kinetics of neuroendocrine differentiation in an androgen-dependent human prostate xenograft model |journal=The American Journal of Pathology |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=543–51 |date=February 1999  |pmid=10027412 |pmc=1850014 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65300-X}}</ref> Following castration, the proportion, as well as the density of neuroendocrine tumor cells, rises abruptly, eventually leading to the formation of neuroendocrine cell islets that are spread throughout the tumor and account for the majority of its constituent cells.<ref name="Jongsma et al., 1999" />

The immunohistochemical phenotype of focal neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer has been intensively studied. [[Chromogranin A]], which is the most abundant product of prostatic neuroendocrine cells and neuroendocrine tumor cells, is widely recognized as a reliable marker for neuroendocrine differentiation.<ref name="Vashchenko and Abrahamsson, 2005" /> [[Synaptophysin]] and [[Enolase 2|neuron-specific enolase]] are also reliable markers.<ref name="Sun et al., 2009" /> The most frequently encountered products in neuroendocrine tumor cells across prostate cancer samples appear to be [[calcitonin]] (in more than one third of cases), [[neurotensin]], [[serotonin]], [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], [[Vasoactive intestinal peptide|vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)]] and [[Gastrin-releasing peptide|bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide]].<ref name="Ishida et al., 2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishida E, Nakamura M, Shimada K, Tasaki M, Konishi N |title=Immunohistochemical analysis of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer |journal=Pathobiology |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=30–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19188748 |doi=10.1159/000178153}}</ref> Neuroendocrine tumor cells express [[cytokeratin]]s that are typically expressed by luminal secretory type cells, but lack basal cell markers such as high molecular weight cytokeratin and [[TP63|p63]].<ref name="Huang et al., 2006">{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Yao JL, di Sant'Agnese PA, Yang Q, Bourne PA, Na Y |title=Immunohistochemical characterization of neuroendocrine cells in prostate cancer |journal=The Prostate |volume=66 |issue=13 |pages=1399–406 |date=September 2006  |pmid=16865726 |doi=10.1002/pros.20434}}</ref> They are negative for [[androgen receptor]] and [[Prostate-specific antigen|prostate-specific antigen (PSA)]] and are positive for [[Prostatic acid phosphatase|prostate acid phosphatase]].<ref name="Huang et al., 2006" /><ref name="Bonkhoff, 2001" /> Neuroendocrine tumor cells are also negative for the proliferation marker [[Ki-67 (protein)|Ki-67]];<ref name="Jongsma et al., 1999" /><ref name="Huang et al., 2006" /> however, adjacent non-neuroendocrine tumor cells appear to display an increased expression of Ki-67.<ref name="Huang et al., 2006" /> As opposed to their normal neuroendocrine counterparts, tumor neuroendocrine cells express the beta-oxidative enzyme [[alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase]], which is a recently described marker for prostate cancer.<ref name="Huang et al., 2006" />

As opposed to the focal type of neuroendocrine differentiation seen in prostatic adenocarcinoma, [[Small-cell carcinoma|small cell carcinoma]] of the prostate, in turn, exhibit a '''universal type''' in that virtually all the constituent tumor cells display neuroendocrine features.<ref name="Abrahamsson, 1996" /> Immunohistochemically, prostatic [[Small-cell carcinoma|small cell carcinoma]] are positive for [[NK2 homeobox 1|thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1)]], [[Neural cell adhesion molecule|CD56]], [[chromogranin A]], [[synaptophysin]], [[Enolase 2|neuron-specific enolase]], [[calcitonin]] and [[Gastrin-releasing peptide|bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide]], while lacking, or rarely and weakly expressing, [[androgen receptor]] and [[prostate-specific antigen]].<ref name="Sun et al., 2009" /><ref name="Yao et al., 2006">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Yao JL, Madeb R, Bourne P, etal |title=Small cell carcinoma of the prostate: an immunohistochemical study |journal=The American Journal of Surgical Pathology |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=705–12 |date=June 2006  |pmid=16723847 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0147-5185&volume=30&issue=6&spage=705 |doi=10.1097/00000478-200606000-00005}}</ref>

It is commonly believed that prostatic adenocarcinoma exhibiting significant neuroendocrine differentiation is less differentiated, more aggressive and hormone therapy-resistant.<ref name="Bonkhoff, 2001">{{cite journal |author=Bonkhoff H |title=Neuroendocrine differentiation in human prostate cancer.
