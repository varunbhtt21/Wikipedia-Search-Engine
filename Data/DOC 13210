==Career==
Che started doing stand-up comedy in 2009.<ref name= banner>{{cite news |title= Comedian Michael Che talks stand-up, SNL writing gig |last= Greenstein |first= Colette |work= The Bay State Banner |location= Boston, Massachusetts |date= February 20, 2014 |page= 15 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/1504068621/ }}</ref> He would regularly work several sets per night.<ref name= banner/> In 2012, Che appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.<ref name= banner/><ref name=ew>{{cite magazine|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/04/28/michael-che-daily-show-snl/ |title=Michael Che: 5 things to know |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=April 28, 2014 |first=Hillary |last=Busis |accessdate=April 28, 2014 }}</ref> In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called Che one of "10 Comics to Watch",<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer @barkerrant |url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/features/new-york-standup-michael-ches-tastes-run-raw-1200564460/ |title=10 Comics to Watch: ‘SNL’ Writer Michael Che Hones Chops in Edinburgh |magazine=Variety |date=July 17, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named him one of "The 50 Funniest People."<ref name="rollingstone"/>

Che joined ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a writer in 2013, at first as a guest writer and soon after as regular writer.<ref name= banner/> On April 28, 2014, it was announced that Che would join ''[[The Daily Show]]'' in June as a correspondent.<ref name=ew/><ref name=sentinel>{{cite news |author=Hal Boedeker |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/blogs/tv-guy/os-daily-show-names-michael-che-correspondent-20140428,0,6934483.post |title=Daily Show names Michael Che correspondent |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429010422/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/blogs/tv-guy/os-daily-show-names-michael-che-correspondent-20140428,0,6934483.post |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> Che made his onscreen debut as a ''Daily Show'' correspondent on June 4, 2014. Although he appeared in only nine segments during his brief time on the show, he was lauded by ''[[TV Guide]]'' for his work, in particular "Race/Off: Live From Somewhere", in which in response to the 2014 [[Ferguson protests]], he continuously changed the location from where he was reporting his remote segment (with each change in location accompanied by a background change via the green screen), in order to ostensibly find a place where a black man would not be harassed by police officers, ultimately going into outer space. These are regarded by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as his signature segments on the program.<ref>Rudolph, Ileane (July 27, 2015). "Alumni Association: A roundup of ''The Daily Show''{{'}}s coolest Graduates". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp 21-22.</ref>

On September 11, 2014, he was named to take over for [[Cecily Strong]] as the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor for the [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)|40th season]] of ''SNL'' alongside [[Colin Jost]], the 40th season premiered on September 27, 2014.<ref name="The New York Times"/> Che is the first African-American co-anchor in the history of ''Weekend Update''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/michael-che-to-become-first-ever-black-anchor-of-snls-w-1633844443|title=Michael Che to Become First Ever Black Anchor of SNL's Weekend Update|work=Jezebel|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref> During his first two seasons Che primarily hosted ''Weekend Update'', while rarely appearing in any sketches. During his [[Saturday Night Live (season 42)|third season]], Che was promoted to the main cast and [[Jay Pharoah]] was fired from the show after six years. This left Che and [[Kenan Thompson]] as the only male African-American cast members until Che's [[Saturday Night Live (season 43)|fourth season]], when ''SNL'' hired [[Chris Redd]], bringing the number of African-American male cast members to three.

In 2014, Che appeared in the movie ''[[Top Five]]'', appearing as one of [[Chris Rock]]'s character's friends.<ref>{{cite news |title= Rock makes another hit with 'Top Five' |last= Sandoval |first= Lapacazo |work= New York Amsterdam News |location= New York, New York |date= December 11, 2014 |page= 18 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/1640492817/ }}</ref>

In December 2017, Che was named co-head writer of ''Saturday Night Live''.<ref>{{cite news |title= Saturday Night Live Makes Its Most Baffling Move Yet |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |work=Vanity Fair |date=December 13, 2017 |url= https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/colin-jost-michael-che-head-writers-saturday-night-live|accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>

On September 17, 2018, Che co-hosted the [[Emmy Awards]] with Colin Jost.<ref>{{cite news |title= Here Are the Best Jokes From Michael Che and Colin Jost's Emmys 2018 Monologue |last=Gajanan |first=Mahita |work=Time |date=September 18, 2018 |url= http://time.com/5398338/emmys-2018-michael-che-colin-jost-monologue-jokes/ |accessdate=September 18, 2018 }}</ref> 

Che, along with Colin Jost, appeared on the March 4, 2019 episode of [[WWE]]'s ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', where both were announced as special correspondents for [[WrestleMania 35]] on April 7. That same episode, they got involved in a storyline with wrestler [[Braun Strowman]], eventually resulting in both Che and Jost becoming participants in the [[André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]] at WrestleMania.<ref name="Raw03042019">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/03/04/3-4-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-triple-hs-response-to-batista-attacking-ric-flair-charlotte-flair-wants-vince-mcmahon-to-name-her-the-raw-womens-champion-snl-weekend-update-hosts-appear-final/|title=3/4 Powell’s WWE Raw TV Review: Triple H’s response to Batista attacking Ric Flair, Charlotte Flair wants Vince McMahon to name her the Raw Women’s Champion, SNL Weekend Update hosts appear, final hype for WWE Fastlane|date=March 4, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Raw03252019">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/03/25/3-25-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-ronda-rousey-becky-lynch-and-charlotte-flair-face-riott-squad-in-beat-the-clock-challenge-matches-kurt-angle-vs-samoa-joe-the-penultimate-edition-before-wrestlem/|title=3/25 Powell’s WWE Raw TV Review: Ronda Rousey, Becky Lynch, and Charlotte Flair face Riott Squad in Beat The Clock Challenge matches, Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe, the penultimate edition before WrestleMania 35|date=March 25, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref> At the event, Jost and Che went under the ring for the majority of the match, and then tried to eliminate Strowman while he was trying to do the same to [[the Hardy Boyz]].
