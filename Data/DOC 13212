This page is redundant to [[Wikipedia:Glossary]]. I recommend <s>'''blanking the page''' (and merging anything that needs to be merged) '''and then</s> converting the page into a redirect towards [[Wikipedia:Glossary]]'''.

*No objection, as a substantial contributor to the page. The solution is probably even simpler, though: just redirect. No need to blank first. And the page history will remain accessible for any editors interested in a merge. This page has an unusual history: it was apparently a previous name of [[WP:AADD]], and continued to redirect there from 2007 until last year, when it [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2013 November 13#Wikipedia:Guide to abbreviations used in deletion debates|came up at RfD]], at which point it was turned into its own page. I think the participants in that discussion probably weren't aware of the glossary—and at the time, neither was I. It does appear that this page is redundant to the glossary now. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 18:49, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect as suggested''', although blanking is pointless and deleting first is a bad idea for many reasons. [[User:Ego White Tray|Ego White Tray]] ([[User talk:Ego White Tray|talk]]) 20:11, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:*Right, I was just stating "blank the page" to state that the content on the page currently could be blanked. So, yes, I'm essentially just stating that the page become a redirect. (I've struck out part of my nomination to reflect this.) [[User:Steel1943|<span style="color: #2F4F4F;">'''''Steel1943'''''</span>]] ([[User talk:Steel1943|talk]]) 20:17, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' - In the 3 years I've been here I've ever only known "WP" & have never known GLOSSARY existed neither .... Anyway the page is helpful but is pretty much a copy of GLOSSARY so per nom & above Redirect is the best solution.

*'''Merge''' and '''Redirect''' to [[Wikipedia:Glossary]]. No reason to lose those terms not yet in the target. [[User:The Whispering Wind|The Whispering Wind]] ([[User talk:The Whispering Wind|talk]]) 22:54, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
