Recreation of a previously deleted article. No evidence of encyclopedic notability. Only one source. A Google failed to turn up anything that rings the Notability bell.

Brasilian stadium who meets the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B]](fully professional league) criteria.
The stadium has an initial capacity of 10,000 people.

::I am not sure what the (fully professional league) criteria is or how it applies to a stadium, but it's possible I may have missed something.

*'''Redirect''' to [[Luverdense Esporte Clube]]. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 11:54, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

The stadium currently hosts matches about a fully professional league ([[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B]]) so it respects the notablity and it isn't a small stadium.(10.000 spectators).

The team is notable so I assume that if a team is notable, then his stadium should be as well.--[[User:Lglukgl|Lglukgl]] ([[User talk:Lglukgl|talk]]) 22:53, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Stadium notable enough, just like [[Estádio do Canindé]], [[Estádio Anacleto Campanella]], and others. Also, this stadium is very well known here in Brazil, despite the club and the stadium being from a small town (Luverdense defeated Corinthians last year in this stadium).

*'''Keep''' - I don't know how one would even start to think that a stadium of 10,000 for a team in a fully professional league isn't notable. It doesn't take long to find a very recent newspaper article about the stadium [http://www.mtagora.com.br/esportes/arquibancadas-comecam-a-ser-montadas-no-passo-das-emas/69593392], I'm sure I'd quickly find more if I had access to newspapers older than 30 days.

*'''Keep''' per the above comments; we generally find stadiums like this to be deserving of their own articles. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 14:09, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
