He went to the United States on a full scholarship (according to a 2010 interview)<ref>Graff, Lloyd (20 January 2010).

==Career==
Wey began his financial career in [[Oklahoma]] where he worked as an investment advisor and broker. In 2000, he became the CEO of the Oklahoma-based Benchmark Global Capital Group. In 2002 Wey was fined $5,000 and suspended by the U.S. [[National Association of Securities Dealers]], now FINRA, for "maintaining accounts" at his brokerage firm without informing the firm in writing. The Oklahoma Department of Securities censured Way and banned him from operating in the state. They claimed that he had advised a retired 68-year-old woman to invest her entire life savings in the Nasdaq listed stock of [[Pharmaprint]], a "risky penny stock," without disclosing that he was a paid consultant to the company. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Wey agreed to cease carrying out all brokerage and investment advisory business in the state.<ref name="ft">Anderlini, Jamil (26 July 2011).
