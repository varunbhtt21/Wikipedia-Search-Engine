:({{Find sources|Putroe Neng}})
It's hard to tell whether this article is about fact or fiction, but the categories listed imply it's supposed to be about a real person.  There are no reliable sources to support any claims--the only reference is to a novel.  The article reads more like legend/story than fact and could clearly use a rewrite if it's kept.[[User:Mdtemp|Mdtemp]] ([[User talk:Mdtemp|talk]]) 18:30, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''  I agree - the only source given is the novel and if kept there are essentially two choices - cut this down to bare bones sourced fact or convert the article to one about the novel.  Neither option ensures notablility will be met.[[User:PRehse|Peter Rehse]] ([[User talk:PRehse|talk]]) 19:57, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''', there are a whopping six [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Putroe+Neng&btnG=&lr= Google Scholar] hits for "Putroe Neng", all of which are in Indonesian. If she were one of the few Chinese from 1800 BC we know by name (as the author claimed on the [[Talk:Putroe Neng|talk page]]), there would be ''far'' more sources. [[User:Huon|Huon]] ([[User talk:Huon|talk]]) 23:46, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': This seems to be a machine translation of a Chinese or possibly Malay tale based on events during the reign of the Ming dynasty [[Zhengde Emperor]] (r. 1505-1521), around the time [[Aceh]] was founded by [[Ali Mughayat Syah]] in 1511. The mention of 1180 BC is spurious on that basis. I can't find any corroboration in English or Chinese so it's a GNG failure. The English is sadly too far gone to attempt a rescue.

*'''Do not agree''' : i can prove it with picture of her entombment, here : [http://www.bappedalhokseumawe.web.id/makam-putroe-neng-kota-lhokseumawe Makam Putroe Neng]
also you can google it : putroe neng

:'''Comment''' {{ping|Bappeda lhokseumawe}} Unfortunately the link you provided is dead (from the UK) at least, but I found some other pictures of the tomb. I don't dispute that Putroe Neng existed, but the English in the current article is unfathomable. All the references I can find seem to be in Indonesian. Do you know what her Chinese name was or whether there are any English books about her?

::A picture of the purported grave of a character in a popular novel is not proof (read tourist trap).  I also expect that the novel was based on a real character but it is impossible to separate out the novel from the real person not to mention the fact that the only source is the novel.  Until that is changed we have to assume that the the character is based on the authors imagination. [[User:PRehse|Peter Rehse]] ([[User talk:PRehse|talk]]) 11:12, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Agreed, unless someone can come up with Putroe Neng's Chinese name, which in turn provides references, it doesn't look as if there's anything more that can be done to salvage the article.

Her chinese name is : Nian Nio Liang Khie
she is a legend here, especially in [[lhokseumawe]] city and there is a prove of her entombment. we can develop and dig more deeper about her life, the government of [[lhokseumawe]] city also seek and develop about it. modern reference, the novel is based on true story of her life.

: {{ping|Philg88}} i`m not Chinese, so i dont know her Chinese character, sorry.... ([[User:Bappeda lhokseumawe|Bappeda lhokseumawe]] ([[User talk:Bappeda lhokseumawe|talk]]) 17:55, 1 May 2014 (UTC));

So what do you think all? real people, real legend and true story, still marked for deletion? we can develop it together and dig more deeper about her life, i still looking more reliable source about when she was born and when she was dead, but still not found it, maybe you guys can help me to develop it ([[User:Bappeda lhokseumawe|Bappeda lhokseumawe]] ([[User talk:Bappeda lhokseumawe|talk]]) 18:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC));

:{{ping|Bappeda lhokseumawe}} The problem is that we have nothing in English to work from, which is why I asked for the Chinese characters because I can translate anything based on that. Unfortunately, I don't speak Indonesian, so the document you referenced above is of no use and gets us no further along.

*'''Comment''' I searched Google Books and Google Scholar for the presumed Chinese name. A grand total of three hits, all in Indonesian. Whether she lived in 1800BCE or 1500CE, I would expect at least ''some'' non-Indonesian sources on a female Chinese admiral. [[User:Huon|Huon]] ([[User talk:Huon|talk]]) 18:23, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::{{ping|Huon}} Indeed. The Chinese name isn't correct - it doesn't follow the rules of pinyin, juyutping or Wade-Giles, more likely a Malay interpretation based on their phonetic system.
