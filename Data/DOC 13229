:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Length and date ok. But I can't fin the issue of the cost of uniforms in the reference? --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 19:16, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::*Thanks for looking at it, [[User:Soman|Soman]]! It's in the second paragraph of the "Sports" subsection. "San Pedro is known nationally for its "Gordos y Flacos" ("Fatties versus Skinnies") soccer game.[10]...Because organizers wanted to raise money for the church, they decided against spending money on uniforms. Instead, in order to for spectators to easily identify two opposing teams, they came up with the idea of using fat players against skinny players.[10]" Thanks again for looking into it!

:::*yes, but I don't find any mention of the uniform cost issue in http://wfnode01.nacion.com/2013-06-16/RevistaDominical/Gordos-contra-flacos--Mejenga-de-peso.aspx?subsection=Articulos --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 07:26, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::::* It's in the second paragraph of "Los Inicios." "Como no había uniformes para distinguir a los bandos, pensaron en reunir a todos los gordos de la comunidad en un equipo, y enfrentarlos con los flacos futboleros. Y así comenzó la historia." - "As there were no uniforms to tell the groups apart, we thought we'd get together all fat guys of the community on one team, and put them up against all the skinny football guys. That's how it started." "Max se le ocurrió la idea de organizar un partido singular el lunes después de terminadas las fiestas de San Pedro, para alargar la celebración y ayudar al consejo económico de la iglesia." --"It occurred to Max [Lara] to organize a unique game the Monday after the festivals ended in San Pedro, in order to stretch the celebration and help out the economic aspects of the church." That said, perhaps the following hook is more accurate if the first is making an assumption:
:::::*'''ALT1''' <s>... that the annual "Fatties versus Skinnies" soccer match in '''[[San Pedro de Santa Bárbara]]''' started in order to distinguish the players?</s> [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]] ([[User talk:Mvblair|talk]]) 14:19, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] ALT1 doesn't work because it's unclear: "distinguish" could mean "distinguish between" (tell apart) or "highlight" (single out), and having that kind of ambiguity is a major problem. Please try another wording. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 21:52, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::'''ALT2'''<s>... that the annual "Fatties versus Skinnies" soccer match in '''[[San Pedro de Santa Bárbara]]''' started so that spectators could tell the difference between two teams?</s> [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]] ([[User talk:Mvblair|talk]]) 22:17, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

{{outdent}} You know, the source doesn't say it was so the spectators could tell the teams apart. This could also be to help the players themselves tell who's on their team and the opposing one, since there are no uniforms. How about another ALT:
*'''ALT3'''... that the annual "Fatties versus Skinnies" soccer match in '''[[San Pedro de Santa Bárbara]]''' was started so that people could identify each team's players, since they had no uniforms? 
The article should probably also be adjusted accordingly. —[[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 03:19, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:Sounds great. Language in article has been changed from "spectators" to "people." [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]] ([[User talk:Mvblair|talk]]) 10:49, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]], I count five paragraphs in the body of the article that don't have any sourcing. By DYK rules, each paragraph in the article's body should have at least one inline source citation. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 12:15, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:I added several citations. Now each paragraph has citations. I did not see this rule on the [[Wikipedia:Did you know]] rules page. [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]] ([[User talk:Mvblair|talk]]) 12:54, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Mvblair, it's in the supplementary guidelines, which explain the rules in greater depth, rule [[WP:DYKSG#D2|D2]]. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 21:04, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Full review needed now that the hook is settled on. (I can't do it since I proposed the hook.) [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 21:04, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Long enough, new enough, sourcing adequate, QPQ done, no copyvios found, hook short enough and sourced. Good to go.--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 16:13, 23 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
