==Career==

He began learning the racing trade in [[Ireland]] under [[horse trainer|trainers]] [[Dermot Weld]] and [[Jim Bolger (racehorse trainer)|Jim Bolger]].<ref name=BetExpert/> Tylicki was then apprenticed to  [[Richard Fahey]] in [[Malton, North Yorkshire]]. His first big race victory came in 2008, when he won the [[John Smith's Cup]] at [[York Racecourse|York]] on ''Flying Clarets''. He finished that year with 25 wins from 163 rides.<ref name=RPProfile/> In the 2009 season, he built on this initial success to narrowly beat [[David Probert]] to the title of [[British flat racing Champion Apprentice]]. Probert was suspended for the final day of the [[flat racing]] season when just a single victory separated them. Tylicki donated his trophy to the family of fellow apprentice Jamie Kyne, who had recently died in a house fire.<ref name=Carroll091113/> At the end of the season, he wintered in [[California]] to enhance his skills, riding for trainer Paddy Gallagher.<ref name=Carroll091113/>

Less than a year after becoming champion apprentice, his career was put on hold after a serious shoulder injury.<ref name=McGrath120920/> He finished the year with just 26 winners.

Afer coming back from injury he had over 60 winners a season. In September 2012 he rode five winners for five different trainers at [[Newcastle Racecourse|Newcastle]] on a Saturday, followed by a double on two outsiders at [[Great Yarmouth Racecourse|Yarmouth]] on the following Thursday. Semayyel, trained by [[Clive Brittain]] won the [[John Musker Fillies' Stakes]] at a [[starting price]] of 125-1, one of the biggest priced winners in British horse racing history, and Tylicki followed up with a win on a 33-1 horse.<ref name=McGrath120920/> For the former achievement he won the Flat Jockey Award at the annual 'Magic Moments' awards dinner.<ref name=BetExpert/>

On the 31 October 2016 he was involved in a serious four horse accident at [[Kempton Park Racecourse]] which ended with him in intensive care at St George's Hospital in [[Tooting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/37828149|title=Freddie Tylicki in intensive care but Jim Crowley discharged after Kempton fall|date=31 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> It has since been announced that he has been diagnosed with [[Thoracic vertebrae|T7]] paralysis meaning he is paralysed from the waist down.

Initially based in the north of England, Tylicki moved to [[Newmarket, Suffolk]].
