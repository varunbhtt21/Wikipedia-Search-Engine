==History and profile==
''Blow Up'' was founded in September 1995 as a fanzine that evolved into a monthly magazine. After six numbers, in fact, the fanzine magazine becomes available only by subscription. In June 1998 the magazine arrives on newsstands.<ref name="info"/>

''Blow Up'' is published by Tuttle Publishing, founded by Bianchi in 1997 and based in [[Cortona|Cortona, Tuscany]]. The name was inspired by the character Archibald "Harry" Tuttle of the 1985 movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''.<ref>Paolo Mereghetti, ''Il Mereghetti. Dizionario dei film 2011'', Baldini Castoldi Dalai, 2010.</ref> In addition to the magazine, the Tuttle opened in 2003, a series of books titled "The Books of Harry", dedicated to strands, themes and cultural phenomena related to music and rock culture. Fifteen volumes have been published to date.

The magazine has received the Premio Lo Straniero in 2010, with the following motivation: "By acting from the margins and in total independence, [Stefano Isidoro Bianchi] preceded the prior music press for treating non-conventional or free distribution in the national territory, and has contributed significantly to the formation of the latest generation of listeners, musicians and critics. In a period of the utmost confusion in music, [Stefano Isidoro Bianchi] kept his desire to offer routes of synthesis that were trying to be placed into coherent movements, which were otherwise isolated or fragmented, that crossed the body of underground music."<ref>[Stefano Isidoro Bianchi Premio 2010 - Santarcangelo di Romagna (RN)]</ref>
