{{Nihongo|'''''Zatoichi and the Chess Expert'''''|座頭市地獄旅|Zatōichi jigoku-tabi}} is a 1965 Japanese ''[[chambara]]'' film directed by [[Kenji Misumi]] and starring [[Shintaro Katsu]] as the blind masseur [[Zatoichi]]. It was originally released by the [[Daiei Film|Daiei Motion Picture Company]] (later acquired by [[Kadokawa Pictures]]).

''Zatoichi and the Chess Expert'' is the twelfth episode in the 26-part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi. It has also been known as '''''Showdown for Zatoichi''''' and '''''Zatoichi's Trip to Hell'''''.

==Plot==
On a boat trip to [[Honshu island]], Zatoichi (Katsu) makes the acquaintance of Jumonji (Narita), an expert [[shogi]] (Japanese [[chess]]) player and swordsman. Once on Honshu, a group of men that had tried to cheat Zatoichi at dice try to take revenge upon him- only for Ichi to turn the tables on them in the tussle. However, Miki, the niece of a woman named Otane, is injured in the confusion, compelling Ichi to go to great lengths to procure the medicine needed to cure her injury. When she recovers, the child sincerely thanks him, leaving him overwrought with emotion.

The four travel to [[Hakone]] to use hotsprings to help in healing Miki. After arriving, further guests arrive- including a young lord named Sasagara, his sister Kume, and their retainer Roppei, the only one who could identify the man who killed their father, over a heated game of shogi. When Otane admits to her growing feelings for Ichi, he reveals that he still harbors feelings for a [[The Tale of Zatoichi|woman of the same name]] that he once loved, who is now dead. Despite his suspicions, Zatoichi remains silent, until Roppei is found dead- having been strangled with a length of wire while engaged in prayer. This, combined with the discovery of a fishing float at the scene of the killing, further implicates Jumonji. However, Ichi continues to "observe" Jumonji through their shogi games, with the latter having won two of their three games. When The brother and sister reveal a particular quirk of the man who killed their father- rubbing his nose and snapping his finger- Ichi is all but certain of his new friend's guilt in the two murders.

As Zatoichi and Jumonji escort Otane and Miki on their trip, the two men begin a verbal game of shogi, with each move escalating the tension between the two of them. Eventually, the moment of "checkmate" comes- when Jumonji confronts Ichi, only for Zatoichi to reveal the fishing float from the scene of the murder. The two engage in a duel- with Zatoichi telling Otane to get Miki away from the carnage- and Ichi critically wounds Jumonji. Though he stops from killing the man, when Sasagara and Kume arrive to enact vengeance upon him. In the confusion, Zatoichi departs- with Sasagara and Kume bowing respectfully to him, and Miki calling out to thank him.

As he walks away, upon hearing Miki, Zatoichi softly returns her earlier thanks- saying "arigato".

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Howard Thompson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film "has considerably more juice than its predecessor", adding that "[t]he settings, especially the natural [[panoramas]], and the costumes are fetching in quite lovely color. Mr. Katsu performs, as before, with beguiling, wily simplicity. There is an excellent, sinuous performance by Mikio Narita as an expert [[shogi]] player and no mean swordsman himself. Chizu Hayashi is a pretty, earnest heroine and little Gaku Yamamoto, as her chirpy daughter, is cute." Thompson also said "[t]he movie is a [[Western (genre)|Western]] in being unabashedly [[melodramatic]] with most of the cards stacked, clipping along in a straight line through some pictorial backgrounds and with [[virtue]] triumphant."<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=|first=|title=MOVIE REVIEW: ''Zatoichi and the Chess Expert'' (1965) Zatoichi Returns for a Showdown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9801E3D81E31E034BC4D53DFB6678383679EDE|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 October 1968|author=[[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Thompson, Howard]]}}</ref>
