'''Cefn Meiriadog''' (sometimes '''Cefnmeriadog''') is a rural [[community (Wales)|community]] in [[Denbighshire]], Wales, just south-west of the city of [[St Asaph]].<ref>[https://www.denbighshire.gov.uk/en/resident/community-and-living/clubs-and-societies/organisation.aspx?ID=6D618CF90ADD95938025696F003B52CA Cefn Meiriadog Historic Society;] accessed 16 April 2014.</ref> The boundary of the community on three sides is the [[river Elwy]], which here forms the county boundary with Conwy County Borough. Arguably the largest settlement in the community is the hamlet of Bontnewydd. Also in the community is the hamlet of Groesffordd Marli where Ysgol Cefn Meiriadog is situated.

The community is named for a small ridge of the same name (''cefn'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] means "ridge"). It is said that the place was named for [[Meriasek|St Meiriadog]], a 4th or 5th century Breton saint. [[Cefn Caves]] are nearby, where human and early [[Neanderthals|Neanderthal]] remains dating back 250,000 years have been discovered. Visitors to the site have included [[Charles Darwin]], in 1831.<ref>[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/rhagor/article/cefn-caves/ National Museum of Wales]; accessed 16 April 2014</ref> The site is known as [[Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site]].

There is a local spring, ''Ffynnon Fair'' ("St Mary's spring"), and it was once believed to have healing properties. The poet [[Siôn Tudur]] (1522 – 1602) lived at Plas Wigfair (GR028712) nearby.

==St Mary's Church, Cefn==
About 300 metres SE of the fort ''Bryn y Cawr'' ("Giant's Hill", at the SE end of the ridge) stands the small St Mary's church (Grade II listed).<ref>[http://cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=CPAT105472 Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust; accessed 16.9.2014]</ref> The stone was quarried at the site of the church; the church was opened and consecrated on 3.9.1864 by Bishop Short of St Asaph, and the new ecclesiastical parish of "Cefn" was created on 7. 2. 1865, made up of two "townships": Wigfair and Meiriadog (both in Denbighshire), previously part of St Asaph parish.
==Population==
In 2011 the population of Cefnmeiriadog was 389, with 30.4% able to speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]].
