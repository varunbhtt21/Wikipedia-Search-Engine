'''Druid''' (Welsh: ''Y Ddwyryd'') is a small village in [[Denbighshire]], [[Wales]]. The village is located where the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] and the [[A494 road|A494]] meet, about two miles west of [[Corwen]] and near the boundary with [[Gwynedd]].

The name is an anglicised corruption of the Welsh name Y Ddwyryd, which has no connection to Druidic history or folk lore.
