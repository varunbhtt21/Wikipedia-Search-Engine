:({{Find sources|The Squids}})
Fails [[WP:NBAND]]. First two sources given are trivial mentions, the third is an old library notice. PROD was needlessly declined, as the article WAS eligible for PROD as the previous AfD was never concluded, given that the first incarnation of the article had been speedily deleted under CSD A7.

*'''Delete''' Google didn't turn up enough to ring the notability bell. Subject seems to fail BAND and GNG. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 23:34, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge''' to [[LaTour#The_Squids]] which already discusses the band. There are some sources, but possibly not enough. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 10:56, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' any sourceable content to [[LaTour#The_Squids]], which passes [[WP:NBAND]] (this band does not).--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] <small>([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|T]] / [[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|C]] / [[WP:FOUR]] / [[WP:CHICAGO]] / [[WP:WAWARD]])</small> 13:33, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Proposal is biased, from a devoted deletionist that damages wikipedia, removes valid articles about subcultures that he knows not a thing, is possibly racist and deserves some scrutiny! [[User:QuackDoctor|QuackDoctor]] ([[User talk:QuackDoctor|talk]]) 21:45, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::'''Caution''' Your comment is inconsistent with Wikipedia guidelines that require editors to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] and to be [[WP:CIVIL|civil]] in our dealings with one another. This can result in administrative sanctions. I suggest an apology is in order. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 23:53, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge'''. [[LaTour#The_Squids]] seems the best place for any sourcable content. [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] &#124; [[User talk:Bishonen|talk]] 16:30, 1 May 2014 (UTC).
