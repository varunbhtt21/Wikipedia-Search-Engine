* ... that '''''[[Passionate Journey]]''''' contains only pictures, and was named as Thomas Mann's favourite film—but is a novel?

:* ''Comment'': Too similar to last fool's day hook? If not, for next April Fool's please
<small>Improved to Good Article status by [[User:Curly Turkey|Curly Turkey]] ([[User talk:Curly Turkey|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Matty.007|Matty.007]] ([[User talk:Matty.007|talk]]) at 18:49, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* <s>[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]]</s> The hook is interesting. Article is long enough, neutral, and the images are tagged correctly. It was promoted to GA on 27 April. I didn't detect close paraphrasing checking some of the sources that I was able to preview online. Needs a QPQ.--[[User:Khanate General|Khanate General <font color="#E30A17">☪</font>]] [[User talk:Khanate General|talk]] [[User:Khanate General/Project Mongol Conquests|<sup>project mongol conquests</sup>]] 17:30, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::*No QPQ needed for non-self noms. If you want me to, I'll find the specific rule, but as a fairly experienced DYKer, I can assure you that it is not required.

:::*Please compare hook with [[Template:Did you know nominations/Southern Cross (wordless novel)]], personally I think it is sufficiently different, but I think it should be taken into account.
