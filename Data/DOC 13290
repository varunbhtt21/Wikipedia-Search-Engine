==History==
The structure was built to host Patna university meetings, convocations and other functions.

It got ready in 1926 and was inaugurated the same year by the then [[Governor of Bihar and Orissa]] province and Chancellor of the University Sir [[Henry Wheeler (governor)|Henry Wheeler]].<ref name="indiatimes1">{{cite web|author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Sweat-tears-and-toil-of-examiners/articleshow/20267452.cms |title=Sweat, tears and toil of examiners - The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2013-05-26 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>

Before the construction of the senate hall, meetings, conferences and convocations of the Patna University were held at different places in the city.

Meetings of the faculties were held in the hall located at the new college, now known as [[Patna College]], while senate meetings were held in the conference room of the [[Patna Secretariat]].<ref name="indiatimes2">{{cite web|author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/An-august-house-falls-victim-to-misuse/articleshow/671941889.cms |title=An august house falls victim to ‘misuse’ - The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2001-12-09 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>
