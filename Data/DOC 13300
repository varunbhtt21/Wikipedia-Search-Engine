Fails PORNBIO and the GNG. No qualifying awards. No independent reliable sourcing. No reliably sourced biographical content. Substantially promotional elements, created by SPA. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 18:59, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' per [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]]. I came across this article after dealing with some copyvios related to the subject over on Commons and I was planning to AfD but it looks like you beat me to it. --[[User:Lewis Hulbert|Lewis Hulbert]] ([[User talk:Lewis Hulbert|talk]]) 20:39, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
Please help me with what I can do to help save this article from deletion.  I added his notable Vanity Fair Magazine article.  Does that help? [[User:Sutorta[[User:Sutorta|Sutorta]] ([[User talk:Sutorta|talk]]) 21:06, 28 April 2014 (UTC)]]

*'''Delete''' This vanity fair article about him would be a one line mention of a master liam in an articlem about Murdock and myspace?
