==History==

===Building===
The Asian Centre building that houses the department consists of the roof and structural framework of the Sanyo Pavilion constructed for the [[Expo '70|1970 World Exposition]] in [[Osaka]], Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asia.ubc.ca/department-2/department/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721231229/http://www.asia.ubc.ca/department-2/department/history/ |archivedate=2014-07-21 |df= }}</ref>

===About the logo===
[[File:Camellia sinensis drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Camellia sinensis]]
The UBC Department of Asian Studies logo is often mistaken to be a lotus flower, with its symbolization of purity, non-attachment and enlightenment in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition. The design (courtesy of Asian Studies MA student in Japanese Literature and Visual Culture and graphic designer Julien Butterlin) does indeed gesture in this direction, but the flower depicted is in fact that of [[Camellia sinensis]] or Thea sinensis, the tea plant whence many teas are derived. A genus of flowering plants in the family [[Theaceae]], Camellia sinensis is used to harvest [[white tea]], [[green tea]], [[oolong]], [[pu-erh tea]] and [[black tea]].

[[Tea]] is the second-most widely consumed beverage in the world after water, and has played and continues to play such a central role in all Asian cultures that it was a natural choice to symbolize the diverse Asian languages, literature, cultures, histories, and religions represented in the Department of Asian Studies.
