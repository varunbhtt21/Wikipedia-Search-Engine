Title : Patient derived xenograft
Text : '''Patient derived xenografts''' ('''PDX''') are models of cancer where the tissue or cells from a patient's [[tumor]] are implanted into an immunodeficient or [[humanized mouse]].<ref name=lai /> PDX models are used to create an environment that allows for the natural growth of cancer, its monitoring, and corresponding treatment evaluations for the original patient.<ref name=lai />

==Methods of tumor xenotransplantation==
Several types of immunodeficient mice can be used to establish PDX models: athymic [[Nude mouse|nude mice]], [[SCID mouse#Mice|severely compromised immune deficient (SCID) mice]], [[NOD mice|NOD-SCID mice]], and recombination-activating gene 2 (Rag2)-knockout mice.<ref name="morton2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton CL, Houghton PJ |title=Establishment of human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice |journal=[[Nature Protocols]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=247–50 |year=2007 |pmid=17406581 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.25 | type=Protocol }}{{open access}}</ref>  The mice used must be immunocompromised to prevent transplant rejection. The NOD-SCID mouse is considered more immunodeficient than the nude mouse, and therefore is more commonly used for PDX models because the NOD-SCID mouse does not produce [[natural killer cell]]s.<ref name="Siolas">{{cite journal |vauthors=Siolas D, Hannon GJ |title=Patient-derived tumor xenografts: transforming clinical samples into mouse models |type=Perspective |journal=[[Cancer Res.|Cancer Research]] |volume=73 |issue=17 |pages=5315–9 |date=September 2013 |pmid=23733750 |pmc=3766500 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1069}}{{open access}}</ref>

When human tumors are resected, necrotic tissues are removed and the tumor can be mechanically sectioned into smaller fragments, chemically digested, or physically manipulated into a single-cell suspension. There are advantages and disadvantages in utilizing either discrete tumor fragments or single-cell suspensions. Tumor fragments retain cell-cell interactions as well as some tissue architecture of the original tumor, therefore mimicking the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, a single-cell suspension enables scientists to collect an unbiased sampling of the whole tumor, eliminating spatially segregate subclones that are otherwise inadvertently selected during analysis or tumor [[Subculture (biology)|passaging]].<ref name="William 2013"/>  However, single-cell suspensions subject surviving cells to harsh chemical or mechanical forces that may sensitize cells to [[anoikis]], taking a toll on cell viability and engraftment success.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zvibel I, Smets F, Soriano H |title=Anoikis: roadblock to cell transplantation? |journal=Cell Transplantation |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=621–30 |year=2002 |pmid=12518889<!-- |doi=10.3727/000000002783985404-->|doi=10.3727/000000002783985404 }}{{closed access}}</ref>

===Heterotopic and orthotopic implantation===
Unlike creating xenograft mouse models using existing cancer cell lines, there are no intermediate ''in vitro'' processing steps before implanting tumor fragments into a murine host to create a PDX. The tumor fragments are either implanted heterotopically or orthotopically into an immunodeficient mouse. With '''heterotopical implantantion''', the tissue or cells are implanted into an area of the mouse unrelated to the original tumor site, generally subcutaneously or in subrenal capsular sites.<ref name="Jin K 2010">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jin K, Teng L, Shen Y, He K, Xu Z, Li G |title=Patient-derived human tumour tissue xenografts in immunodeficient mice: a systematic review |journal=Clinical & Translational Oncology |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=473–80 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20615824 |doi=10.1007/s12094-010-0540-6 | type=Review }}{{closed access}}</ref> The advantages of this method are the direct access for implantation, and ease of monitoring the tumor growth. With '''orthotopic implantation''', scientists transplant the patient’s tumor tissue or cells into the corresponding anatomical position in the mouse. Subcutaneous PDX models rarely produce metastasis in mice, nor do they simulate the initial tumor microenvironment, with engraftment rates of 40-60%.<ref name="Jin K 2010" /> Subrenal capsular PDX maintains the original tumor stroma as well as the equivalent host stroma and has an engraftment rate of 95%.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cutz JC, Guan J, Bayani J, etal |title=Establishment in severe combined immunodeficiency mice of subrenal capsule xenografts and transplantable tumor lines from a variety of primary human lung cancers: potential models for studying tumor progression-related changes |journal=[[Clin.

===Generations of engraftments===
The first generation of mice receiving the patient's tumor fragments are commonly denoted F0. When the tumor-burden becomes too large for the F0 mouse, researchers passage the tumor over to the next generation of mice. Each generation thereafter is denoted F1, F2, F3…Fn. For drug development studies, expansion of mice after the F3 generation is often utilized after ensuring that the PDX has not genetically or histologically diverged from the patient’s tumor.<ref name="Tentler 2012">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tentler JJ, Tan AC, Weekes CD, etal |title=Patient-derived tumour xenografts as models for oncology drug development |journal=[[Nat.

==Advantages over established cancer cell lines==
[[Immortalized cell line|Cancer cell lines]] are originally derived from patient tumors, but acquire the ability to proliferate within ''in vitro'' [[cell culture]]s. As a result of ''in vitro'' manipulation, cell lines that have been traditionally used in cancer research undergo genetic transformations that are not restored when cells are allowed to grow ''in vivo''.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Daniel VC, Marchionni L, Hierman JS, etal |title=A primary xenograft model of small-cell lung cancer reveals irreversible changes in gene expression imposed by culture in vitro |journal=[[Cancer Res.|Cancer Research]] |volume=69 |issue=8 |pages=3364–73 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19351829 |pmc=2821899 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4210}}{{open access}}</ref>  Because of the cell culturing process, which includes enzymatic environments and centrifugation, cells that are better adapted to survive in culture are selected, tumor resident cells and proteins that interact with cancer cells are eliminated, and the culture becomes phenotypically homogeneous.<ref name="William 2013">{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams SA, Anderson WC, Santaguida MT, Dylla SJ |title=Patient-derived xenografts, the cancer stem cell paradigm, and cancer pathobiology in the 21st century |journal=[[Lab.

When implanted into immunodeficient mice, cell lines do not easily develop tumors and the result of any successfully grown tumor is a genetically divergent tumor unlike the heterogeneous patient tumor.<ref name="William 2013" /> Researchers are beginning to attribute the reason that only 5% of anti-cancer agents are approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] after pre-clinical testing to the lack of tumor heterogeneity and the absence of the human stromal microenvironment.<ref name="Hutchinson">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutchinson L, Kirk R |title=High drug attrition rates--where are we going wrong? |journal=[[Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol.|Nature Reviews. Clinical Oncology]] |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=189–90 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21448176 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2011.34 |type=Editorial }}{{open access}}</ref>  Specifically, cell line-xenografts often are not predictive of the drug response in the primary tumors because cell lines do not follow pathways of drug resistance or the effects of the microenvironment on drug response found in human primary tumors.<ref name="Hutchinson" />

Many PDX models have been successfully established for breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, and many other cancers because there are distinctive advantages when using PDX over cell lines for drug safety and efficacy studies as well as predicting patient tumor response to certain anti-cancer agents.<ref name="one mouse">{{cite journal |vauthors=Malaney P, Nicosia SV, Davé V |title=One mouse, one patient paradigm: New avatars of personalized cancer therapy |type=Mini-review |journal=[[Cancer Lett.|Cancer Letters]] |volume=344 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24157811 |doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2013.10.010 |pmc=4092874}}{{closed access}}</ref>  Since PDX can be passaged without ''in vitro'' processing steps, PDX models allow the propagation and expansion of patient tumors without significant genetic transformation of tumor cells over multiple murine generations.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Reyal F, Guyader C, Decraene C, etal |title=Molecular profiling of patient-derived breast cancer xenografts |journal=[[Breast Cancer Res.|Breast Cancer Research]] |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=R11 |year=2012 |pmid=22247967 |pmc=3496128 |doi=10.1186/bcr3095}}{{open access}}</ref>  Within PDX models, patient tumor samples grow in physiologically-relevant tumor microenvironments that mimic the oxygen, nutrient, and hormone levels that are found in the patient’s primary tumor site.<ref name="Tentler 2012" /> Furthermore, implanted tumor tissue maintains the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities found in the patient and the xenograft tissue can be excised from the patient to include the surrounding human stroma.<ref name="xeno v gem">{{cite journal |vauthors=Richmond A, Su Y |title=Mouse xenograft models vs GEM models for human cancer therapeutics |journal=[[Dis.

===Humanized xenograft models===
One prominent shortcoming of PDX models is that immunodeficient mice must be used to prevent immune attacks against the xenotransplanted tumor. With the immune system incapacitated, a critical component of the known tumor microenvironment interaction is foregone, preventing immunotherapies and anti-cancer agents that target the immune system components from being studied in PDX models. Researchers are beginning to explore the use of humanized-xenograft models to enable immune studies. Humanized-xenograft models are created by co-engrafting the patient tumor fragment and peripheral blood or bone marrow cells into a NOD/SCID mouse.<ref name="Siolas" /> The co-engraftment allows for reconstitution of the murine immune system, giving insight into the interactions between xenogenic human stroma and tumor environments in cancer progression and metastasis.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Talmadge JE, Singh RK, Fidler IJ, Raz A |title=Murine models to evaluate novel and conventional therapeutic strategies for cancer |type=Review |journal=[[Am. J. Pathol.|The American Journal of Pathology]] |volume=170 |issue=3 |pages=793–804 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17322365 |pmc=1864878 |doi=10.2353/ajpath.2007.060929}}{{open access}}</ref> However, these strategies have yet to be validated for most tumor types and there remain questions over whether the reconstituted immune system will behave in the same way as it does in the patient. For example, the immune system could be 'hyper-activated' due to exposure to mouse tissues in a similar fashion to graft versus host disease.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassidy JW, Caldas C, Bruna A |title=Maintaining tumour heterogeneity in patient derived tumour xenografts |type=Review |journal=[[Cancer Res.|Cancer Research]] |volume=75 |issue=15 |pages=2963–2968 |date=July 2015 |pmid=26180079 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0727 |pmc=4539570}}{{open access}}</ref> Humanized-xenograft models for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia have been created.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyer LH, Debatin KM |title=Diversity of human leukemia xenograft mouse models: implications for disease biology |type=Review |journal=[[Cancer Res.|Cancer Research]] |volume=71 |issue=23 |pages=7141–4 |date=December 2011 |pmid=22088964 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1732}}{{open access}}</ref>

==Clinical relevance==

===Breast cancer===
The classification of [[Breast cancer classification#DNA classification|genetic breast cancer subtypes]], including triple-negative and [[HER2/neu|HER2-positive]] subtypes,<ref name="Tentler 2012" /> have allowed oncologists to use a patient’s breast cancer subtype to personalize cancer therapy schedules. Utilizing PDX [[triple negative breast cancer]] models, scientists found that aurora kinase inhibitors slows tumor growth rate and suppresses recurrence in a breast cancer subtype that has a high recurrence rate and poor survivability.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Romanelli A, Clark A, Assayag F, etal |title=Inhibiting aurora kinases reduces tumor growth and suppresses tumor recurrence after chemotherapy in patient-derived triple-negative breast cancer xenografts |journal=[[Mol.

===Pediatric cancer (neuroblastoma)===
Researchers have established [[neuroblastoma]] PDXs by [[orthotopic]] implantation of patient tumor explants into immunodeficient mice. The PDXs retained the [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]] of patient tumors, and exhibited substantial infiltrative growth and [[metastasis]] to distant organs including the bone marrow. The researchers cultured PDX-derived neuroblastoma cells ''in vitro'' and the cells retained tumorigenic and metastatic capacity ''in vivo''.<ref name="Braekeveldt2015">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Braekeveldt N, Wigerup C, Gisselsson D, etal |title=Neuroblastoma patient-derived orthotopic xenografts retain metastatic patterns and geno- and phenotypes of patient tumours |journal=[[International Journal of Cancer]] |volume=136 |issue=5 |pages=E252–61|date=March 2015 |pmid=25220031 |doi=10.1002/ijc.29217 |pmc=4299502}}{{open access}}</ref>

==Challenges with PDX model adaptation==
There are several challenges that scientists face when developing or using PDX models in research. For instance, not all tumor samples will successfully engraft in an immunodeficient mouse.<ref name="one mouse" /> When engraftment does occur, clinical study protocols are difficult to standardize if engraftment rates vary.<ref name="one mouse" />  It is also expensive to house mice, maintain histopathological cores for frequent testing,<ref name="one mouse" /> and perform ''ex vivo'' passaging of tumors in mice with high tumor burdens.<ref name="Siolas" />

With regard to using PDX in [[personalized medicine]], there are financial challenges. In the US, the cost to develop PDX models is can potentially cost a patient thousands of dollars for treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/business/mice-as-stand-ins-in-the-fight-against-disease.html|title=Seeking cures, patients enlist mice stand-ins|last=Pollack|first=Andrew | name-list-format = vanc | date=September 25, 2012|work=[[N.
