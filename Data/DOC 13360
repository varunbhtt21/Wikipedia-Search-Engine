==Background==
On 27 January 2011, Judas Priest announced that they were in the process of writing new material for what was thought to be the group's final album due to their previously announced farewell tour entitled the [[Epitaph World Tour]], but the band clarified that the Epitaph tour was "by no means the end of the band."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=152891 | title=Judas Priest Working on New Material – Jan. 27, 2011 | accessdate=28 January 2011 | date=27 January 2011 | work=Blabbermouth.net | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130223121/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=152891 | archive-date=30 January 2011 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles on May 26, of the new material, Glenn Tipton said, "It's quite a mixed bag. Really, there's more sentiment on this album. In a way, I suppose, it's also our farewell album, although it might not be our last one. There are some anthems on there, which pay tribute to our fans."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=158633 |title=Judas Priest: More Video Footage Of Los Angeles Press Conference – May 25, 2011 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=3 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820094641/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=158633 |archive-date=20 August 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In April 2011, founding member K. K. Downing announced his departure from the band, citing differences with the band and management and a breakdown in their relationship as the reason. [[Richie Faulkner]], guitarist for [[Lauren Harris]]' band, was announced as his replacement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://judaspriest.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=31894B27-BD13-43BA-84F0-6A11B4F9D835 |title=News – K.K.

In an August 2011 interview with [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], Halford said that he and Tipton had "about 12 or 14 tracks completely mapped out" for a new studio album. He then said that four tracks were already recorded and mixed and suggested a new album would be out the next year.<ref name=Billboard2012Album>{{cite news|title=Judas Priest Singer Says '12 Or 14' Songs Have Been 'Completely Mapped Out' For Next Album|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=162706|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201120955/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=162706|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 February 2013|work=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref> The year ended, however, without seeing a release.

On 17 March 2014 at the Ronnie James Dio Awards in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Halford announced that the album had been finished.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://loudwire.com/rob-halford-new-judas-priest-album-finished-heavy/?trackback=tsmclip |title=Rob Halford: New Judas Priest Album Is ‘Finished’ and ‘F—ing Heavy’ |magazine=[[Loudwire]] |date=19 March 2014 |accessdate=19 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075325/http://loudwire.com/rob-halford-new-judas-priest-album-finished-heavy/?trackback=tsmclip |archive-date=7 April 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 28 April, the band revealed the title for the album, as well as releasing the title track for streaming on their official website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tappoutmusic.com/judas-priest-unveil-new-track-from-upcoming-album/ |title=Judas Priest Unveil New Track From Upcoming Album |publisher=Tapp Out Music |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106221037/http://www.tappoutmusic.com/judas-priest-unveil-new-track-from-upcoming-album/ |archive-date=6 November 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The track listing was announced four days later.<ref name=tracklist>{{cite web|title=Classic Judas Priest Metal On The Way With Their 17th Album 'Redeemer Of Souls'|url=http://judaspriest.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=1A433612-7E49-43DC-B3E0-BEE2B5EA5BAA|work=Judaspriest.com|accessdate=2 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502183642/http://judaspriest.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=1A433612-7E49-43DC-B3E0-BEE2B5EA5BAA|archive-date=2 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At the end of June, a 20-date US tour supporting the album was confirmed.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/06/judas_priest_an_1.html |title=Judas Priest announces 2014 Tour Dates, Barclays Center, Izod Center, Atlantic City, FFF Fest & more included |publisher=Brooklynvegan.com |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629123459/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/06/judas_priest_an_1.html |archive-date=29 June 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Album information==
Guitarist [[Glenn Tipton]] gave a statement saying that fans should not expect wild experimentation.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/judas-priest-preview-very-heavy-record-with-redeemer-of-souls-20140428 |title=Judas Priest Preview 'Very Heavy Record' With 'Redeemer of Souls' |magazine=[[Rolling Stone Magazine|RollingStone]] |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=4 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315040059/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/judas-priest-preview-very-heavy-record-with-redeemer-of-souls-20140428 |archive-date=15 March 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Tipton explains that the reason the extra five tracks were not included on the standard release was due to the consistency of the songs the band chose with their choice to "release an undisputable heavy metal album".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/14/May/16Judas_Priest_Explain_Separate_Bonus_Edition_of_Redeemer_Of_Souls.shtml |title=Judas Priest Explain Separate Bonus Edition of Redeemer Of Souls |publisher=antiMusic |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=16 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152534/http://www.antimusic.com/news/14/May/16Judas_Priest_Explain_Separate_Bonus_Edition_of_Redeemer_Of_Souls.shtml |archive-date=17 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The five bonus tracks from the deluxe edition were released as a stand-alone limited-edition 10" vinyl LP, entitled ''5 Souls'', for Record Store Day 2014.<ref name=5Souls>{{cite web|title=Judas Priest's '5 Souls' Limited-Edition 10-Inch Vinyl: Video Overview|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/judas-priests-5-souls-limited-edition-10-inch-vinyl-video-overview/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=1 December 2014|date=1 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203204210/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/judas-priests-5-souls-limited-edition-10-inch-vinyl-video-overview|archive-date=3 December 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Four of the album's songs have been performed live: "Halls of Valhalla", "Dragonaut", "March of the Damned" and the title track, with "Halls of Valhalla" reappearing in the setlist for the 2019 tour.

==Interviews==
Halford describes the album's sound as "hard. It's heavy. It's something we think our Priest fans will be thrilled with. We know we have a reputation to maintain, and we know we have to deliver something really strong and solid. The album is going to be full of all the great things you love about Judas Priest — I don't think I can say anything more than that without being hung, drawn and quartered."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/judas-priest-to-release-redeemer-of-souls-album-in-july-title-track-available-for-streaming/ |title=Judas Priest To Release 'Redeemer Of Souls' Album In July; Title Track Available For Streaming |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=2014-04-28 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630194614/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/judas-priest-to-release-redeemer-of-souls-album-in-july-title-track-available-for-streaming/ |archive-date=30 June 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Halford says that fans can expect "the side of Priest that we haven't heard for a few years and reemphasize and remake those big, heavy metal statements again."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-halford-new-judas-priest-album-is-absolutely-finished/ |title=Rob Halford: New Judas Priest Album Is 'Absolutely Finished' |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322200851/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-halford-new-judas-priest-album-is-absolutely-finished/ |archive-date=22 March 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

When asked how it was collaborating on new music with Faulkner, Halford told [[Guitar World]] in a 2012 interview: "Really, really strong. Exciting. He's riffing and saying, 'Robby, I'm thinking of this and this and this.' It's really exciting to have that kind of energy, because you feed off of it. It’ll be great after having this two-month break from not seeing each other to reconvene in the studio in England and just sit in a room and go, 'OK, what’ve you got?' I know Richie's got a lot to share with us. He went through the ritual on this tour, did great work on stage, the fans embraced him, so it's now time to see what we're capable of, the writing trio of Glenn and Richie and myself. We’ve already got a lot of stuff in the flash drives, stuff that basically Glenn and myself put together while K. K. was mulling over whether he was going to stay or go. So before we launched the tour with Richie, we had a lot of material, and the bulk of it is very, very strong."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalpaths.com/news/2012/09/12/judas-priest-frontman-says-writing-music-with-new-guitarist-faulkner-has-been-exciting/|title=JUDAS PRIEST FRONTMAN SAYS WRITING MUSIC WITH NEW GUITARIST FAULKNER HAS BEEN 'EXCITING'|publisher=metalpaths.com|accessdate=12 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204064827/http://www.metalpaths.com/news/2012/09/12/judas-priest-frontman-says-writing-music-with-new-guitarist-faulkner-has-been-exciting/|archive-date=4 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Regarding whether technology changed the band's songwriting process at all, Halford said: "It's dangerous to walk around with a flash drive on a bunch of keys. [Laughs] To a great extent, it doesn't really change. The technology is amazing in terms of the advantages it brings to music now, some of it good, some of it very bad. It's all about discipline and self-belief, determination, wanting to do the best you can do and not accepting anything that's below par. We've always had that attitude in Priest. We've always felt really strongly about any track that goes out for our fans. We're still doing it like we always have: firing up the riffs and finding a vocal melody to go with it, me going into me wonderful world of the [[Roget's Thesaurus]] and trying to come up with a new lyric and a new idea. And that's what we've been doing for four decades."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/judas-priest-frontman-says-writing-music-with-new-guitarist-faulkner-has-been-exciting/ |title=Judas Priest Frontman Says Writing Music With New Guitarist Faulkner Has Been 'Exciting' |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=2012-09-11 |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714185229/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/judas-priest-frontman-says-writing-music-with-new-guitarist-faulkner-has-been-exciting/ |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

''Redeemer of Souls'' has been largely praised by critics and has been hailed as a return for the band, following the lackluster response to its previous album ''[[Nostradamus (album)|Nostradamus]]''. At [[Metacritic]], that assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 10 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="Meta" /> At [[AnyDecentMusic?]], that collates critical reviews from more than 50 media sources, the album scored 6.7 points out of 10, based on nine reviews.<ref name="ADM" />

Chad Bowar, reviewing for [[About.com]], commented that new guitarist Richie Faulkner seemed to "energize" the band – and that even in his 60s, Halford still displayed ample vocal ability on the record. Bowar praised several of the album's songs, including "Sword of Damocles" and "Battle Cry".<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/judaspriest/fl/Judas-Priest-Redeemer-of-Souls-Review.htm|title=Judas Priest – Redeemer of Souls|publisher=[[About.com]]|first=Chad|last=Bowar|accessdate=8 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715092925/http://heavymetal.about.com/od/judaspriest/fl/Judas-Priest-Redeemer-of-Souls-Review.htm|archive-date=15 July 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Andy McDonald of ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' commented "...''Redeemer Of Souls'' ticks just about every box in terms of an enjoyable heavy metal record. For the most part, it’s suitably overblown, cocksure and blunt, and still goes some way to capturing the genre's eternal, endearing refusal to grow up.

Allmusic's James Christopher Monger noted that the album was the "antithesis" to 2008's ''Nostradamus''. Monger defined "Dragonaut" and "Metalizer" as the album's high points and stated that ''Redeemer of Souls'' deserves to stand alongside albums like ''[[Sad Wings of Destiny]]'' and ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]''.<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web |first=James Christopher |last=Monger |title=Review: ''Redeemer of Souls'' |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/redeemer-of-souls-mw0002668462 |publisher=[[Allmusic.com]] |accessdate=7 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712110842/http://www.allmusic.com/album/redeemer-of-souls-mw0002668462 |archive-date=12 July 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Kory Grow of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' added "Above all, ''Redeemer'' is proof that Priest can still call themselves metal’s defenders of the faith."<ref name="RollingStone" />

Ray Van Horn, Jr. of [[Blabbermouth.net]] stated that Faulkner and Tipton sound "just fine together, trading off solos and keeping their riffs glued tight", while at the same time lamenting K. K. Downing's absence.<ref name=blabberreview>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/cdreviews/redeemer-of-souls/|title=Judas Priest: Redeemer of Souls – review|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|location=White Plains, New York|first=Ray|last=Van Horn Jr.|date=28 July 2014|access-date=28 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801111718/http://www.blabbermouth.net/cdreviews/redeemer-of-souls|archive-date=1 August 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
