:({{Find sources|Brantly Womack}})
Does not appear to be a noteworthy professor, lacks multiple reliable sources in which to build an article.  PROD removed as "probably notable as both WP:PROF and WP:CREATIVE," but a search for sources to support this was lacking.

*'''Keep''' if he's not notable as a professor his authorship of several books makes him notable. Discussed for example [http://books.google.com/books?id=JqUf7rLton4C&pg=PA35&dq=%22Brantly+Womack%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=arpeU7LbPKnKsQSa4YG4DA&ved=0CGQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22Brantly%20Womack%22&f=false here].

*'''Keep''' holder of named chair at University of Virginia, (in fact, the successive holder of several named chairs at several universities) , and therefore unquestionably notable. Source is his official CV, which, though not third party, is reliable. I could probably find the campus newspaer or press release, but that's no more reliable, even less. because those sources tend to be inexact. An article showing publishing several books by major international publishers translated into other languages is normally notable , and questioning what can be easily proven is not all that helpful, though additional sources never hurt. I do not deprod without good reason.  '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 21:20, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Notable as a professor (named chair), CV for academics are reliable, impressive publications. --[[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 02:41, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I added refs to 3 reviews of his work in scholarly journals. There's plenty more that could be added. Meets [[WP:PROF]], as already noted. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 10:55, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
