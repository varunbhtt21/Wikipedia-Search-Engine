'''Saint John the New Monastery''' ({{lang-ro|Mănăstirea Sfântul Ioan cel Nou}}) is a [[Romanian Orthodox]] monastery in [[Suceava]], [[Romania]]. Built between 1514 and 1522, the monastery church is one of eight buildings that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]],<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/598 Churches of Moldavia] at the UNESCO site</ref> and is also listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by the country's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_SV.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Suceava], p.2159</ref> Its construction began during the reign of voivode [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] of [[Moldavia]], after the nearby Mirăuți Church (the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia at that moment) was devastated in 1513. The construction was completed by [[Stephen IV of Moldavia]] (also known as Ștefăniță). The monastery church served as metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia until 1677 and, since 1991, it serves as the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Suceava and Rădăuți]]. The church is dedicated to [[Saint George]] and it has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region.

The monastery is dedicated to Saint [[John the New of Suceava]], a Moldavian monk who preached during Turkish occupation and was subsequently martyred in Cetatea Albă, present-day [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]] in [[Ukraine]]. [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] brought his relics to Suceava in 1402. Besides the monumental church, the monastery complex includes a bell tower built in 1589 during the reign of [[Peter the Lame]] of [[Moldavia]], a chapel founded by clergyman [[Anastasie Crimca]] in 1626-1629, old cells for monks (built in the 19th century), a house for the abbot (built between 1894-1896) and the surrounding walls.
