# [[User:Ogram|Margo Burns]], a.k.a. [[User:Ogram|Ogram]] ([[User talk:Ogram|talk]]) 21:13, 29 May 2014 (UTC) - I will be coming tonight to work on the [[Salem witch trials]] and related articles about the prosecution of women for witchcraft in colonial New England. I will be bringing a crate from my personal library with over 30 secondary sources with me. My goal this summer is to get this article firmly into GA status. I welcome any and all help on this!
