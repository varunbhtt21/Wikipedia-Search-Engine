Title : Bullying and emotional intelligence
Text : [[Bullying]] is [[abusive]] [[social interaction]] between peers can include [[aggression]], [[harassment]], and [[violence]]. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]]. 

Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of [[emotion]] as it relates to one's self and others. [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".<ref>Mayer, J.D., Roberts, R.D & Barasade, S.G. (2008) Human abilities: Emotional intelligence. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', ''59'', 507-536. DOI: 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646</ref> The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.<ref name="Tolegenova">Tolegenova, A.A., Jakupov, S.M., Man Cheung Chung, Saduova, S. & Jakupov, M.S (2012) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents.] “Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences”, 69, 1891-1894. International Conference on Education and Educational Psychology (ICEEPSY 2012). DOI: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142</ref> Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.<ref>Mckenna, J. & Webb, J.

==Childhood==

Bullying is the most prevalent form of [[school violence|violence in schools]] and has lasting consequences into adulthood.<ref name=Domino>Domino,  M. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/josh.12047/ Measuring the impact of an alternative approach to school bullying.] ''Journal of School Health'', ''83''(6), 430-437. DOI: 10.1111/josh.12047</ref> Increased concern regarding [[school bullying]] has been raised in part due to publicized suicides of childhood victims.<ref name=Turner>Turner, M. G., Exum, M. L., Brame, R. & Holt, T. J. (2013) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2012.12.005 Bullying victimization and adolescent mental health: General and typological effects across sex.] ''Journal of Criminal Justice'', ''41''(1), 53-59. DOI: 10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2012.12.005</ref> Around 40% of middle school children are directly involved in bullying at least once a week according to the National Center of Education Statistics.<ref name=Domino /> Pre-adolescent research confirms such a negative relationship between [[Emotional Intelligence#Trait Model|trait EI]]{{efn|There are three different models of Emotional Intelligence. The two main models are the Ability Model and the Trait Model, with a Mixed Model combining the two. The terms used for the dimensions are typically synonymous with those of the other models. The main difference is that the ability model conceives the traits as cognitive abilities, whereas the trait model conceives the traits as personal perceptions of those abilities/self-reported tendencies.<ref name="Kokkinos"/> The mixed model views the traits as capabilities; abilities that can be acquired and enhanced. In most papers where Trait EI is specified, the model is actually mixed.}} and bullying behavior; bullying behavior is negatively associated with  total [[empathy]] and more specifically, the EI dimension of cognitive empathy, which is the ability to understand or take on the emotional experiences and perspectives of others.<ref name="Kokkinos">Kokkinos, C. M. & Kipritsi, E. (2012) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9 The relationship between bullying, victimization, trait emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and empathy among preadolescents.] ''Social Psychology of Education'', ''15''(1), 41-58. DOI:10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9</ref> It was found that adolescent bullying peer relations are also significantly negatively correlated with the dimension of  EI that was conceptualized by Lomas et al. (2012) as Understanding the Emotions of Others.<ref name=Lomas>Lomas, J., Stough, C., Hansen, K. & Downey, L. A. (2012) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002 Brief report: Emotional intelligence, victimization and bullying in adolescents.] ''Journal of Adolescence'', ''35''(1), 207-211. DOI: 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002</ref> While the term naming the dimension varies within the research, the dimension of EI that appears to have the strongest inverse relationship with enacting  bullying behavior throughout the literature is one’s ability to understand the emotional experience of other people. 

Because bullying behavior in school-aged children is related to lower levels of understanding of other’s emotions, one theory is that children who exhibit bullying behaviors are not able to fully understand the impact that they have on their victims.<ref name="Lomas" /> Indeed, when differentiating between the different components of empathy, it is the cognitive component that bullies seem to have the most deficit in.<ref name="Kokkinos" /> In addition to the inability to relate to the emotions of others, research also suggests that those who engage in bullying behavior may also lack proper skills in dealing with their own emotions, another aspect of EI often referred to as emotional facilitation or [[self-efficacy]].<ref name="Kokkinos" /> 

The poor use of emotions is found to be significant in predicting problem behavior among adolescents, such as [[aggression]], which can be characteristic in bullying behavior.<ref>Siu, A.F.Y. (2009) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2009.05.004 Trait emotional intelligence and its relationships with problem behavior in Hong Kong adolescents.] ''Personality and Individual Differences'', ''47''(6), 553-557. DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2009.05.004</ref> In this way, the ability to understand and manage one’s own emotions may play an important role in preventing children from engaging in bullying behavior. For example, in a study among adolescent girls, it was found that better management of stress could prevent the perpetuation of aggression and violence.<ref name="Polan">Polan, J., Sieving, R., Pettingell, S., Bearinger, L. & McMorris, B.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.10.216</ref>

==Workplace==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Workplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought.<ref name=HutchinsonA>Hutchinson, M. & Hurley, J. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x/ Exploring leadership capability and emotional intelligence as moderators of workplace bullying.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 553-562. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x</ref> Workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying.<ref name=HutchinsonA /> 

Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the [[organizational structure]] and in pursuing [[goal]]s. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees.<ref name="HutchinsonA" /> Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels.<ref name="HutchinsonA" /> 

Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress.<ref name="HutchinsonA" /> The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. 

Workplace bullies may have high [[social intelligence]] and low emotional intelligence.<ref name="HutchinsonB">Hutchinson, M. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x/ Bullying as workgroup manipulation: a model for understanding patterns of victimization and contagion within the workgroup.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 563-571. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x</ref> In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at [[Social influence|influencing]] others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behavior, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be.<ref name="HutchinsonB" /> In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be [[persuaded]] to engage in unethical behavior.<ref name="HutchinsonB" /> With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behavior, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying.<ref name="HutchinsonB" /> Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and [[leadership]] skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behavior among other members of the work team have been shown to have a significant impact on ethical behavior of nursing teams.<ref>Deshpande, S.P., & Joseph, J.

A bad environment in the workplace (with bullying cases, for instance) can negatively affect the organization's efficiency and costs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sheehan |first1=Michael |title=Workplace bullying: responding with some emotional intelligence |journal=International Journal of Manpower |date=1999 |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=57-69 |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/231911981}}</ref>
==Theoretical contributions to the relationship==

===Malevolent creativity===
Given lower emotional intelligence, it is also possible that many bullies are more malevolently creative. When original, the acts of aggression and [[abuse]] found in both childhood and adult bullying are considered examples of malevolent creativity (MC).<ref name=Harris>Harris, D. J., Reiter-Palmon, R. & Kaufman, J. C. (2013)  The effect of emotional intelligence and task type on malevolent creativity. ''Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts'', ''7''(3), 237-244. DOI: 10.1037/a0032139</ref> Findings suggest that individuals lower in EI conceive more malevolently creative solutions, which theoretically leads to more malevolently creative behaviors.{{efn|EI predicted MC even after controlling for emotional and social context. There was a negative correlation between EI and MC in both study 1 (r{{=}}-.11, p{{=}} .076) and study 2 (r{{=}} -.24, p{{=}}.022); EI also had marginal significance in predicting the number of malevolently creative ideas after controlling for both cognitive ability and instructions (β{{= }}-.25, p{{=}}0.055).<ref name=Harris />  }} It is conjectured that people with lower emotional intelligence may not see the impropriety in malevolently creative ideas or disregard how others would perceive them, and thus they have less issue with disclosing such ideas.<ref name=Harris />  Given the hypothesis that more malevolently creative solutions should lead to more malevolently creative behaviors, this theory makes sense in light of the deficit in cognitive empathy found in bullying behavior.

===Callous and unemotional traits===
{{Main|Callous and unemotional traits}}
{{See also|Conduct disorder|Psychopathy}}
There may also be a subtype of bully that is high in callous and unemotional traits (CU). CU traits include some of the discussed deficits in EI such as lack of empathy, as well as other traits such as a lack of guilt, shallow capacity for emotion and poor behavioral modulation when faced with punishment.<ref name=Viding >Viding, E., Simmonds, E., Petrides, K.V., & Frederickson, N. (2009) The contribution of callous-unemotional traits and conduct problems to bullying in early adolescence. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50(4), 471-481. DOI: 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02012.x</ref>  Given that children who bully often have conduct problems, and CU traits are often co-occurring with conduct problems, Viding et al., (2009)  investigated the relationship between CU and bullying behavior.  Given that previous research suggests children with conduct problems fall into subtypes of those with high CU traits and those without, it was possible that this creates a distinction among bullies.<ref name=Viding />  Higher CU was independently correlated to direct bullying,{{efn| Direct forms of bullying are those that entail direct contact between the bully and victim, such as physical attack or verbal aggression. Indirect forms of bullying are those that involve other people and are more indirect, such as spreading rumors, or cyber-bullying. }} which is associated with lack of [[empathy]], while indirect bullying is not.<ref name=Viding />   When combined with conduct problems, CU increased the risk of direct and indirect bullying behaviors. Bullies high in CU traits will probably be resistant to many of the interventions successful with bullies who are not.<ref name=Viding /> Although a defining characteristic of CU is a lack of empathy, which overlaps with bullies deficits in empathy as highlighted above, the other characteristics of the concept would make bullies high in CU less malleable than those who simply have lower EI.<ref name=Viding />

==Victimization and emotional intelligence==
{{Main|Victimization}}
Being bullied can have a negative impact on the victim's life: Bullied children may go on to be maladjusted socially and emotionally, and worsen in behavior.<ref name=Sapouna>Sapouna, M. & Wolke, D. (2013) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009 Resilience to bullying victimization: The role of individual, family and peer characteristics.] ''Child Abuse & Neglect'', ''37''(11), 997-1006. DOI: 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009</ref> Adults who are bullied in the workplace may have deteriorated [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[Social rejection|isolation]] and become fearful and avoidant after being victimized. They may disengage and withdraw from their work community.<ref name=HutchinsonB />  Both child and adult victims are at greater risk of developing mental pathology.<ref name=HutchinsonA /><ref name=Sapouna /> EI is found to be a significant predictor of variance in adolescent [[peer victimization]] in bullying and also has a negative correlation with adolescent bullying.<ref name=Lomas /> Victim peer relations showed strong negative correlations with the emotional management and facilitation dimensions of EI conceptualized as Emotional Management and Control and Emotions Direct Cognitions respectively, both of which made significant semi-partial contributions to the overall model of Emotional Intelligence.<ref name=Lomas /> These results indicate that victims may have less ability to handle their emotions or to use them to make decisions in response. The inability to manage one’s own emotions can lead to rejection, or further rejection, from peers which can help perpetuate victimization and further damage a victim’s [[social skills]]; peer relationships and support are influential on emotional adjustment.<ref name=Sapouna /> In workplace bullying the workgroup’s [[Social rejection|rejection]] isolates the victim and causes [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[fear]], causing withdrawal from the group and reducing opportunities for social support.<ref name=HutchinsonB />  In addition to self-efficacy, victimization is also found to be negatively correlated to cognitive and affective empathy.<ref name="Kokkinos" />

===Bully-victims===
There is a strong positive relationship between engaging in bullying behaviors and having been victimized by bullying behaviors.<ref name="Kokkinos"/><ref name=Lomas /> This is both a common finding in review of the research and is in tune with what is commonly observed during human adolescence; often victims of bullying go on to become bullies themselves. A history of victimization often leads to a perpetuation of similar behavior.<ref name=Polan /> Having low emotional intelligence increases the likelihood of being both a victim and a bully, which are apparently not mutually exclusive roles. This dual status is sometimes referred to as being a bully-victim. Bully-victims seem to be the most troubled. They tend to exhibit more emotional issues like low impulse control and self-esteem as well as social issues, such as the inability to interpret social cues or make friends.<ref name=Wolke>Wolke, D., Copeland, W. E., Angold, A. & Costello, E. J. (2013) [http://pss.sagepub.com/content/24/10/1958 Impact of bullying in childhood on adult health, wealth, crime, and social outcomes.] ''Psychological Science'', ''24''(10), 1958-1970. DOI: 10.1177/0956797613481608</ref> They may begin with pre-existing issues with behavior and emotion, and more often come from [[dysfunctional families]].<ref name=Wolke />  Childhood bully-victims also fare worse in adulthood than 'pure' bullies or victims.<ref name=Wolke /> Across multiple areas, bully-victims had the greatest impairment in adult functioning and worse health outcomes including the diagnosis of a serious illness or psychiatric disorder.<ref name=Wolke /> Bully-victims had similarly poor outcomes in educational achievement as bullies and also shared similar likelihood to some of the measured risk behaviors, all status groups showed impairment in some categories like wealth attainment and social relationships.<ref name=Wolke /> When controlling for other factors pure bullies are no longer at an elevated risk across all these categories, which bullying is predictive of regardless of victim status, though bully-victims and victims remain at higher risk.<ref name=Wolke /> While some dimensions of EI seem more predictive of one status or the other (that of the bully or the victim), there are dimensions of EI, such as empathy and self-efficacy, that have significant negative relationships with both. Additionally, EI as a whole is significant in predicting for victim status.<ref name=Lomas /> Thus, victims may also be deficient in the dimensions of EI that correlate to becoming a bully, a risk that could be expected to be exacerbated by the damage to one's psycho-social health due to being a victim. Students who experience bullying often have a harder time adapting healthy relationships when they get older.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/stats.asp|title=Bullying Statistics|access-date=2017-10-10}}</ref> It has been found that there is a negative correlation between bullying and emotional intelligence.<ref> {{cite journal |last1=Kokkinos |first1=Constantinos |last2=Kipritsi |first2=Eirini |title=The Relationship between Bullying, Victimization, Trait Emotional Intelligence, Self-Efficacy and Empathy among Preadolescents |journal=Social Psychology of Education: An International Journal |date=2011 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=41-58 |doi=10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9}}</ref> People with more emotional intelligence are able moderate the effects of the bullying they suffer in the workplace and still work efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ashraf |first1=Fatima |last2=Khan |first2=Muhammad |title=Does emotional intelligence moderate the relationship between workplace bullying and job performance? |journal=Asian Business & Management |date=2014 |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=171-190 |doi=10.1057/abm.2013.5}}</ref>

==Interventions==
[[File:Bullies.jpg|thumb]]
The most effective bullying interventions will likely be those that are dynamic and theory-driven in approach. Conventional intervention efforts have had small impact and mixed results in reducing bullying among children.<ref name=Domino /> These earlier models were based on descriptive data and focused on correcting the behavior of children who were already bullies or victims.<ref name=Domino /> Domino (2013) notes a theoretical shift from focus on deficit-based intervention to strength-based intervention.<ref name=Domino />

Take The Lead (TTL) is a curriculum for middle school students combining [[social emotional learning]] (SEL) and [[positive youth development]] (PYD). SEL is a process of building social competence and emotional intelligence through a set of pertinent skills. PYD is a SEL program that uses social end emotional learning to promote healthy outcomes for the children by developing, then applying, the learned individual and group skills. Meta-analysis of 213 studies linked SEL to significant improvement in interpersonal relationships, [[social skills]], behavior issues, [[substance abuse]] and aggression.<ref name=Domino /> Positive contributions to the impact of SEL were found to be made by the development and application of social skills, [[social support]] and positive behavior [[reinforcement]].<ref name=Domino /> Meta-analysis of 25 programs illustrated significant positive changes in [[interpersonal skills]], [[self-control]], problem-solving and both peer and adult relationships as a result of PYD as well as significant decrease in negative risk behaviors such as substance abuse, acts of aggression, [[truancy]] and [[risky sexual behavior]].<ref name=Domino /> The most important elements of PYD for positive outcomes in the analysis were incorporation of emotional intelligence and [[self-efficacy]], and the development of [[social norm|pro-social norms]]. Domino (2013) noted that prior research supported SEL and PYD being applied to youth risk behaviors and that their effectiveness was found to be positive and sustainable, however not much research had been done on a link between the constructs and reduction of bullying specifically. The study then investigates a model, TTL, that combines the SEL and PYD frameworks, strengthened by a social support system. TTL consists of 16 lessons, taught once a week for 16 weeks, during regular 45 minute class periods by teachers that are trained for a minimum of 6 hours.<ref name=Domino />{{efn|The 16 lessons are:
<small>
#Self-assessment and Self-Awareness
#Building confidence and competence 
#Elements of communication
#Communication skills
#Interpersonal relations
#Developing social skills
#Developing social skills
#Identifying and managing emotions
#Identifying and managing emotions
#[[Assertiveness]]
#Exclusion, aggression, and other negative behaviors
#Exclusion, aggression, and other negative behaviors
#Responsible decision making
#Responsible decision making
#Problem solving
#Service-learning</small>}}
The lessons are accompanied by a goal; for instance, the [[goal]] accompanying lesson 10 on Assertiveness is "Differentiate between assertive, passive, and aggressive communication styles, and practice [[assertive]] and empathic interrelating.".<ref name=Domino />{{rp|432}} Every lesson includes knowledge, skill and application components so that students are able to practice the learned skills in their life outside of the classroom. A TTL training workshop is offered to the parents of participants and a letter is sent to the parents at the beginning of each segment with information about the lesson, goals and accompanying activities. Domino (2013) applied the TTL intervention to 7th grade students and measured changes in bullying and victim behavior using a quantitative pretest-posttest control group cohort design. Sum scores for bullying and victimization were obtained before and at the completion of the intervention using the PRQ, a self-report survey, completed anonymously.{{efn|Prior to beginning the curriculum bullying behavior scores were similar between the experimental and control group (p {{=}} .188). Using ANOVA, there was significant interaction between assessment point and group for bullying (F(1,321) {{=}} 45.17, p<.001). There was a significant difference in mean sum scores for bullying (p<.001) between group at posttest, with a significant decrease for the intervention group from 1.15 (1.47) to 0.68 (SD {{=}} 1.04) compared to the control group whose mean score increased to 1.98 (SD {{=}} 2.02). There was also significant interaction between assessment point and group for victimization (F(1,321) {{=}} 58.12, p<.001) illustrated by ANOVA. At the outset of the study the intervention group had larger mean victimization scores (Mean {{=}} 2.48, SD {{=}} 2.55) than the control group (Mean {{=}} 1.41, SD {{=}} 1.94). At the post test, there was a significant difference in mean sum scores for victimization (p<.001) between groups with a significant decrease in mean score for the intervention group from 2.48 (2.55) to 1.26 (1.80), while that of the control group increased from 1.41 (1.94) to 2.25 (2.40). When the former control group, that had an increase in bullying and victimization scores, received the intervention the following semester, there were similar decreases in bullying and victimization, and Repeated measures ANOVA illustrated significant differences in bullying (F(2,324) {{=}} 18.41, p<.001)and victimization (F(2,324) {{=}} 21.83, p<.001.). All results remained significant (p<.001) when controlling for gender.<ref name=Domino />}}

===Resilience===
{{Main|Psychological resilience}}
Beyond preventing bullying, it is also important to consider how interventions based on EI are important in the case that bullying will occur. Increasing EI may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims. When a person faces stress and adversity, especially of a repetitive nature, their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome.<ref name=Brisa>Monroy Cortés, B. G. & Palacios Cruz, L. (2011) [http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=58220785008 Resiliencia: ¿Es posible medirla e influir en ella?] ''Salud Mental'', ''34''(3) 237-246. México: Instituto Nacional de Psiquiátrica Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz. {{ISSN|0185-3325}} [Spanish]</ref> Resilient individuals are those who are considered to have positive developmental outcomes in light of their negative experiences, such as bullying.<ref name=Sapouna /> Sapouna & Wolke (2013) examined adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being negatively associated with resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention.<ref name=Sapouna /> Emotional Intelligence has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress<ref name=Schneider>Schneider, T. R., Lyons, J. B. & Khazon, S. (2013) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460 Emotional intelligence and resilience.] ''Personality and Individual Differences'', ''55''(8), 909-914. DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460</ref> and  as mentioned  previously the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression.<ref name=Polan /> One factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one's own emotions.<ref name=Brisa /> Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.<ref name=Schneider />
