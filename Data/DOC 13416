He was the paternal grandfather of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], whose birth name ''Kasner'' had been Germanized from ''Kaźmierczak'' by Ludwig Kasner in 1930. 

In 2013 Ludwig Kasner received media attention in Poland and Germany after a new book shed light on Angela Merkel's family background. This was not only due to Kasner's being of Polish origin, but also because Kasner's nephew had provided a photograph of him in the uniform of the Polish [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] (also known as "Haller's Army") which had fought for Poland's independence in the late stages of [[World War I]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article114504336/Polnische-Erregung-ueber-Angela-Merkels-Herkunft.html Polnische Erregung über Angela Merkels Herkunft], Die Welt</ref><ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/all-in-the-family-poles-pleased-to-learn-of-polish-heritage-of-angela-merkel-a-889207.html All in the Family: Chancellor Merkel's Heritage Pleases Poles], Der Spiegel</ref><ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/20130314/48523 Merkel's Polish roots emerge in new book], The Local</ref>

==Life==
Ludwig Kasner was born out of wedlock to Ludwik Wojciechowski and Anna Kaźmierczak (1867–1943), ethnic [[Poles]] and citizens of the [[German Empire]] from Posen (now [[Poznań]], Poland). His mother was the daughter of Bartłomiej Kaźmierczak (born 1828) and Apolonia Bielejewicz (1826-1903). The Kaźmierczak name derives from Jan Kaźmierczak, an 18th-century Pole from the Poznań area.

In 1915, during [[World War I]], Ludwig was drafted into the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] and fought on the western front before being taken [[prisoner of war]] in [[France]]. He subsequently joined the Polish [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]], which fought for Polish independence on the side of the [[Entente Powers]]; it is not known whether he took part in fighting against Germany.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/merkels-polnische-wurzeln-grossvaters-krieg-12124653.html | title=Großvaters Krieg | publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] | date=22 March 2013 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Schuller, Konrad}}</ref>  With the Blue Army, he returned to Poland to fight in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] and the [[Polish-Soviet War]].<ref>[http://poznan.gazeta.pl/poznan/1,36037,13607990,Dziadek_Angeli_Merkel_byl_w_armii_Hallera__Walczyl.html#TRrelSST ''Dziadek Angeli Merkel był w armii Hallera. Walczył z Niemcami?''] [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] (Poznań), 23 March 2013</ref>

After returning from war, in the aftermath of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Ludwig opted for German citizenship and relocated to Berlin, the hometown of his fiancée Margarethe.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angela-Merkel-The-Authorized-Biography/dp/1846883075/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394064234&sr=8-1&keywords=angela+merkel#reader_B00F4U3CD8 | title=Angela Merkel: The Authorized Biography | publisher=[[Alma Books]] | author=Kornelius, Stefan | year=2013 | location=Richmond | pages=14 | isbn= 978-1846883071}}</ref> He worked in the [[Berlin Police]], last in Berlin's [[Pankow]] district, and was promoted twice, reaching the rank of ''Hauptwachtmeister'' ("chief watch master", the most senior [[constable]] rank). In 1926 their son [[Horst Kasner|Horst Kaźmierczak]] was born. 

In 1930 the family Germanized their surname from ''Kaźmierczak'' to ''Kasner''.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angela-Merkel-The-Authorized-Biography/dp/1846883075/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394064234&sr=8-1&keywords=angela+merkel#reader_B00F4U3CD8 | title=Angela Merkel: The Authorized Biography | publisher=[[Alma Books]] | author=Kornelius, Stefan | year=2013 | location=Richmond | pages=14 | isbn= 978-1846883071}}</ref> They still kept in touch with the Polish side of the family, visiting them in Poznań several times in the 1930s and receiving visits in Berlin from Polish relatives. Despite the surname change, Ludwig Kasner's nephew Zygmunt Rychlicki said Kasner always stayed true to his Polish roots.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/the-german-chancellors-polish-roots/a-16698783 The German chancellor's Polish roots], DW</ref>

Ludwig Kasner was raised a Catholic, but in the 1930s the family converted to Lutheranism, and his son became a Protestant pastor.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/german-elections-blog-2013/2013/sep/10/angela-merkel-origins-germany-election Six things you didn't know about Angela Merkel], The Guardian</ref>

Even before the 2013 media reports about Ludwig Kasner, [[Angela Merkel]] had said in 1995 that one of her grandfathers was originally from Poland; and in 2000 she had reiterated that she was one-quarter Polish.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article114407379/Kanzlerin-Angela-Merkel-ist-zu-einem-Viertel-Polin.html Kanzlerin Angela Merkel ist zu einem Viertel Polin], Die Welt</ref>
