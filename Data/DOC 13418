:* ''Comment'': McKenzie wrote the infobox, lede and section headers; I simply filled them in.
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Launchballer|Launchballer]] ([[User talk:Launchballer|talk]]), [[User:SolomanMcKenzie|SolomanMcKenzie]] ([[User talk:SolomanMcKenzie|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Launchballer|Launchballer]] ([[User talk:Launchballer|talk]]) at 20:03, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:*  [[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] This is a great hook but a disappointing article. The "main" source is the website of the production company, hardly a [[WP:SECONDARY|secondary source]]. The bulk of the article contains descriptions from show episodes. More content is needed to make this DYK-worthy. It also needs a QPQ. BTW a Wikipedia search on [[Ejector seat]] sends you to [[Ejection seat]]. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 21:09, 7 May 2014 (UTC) 
:::I'm lost... the Endemol source is used for a single statement in the infobox, and the 'expanded' content is a description of gameplay ''backed up'' by individual episodes that I have watched. I have created a disambiguation page at [[Ejector seat]].--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 19:34, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*So the whole article is nothing but "plot". Do you have any other references that talk about the production or the reception of the program? [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 19:54, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::To tell you the truth, I expanded the article after watching an episode of it. I have not even looked for online references.

:::::::* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]]  Well done! New enough, long enough, well referenced, no close paraphrasing seen. Hook ref verified and cited inline. Please do a QPQ and we'll be good to go. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 23:33, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] I went to promote this—looking for a quirky hook—but realized I couldn't when I hit the phrase "accusing the chairs of being stolen" in the article: who would accuse chairs? The paraphrasing in this Critical reception section needs work. There is also a severe problem with the article as a whole: nowhere is it explained just what "being ejected" consists of. My expectation before I read the article was that this would be like actual ejector seats in planes or James Bond cars: the seat flies out somehow. Another possibility might be that the contestant is dumped from the seat. Given liability issues, these can't be what happens, but the article never makes it clear what does happen, and it must. I don't think the hook holds up, either, for similar ejection reasons. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 14:56, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I've performed some fixes, but before I run Reflinks; do the tweets I've used constitute a reliable source?--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 16:49, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*I replaced the Twitter sources with the ''Sunday Express'' source, which explains that contestants are "tipped" out of their seats. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 18:16, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Article was expanded on the same day as nomination, so the date is fine. Article content is neutral, well cited, and I don't see any copyright or plagiarism issues. Hook is interesting and cited.
