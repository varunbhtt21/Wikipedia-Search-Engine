Promotional article about a reputation management company. I can't find anyone anywhere who has written about this company. The only online sources are press releases and advertising, and not many at that. It appears completely impossible to write a neutral article, based on reliable sources, as there are no such sources writing about the subject.

*'''Delete''': The reliable sources listed in the article are about reputation management generally, not this specific company. The only online sources I could find are, like the nominator, press releases. Lacks significant coverage for a claim of notability.

*'''Delete''' - I was the one who previously had deleted this article as a [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion]], due to the same concerns raised again by the AfD nominator. The article creator later [[Special:diff/605451787#Request for review of an article with "speedy deletion" status|asked me]] to "review the article again" because they wanted it restored. Since proposed deletions can be restored on request, I restored the article. But I also [[Special:diff/605471826#Request for review of an article with "speedy deletion" status|warned the editor]] that the article was in danger of a second deletion via AfD. Those same warnings I gave the editor (promotional tone and a lack of significant coverage in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]) are why I support deletion here. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 15:18, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - As I've asked the article to be restored, I started working on the reliable sources. Unfortunately it takes time, so I won't be able to add them all that quickly. My last request is the article to be completely removed since I am not able to do so as a creator, this should be addressed to a Wikipedia administrator. Once I have all the needed sources which meet the Wikipedia Guidelines, I will publish the original and improved content, including the sources. As I am reading, the article will be automatically deleted if nobody objects within a week. - [[User:Activeormguide|Activeormguide]] ([[User talk:Activeormguide|talk]]) 07:48, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
