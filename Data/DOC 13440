*'''Speedy keep'''; retaliatory nomination for deletion of [[A. Chawla]] and [[Ayaan Chawla]]. Nominator is the subject of an [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Ron Gates|SPI]]. The argument for deletion is [[WP:JNN]], even though the article has three [[WP:RS|RS]] that are about this person and he has held executive offices in cricket that I believe combine to meet the notability threshold. &mdash;<span style="color:#808080">[[User:Kuyabribri|'''KuyaBriBri''']]</span><sup><span style="color:#008080">[[User_Talk:Kuyabribri|''Talk'']]</span></sup> 00:15, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep'''; I do concur with {{ping|Kuyabribri|p=}} and there is no explicit reason for nomination by nominator. Possibly this nomination could be a ourburst/frustration of repeated deletion of articles regarding [[Ayaan Chawla]] by the nominator. Apart from the sources present in [[Chirayu Amin]] article, there do exist [[WP:THIRDPARTY|third party sources]] over a google search. --[[User:Balablitz|βα£α]]([[User talk:Balablitz#top|ᶀᶅᶖᵵᵶ]])<sup>([[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals/Tiruchirappalli|<em style="font-family:Georgia;color:#ff0000;font-weight: bold">Support</em>]])</sup> 15:21, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
