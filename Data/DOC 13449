This has been copied from the [[Groningen horse]] article with the height changed, so I'm not sure of its accuracy. Google books search results suggest that there is (or was) a horse known as a Luxembourg horse, but the only fact available is that it "differs little from the French Ardennais", there's no information that it is a recognised breed.

*'''Delete''' I can find no evidence that this is a notable topic. The article is unreferenced, and my search for reliable sources was unsuccessful.

*'''Delete''' - I found [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=PbxMAAAAYAAJ the journal mentioned by the nominator] but nothing else. Can't see that there is enough to substantiate notability of this particular breed. Tellingly, there is a [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=rhNFW0sD3jMC ''Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds''] but this particular one isn't listed.
