'''Valpelline''' is one of the side valleys of the [[Aosta Valley]] in north-west [[Italy]]. It shares its name with one of the [[comuni|communes]] within its territory ([[Valpelline (commune)|Valpelline]]) and Valpelline is also one of the names by which the River [[Buthier]] is known.

==Geography==
The Valpelline branches from the [[Great St Bernard Valley]] near [[Gignod]] and rises to [[Collon Pass]], which it shares with [[Valais]], and which is located at the foot of the mountain [[Grand Combin]], whose peak is across the border in [[Switzerland]].

==Climate==
The Valpelline is known locally in [[Valdotain|Valdôtain]] ''patois'' as the ''Coumba frèida'' (or [[french language|Fr]]., ''Combe froide'', literally the ''cold hollow'') due to its particularly harsh climate.

==History==
[[Image:Val de bionaz.jpg|thumb|left|The Bionaz Valley]]
The valley was for a long period a site of exchange—or of conflict—with the neighbouring [[Valais]].

In the [[Middle Ages]] the valley was a possession of the lords of [[Quart, Aosta Valley|Quart]], which they granted to the noble family of the district known as ''La Tour-de-Valpelline'' (or ''La-Tour-des-Prés'').

On the  extinction of the Quart Family in 1377, Valpelline passed to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1612 it was assigned to the Perrone di San Martino, a Piedmontese noble family involved in the exploitation of the mine at [[Ollomont]].

The valley was for many centuries difficult of access: the first carriage road to [[Bionaz]] was constructed in 1953.
