== Appearance ==
The longhorn sculpin varies in color with its surroundings. It has four tinted bands on the back of its body, which range from dark brown to tinted yellow and dark olive in color. When the fish is resting on sand or dirt, it is plain in color, but when resting on pebbles, it is variably marked in order to blend in with its surroundings in both scenarios. The dorsal spines and head spines on the fish are very sharp, and one must be careful if they are to handle it. It has two variably marked dorsal fins, along with two pectorals and an anal fin.<ref name="Warfel">Warfel and Merriman (Copeia, 1944, p.&nbsp;198)</ref><ref name="Cox">Cox, Contrib. Canadian Biol.
