Wikipedia is not a travel guide. It is not clear that this article could ever be particularly useful to people interested in taking a bus in Shepway, given that one would have to refer to the bus company's web site to confirm that the bus service still exists, what days it runs, what time it runs, and where to get on the bus. List of bus routes have already been established as not notable and are more suited on sites such as Wikivoyage.

*'''Delete''': Agree. All of the information in this article can change overnight on the whim of the transit authority. Why anyone would seek this sort of information on WP is beyond me. Actually, I doubt anyone would. [[User:Dominus Vobisdu|Dominus Vobisdu]] ([[User talk:Dominus Vobisdu|talk]]) 02:31, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - As I keep repeating "''Wikipedia isn't a fucking travel guide/directory''" ....

*'''Delete''', '''Transwiki to Wikia''', or otherwise remove from Wikipedia. This is an omnishambles of a nomination but the policy Wikipedia is not a travel guide does apply here, as does "[[WP:NOTDIR|Wikipedia is not a directory]]" on the same policy page. Various routes have been to AfD but there's no real strategy as to which are taken to AfD and which we retain. Because of the pendulum swing from editors voting keep and delete there was an RFC at the village pump which equally could not draw a single consensus for keeping or deleting but advised that each list should be nominated individually. This article is unsourced, it's only likely to ever be sourced to primary sources (either 1st party the bus company, or 3rd party the local authority) it's unlikely that any secondary sources will be found to establish either the individual routes or the list of routes as notable and meeting the GNG. Just remember all the rules, and be prepared to kill all the bus route articles :) It is also similar to the file sharing/torrent sites (which is like [[KickassTorrents]] or [[The Pirate Bay]], some of which had been blocked by the court orders.
