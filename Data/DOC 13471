Completely non-notable individual. No third party references describe this person in the level of detail required for a biography. [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] ([[User talk:Hipocrite|talk]]) 20:28, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''keep''' Brander is a rising star in the Jewish world and has achieved notoriety on many fronts. This article clearly needs some good work to make it up to snuff but nonetheless its important to have it.

*'''keep''' I would like to contest this deletion. This individual is notable both as a dean and university vice president [http://www.yutorah.org/Rabbi_Kenneth_Brander] as well as a published scholar [http://rabbanan.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rabbi%20Brander-Critique%20of%20Walzer.pdf]. His biography is described in detail on the university website [http://yu.edu/cjf/about/senior-staff/] in the level of detail required for a biography.

:* I don't believe being a mid-level dean at a mid-level institution is an indication of notability. I don't believe that unpublished drafts are published.

*'''Comment'''.  Hi, Hip.  Have you done a [[wp:before]] search? The RS coverage need not be in the article.  It simply has to exist.  For example, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-07-09/florida-jewish-journal/fl-jjps-brander-0710-20130709_1_boca-raton-community-kollel-rabbi-kenneth-brander-synagogue-community the 15-paragraph article "Brander named vice president at Yeshiva University"] in the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' is entirely about the rabbi. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 01:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:: I did, yes. I don't believe that puff-piece articles with no detail are substantial biographical works. [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] ([[User talk:Hipocrite|talk]]) 19:49, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Thanks.  Why do you refer to the 15-paragraph article  as having "no detail?" On the contrary, it appears quite detailed, and appears to reflect precisely what a biography-supporting article would contain--in terms of biographical content. And ''Sun-Sentinel'' is clearly an RS. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 22:20, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' this [[WP:N]] rabbi, there are so many [[WP:V]] and [[WP:RS]] about and by him on: [https://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22Kenneth+Brander%22&num=50 "Kenneth Brander"], [https://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q=%22Kenneth+Brander%22 books], [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Kenneth+Brander%22 scholar] that prove this beyond any doubt.

:::Hip -- there is no requirement that ''the majority'' of results meet GNG. So its irrelevant whether they do.

*'''Merge''' I would suggest adding just his name and some credentials to the page: Yeshiva University Center for the Jewish Future, an organization which he currently runs and started. His page in its current state is untenable and should be deleted.[[User:Pretzelguy|Pretzelguy]] ([[User talk:Pretzelguy|talk]]) 23:26, 29 April 2014 (UTC) <small>— [[User: Pretzelguy| Pretzelguy]] ([[User talk: Pretzelguy|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ Pretzelguy|contribs]]) has made [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|few or no other edits]] outside this topic. </small>

*'''Delete''' - University assistant deans are not notable. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 19:48, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:*He is not an assistant dean, apparently, but a full dean.  As well as rabbi, founder of a high school, etc. --[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 07:45, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::*That does appears to be the case, but nevertheless, he is not '''''the Dean''''' of Yeshiva University, but '''''a dean''''' of one of its units, one among many. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 22:43, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*He is the [[Yeshiva University]] Executive Vice President for University and Community Social Life, and Dean of the University's [[Center for the Jewish Future]] (CJF). --[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 22:57, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*Thank you, I can read.  Please pay close attention to what I write: he is not '''''<u>The</u> Dean of Yeshiva University''''', a unitary position, he is '''''<u>ONE OF</u>''''' Yeshiva University's multiple number of deans.  Every major department or school within the university will have its own dean, the person is charge of that unit.  Unless the dean is '''''otherwise notable''''' being the dean, the head of a department or school within a university does not give one notability.
:::::*I'm reacting to your !vote.  Based on your misunderstanding that he is an "assistant dean." He's an EVP of the university.  And he is dean of the center; as far as I can tell the university has four centers, and [[Adrienne Asch]] is director of a second one, and [[Steven Fine]] is director of a third one. --[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 01:21, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::*According to [http://yu.edu/deans/ this page on their website], Yeshiva University has '''''<u>12 deans</u>'''''. Being one of 12 people at the same level in a organization does not confer notability.
::::::*According to [http://yu.edu/president/cabinet-bios/ '''''this''''' page of their website], Brander is one of '''''<u>5 vice presidents</u>''''' of the university, and there are two '''''senior vice presidents''''' above that level on the totem pole.  Again, being one of five people three levels down from the top does not confer notability. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 01:38, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::*As I said, my !vote is based primarily on GNG.  But he is one of four deans of a Center at the university -- and the deans of two of the other centers are also notable, with wp articles.  And he is also a rabbi, and has been the spiritual leader of two synagogues, and has founded the Weinbaum Yeshiva High School, and was Chairman of the Resolutions Committee of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], and has had at least two articles in RSs fully devoted to him or his works and many others that have more than passing mention of him. It's not a determination made solely on "is being Dean of a Center of the university enough?" --[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 01:47, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*Yes, we know his resume.  The one thing you omit is that none of that adds up to notability. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 02:48, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::*To the contrary. Meeting [[wp:GNG]] by having significant coverage by virtue of having at least two articles in RSs fully devoted to him or his works and many others that have more than passing mention of him adds up to notability. --[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 07:05, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. A haphazard list of minor accomplishments none of which rises to the level of notability for me. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 19:55, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''.  As the majority of the !voters have indicated, he is notable.  Simply because he meets GNG, including a 15-paragaph article about him in an RS, and various other RS articles that contain more than passing mention of him.  It doesn't matter whether he is an assistant dean (he is a full dean it appears) or a janitor -- if he meets GNG, he is notable for wp purposes. And while the 15-paragraph biographical review of him is anything but "haphazard," that wouldn't matter -- GNG encompasses substantial RS coverage, whether haphazard or not.  Furthermore, the assertion that the RS coverage has "no detail" is clearly incorrect, as discussed above. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 20:00, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**The fact that there is '''''<u>one</u>''''' article which meets the requirement of GNG (i.e. independent reliable secondary sources) does not mean that the subject necessarily passes GNG, which says, quite specifically: <blockquote>'''"Presumed" means that significant coverage in reliable sources creates an <u>assumption, not a guarantee</u>, that a subject should be included.  A more in-depth discussion might conclude that the topic actually should not have a stand-alone article''' (emphasis added)</blockquote><p>What you have here is a man who's been the rabbi at two synagogues, and is now an assistant dean at a university.  I'd be hard pressed to think of anyone else in the encyclopedia with credentials that minimal who has an article, but, in any case, those three things -- which are his claim to fame -- do '''''not''''' make him notable. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 20:41, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::*Thanks for admitting that the 15-paragraph RS on him meets GNG. As you will note, I pointed out that the sources that support the conclusion that he meets GNG include not only that article, but also "various other RS articles that contain more than passing mention of him."  Examples are in the refs in the article that are to RSs -- there are between half a dozen and a dozen of those. GNG states that "If a topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, it is presumed to be suitable for a stand-alone article". He has received precisely that. That is why the majority of the !voters here have !voted Keep. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 21:22, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*You are misunderstanding the notability standards.  There can be gazillions of articles in reliable sources that mention his name in passing, and it doesn't add one iota to his notability.  It takes numerous '''''significant coverage''''' articles to do that, and there is nothing like that for this person - just that '''''<u>one article</u>''''', and nothing else, which is not sufficient. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 21:26, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::::*Let me add, if the coverage was exactly what we have now, and Brander had leaped up to become the '''''Dean''''' of Yeshiva University, that would be different.  It might still be borderline to some people, but I'd be inclined to say that the Dean of a fairly major institution such as that is inherently notable.  This is not the case for Assistant Deans, of which there are a plethora. Brander may someday be notable enough to have an article, but that is not the case at this time. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 21:31, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::*You've somewhow mis-read (again) what I wrote.  I wrote -- twice now; this is the third time: "the sources that support the conclusion that he meets GNG include '''not only that article''', but '''also''' "various other RS articles that contain '''more than''' passing mention of him." And that is what the majority of the !voters here have also said. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 21:45, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::*No, I didn't misread, '''''I do not share your evaluation of those other articles'''''.  They are '''''<u>not</u>''''' significant coverage.  You've got press releases masquerading as a newspaper article and other garbage like that, and they are far from sufficient to show notability.<p>Also, please remember that AfD is not a !vote, it's the quality of the arguments which determine the closing, so it's silly to keep pointing out the numbers, especially when the discussion is still ongoing (and particularly when there are 4 "keep" !votes and 3 "delete" votes).  We're less than halfway through the 7 day period. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 22:03, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::*The article reflects many RSs that speak of his leadership positions in the religious and academic communities (spiritual leader at the Lincoln Square Synagogue, rabbi of the Boca Raton Synagogue, founder of the Weinbaum Yeshiva High School, "Top 50 Jewish Community Builder" list, YU EVP, Dean of DJF, Chairman of the Resolutions Committee of the Rabbinical Council of America), and cite his religious opinions--for example in an article devoted to discussing his opinion with regard to the impact of a natural disaster on Jewish law requirements to observe the Sabbath. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 19:31, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*Everyone has an opinion, and I assume every rabbi expresses his or hers, but I see no indication in the sources provided that Brander's are "influential".   BTW, what kind of "research" does he do, and what authority has he to make "rulings"? What I'm seeing here from his advocates is a '''''lot''''' of hand-waving and boot-strapping, not clear-cut and straightforward notability and significance. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 21:26, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*Not every rabbi has full articles in RSs about an opinion of his.  Not every rabbi is the spiritual leader of a synagogue (or, here, two). Or founds a high school.  Or is Chairman of the Resolutions Committee of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]].  Or has the other indicia.  None of this is hand-waving -- it is all RS-supported hard-fact straight-forward material. The hand-waving is the effort to ignore it. As to the level of his authority -- it is the level inherent in the various positions indicated above and in the article and relative to the institutions (the two synagogues, the high school, the university, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]]) with which he has held those positions, but it would be off-topic to discuss here the details further and it is of course irrelevant what "research" he does -- thought if you look at his writings perhaps you can deduce it.[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 21:42, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:*Note to closing admin: I have struck out the above comment for these reasons: The above IP has said in his edit summaries on the article that he or she knows Brander personally, and the editor has been repeatedly trying to add a large amount of unsubstantiated unsourced information into the article on the basis of their personal knowledge, over the objections of other editors. (They have also used 66.87.117.237, 129.98.152.14  and other addresses to do this.) The material they have been adding is a mixture of plausible and outright falsehoods, hoaxes, and jokes, things such as comments that Brander is self-ordained, that he has "not yet won a Nobel Prize" but has been nominated numerous times for the Peace Prize, that Brander has been compared to Abraham Lincoln (with a ref an article the title of which is "Rumor is Rabbi Brander breathes"), that because of his work with "granular composites" Brander has been given honorary Iowa citizenship, and so on.  These are vandalistic edits, which editors on both sides of this issue can agree damage the article (which, if it is kept, should be the best possible article it can be). These actions should not be rewarded by allowing the editor to participate here, and the editor is warned that if he or she undoes the strikeout, or otherwise defaces this comment or the rest of the discussion, I will bring in an admin to deal with them.
