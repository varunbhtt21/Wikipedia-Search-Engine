The '''Rio Cobre Dam''' is a [[diversion dam]] on the [[Rio Cobre]] near [[Spanish Town]] in [[Saint Catherine Parish]], [[Jamaica]]. It is owned by the National Irrigation Commission. The primary purpose of the dam is to divert water into a canal on its right bank for the irrigation of up to {{Convert|12000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} to the south. It also provides [[municipal water]] to Spanish Town. The scheme contains more than {{Convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} of canals and waters sugar cane, bananas and cattle.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wSQOAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA9&lpg=RA1-PA9&dq=rio+cobre+dam+irrigation+ha&source=bl&ots=ulyRJIxnRn&sig=anlbwOwq2grZPXEvHFoS5zZ3WbM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ELVeU-y9HfTJsASy04GgCw&ved=0CHMQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&q=rio%20cobre%20dam%20irrigation%20ha&f=false | title=Overview of Agricultural Development in Jamaica | publisher=Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture | year=1981 | accessdate=28 April 2014 | author=Aitken-Soux, Percy | pages=0}}</ref>

Plans for the scheme began with then [[Governor of Jamaica]] [[John Peter Grant]] in 1870. Construction began at the end of 1872 and by June 1876 the dam and canals were complete.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzULAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA293&lpg=PA293&dq=rio+cobre+dam&source=bl&ots=tzW13uPrT5&sig=ecfDjD7pPU6G2G8Pm33Y0miakuE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=865eU5SII4qw2wWoiICgCA&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=rio%20cobre%20dam&f=false | title=The Handbook of Jamaica | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | year=1886 | accessdate=28 April 2014 | pages=293â€“294}}</ref>

In the late 1800s the [[West India Electric Company]] constructed a 900&nbsp;kW [[hydroelectric]] power station upstream at [[Bog Walk]] to power a [[Trams in Kingston upon Hull|tram system]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. On 24 June 1904, while workers were cleaning the station's [[penstock]], water was accidentally released down it killing 33 of them. The power station was closed in 1966, 62 years after the accident but, the dam, the ruins of the turbine house and some of the concrete supports of the penstock still exist today.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story004.html | title=Bog Walk Tube | publisher=Jamaica Gleaner | accessdate=28 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219232814/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story004.html | archivedate=19 December 2014 | df= }}</ref>
