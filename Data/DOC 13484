* <s>... that "'''[[The Little Things Give You Away]]'''" berates [[George W. Bush]]'s handling of [[Hurricane Katrina]]?</s>
:*
<small>Created by [[User:Launchballer|Launchballer]] ([[User talk:Launchballer|talk]]). Self nominated at 20:37, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] In general, this article is new enough and long enough and the hook is cited, but Bush did not actually handle the hurricane did he? I would like to suggest as a better hook
*'''ALT1''' ... that "'''[[The Little Things Give You Away]]'''" berates [[George W. Bush]]'s response to [[Hurricane Katrina]]? [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 12:49, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::For no reason other than the fact that you can't approve your own hooks:

::::I don't understand your comment but you can't use ALT2, its not in the article. I will leave someone else to finalise what hook should be used. [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 19:02, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Editors can't approve their own hooks, is what I'm trying to say. ALT1 I can agree with.--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 19:04, 14 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  New reviewer needed for ALT1 hook, and also to check neutrality and close paraphrasing, since those weren't covered in the original review. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 21:58, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]]  Good work, Launchballer, for taking a contested article and making it Wikipedia-worthy! The history, though, shows that you did not create the article, but expanded it from the last time [[User:Danielhj]] cut it down. On that date, March 25, the character count stood at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Little_Things_Give_You_Away&diff=200769231&oldid=200768095 524 characters]. You started your expansion on April 28, which is fine for your DYK nomination date. But your expansion did not add 5x to the page, and even if I count from today's word count, which is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Things_Give_You_Away 2,123 characters], the article is still 497 characters short of a 5x expansion.

:::Um, I started the article from scratch - I didn't even know the old content was there until just a minute ago. I'm sure when I checked the history all that was there was a redirect. I can probably add another 497 characters to it, but surely it would count as a new article? That's what DYK check is telling me, anyway.--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 23:12, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*It's my understanding that it would count as a 5x expansion. You could add back information about the music video from prior edits. Also, please submit a QPQ for a self-nomination. Thanks, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 23:29, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] 5x expansion verified. New enough, long enough, well referenced, no close paraphrasing seen. Hook ref verified and cited inline. QPQ done. ALT1 good to go.
