'''Martin Ray Akins''' (born January 6, 1954) is a former college All-American [[American football|football]] player and politician. He started as quarterback for the [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]] [[Texas Longhorns football|Longhorns]] in the early 1970s and was the only Longhorn quarterback to start three seasons directing the wishbone offense, and the only wishbone quarterback to ever be an All-American. He was later the Democratic nominee for Texas State Comptroller in 2002.

==Early life==

Marty Akins was born in San Saba, Texas. At Gregory-Portland, Akins was coached by his father, Ray Akins, a Texas High School Football Hall of Famer with 302 wins in 37 seasons. Marty Akins, captain of his high school team, was selected as the Texas High School 3A Football Player of the Year in 1971 while he led the Wildcats to the 1971 State Championship game. He had a 60–4–1 record as a junior high and high school quarterback.<ref name="wish"/><ref name="Comptroller"/> Akins was an All-State Quarterback and Prep All-American Quarterback and was selected Super All-State Punter and Kicker. Marty Akins was also selected as Quarterback on the UIL All-Century Football Team 1910-2010. In 2017, his number #10 was retired by Gregory-Portland High School.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hayward|first1=Len|title=Landgraf's TD catches push Gregory-Portland past Alice in overtime|url=http://www.caller.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2017/10/20/landgrafs-td-catches-push-gregory-portland-past-alice-overtime/774032001/|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=20 Oct 2017}}</ref>

Akins was heavily recruited by many national programs and had always dreamed of playing for Notre Dame. When Notre Dame offered Akins a scholarship, he first decided to take it, but later chose to stay close to home when he was heavily recruited by Longhorn coach [[Darrell Royal]] and by former President [[Lyndon Johnson]].<ref name="wish"/><ref name="Comptroller">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title="All American" Leadership |url=http://bnb.stparchive.com/Archive/BNB/BNB10022002p09.php |newspaper=The Burnet Bulletin |location= Burnet, TX|publisher= |date= October 2, 2002 |accessdate=May 12, 2014 }}</ref>

Akins was also a star in track and field, winning the 1972 Texas State High School Championship in the shot put. He also won the 1971 national championship in track and field. <ref>{{cite web|title=Boys Track & Field State Champions - Shot Put|url=http://uil100.org/archives/athletics/track-field-event-distance.php?event==Shot+Put&boys_girls=Boys|website=http://uil100.org/|accessdate=31 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225031820/http://uil100.org/archives/athletics/track-field-event-distance.php?event==Shot+Put&boys_girls=Boys|archive-date=25 February 2015|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

==College career==
At Texas, Akins spent his freshman year backing up [[Alan Lowry]]. He saw limited play in four games as quarterback, but at the end of the season, emerged as a kickoff returner in the final regular season game and in the [[1973 Cotton Bowl Classic|1973 Cotton Bowl]], which Texas won. They finished the season ranked #3.

Lowry graduated and by the spring of 1973, Akins had taken over as the starting quarterback.<ref name="wish"/> In 1973, Akins started every game, despite suffering a broken big toe in the third game of the season. Texas defied predictions and won its sixth consecutive SWC Championship, but lost to Nebraska in the [[1974 Cotton Bowl Classic|1974 Cotton Bowl]]. He was twice voted Chevrolet Television Player of the game and was chosen the Southwest Conference Newcomer of the Year. Akins played in the Cotton Bowl despite having the flu and a temperature over 102 degrees. 

Texas started the 1974 season with a win over [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]], but Akins didn't make it through the game as he suffered a concussion early in the 2nd quarter resulting in him being hospitalized for observation and replaced by Mike Presley. He then sat out most of the next game against [[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]] too, entering the game only once for a 9-yard carry.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Presley Gets Reward, He's New Texas QB  |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/9247299/ |newspaper=Northwest Arkansas Times |location= Fayetteville, AK |publisher= |date= September 18, 1974 |accessdate=May 5, 2014 }}</ref>

Akins returned as the starter and he and Presley shared quarterbacking duties for most of the season. Against Rice, Akins set the record for most rushing yards in a game by a quarterback. Texas came close to winning the SWC for a 7th straight time, but disappointing upsets to unranked Texas Tech and Baylor, as well as #2 (and eventual National Champion) Oklahoma, broke Texas' streak. They finished on a high note, beating TCU 81-16 and upsetting #7 Texas A&M and then went to the Gator Bowl where they lost to #5 Auburn. In the 1974 season Marty Akins was named the Chevrolet Player of the Game in two televised games.

Akins was again the starter in 1975 and now the captain of a team that included future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Earl Campbell]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Top 20 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090222/8/index.htm |journal=Sports Illustrated |location= |publisher= |date=September 9, 1975 |accessdate= April 14, 2014 }}</ref> He led the Longhorns to a 10–2 record, again losing to #2, and eventual National Champion, Oklahoma while beating #20 Arkansas. He was replaced in the TCU game by [[Ted Constanzo]] when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, Texas was up 14–3 when he left the game and eventually won 27-11.<ref name="wish"/><ref name="surgery">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Ted Constanzo Due Surgery |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/47683610/ |newspaper=Abilene Reporter-News |location= Abilene, TX|publisher= |date= July 23, 1977 |accessdate=April 1, 2014 }}</ref> Two weeks later, after much doubt that he would even play, Akins, with his knee heavily braced, started against #2, undefeated [[1975 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] with the Conference title on the line. But he was injured again on Texas' first offensive play and was again replaced by Constanzo. He entered the game later in the 1st, but was pulled for good early in the 2nd quarter after taking only 9 more snaps.<ref name="wish"/><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Ags hold Texas to 179 Total Yards.  |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44106277/ |newspaper=The Eagle |location= Bryan, TX|publisher= |date= November 29, 1975 |accessdate=April 14, 2014 }}</ref>  Texas A&M won, splitting the Conference Championship with Texas and Arkansas and sending Texas to the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl. Akins was back in the lineup for the bowl game and led the team to a 38–21 come-from-behind win over Colorado and a final ranking of #9. That season he was twice the Chevrolet Player of the Game in televised games, named to the All-Conference team and became the second quarterback in Texas history to be named an All-American when the FWAA chose him over AP All-American John Sciara.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gmZS5cfxsXMC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=Marty+Akins+Longhorns&source=bl&ots=iBHmMAsL-U&sig=wgIHiCOV2Yt4SJTe91KbzDoyzOQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7RptU7idOIqvsATAloHYBA&ved=0CEQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Marty%20Akins%20Longhorns&f=false Tales of the Texas Longhorns]</ref>

Akins finished his football career at the University of Texas with a record of 27-9, the most wins since [[Bobby Layne]] won 28.

Akins was selected in the 11th round of the 1976 NFL draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. He spent his rookie season on the scout team playing defensive back and was then traded to the New Orleans Saints in 1977. He never played for the Saints, and decided to give up pro ball.  He studied law at the [[University of Houston]] [[University of Houston Law Center|College of Law]], graduated with high honors and became a very successful trial lawyer dealing with environmental, consumer protection, and personal injury cases.<ref name="wish">{{cite web|url=http://www.kens5.com/community/blogs/david-flores/66444637.html |title=Former UT quarterback Akins took the 'wish' out of wishbone offense with his precise execution |last1=Flores |first1=David |date=June 17, 2009 |website=kens5.com |publisher= |accessdate=May 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017181232/http://www.kens5.com/community/blogs/david-flores/66444637.html |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref name="Comptroller"/>
