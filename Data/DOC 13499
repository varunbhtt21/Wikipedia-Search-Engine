== History ==
Cycle for Survival was founded by Jennifer Goodman Linn and her husband, David Linn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alikocarter/2016/03/02/rare-cancer-charity-cycle-for-survival-nears-100-million-milestone/#5e800f245231|title=Rare Cancer Charity Cycle For Survival Nears $100 Million Milestone|last=Carter|first=Aliko|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}</ref> In 2004, Jen was diagnosed with MFH sarcoma, a rare cancer, and began treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alikocarter/2016/03/02/rare-cancer-charity-cycle-for-survival-nears-100-million-milestone/#5e800f245231|title=Rare Cancer Charity Cycle For Survival Nears $100 Million Milestone|last=Carter|first=Aliko|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/cancer/cycle-for-survival-jennifer-goodman-linns-legacy-of-hope-love-and-fearless-living.aspx|title=Jennifer Goodman Linn's Legacy of Hope, Love, and Fearless Living|work=EverydayHealth.com|access-date=2018-10-11}}</ref> After going into remission, she and Dave wanted to fight back and support the doctors and researchers at MSK.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/cancer/cycle-for-survival-jennifer-goodman-linns-legacy-of-hope-love-and-fearless-living.aspx|title=Jennifer Goodman Linn's Legacy of Hope, Love, and Fearless Living|work=EverydayHealth.com|access-date=2018-10-11}}</ref>

In 2007, they held the first-ever event, originally named “Spin4Survival,” in Equinox Columbus Circle to raise money for rare cancer research. Despite Jen’s cancer returning, they held two successful events and in 2009, MSK became the owner and operator and Equinox became the founding partner of what it is known today as Cycle for Survival.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/cancer/cycle-for-survival-jennifer-goodman-linns-legacy-of-hope-love-and-fearless-living.aspx|title=Jennifer Goodman Linn's Legacy of Hope, Love, and Fearless Living|work=EverydayHealth.com|access-date=2018-10-11}}</ref> Jen lost her battle to cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alikocarter/2016/03/02/rare-cancer-charity-cycle-for-survival-nears-100-million-milestone/#5e800f245231|title=Rare Cancer Charity Cycle For Survival Nears $100 Million Milestone|last=Carter|first=Aliko|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}</ref> After her passing, MSK dedicated a lab to recognize her critical role in the advancement of rare cancer research, named “The Jennifer Goodman Linn Laboratory of New Drug Development in Sarcoma and Rare Cancers.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/6/cycle-for-survival-bikes-for-rare-cancer-research/|title=‘Cycle for Survival’ bikes for rare cancer research|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}</ref>
