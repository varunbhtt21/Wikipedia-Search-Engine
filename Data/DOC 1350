==The temple==
The temple is built as an exact replica of the original Ayyappan Temple at [[Sabarimala]] in [[Kerala]]. The temple was constructed in three floors presumably to lend the feeling of being atop a hill similar to the Sabarimala hill.<ref name="HomeWeb_AboutTheTemple"/> The architecture follows the Kerala style and tradition with 18 steps to the main shrine and the sanctum sanctorum. The temple is known as ''Vada Sabari'' or North Sabarimala. Methods of worship is similar to the Sabarimala temple, whereby devotees observe all fasting, carry ''Irumudi'' (the sacred twin baggage) and sing bajans as they do for a pilgrimage to Sabarimala. There is a separate passage for other devotees coming to the temple without the Irumudi.<ref name="Dinamalar_SriAiyappanTemple"/> The temple has all the features of Sabarimala with sub-shrines of Kannimoola Maha Ganapathy, Maaligaipurathu Amman, Nagaraja and other "Parivara Devatas".<ref name="Hindu_FestivalTimeAtAyyappaTemple">{{cite news
