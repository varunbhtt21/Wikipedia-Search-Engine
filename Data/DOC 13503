==Background==
{{main|New Philadelphia Town Site}}

The New Philadelphia Town Site is the original site of the now-vanished town of "New Philadelphia", [[Illinois]].  It is located near the city of [[Barry, Illinois|Barry]], in [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]].  Founded in 1836, it was the first town in the United States platted and registered by an [[African American]] before the [[American Civil War]].  The founder [[Free Frank McWorter]] was a former [[slave]] who was able to save money from work and his own business to purchase the freedom of his wife, himself and 13 members of his family in [[Kentucky]].<ref>[http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/faculty/cfennell/NP/ Christopher Fennell, "Historical Landscapes of New Philadelphia, Illinois"], University of Illinois</ref><ref>"New Philadelphia: A First," ''The Living Museum'' 71(1 & 2):9.</ref> The town site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005, and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2009.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

Previously, in June 2010, Rep. [[Aaron Schock]] had introduced legislation ({{USBill|111|H.R.|5455}}) to direct the Department of Interior to study the New Philadelphia townsite for possible designation as a [[US National Park|National Park]]. If approved, it would be the first such park in Illinois.<ref>[http://www.sj-r.com/breaking/x1057817179/Schock-wants-New-Philadelphia-studied-for-national-park "Schock Wants New Philadelphia Studied for National Park"], ''The State-Journal Register'', 13 Jun 2010, accessed 4 April 2014</ref><ref name=5455sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 5455 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5455|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=930sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 930 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/930|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> 

The New Philadelphia, Illinois, Study Act was intended to direct the [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to conduct a special resource study of the [[New Philadelphia Town Site|New Philadelphia archaeological site]] and the land surrounding it in Illinois (the study area).<ref name="930sum"/>

The bill sought to require the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the national significance of the study area; (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the study area as a unit of the National Park System; (3) consider other alternatives for preservation, protection, and interpretation of the study area by federal, state, or local governmental entities, or private and nonprofit organizations; and (4) determine the effect of the designation as a System unit on existing commercial and recreational activities as well as the authorization, construction, and operation of energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the effect on the authority of state and local officials to manage those activities.  It also would have directed the Secretary to identify any authorities, including condemnation, that will compel or permit the Secretary to influence or participate in local land use decisions (such as [[zoning]]) or place restrictions on non-federal land if the study area is designated as a System unit.<ref name="930sum"/>

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 31, 2013. This is a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=cbo930>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 930|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44519|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> 

H.R. 930 would have directed the [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to conduct a study of the [[New Philadelphia Town Site|New Philadelphia archaeological site]] in [[Illinois]] to evaluate the national significance of the area and to determine the feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System. Based on information provided by the [[National Park Service]] and assuming the availability of [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriated]] funds, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated its costs to reach approximately $250,000 by 2016.<ref name="cbo930"/>

H.R. 930 contained no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would have imposed no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.<ref name="cbo930"/>

==Procedural history==
The New Philadelphia, Illinois, Study Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on February 28, 2013 by [[Aaron Schock|Rep. Aaron Schock (R, IL-18)]].<ref name=930allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 930 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/930/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation]]. It was reported (amended) on November 20, 2013 alongside [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt219/CRPT-113hrpt219.pdf House Report 113-219].<ref name="930allactions"/> On April 28, 2014, the House voted in a [[voice vote]] to pass the bill. It was received in the [[United States Senate]] on April 29, 2014 and referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]].<ref name="930allactions"/>

A similar bill was introduced in the Senate by Senators [[Dick Durbin]] and [[Mark Kirk]].<ref name="QuincyHW"/>

==Debate and discussion==
Rep. Schock said that "this legislation is another sure stitch in the healing process for a nation once divided so bitterly and tragically over the issue of slavery."<ref name=QuincyHW>{{cite news|last=Husar|first=Deborah Gertz|title=House passes measure tied to New Philadelphia national park designation|url=http://www.whig.com/story/25377598/house-passes-measure-tied-to-new-philadelphia-national-park-designation|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Quincy Herald Whig|date=29 April 2014}}</ref> According to Schock, "at a time of immense cultural and political hostilities over the issue of slavery, the McWorter family and the other citizens of New Philadelphia built a town where free African-Americans and European settlers lived and worked side by side."<ref name="QuincyHW"/>

Charlotte King, a director of the New Philadelphia Association, testified before Congress that "by including New Philadelphia among the national treasures designated units of the National Park Service, of which currently less than 5 percent are predominantly associated with African-American history, the story of the country will be more complete and accurate and give recognition to contributions of African-Americans to the development of our country."<ref name="QuincyHW"/>
