Only worked on 1 film back in 2006 that was not even notable, no awards, not even a nomination for anything. Maybe someday she will be notable, but not now. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 20:46, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - "Assistant costume designer" for one film is rather weak as the only claim to notability (to provide contrast, [[WP:NACTOR|actors]] need to have played major roles in ''multiple notable'' films to be considered notable). Interestingly, a cursory Google search comes up with sources related to the Royal Wedding. See [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clare-mukherjee/royal-wedding-bolero_b_980414.html][http://www.today.com/style/duchess-kate-sparks-yet-another-wedding-trend-1C8368639][http://www.myfoxla.com/story/22842684/claire-mukherjee-the-royal-baby-is-just-positive-news]. I'm not sure if this is the same Clare Mukherjee, but even so I do not think these trivial events make her notable per [[WP:BIO]]. [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 04:07, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::I figured it out. The first link is a blog entry written by the subject herself. The second source mentions the blog entry, and the third source is independent. Is it [[WP:GNG]]? Personally, I need more evidence. [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 00:34, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - First of all, she started as an Assistant costume designer in the film, but ultimately finished it off as the Costume Designer. I know that's not enough notability, but still. We aren't supposed to look at [http://claremukherjee.com/about/ her own website,] but it gives some insight. She's definitely a Huffington Post columnist and appeared in various newspapers and television channels during the Royal wedding as well as the Childbirth. Maybe she was given prominence as she was considered as a British Costume Designer in America (Los Angeles). She can be seen on Today.com, Fox, Huffington Post etc. [[User:DebashisM|<span style="text-shadow:gray 3px 3px 2px;"><font color="#000000"><sup></sup>DebashisM</font></span>]]<sup>[[User talk:DebashisM|<font color="#000000">Talk</font>]]</sup> 03:06, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
::According to her [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clare-mukherjee Huffington Post profile], she has contributed all of 2 blog entries to the site. At AfD, I am interested in sources above all else. Can you provide [[WP:V|verifiable]] evidence of [[WP:SIGCOV|significant coverage]] of the subject in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]? Significant coverage is necessary so we can write a verifiable article about the subject [[WP:PERMASTUB|bigger than a stub]]. This is especially important considering that the subject is a [[WP:BLP|living person]].  As of now, it's [[WP:TOOSOON|too soon]] and too early in her career for a Wikipedia article to be created—simply because biographical information just isn't reliably documented yet. [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 00:30, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I don't see the significant coverage required to meet [[WP:GNG]].[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 15:58, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as failing [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 02:35, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
