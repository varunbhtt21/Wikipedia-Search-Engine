The references does not display the articles notabily. Plus that it looks like it is written a little bit like an ad. <span style="background: turquoise; font-family: 'Segoe Script'">([[User talk:Josve05a|'''t''']])&nbsp;[[User:Josve05a|<span style="color:white;">'''Josve05a'''</span>]]&nbsp;([[Special:Contributions/Josve05a|'''c''']])</span> 20:49, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': No [[:WP:RS|evidence]] provided or found that this product line is [[:WP:GNG|notable]]. (Note that there are construction firms of similar names for which coverage can be found.) [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 07:01, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
Although the brand may not be in many articles, it is one of the top selling brands in Amazon.com's Hand Tools department.[[http://www.amazon.com/Hand-Tools/b/?node=551238&ref=acs_ux_ctw_7_phtctw&pf_rd_p=1705527622&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_i=328182011&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=13B8VHHDN4JRX6A2262N| See here]] The brand is also sold on Sears.com and Lowes.com. And it is an oft-mentioned brand in Garage Journal, which is a popular blog among tool users and mechanics. [[http://www.garagejournal.com/forum/search.php?searchid=16178313| See here]]. I can understand if you still have to delete it because there aren't scholarly articles on the brand, but I believe it is a product line that is notable.

'''Delete'''. Not because it isn't notable, but because this is an ad. [[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 02:24, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
