On March 7, 2014, the group released the official music video.<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Videos - Chills by Down With Webster|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/music-video/chills/id835127989|work=[[iTunes Store]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc]]|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> The video, shot in [[greyscale]], shows each of the group members alone in an empty room with their hands covering their face, and an image of their face projected onto the backs of their hands. [[MuchMusic]] blogger Liam Scott described the visual effects in the video as "pretty nifty (if slightly creepy)," which helped deliver the titular chills.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Liam|title=Here's the new Down With Webster video for Chills!|url=http://blog.muchmusic.com/heres-the-new-down-with-webster-video-for-chills/|work=[[MuchMusic]]|publisher=[[Bell Media]]|accessdate=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429051832/http://blog.muchmusic.com/heres-the-new-down-with-webster-video-for-chills/|archive-date=29 April 2014|dead-url=yes}}</ref>
