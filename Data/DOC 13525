:* Promoted to GA 28 April 
:* Length OK
:* neutral, cites, seems free of close paraphrases etc.
:* nice hook, length OK
:* QPQ undertaken

::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] What do you mean, "it's not a hunting lodge"? This needs to be stated and cited inline per [[Wikipedia:Did you know#Eligibility criteria]] (3. Cited hook). Ditto for its being built "200 years after the death of King John". [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 22:01, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</s>
[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] Not a GA, therefore not eligible. Please improve articles to GA standards before proposing them for DYK as a GA. --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 22:35, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:While I see the delisting from GA in the edit history for the page, it is still listed on the talk page. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 10:26, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::: NB - it '''was''' a GA  when I reviewed the article. - then after that held back for a reassessment at the request of [[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] - [[Talk:King_John%27s_Hunting_Lodge,_Axbridge/GA2]] - presently awaiting as far as I can see a citation requested by [[User:Yoninah]]. '''Query''': if restored to GA status, does the DYK countdown then start from the restoration? --[[User:Smerus|Smerus]] ([[User talk:Smerus|talk]]) 14:59, 1 May 2014 (UTC) 
I think it is best to withdraw this nomination until the status of the article is resolved. Is there a mechanism to do this or does an admin need to remove it?&mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] <sup>[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]</sup> 15:17, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
