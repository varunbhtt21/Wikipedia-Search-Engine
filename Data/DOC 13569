Text : [[Image:TarkhunSogdianCoin.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of Tarkhun]]
'''Tarkhun''' (died 710) was a [[Sogdia]]n ruler ([[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]: ''[[ikhshid]]'') of [[Samarkand]] from somewhere 705-707 to 710.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Pu |title=Institutional History of Tang}}</ref> After receiving the news of the capture of [[Bukhara]] by the [[Umayyad]] general [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]] in 709, Tarkhun sent envoys to the latter and acknowledged the authority of the Umayyad Caliphate. However, one year later, Tarkhun was overthrown by a local rebellion because of his pro-Muslim policy, and was succeeded by another Sogdian prince named [[Gurak]], who had Tarkhun imprisoned. Tarkhun shortly after committed suicide. His two sons, however, managed to flee to the court of another Sogdian ruler named [[Divashtich]] at [[Panjikant]], where they were treated honorably.

Note: 
During the years of Shenlong (705-707), Ninieshishi died. And his son Tarkhun was put on the throne (神龙中泥涅师师卒，又册其子突昏).
