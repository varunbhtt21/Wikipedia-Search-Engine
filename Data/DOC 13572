=== Official French president's Marianne ===
Each newly elected President of France is permitted to select an artist to design the "Marianne" (the most common French postage stamp). When newly elected François Hollande indicated he would like to choose Ciappa, a controversy ensued. This honor is usually reserved for more established artists, much later in their careers. [[François Hollande|Hollande]] felt the best way forward was to allow all France's young generation (all of its high school students) to select the artist. As the students made their choice, Ciappa was selected by every high school in the country. His stamp is now known throughout France, and the drawings have been widely displayed including an exhibition at the [[Palais de l'Élysée|French White House]].

====Imaginary Couples====
During 2012, as the debate over legalizing [[Gay marriage in France|gay marriage]] in France became very polarizing to the French people, Ciappa looked for a way to bring a more positive image of gay love to a homophobic public. His concept was to show loving people – and challenge others to see this love as anything other than the love of two people. The result is an exhibition of black and white photographs, which has seen unprecedented public displays throughout the country, including at the Place de Republique and the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]] in Paris. The photographs feature straight people posing as same sex couples, and include leading athletes, film stars and political figures. With that exhibition, Olivier Ciappa became the youngest person to be on the cover of France’s biggest newspaper |Le Figaro]]<ref>(17 July 2013) [http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2013/07/17/03004-20130717ARTFIG00310-olivier-ciappa-le-visage-de-la-perseverance.php "Olivier Ciappa, le visage de la persévérance"].
