{{USPL|113|102}} (formerly {{USBill|113|hr|4120}}) is a United States Public Law that extends until November 9, 2016, the authority of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization, to construct a museum on federal lands within the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] honoring law enforcement officers.<ref name="cbo4120"/> The museum would "honor federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty."<ref name=Housevotes28>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=House votes to allow more DC penthouses|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/204618-house-votes-to-allow-more-dc-penthouses|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 April 2014}}</ref> 

The law was introduced the [[United States House of Representatives]] and became Public Law 113-102 during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
{{main|National Law Enforcement Museum}}

In 2000, the [[United States Congress]] authorized the establishment of the National Law Enforcement Museum, to tell the story of law enforcement in the United States. Stories of the fallen will be featured in the Museum's "Hall of Remembrance."  The bill, signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on November 9, 2000, authorized the planning for the museum. The National Law Enforcement Museum will be mostly-underground and located adjacent to the [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial]] in Washington, DC's [[Judiciary Square]] (400 block of E Street, NW). The Museum will tell the story of American law enforcement through high-tech interactive exhibits, historical and contemporary artifact collections, a dedicated space for research, and diverse educational programming. The public review process to authorize construction at the site took five years.<ref name=wp1015/> On October 14, 2010, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]], Homeland Security Secretary [[Janet Napolitano]] and others broke ground on the construction of the museum.<ref name=wp1015>{{cite news|title=Law enforcement museum is on track|work=Washington Post|date=October 15, 2010|first=Jaqueline|last=Trescott|page=C5}}</ref>  As of October 2012, over $58 million in private donations have been raised.<ref name=wp1015/>

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=4120sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4120 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4120|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> 

The bill would amend the [[National Law Enforcement Museum Act]] to extend by three years the authority to construct the [[National Law Enforcement Museum]].<ref name="4120sum"/>

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on April 9, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=cbo4120>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4120|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45283|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> 

H.R. 4120 would extend until November 9, 2016, the authority of the [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund]], a nonprofit organization, to construct a museum on federal lands within the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] honoring law enforcement officers. The [[authorization bill|authorization]] to construct the museum expired on November 9, 2013. Because the museum would be established with nonfederal funds, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4120 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 4120 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.<ref name="cbo4120"/>

H.R. 4120 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]].<ref name="cbo4120"/>

==Procedural history==
H.R. 4120 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on February 28, 2014 by [[Steny Hoyer|Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D, MD-5)]].<ref name=4120allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4120 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4120/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation]]. It was reported by the committee on April 28, 2014, alongside [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt421/CRPT-113hrpt421.pdf House Report 113-421].<ref name="4120allactions"/> On April 28, 2014, the House voted in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll179.xml Roll Call Vote 179] to pass the bill 384-0.<ref name="4120allactions"/><ref name="Housevotes28"/> On May 5, 2014, the [[United States Senate]] voted by [[unanimous consent]] to pass the bill.
