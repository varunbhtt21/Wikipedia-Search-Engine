The '''Russian Chapel in Darmstadt''', formally, the St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, is a historic [[Russian orthodox church]] in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]].

The [[Russian Revival architecture|Russian revival]] style church with gold [[Onion dome]]s was built between 1897-1899 by the architect [[Leon Benois]], and used as a private chapel by the last [[Tsar]] of Russia, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], whose wife [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Alexandra]] was born in Darmstadt. It is named in honor of the patron saint of Tsar Nicholas' mother. It was built of Russian stone and, as some people claim, built on soil from Russia brought to Darmstadt by train, and used during their lifetimes by the Russian royal family and court during regular visits to the Tsarina's childhood home and to her family.<ref>[http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/engdocuments/enart_churches.html]</ref>

Even though there have been many historical Eastern orthodox churches in diverse regions of Western and Central Europe, it has been stated by some that it had been the only one [[Tsar Nicholas II|Nicholas II]] would have ever entered and attended outside of Russia, being a favorite of Nicholas II for his visits to Germany. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
