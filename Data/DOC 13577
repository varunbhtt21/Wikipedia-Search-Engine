{{Japanese name|Minamoto}}
{{Nihongo|'''Minamoto no Michichika'''|源 通親||1149 – November 7, 1202}} was a Japanese noble and statesman of the late [[Heian period]] and early [[Kamakura period]]. Serving in the courts of seven different emperors, he brought the [[Murakami Genji]] to the peak of their success. He is also commonly known as {{Nihongo|'''Tsuchimikado Motochika'''|土御門 通親}}, and in [[Sōtō]] Zen buddhism as {{Nihongo|'''Koga no Michichika'''|久我 通親}}.

== Life ==

=== Aide to Emperor Takakura ===
Born the heir of the [[Murakami Genji]] branch of the [[Minamoto clan]] in 1149, and in 1158 was granted the {{Nihongo|[[Ritsuryō#Establishment of court rank|lower junior fifth rank]]|従五位下}}, via the Minamoto family head's prerogative to thus promote one individual each year. The Murakami Genji had previously enjoyed prosperity as the maternal relatives of [[Emperor Horikawa]], but after this were pushed back by descendants of [[Fujiwara no Kinsue]]'s branch of the [[Fujiwara clan]], the {{Nihongo|Kan'in-ryū|閑院流}}. Michichika's father Masamichi served [[Fujiwara no Nariko|Bitokumon-in]] during [[Emperor Toba]]'s cloistered rule, but changed his role under the cloistered rule of [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]]. In 1168, when Go-Shirakawa's wife {{Interlanguage link multi|Taira no Shigeko|ja|3=平滋子}} became ''[[kōtaigō]]'', Masamichi became {{Nihongo|director of the Kōtaigō's Quarters|皇太后宮大夫}}. Michichika was permitted entry into the court along with [[Emperor Takakura]]'s ascension in the same year, serving as a close aid to the young emperor. Michichika's first wife was a daughter of the ''[[daijō-daijin]]'' {{Interlanguage link multi|Fujiwara no Tadamasa|ja|3=藤原忠雅}}, but he soon took a daughter of [[Taira clan|Taira]] no [[Taira no Norimori|Norimori]] or [[Taira no Michimori|Michimori]] as his second wife, strengthening his ties with that powerful clan.

In 1179, Michichika became head of the [[Kurōdo-dokoro]], and in 1180 he was promoted both to ''[[sangi (Japan)|sangi]]'', thus joining the ranks of the ''[[kugyō]]'', and to {{Nihongo|provisional lieutenant general of the imperial guard|左近衛権中将}}. After [[Taira no Kiyomori]]'s [[coup d'etat]] in late 1179, Emperor Takakura reluctantly abdicated the throne to begin his own cloistered rule, and Michichika supported his inexperienced efforts as head of his cloistered government. Michichika joined the imperial outing to [[Itsukushima]] and relocation of the capital to [[Fukuhara-kyō]] in the first half of the year, but as the country fell into upheaval after the [[Battle of Uji (1180)|first battle of Uji]], he returned to [[Heian-kyō]] in the autumn. The retired emperor Takakura's physical condition worsened and he fell ill. Michichika composed a poem praying for his recovery, but in 1181, Takakura died at 21 years old. As a close attendant of the dead sovereign, Michichika was bestowed an undyed white mourning dress. Lamenting the death of his longtime master, he recorded his plaintive feelings in the {{Nihongo||高倉院昇霞記|Takakura-in Shōkaki}}.

=== Genpei War ===
Shortly thereafter Taira no Kiyomori died and Go-Shirakawa reopened his cloistered rule, and the center of power continued to change at a dizzying pace. Meanwhile, Michichika avoided relying on the patronage of any particular power, but participated passionately in debates at Go-Shirakawa's palace and worked diligently at the business of government, increasing his presence in the court. When the Taira clan fled the capital in 1183, he went visited Go-Shirakawa in order to bid them farewell. When [[Emperor Go-Toba]] took the throne in the next month, the Imperial Regalia were in the possession of the Taira. Michichika raised the examples of [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] and [[Emperor Yuan of Jin]], who obtained their imperial seals only after assuming the throne, in order to help Go-Toba ascend smoothly.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:玉葉 |trans-title=Gyokuyō ([[Kujō Kanezane]]'s diary) |chapter=寿永2年8月19日条 |trans-chapter=Juei 2, Month 8, Day 19 |language=Japanese}}</ref> He was present at [[Hōjūjidono]] during the [[Siege of Hōjūjidono]] that autumn.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:吉記 |trans-title=Kikki (Yoshida Tsunefusa's diary) |chapter=寿永2年11月19日条 |trans-chapter=Juei 2, Month 11, Day 19 |language=Japanese}}</ref>

Michichika's loyalty was recognized, and in spring of 1185 he was promoted to provisional ''[[chūnagon]]'', and that winter was appointed as one of ten ministers appointed to oversee the court, called {{Nihongo||議奏|gisō}}. He was granted [[Inaba Province]] as a fief and recommended his second son {{Interlanguage link multi|Horikawa Michitomo|ja|3=堀川通具}} as its [[Kokushi (official)|governor]]. He married Emperor Go-Toba's wetnurse, {{Interlanguage link multi|Fujiwara no Hanshi|ja|3=藤原範子}}, and adopted her daughter {{Interlanguage link multi|Minamoto no Zaishi|ja|3=源在子}}. As Michichika headed the event teams for [[Kujō Kanezane]]'s proclamations as ''[[nairan]]'' and head of the ''[[sekkan]]'' [[Fujiwara clan]], and Kanezane praised Michichika's hard work in turn, the relationship between the two appears to have been healthy at the time. Under Kanezane's conservative administration, though, Michichika's promotion stalled. In 1188, Michichika protested against the promotion of Kanezane's younger and less experienced son [[Kujō Yoshitsune]] over him to the {{Nihongo|senior second rank|正二位}}, requesting that he too be promoted. Kanezane criticized Michichika harshly, calling him ungrateful for his promotion to {{Nihongo|junior second rank|従二位}} the previous year, and in this no different from a bird or animal.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:玉葉 |trans-title=Gyokuyō (Kujō Kanezane's diary) |chapter=文治4年正月7日条 |trans-chapter=Bunji 4, Month 1, Day 7 |language=Japanese}}</ref> After this, their relationship soured, and Michichika began to look for an opportunity to take Kanezane down.

=== Guardian to Senyōmon-in ===
In late 1189, Michichika invited Go-Shirakawa to the Koga estate and presented him with various gifts. A month and a half later, Go-Shirakawa's youngest daughter {{Interlanguage link multi|Princess Kinshi|ja|3=覲子内親王}} was proclaimed an imperial princess, and Michichika was appointed as her guardian, strengthening his relationship with her birth mother {{Interlanguage link multi|Takashina no Eishi|ja|3=高階栄子}}. In 1191, Princess Kinshi was bestowed the Buddhist name of {{Nihongo|Senyōmon-in|宣陽門院}}, and Michichika became the steward of her household, appointing his sons Michitomo and Michimune to positions within it. When Go-Shirakawa died in 1192, it was Senyōmon-in who inherited his largest territory {{Nihongo|Chōkōdō-ryō|長講堂領}}, and as Michichika was its effective manager, he brought the courtiers in control of it into his jurisdiction, forming a strong political foothold for himself.

When [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] entered the capital in 1190, Michichika remembered to curry favor with him by acting as event manager for his appointment to {{Nihongo|general of the imperial guard|右近衛大将}}, but also planned to strengthen his relationship with Yoritomo's confidant [[Ōe no Hiromoto]]. In 1191, he broke with tradition by appointing Hiromoto as a {{Nihongo|professor|明法博士}} in the ''[[Daigaku-ryō]]'' and {{Nihongo|captain in the imperial guard|左衛門大尉}}.

After Go-Shirakawa's death, Kujō Kanezane controlled the court through the young Emperor Go-Toba, but his strict adherence to tradition and stress on lineage in personnel affairs fostered opposition amongst the middle and lower ranking nobles, and he gradually lost popularity in the court. Michichika won over the noble families of [[Fujiwara no Akisue]] and the {{Nihongo|Kashūji-ryū|勧修寺流}} branch of the Fujiwara, who Kanezane had treated coldly, as allies. Meanwhile, he used Takashina no Eishi as an intermediary to alienate Yoritomo, who wanted to marry his daughter [[Ō-hime]] to the Emperor, from Kanezane, who had already married his own daughter [[Kujō Ninshi]] to said emperor. In 1195, Michichika was promoted to ''[[dainagon]]'', and when his adopted daughter Zaishi bore the Emperor a prince, the future [[Emperor Tsuchimikado]], his position in the court suddenly solidified. In 1196, he made Kujō Ninshi leave the palace and overthrew Kanezane, replacing him with [[Konoe Motomichi]] in a coup d'etat.

=== Minamoto Hakuriku ===
In 1198, Michichika forced the enthronement of Emperor Tsuchimikado against both precedent and the opposition of the shogunate. Though Michichika tried to use the case of [[Emperor Kōnin]] as a precedent for the sudden enthronement, [[Fujiwara no Teika]] scathingly commented "If Tsuchimikado is Kōnin, then who is [[Dōkyō]]?"<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:明月記 |trans-title=Meigetsuki ([[Fujiwara no Teika]]'s diary) |chapter=建久9年正月11日条 |trans-chapter=Kenkyū 9, Month 1, Day 11 |language=Japanese}}</ref> After this, Michichika reached the height of his power as the Emperor's maternal grandfather, and was called {{Nihongo|Minamoto Hakuriku|源博陸}}.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:玉葉 |trans-title=Gyokuyō (Kujō Kanezane's diary) |chapter=建久9年正月7日条 |trans-chapter=Kenkyū 9, Month 1, Day 7 |language=Japanese}}</ref> The term "Hakuriku" here refers to the position of [[kampaku]], although Michichika himself never officially held the title.

In 1199, Michichika became a {{Nihongo|general of the imperial guard|右近衛大将}}. He tried to lessen the shogunate's opposition by appointing the heir [[Minamoto Yoriie]] as {{Nihongo|lieutenant general of the imperial guard|左近衛中将}}, but shortly thereafter received news that Yoritomo had fallen seriously ill. Once Yoritomo's death was publicly announced, it would become necessary to delay Yoriie's promotion, and so Michichika hurriedly conducted both appointments in a simplified fashion. Teika once again criticized Michichika for enforcing the appointment while knowing of Yoritomo's demise and then expressing his condolences and making a show of mourning the next day, calling this an "egregious plot".<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:明月記 |trans-title=Meigetsuki (Fujiwara no Teika's diary) |chapter=正治元年正月22日条 |trans-chapter=Shōji 1, Month 1, Day 22 |language=Japanese}}</ref> Yoritomo's death upset the political situation, and in the capital {{Interlanguage link multi|Ichijō Yoshiyasu|ja|3=一条能保}} plotted an attack on Michichika, forcing him to hide in the retired emperor's palace. Executives of the shogunate, with Ōe no Hiromoto at the center, supported Michichika, suppressing the movement to remove him and restoring peace to the capital.

Michichika made various preparations, rebuilding Tsuchimikado's palace and adding a gate,<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:明月記 |trans-title=Meigetsuki (Fujiwara no Teika's diary) |chapter=正治元年6月19日条 |trans-chapter=Shōji 1, Month 6, Day 19 |language=Japanese}}</ref> and that summer was promoted to ''[[naidaijin]]''. While respecting the viewpoint of the now-mature retired emperor Go-Toba, Michichika placed Kujō Yoshitsune as ''[[sadaijin]]'' and [[Konoe Iezane]] as ''[[udaijin]]'' to preserve peace between and with both families. Since both were still young, Michichika was effectively in control of the [[Daijō-kan]]. Around this time, he also married [[Fujiwara no Motofusa]]'s daughter Ishi.

In 1200 Go-Toba's third son Prince Morinari, the future [[Emperor Juntoku]], became crown prince. Michichika became his {{Nihongo|tutor|東宮傅}}, while his brother-in-law {{Nihongo|Fujiwara Terumitsu|藤原範光}} became {{Nihongo|vice-steward of the Crown Prince's Quarters|春宮亮}}, and his heir {{Nihongo|Minamoto Michiteru|源通光}} provisionally assumed the same title, filling the Crown Prince's Quarters with the Murakami Genji and his Fujiwara relatives. Even 1202 he appeared vigorous, acting as event manager when his adopted daughter Zaishi received the Buddhist name {{Nihongo|Shōmeimon-in|承明門院}}, and welcoming Go-Toba to a palace built by his sworn friend {{Interlanguage link multi|Fujiwara no Muneyori|ja|3=藤原宗頼}}, but he suddenly died that autumn at age 54. When Konoe Iezane heard of his death, he recorded in his diary that Michichika had handled all the business of government,<ref>{{cite book |script-title=ja:猪隈関白記 |trans-title=[[Konoe Iezane]]'s diary |language=Japanese}}</ref> and the court granted him the posthumous {{Nihongo|junior first rank|従一位}}. Go-Toba was also said to have expressed his sorrow by stopping holding poetry contests. After Michichika's death, there was nobody left who could dissuade Go-Toba, and he began his cloistered rule in earnest.

Michichika was also a skilled poet and also served in the {{Nihongo||和歌所|waka-dokoro}}, where he led the planning for a new poetry collection that would later become the ''[[Shin Kokin Wakashū]]''. However, he died without seeing its completion. That collection, along with many others, includes some of Michichika's ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]''.

== Famous works ==
{{Nihongo||高倉院厳島御幸記|Takakura-in Itsukushima Gokōki}}, written in 1180, is Michichika's travel diary from retired Emperor Takakura's Imperial visit to [[Itsukushima]] in [[Aki Province]]. {{Nihongo||高倉院昇霞記|Takakura-in Shōkaki}}, written in 1181, records the state of affairs at the time of Emperor Takakura's death and mourns him. Both are written in a mix of [[kana]] and [[kanji]], as is modern Japanese. The two together are known as {{Nihongo|"Minamoto no Michichika's Diaries"|源通親日記}}.

Michichika's eldest son Michimune rose to the {{Nihongo|lower senior fourth rank|正四位下}} and position of ''[[Sangi (Japan)|sangi]]'', as well as {{Nihongo|lieutenant general in the imperial guard|左中将}}, but in 1198 he died at the age of 31. However, Michimune's daughter {{Nihongo|Minamoto no Tsūshi|源通子}} and [[Emperor Tsuchimikado]]'s son became [[Emperor Go-Saga]], and so Michichika's family gained the position of maternal relatives to both Tsuchimikado and Go-Saga.

Later, the [[Saionji family]] rose to power, and Michichika's clan never regained the stature it had during his life. Even so, his children Michitomo, Michiteru, Sadamichi, and Michikata split the family into the Horikawa clan, [[Koga clan]], Tsuchimikado clan, and Nakanoin clan. The Horikawa and Tsuchimikado clans died out in the [[Muromachi period]], but the Koga and Nakanoin families persisted until the [[Meiji restoration]], joining the ''[[Kazoku]]'' peerage upon its creation. Meanwhile, the Nakanoin clan produced its own branch family in the {{Nihongo|Kitabatake clan|北畠家}}, while the Koga went on to spawn the {{Nihongo|Iwakura clan|岩倉家}}.

Michichika's most famous descendant was the Zen monk [[Dōgen]], who returned from [[Song dynasty]] and created the [[Sōtō school]] 24 years after Michichika's death.

Michichika's adopted son [[Shōkū]] became a disciple of [[Hōnen]], and became the founder of the [[Seizan]] sub-sect of [[Jōdo-shū]] buddhism.
