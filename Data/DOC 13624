From 1891 to 1895, he learned the craft of wood and stone sculpture in [[Partenkirchen]]. In [[Munich]], he worked with Joseph Flossmann. Then Hitzberger worked under George of Hauberrisser at Munich New Town Hall as a stonemason.

He perfected his skills as a wood sculptor at an old church sculptor in the [[Württemberg]] town of [[Sussenguth|Sussen]]. He worked throughout Germany, followed by Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In all these countries he worked in many studios and workshops. In 1910 he was again briefly in Partenkirchen, after which he lived for three years in southern Africa,  where he worked on altar figures for Boer churches, and cabinets and door panels for farm-houses.

In 1914 he returned to Germany, after Berlin, where he became head of the workshop until 1917 Josef Wackerles was. 1917 he was appointed by [[Bruno Paul]] to head the wood and stone sculpture class at the educational institutions of the [[Berlin Museum of Decorative Arts]]. 1924, with the union of the higher schools of art  Hitzberger moved to [[Charlottenburg]] as head of a training workshop for wood and stone sculpture. He held this office until 1943.
