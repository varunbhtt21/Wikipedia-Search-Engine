==Basic information==

[http://en.wikichecker.com/user/?l=all&t=DPeterson Comprehensive edits analysis]</br>

===Targeted areas, pages, themes===
<!-- Indicate WHAT they attack here -->

The sock operator primarily targets articles related to [[Attachment therapy]] and [[Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy]] (where there seems to be a severe conflict of interest), and more broadly to therapies and mental health generally. 

The sock-operator also branches out to, and socks on, a wide range of other articles. So he is potentially active and socking at any place that he chooses on the wiki, and engages in sneaky editing at times. Areas where an interest develops may be returned to in future socking. Sock operator is also tendentious and re-socks (attempts to sneak back and reinstate preferred views) repeatedly over many years - we're up to about 10 years now as of 2016 and 100+ socks.

===Habitual behavior===
<!-- Indicate HOW they attack here, in general terms. Username patterns go here.-->
<!-- Give broad indications, do NOT provide "giveaways" 
     if they would help evade detection. -->
The sock operator '''promotes papers, writings, therapies, and "institutes" related to "A. Weidman" or "A. Becker-Weidman", or to attachment therapy generally'''.  The promotion includes
:* adds cites to '''poor value or dubious material supporting POV''' (particularly Weidman and Hughes' papers), 
:* adds material '''raising the apparent status''' of Attachment, or other therapies and perspectives linked to it, 
:* adds and edit wars to keep articles, links and mentions of '''(usually non-notable) organizations''' run or related to the same real-world interests, 
:* targets and edit wars also other articles where the sock operator '''inserts or biases towards his/her own view on therapy and mental health, often inappropriately and sometimes flagrantly misleadingly''', apparently also for promotion purposes. 
:* uses both accounts and IPs.

As well, the sock operator adds '''[[WP:BLP|negative BLP]] which denigrates, attacks or damages professional opponents''', and '''removes links and cites to valid material he would prefer readers not to find'''. In this area he targets two real world "opponents", Jean Mercer and Larry Sarner, and their organization Advocates for Children in Therapy (ACT) . (I am sure from prior contact they will not mind their names being mentioned here for this purpose - please remove if wrong). Examples include negative BLP claims, claims of non-professional standing, etc. He also '''vandalizes external links and citations slightly to prevent users seeing sources''' containing criticism or undesired coverage.

Finally he is somewhat prone to posting cites and claims in articles, and in editor debate, that when checked by uninvolved editors, turn out to be '''unsupported by or contradicted by the actual "source" link provided, or are simply fabricated or mis-stated'''. Sock operator sometimes attacks other editors this way, and makes claims about their wiki conduct, that are unsubstantiated when checked - in some cases uses drama, dirt throwing and socking to try and get his way.

===Cases ===
<!-- ABUSE, SPI, ANI, RFAR, and other major threads/subpages that provide useful background -->
Main links:

* [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Attachment_Therapy|RFAR/Attachment Therapy]]: banned 1 year (especially [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Attachment_Therapy/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_.7BFT2.7D|FT2 evidence section]])
* [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive318#AWeidman_.2F_DPeterson_-_block_and_proposed_ban|Community ban]] shortly after, when he continued to [[WP:BATTLE]] on-wiki via talk pages of opponents, in the face of an imminent AC ban decision
* [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/DPeterson]]
* For completeness there was [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/AWeidman|an informative SSP]] and then [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/AWeidman|an RFCU]] (predecessors to SPI) for [[User:AWeidman]] that was overtaken by the RFAR case, as well as [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive277#FT2.2C_Attachment_Therapy_Advocates_for_Children_in_Therapy_and_block_of_User:DPeterson|a short ANI thread]] exemplifying quite well the "throw mud" issue.
* Socks blocked in 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and probably quite a few others, see SPI archive.

===Other notes===
<!-- Any other notes go here. Edit filters applied also go here. -->
There are other giveaways; users experienced in this case include any admins listed at the SPI case history who have blocked him, but if it's not a [[WP:DUCK]] then the functionaries list and also admins [[User:Fainites|Fainites]] and [[User:FT2|FT2]] know a lot more of the case and sock background.

Due to range of articles attacked, do not assume the visible socks are the only socks.
