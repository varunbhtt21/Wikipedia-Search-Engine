'''J.D Birla Institute''' ('''JDBI''') Kolkata is a private unaided college affiliated to [[Jadavpur University]], Kolkata. The late Sushila Devi Birla, wife of eminent industrialist late L. N. Birla established a college for girls in her mother-in-lawâ€™s name in June 1962. The college was named Smt. Jawahari Devi Birla Institute of Home Science and it filled a much-felt gap in the scientific education of young women from Kolkata's conservative families. Over four decades, the Institute has grown with the needs and demands of the changing times. A Department of Commerce was added in 1997 in tune with the shifting zeitgeist; a satellite campus was started in 2002 to house the co-educational Department of Management. At this time, the name of the institution was simplified to J. D. Birla Institute. In the year 2009, four new professionally oriented under-graduate courses were introduced apart from two new post-graduate courses. Today, the Institute provides both graduate and post-graduate degrees.

The Institute and all its departments are affiliated to Jadavpur University which has an A grade rating (CGPA of 3.61) from NAAC. The courses offered by the Institute are exclusive and no other Jadavpur University affiliate can offer the B.Sc (Honours), B.Com (Honours) and BBA (Honours) courses that are conducted at the Institute's two premises.
