It's a real singalong number, and I can't wait to play it on tour next year!."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a540077/shane-filan-unveils-knee-deep-in-my-heart-music-video-watch.html#~oCLxpRHDuB4Sag |title=Shane Filan unveils 'Knee Deep In My Heart' music video - watch |accessdate=2014-07-15|publisher=DigitalSpy.co.uk}}</ref>

Filan's wife Gillian and his three children all feature in the music video for the single. The video was set in the English countryside and shows Shane driving past rolling hills in a vintage car before arriving at a friend's wedding. All the while, the singer is waxing lyrical about a love who stole his heart. Despite being set in the UK, the video is trying to channel the spirit of a traditional Irish wedding, complete with a traditional band. Filan was joined by several members of his family and friends for the reception scenes where the wedding party continues. His wife Gillian can be seen spinning around on the dance floor wearing a pretty frock. Meanwhile, his children feature prominently. The drummer in the video is also a family friend as are several of the other participants. The music Video also features Linedance instructor Maggie Gallagher and her dance troupe Celtica from [[Coventry]]. After missing the wedding, the singer arrives in his car before taking to the stage and performing at the wedding reception. The video is set in the summer time and sees Filan enjoying a few pints of Guinness with his pals before dancing the night away and singing his heart out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/inspired-by-one-d-family-at-heart-of-shane-filans-new-video-29895090.html |title=Inspired by One D?
