the link tells you nothing, other then he is a ref, but nothing about his career or anything (I did misread one part and thought it said a decent referee though) anyway I think this needs more info.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:59, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - fails [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 11:55, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - non-notable ref. no indication of GNG, does not appear to have refereed any continental or international matches. [[User:Fenix down|Fenix down]] ([[User talk:Fenix down|talk]]) 12:12, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - as unverified. If the content of the article is true and he is in fact a FIFA listed referee, the article meets [[WP:NSPORT]], but at present that claim is not supported by reliable sources. [[User:Sir Sputnik|Sir Sputnik]] ([[User talk:Sir Sputnik|talk]]) 04:31, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Not enough coverage in reliable sources. [[User:Narutolovehinata5|Narutolovehinata5]] <sup>[[User talk:Narutolovehinata5|t]][[Special:Contributions/Narutolovehinata5|c]][[WP:CSD|csd]][[Special:Newpages|new]]</sup> 07:59, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
