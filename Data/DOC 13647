'''Erik Holmberg''' (13 November 1908 â€“ 1 February 2000) was a Swedish astronomer and cosmologist. He is most famous for his work in the effects of [[interacting galaxies]]. This research showed that galaxies that came near each other would likely combine to form a larger galaxy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.uu.se/history/holmberg.html|title=Erik Holmberg (1908-2000)|website=www.astro.uu.se}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1908, Holmberg was born to Malcolm and Anna Holmberg in Skillingaryd, Sweden. In 1947 he married Martha Asdahl.

==Scientific work==
In 1941, Holmberg published the works of an experiment to study the effects of interacting galaxies. In order to simulate the effect, he constructed an array of 37 lightbulbs. Using photocells, he measured the simulated force of gravity. Over time, the galaxies moved closer toward each other. He also concluded in a later experiment that [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] are generally older than [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], among other discoveries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/Holmberg.html|title=Holmberg, Erik Bertil (1908-2000)|first=David|last=Darling|website=www.daviddarling.info}}</ref>
