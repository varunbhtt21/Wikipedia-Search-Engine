Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
|Description = Photograph by photographer, Stan Musilek, for Absolut Vodka, depicting the famously polluted Los Angeles River as a beautiful and inviting place for recreation.
|Source = '''Original publication''': In print ads by the Absolut Vodka company.<br/>
'''Immediate source:''' www.musilek.com
|Date = 2007
|Author = Stan Musilek
|Article = Stan Musilek
|Purpose = The photograph illustrates descriptions in the article about the photographer's working method (using digital post-production), and style ("featuring a world that is close to perfect"). The photograph is also referred to in one of the article's quotations and therefore helps readers to understand better the content of the article. The purpose of the photograph is to clarify for readers what the words describe.
|Replaceability = Another free illustration cannot be used because this article is about the specific photographer that produced the photograph. The photograph therefore is not replaceable, and no replacement exists or could be created.
|Minimality = This photograph illustrates the working method of the photographer, described in a quote in the article. Because the article refers to visual images, the photograph contributes to the article by showing what cannot be conveyed in words. The jpeg is of low enough resolution, that copies made from it would be of too inferior a quality to be pirated for other uses.
|Commercial = Because the file size is so small that it cannot be pirated for other uses. Also because the photograph's appearance in the wikipedia article is for illustrative purposes and not for re-sale.
