The '''Sambisa Forest''' is a forest in [[Borno State]], northeast [[Nigeria]]. It is in the southwestern part of [[Chad Basin National Park]], about {{convert|60|km|mi}} southeast of [[Maiduguri]], the capital of [[Borno State]].

==Geography==
The Sambisa forest is located at the northeastern tip of the west [[Sudanian Savanna]] and the southern boundary of the [[Sahel]] Acacia Savanna about 60&nbsp;km. south east of [[Maiduguri]] the capital of the state of Borno.<ref name=nation>Kayode, Bodumin (27 April 2014) [http://thenationonlineng.net/new/sambisa-forest-of-a-thousand-myths "Sambisa: Forest of a thousand myths"], thenationonlineng.net; retrieved 29 April 2015.</ref> It occupies parts of the states of [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Yobe]], [[Gombe State, Nigeria|Gombe]], [[Bauchi]] along the corridor [[Darazo]], [[Jigawa]], and some parts of [[Kano state]] farther north.<ref name=nation/><ref name=guardian/> It is administered by the [[Local government areas of Nigeria]] of [[Askira/Uba]] in the south, by [[Damboa]] in the southwest, and by [[Konduga]] and [[Jere, Nigeria|Jere]] in the west.<ref name=nation/>

The name of the forest comes from the village of Sambisa which is on the border with Gwoza in the East. The Gwoza hills in the East have peaks of 1,300 meters above sea level and form part of the [[Mandara Mountains]] range along the Cameroon-Nigeria border.<ref name=guardian/> The forest is drained by seasonal streams into the [[Chad Basin|Yedseram]] and the [[Ngadda River]]s.<ref name=JRFWE>Mbaya, Y.P. and Malgwi, H. (March 2010) [http://www.ajol.info/index.php/jrfwe/article/view/82370/72525 Species list and status of Mammals and Birds in Sambisa game reserve, Borno State, Nigeria] Journal of Research in Forestry, Wildlife and Environment, Vol 2, no 1, p. 135</ref><ref name=MIKE/>

==Climate==
The climate is hot, dry and wet with minimum temperatures of about 21.5&nbsp;°C between December and February, a maximum of about 48&nbsp;°C in May and average temperatures of about 28-29&nbsp;°C. The dry season is from November to May and the wet season is between May and September/October with annual rainfall of about 190&nbsp;mm.<ref name=JRFWE/><ref name=MIKE/>

==Flora==
The Sambisa forest is one of the few forests in North Eastern Nigeria where sparse vegetation is the norm.  Most of the vegetation is typical of the [[Sudanian Savanna]] although, because of human activity, some parts have become more like the [[Sahel]] savanna. The forest consists of a mixture of open woodland and sections of very dense vegetation of short trees about two metres high and thorny bushes, with a height of 1/2-1 metre, which are difficult to penetrate.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|first1=Bodunrin|last1=Kayode|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/29/nigeria-sambisa-forest-boko-haram-hideout-kidnapped-school-girls-believed-to-be-held|title=Inside Nigeria's Sambisa Forest|date=29 April 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref> Major trees and bushes in the forest include [[Detarium microcarpum|tallow]], [[rubber]], [[Vitex|wild black plum]], [[African birch|birch]], [[date palm]], [[Prosopis africana|mesquite]], [[acacia]], [[Piliostigma thonningii|monkey bread]], [[Combretum apiculatum|red bushwillow]], [[African baobab|baobab]], [[Diospyros mespiliformis|jackalberry]], [[tamarind]] and [[Terminalia (plant)|terminalia]].<ref name=BirdLI/>

==Fauna==
[[BirdLife International]] reported that 62 species of birds have been recorded in the Sambisa Game Reserve,<ref name=BirdLI>(2015) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=6757 Sambisa Game Reserve] Birdlife International; retrieved 29 April 2015.</ref> including the [[guinea fowl]], [[francolin]], [[village weaver]], [[Abyssinian ground hornbill]], [[Arabian bustard]], [[Savile's bustard]], [[African collared-dove]], [[chestnut-bellied starling]], [[black scrub-robin]] and the [[Sudan golden sparrow]]. The forest was also thought to be the last remaining site of the [[ostrich]] in Nigeria.<ref name =BirdLI/>

17 species of mammals were reported in 2010 in the Sambisa Game Reserve<ref name=JRFWE/> including, [[baboon]], [[patas monkey]], [[tantalus monkey]], [[Sylvicapra grimmia|Grimm's duiker]], [[red-fronted gazelle]], [[African bush elephant]], [[roan antelope]], [[hartebeest]], [[African leopard]] and [[spotted hyena]]s. However poaching, chopping downing trees for fuel, human agricultural penetration<ref name=JRFWE/> and the [[Boko Haram]] [[jihadist]] group's activities since 2013<ref name=guardian/> have reduced their numbers since then.<ref name=thisdaylive/> An aerial survey of the game reserve in 2006 reported seeing only five large wild animal species.<ref name=MIKE/>

==Sambisa Game Reserve==
During the colonial period, the Sambisa game reserve covered an area of {{Convert|2258|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} in the eastern part of the forest.<ref name=thisdaylive/> Later reports put the size of the game reserve at 518 square kilometers,<ref name=JRFWE/> or 686 square kilometers<ref name=BirdLI/> although some official documents included the Marguba Forest Reserve in the Sambisa Game Reserve.<ref name=MIKE>Omondi, P., et al, (6 July 2006) [http://www.cites.org/common/prog/mike/survey/0607_FW_AT_Survey_Sambisa_big.pdf Total Aerial Count of Elephants and other Wildlife Species in Sambisa Game Reserve in Borno State, Nigeria] per MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) Program (cites.org); retrieved 3 April 2015.</ref>

From 1970, the reserve was used for safaris. It had a large population of leopards, lions, elephants, hyenas, that tourists could observe from cabins or safari lodges. In 1991, the government of the state of Borno incorporated this reserve into the national park of the Chad Basin. But the abandonment of its management, following the Sambisa takeover by Boko Haram insurgents in February 2013, led to the gradual disappearance of animals, lodges collapsed or were destroyed, vegetation invaded roads, and rivers dried up.<ref name=thisdaylive>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/sambisa-forest-from-nature-conservation-to-terrorists-haven/178216|title=Sambisa Forest From Nature Conservation to Terrorists Haven|date=10 May 2014|publisher=thisdaylive.com|access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref>

==Boko Haram conflict==
The Sambisa forest, especially the mountainous region of Gwoza near the Cameroon border, is used as shelter by the jihadist [[Boko Haram]] group and is believed to be where they keep the hostages from the [[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping]] in April 2014.<ref name=thisdaylive/><ref>{{cite web|last=Kayode|first=Bodunrin|title=Inside Nigeria's Sambisa forest, the Boko Haram hideout where kidnapped school girls are believed to be held|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/29/nigeria-sambisa-forest-boko-haram-hideout-kidnapped-school-girls-believed-to-be-held|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Okonkwo|first=Emeka|title=US Marines, Satellite locate missing girls in Sambisa forest|publisher=The Herald (Nigeria)|date=10 May  2014|url=http://www.theheraldng.com/us-marines-satellite-locate-missing-girls-sambisa-forest-bringbackourgirls|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="BBC: 18 May 2016">{{cite web|title=Chibok girls: Kidnapped schoolgirl found in Nigeria|publisher=BBC|date= 18 May 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36321249|accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref>

During spring 2015 the [[Nigerian Army]] started an offensive against Boko Haram in the forest, but was slowed down due to finding the forest to be heavily [[land mine|mined]] and the militants having better local knowledge.<ref>Oladipo, Tomi (24 April 2015) [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32435614 Analysis: Islamic State strengthens ties with Boko Haram], BBC News; retrieved 29 April 2015.</ref> Despite this, on 28 April 2015, four Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa forest were overrun by the Nigerian military who freed nearly 300 girls and women,<ref>(29 April 2015) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32506942 Nigerian army 'rescues nearly 300' from Sambisa Forest], BBC News Africa; retrieved 29 April 2015.</ref> who were not, however, the missing Chibok girls. On 30 April 2015 another 13 Boko Haram camps were destroyed and 234 more women and children were reportedly freed near [[Kawuri massacre|Kawuri]] and [[Konduga]].<ref>(2 May 2015) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32561052 Boko Haram: Nigerian army frees another 234 women and children], BBC News, Africa; retrieved 2 May 2015.</ref>

The [[Nigerian Army]] Wednesday night 4 November 2015, said troops of 5 Brigade Task Group, killed two Boko Haram suspects, after destroying their camps at Hausari and Baranga in Marte Local Government Area of [[Borno State]]. According to official statement by the military, "In efforts to continually dominate recovered territories and clear all Nigerian territory of Boko Haram vestiges, the advancing troops of 5 Brigade Task Group have today cleared 5 more terrorists camps at Hausari and Baranga in Marte Local Government Area of Borno State."<ref>salisu Idris (November 4, 2015) Troops kill two Boko Haram suspects [https://www.today.ng/news/33867/troops-kill-two-boko-haram-suspects-army] today News, (Nigeria); Retrieved 4 November 2015</ref>

On 18 May 2016, one of the schoolgirls abducted from Chibok in 2014, was reportedly found by local militia men fighting Boko Haram in the Sambisa forest. It was also reported that 218 of the girls were still missing and that the found girl claimed that except six, said to have died, all of them were still held captive in the forest.<ref name="BBC: 18 May 2016" />
