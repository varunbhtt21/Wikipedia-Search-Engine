'''''Choreutis tomicodes''''' is a [[moth]] in the family [[Choreutidae]]. It was described by [[Edward Meyrick|Meyrick]] in 1930. It is found on the [[Solomon Islands]].<ref>{{LepIndex |id=120232 |name=Anthophila tomicodes |accessdate=April 29, 2018}}</ref>

The [[wingspan]] is about 14&nbsp;mm. Adults are similar to ''[[Choreutis cyanotoxa]]'', but differs in the absence of the detached dorsal segment of the second blue line of the forewings, which ends at two-thirds from the costa and is connected with the dorsum by a zigzag black line not found in ''cyanotoxa''. Both blue lines are terminated on the costal edge with whitish and the blue discal mark touches the second blue line with its lower end.<ref>[http://www.bhl-europe.eu/static/a070rxzv/a070rxzv_full_ocr.txt Exotic Microlep. 4: 5]</ref>
