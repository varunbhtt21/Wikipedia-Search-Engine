* '''[[:Liberty GB]]''' – This seems to be a rant rather than a reasoned request for review; nor has the requester notified either of the deleting admins. I am closing it on that basis, per [[WP:DRVPURPOSE]]: "Deletion Review should '''not''' be used:.. 8. to attack other editors, cast aspersions, or make accusations of bias (such requests may be speedily closed)." Discussion can proceed on the second request filed on 1 May. – [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 20:22, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

Speedily deleted despite coverage in major media sources. I get it, it's an anti-immigration, anti European union, anti Islam party so we want to censor it, but I don't think closing our eyes to subjects we disagree with is the best way to educate and inform readers. Party was started by the founder of the [[British Freedom Party]] who was also once a UKIP candidate. He and the party are in the news today [http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-27186573 BBC story], but we can't cover the subject because we disagree with their positions. But I get it, some people want to censor this kind of thing so the page is protected and can't even be redirected. But why do we purport to have a not censored policy? Seems dishonest.

Includes otherwise unavailable criticism (by Jimbo Wales, among others) of use of administrative authority regarding a dispute in which I was blocked, if anyone cares about my purpose. Because the block has been brought up regularly in disputes, as recently as last month, and absent any way to expunge or modify the block log, it's unfair to allow only one side of the dispute (primarily) to be accessible. The talk page was deleted after the blocking admin exercised their right to vanish, after Jimbo's criticism. This request applies to the original talk page, not the vandalous creation that was properly deleted a few months later.

*I've been on the receiving end of a bad block myself, and I sympathise.  It's extremely irritating when a sysop screws it up and leaves an utterly indelible mark on your record in the process.  The right to vanish is also important, but when we balance a sysop's right to vanish against a non-sysop user's need to deal with their block log in perpetuity, I think we need to hold the sysop to the higher standard.  I feel we should '''restore''' selected diffs, to the minimum extent necessary to accomplish HW's purpose.  The remainder of the talk page should not be restored.—[[User:S Marshall|<font face="Verdana" color="Maroon">'''S Marshall'''</font>]] <small>[[User talk:S Marshall|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/S Marshall|C]]</small> 11:19, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Restore'''.  It doesn't strike me as unreasonable to undelete selected diffs only and move them somewhere else (Hullaballoo's user space?), so that we have a record of what was said.  [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] <sup>([[User talk:Lankiveil|speak to me]])</sup> 23:10, 2 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Comment'''. There was a quite a lot of maladministration around that time concerning blocking and concomitant out of process [[WP:CSD#U1]] self-deletion of user talk pages. Perhaps this was a case in  point. Not being able to see the deleted page means I can't judge whether anything should be restored and I don't think it is appropriate to ask for temporary undeletion. So, I think someone should do the right thing (though I don't know what that might be!). [[User:Thincat|Thincat]] ([[User talk:Thincat|talk]]) 10:53, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::I've now found the relevant ANI discussions and even (off-site) the user talk page containing Jimbo's remark "... If you do not agree, then the honorable thing to do is to turn in your admin bits ..." which, fortunately, was persuasive. Assuming the ANI, block, and slightly later talk page comments are related (and I think they are) then HW was wronged not only by the block log (which was mildly worded) but by some of the remarks and attitudes in the archived ANI discussions. I have not found any retraction of the allegations against HW but I don't really know where to look. [[User:Thincat|Thincat]] ([[User talk:Thincat|talk]]) 12:31, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*Seems a reasonable request, but I'll defer to those that can see the content. [[User:Hobit|Hobit]] ([[User talk:Hobit|talk]]) 23:55, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
**To clarify: '''restore''' unless there is some significant issue which I can't see. [[User:Hobit|Hobit]] ([[User talk:Hobit|talk]]) 19:57, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*Yes, Hobit makes me realise I should say '''restore''' to, say March 2009 and fully protect. I can see the version of 21 February 2009 (last modified 18 February 2009, at 20:01) and, except for the embarrassment of having Jimbo and others posting reasonably-worded but critical remarks, I see no reason for deletion. It was speedied [[WP:CSD#U1]] on 31 March 2009 by {{u|Dweller}} so some rot may have set in by then. Even for people vanishing their talk pages are MFD'd rather than speedied (though I'm sure there can be sensible exceptions and this may be one of them).
