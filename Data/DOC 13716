An ever-changing but limited variety of products is offered, but the range has decreased since the service was first launched. While selecting items  within the Prime Pantry program, each item lists the percentage of space it will take up inside the delivery box. A running total shows how full this box is. The delivery fee remains the same regardless of the filling percentage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walpole|first=Jennifer|title=Amazon Prime Pantry: order discounted groceries online|url=http://agbeat.com/business-news/amazon-prime-pantry-order-discounted-groceries-online/|publisher=The American Genius|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>
