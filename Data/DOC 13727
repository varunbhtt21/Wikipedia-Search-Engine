'''Lucia Valerio''' ({{IPA-it|luˈtʃiːa vaˈlɛːrjo}}; 28 February 1905 – 26 September 1996) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[female tennis player]] who was active during the late 1920s and the 1930s.

Valerio learned playing tennis from her father and she played on a tennis court at her home. Before settling on tennis she practiced fencing, horse riding and skiing.<ref>{{cite news|title=C' era una volta Lucia la Signora del tennis|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/settembre/27/era_una_volta_Lucia_Signora_co_0_96092712463.shtml|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=27 September 1996|page=44}}</ref> Her favorite strokes were the forehand passing shot and cut service.<ref name=lowe1935>{{cite book|title=Lowe's Lawn Tennis Annual|year=1935|publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode|location=London|page=240}}</ref>

Between 1928 and 1938 she participated in seven [[Wimbledon Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon players archive – Lucia Valerio|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/draws/archive/players/9426d8f6-0fe3-489e-a666-521081f95571/index.html|publisher=AELTC}}</ref> Her best result in the singles event was reaching the quarterfinal of the [[1933 Wimbledon Championships]] in which she was defeated by eventual finalist [[Dorothy Round]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wimbledon draws archive – 1933 Ladies' Singles|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/draws/archive/1933/LS/rQs1.html|publisher=AELTC}}</ref> That same year she partnered with [[Madzy Rollin Couquerque]] to reach the third round of the doubles competition. In 1935 she reached the quarterfinal of the mixed doubles event with [[Don Turnbull (tennis)|Don Turnbull]] which they lost to the first-seeded pair [[Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling|Hilde Spehrling]] and [[Gottfried Von Cramm]].

In 1930 Valerio played against [[Phyllis Satterthwaite]] in the final of the [[Bordighera]] tournament on the Italian Riviera. Satterthwaite was a baseline player with a game based on safety and keeping the ball in play. At match point her determination not to make an error resulted in a rally which lasted 450 strokes. Satterthwaite won the point and the match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two thousand strokes - one point|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/mar/27/tennis.comment|publisher=The Guardian|author=Jon Henderson|date=27 March 2005}}</ref>

At the [[French Open|French Championships]] she reached the quarterfinal in 1931 and 1934. In 1935 she lost the quarterfinal in straight sets to [[Cilly Aussem]] who would proceed to win the championship and in 1934 [[Simonne Mathieu]] proved too strong for her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|page=393|edition=2nd}}</ref>

In 1931 she won the singles title at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Championships]] in Milan after winning the final against [[Dorothy Andrus|Dorothy Andrus Burke]] in three sets. That year she also won the mixed doubles title with [[Pat Hughes (tennis)|G.P. Hughes]].<ref name=lowe1935/> Additionally she was a runner-up at the inaugural 1930 championships as well as the 1932, 1934 and 1935 editions.

She was part of the Italian team that toured India in 1932 and during that trip won the singles title at the East and West of India Championships.<ref name=lowe1935/>
