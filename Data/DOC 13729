'''Whittl''' was an online appointment booking website for local services.  Whittl launched to consumers in Chicago in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=ORIGIN VENTURES LEADS FUNDING OF WHITTL|url=http://originventures.com/origin-ventures-invests-in-whittl/|accessdate=28 April 2014|publisher=OCA Ventures}}</ref>  Whittl, originally called MyServista, allows individuals to find and compare local services such as haircuts, dog walking, or auto repair services.  The startup was backed by Origin Venture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://originventures.com/portfolio/whittl/|title=Whittl|accessdate=28 April 2014|publisher=OCA Ventures}}</ref> OCA Ventures,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocaventures.com/Portfolio/Our+Portfolio.aspx|title=Our Portfolio|accessdate=28 April 2014|publisher=OCA Ventures}}</ref> and Amicus Capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amicuscapital.com/companies/?company_id=96|title=Whittl|publisher=Amicus|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> Whittl ceased operations in 2016.

== Early Founding ==
Whittl was founded by Mike Zivin and Hemant Kashyap originally under the name MyServista.  The website got its start in 2011 when Zivin ran into difficulty finding the cost of an eye exam online.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pletz|first=John|title=Whittl.com slices off $1.3 million from Origin, OCA, Amicus|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130618/BLOGS11/130619796/whittl-com-slices-off-1-3-million-from-origin-oca-amicus|publisher=Crain's Chicago Business|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> The duo decided that they could create an easier way to display local service menus online. They launched the business in February 2012 in Chicago's [[Merchandise Mart]].

== Company ==
Whittl.com is located in Chicago's River North neighborhood. It has been featured in several local Chicago news stories for its ease of use and for its $1.3M in funding.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Wailin|title=Whittl services listing startup raises $1.3M|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-06-18/business/chi-whittl-services-20130617_1_grubhub-venture-capital-funding-origin-ventures|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/video/#!/on-air/as-seen-on/A-Website-To-Organize-Your-Life-And-Book-Your-Appointments/251664711|publisher=NBC Chicago|date=March 22, 2014|title=A Website To Organize Your Life And Book Your Appointments|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>  The company has also been named as one of the 50 "Coolest" Startups in Chicago in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slivka|first=Jasmine|title=The 50 "Coolest" Startups in Chicago!|url=http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/50-coolest-startups-chicago|publisher=built in chicago|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

== Business Model ==
Whittl helps individuals find the exact price for everyday services such as a haircut, massage, or pet sitter. It also helps local businesses find long-term customers who are located in their neighborhood. Unlike Chicago-based Groupon, Whittl does not run daily deals.  Whittl's model is more similar to GrubHub, providing transparent menus for services rather than for restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pletz|first=John|title=Whittl.com slices off $1.3 million from Origin, OCA, Amicus|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130618/BLOGS11/130619796/whittl-com-slices-off-1-3-million-from-origin-oca-amicus|accessdate=28 April 2014|publisher=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref>

The site currently serves local Chicago customers and merchants, but has plans to expand to multiple cities.
