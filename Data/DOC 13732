Community Coffee originated in 1919 when company founder Norman "Cap" Saurage began experimenting with coffee blends at his two grocery stores in downtown Baton Rouge.  Demand for the coffee increased to the extent that by 1923 Saurage moved his coffee production to a converted barn, and in 1924 left his grocery business to focus on coffee.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/features/people/8358202-123/community-coffees-first-mill-put Community Coffee’s first mill put on display | People | The Advocate — Baton Rouge, LA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1995, Community Coffee began opening a chain of retail coffeehouses throughout Louisiana.  Community also launched stores in [[Texas]] and [[Alabama]], however, ventures in neighboring states failed due to the entrenchment of [[Starbucks]] and local brands.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  In 2013 Community spun off its coffee house business into a separate company named CC's Coffee House in order to facilitate out-of-state expansion.  CC's remains under the ownership of the Saurage family.<ref>[http://www.businessreport.com/article/20130412/BUSINESSREPORT0112/130419907 Community spins off CC's to facilitate out-of-state expansion<!
