When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was  '''snow close'''. Given that the article for [[Amit manwar]] has been recreated several times after deletion, I'm salting this to prevent a similar situation. It can be re-created when/if more sources become available.

Possible hoax, Google search for sources, directors turned up no hits. If this film was actually distributed by Marvel it should have had widespread coverage, but none was found. Nominating at AfD because article author objected to PROD. [[User:Altamel|Altamel]] ([[User talk:Altamel|talk]]) 23:11, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

Hoax-Marvel never made this. Unless if there is some other studio named Marvel. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 01:56, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Note:''' I declined the speedy that was placed AFTER this deletion discussion had begun, as this is a foreign film and possible foreign sources will be determined at this AFD.

* '''Delete'''. Not even close to satisfying [[WP:MOVIE]]. According to (now A7-speedied, but still in [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ejZDSa3IOyEJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_manwar Google cache]) companion article, "director" [[Amit manwar]] was born in 2000...

* '''Delete'''.  I agree after a lot of digging that at the very kindest this film topic article is [[WP:NYF|TOO SOON]]. '''[[User:MichaelQSchmidt|<font color="blue">Schmidt, </font>]]''' ''[[User talk:MichaelQSchmidt|<sup><small>Michael Q.</small></sup>]]'' 16:14, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. No indication of notability, fails the guidelines for inclusion set out at [[WP:GNG]], [[WP:N]] etc. The article creator's talk page speaks volumes.[[User:Sparklism| — sparklism]] <sup><small>''[[User_talk:Sparklism| hey!]]''</small></sup> 11:21, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
