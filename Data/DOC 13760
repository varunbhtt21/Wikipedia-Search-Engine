'''''Hemerophila diva''''', the '''Diva Hemerophila Moth''', is a [[moth]] in the family [[Choreutidae]]. It was described by Riley in 1889. It is found in [[Florida]]<ref>[http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/sesioidea/choreutidae/hemerophila/index.html Hemerophila at funet]</ref> and [[Cuba]].

The length of the forewings is  5.7-8.8&nbsp;mm. The forewings are violet-purple with an iridescent basal quarter with a tan-yellow or orange outer border. The hindwings are orange. Adults have been recorded on wing from April to June, in August and from November to December.<ref>[http://mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu/species.php?hodges=2655 mothphotographersgroup]</ref>

The larvae feed on ''[[Ficus]]'' species, including ''[[Ficus citrifolia]]''. They curl the leaves of their host plant and skeletonize the
surface. Pupation takes place on the leaf in a webbing.<ref>[http://www.troplep.org/TLR/2-1/pdf012.pdf Florida Hemerophila]</ref>
