The language '''Occidental''', later '''Interlingue''', is a [[constructed language|planned]] [[international auxiliary language]] created by the Balto-German naval officer and teacher [[Edgar de Wahl]], and published in 1922. The vocabulary is based on already existing international words. The language is thereby [[International auxiliary language#Classification|naturalistic]], at the same time as it is constructed to be [[regular language|regular]]. Occidental was quite popular in the years before [[the Second World War]], but declined in the years thereafter.

Occidental is devised so that many of its derived word forms reflect the similar forms common to a number of [[Western Europe]]an languages, primarily those in the [[Romance languages|Romance]] family. This was done through application of [[De Wahl's rule]] which is a set of rules for converting [[verb]] [[infinitive]]s into derived [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s. The result is a language easy to understand at first sight for individuals acquainted with several Western European languages. Coupled with a simplified grammar, this made Occidental exceptionally popular in Europe during the 15 years before [[World War II]]. [[Occidental language|'''''Find&nbsp;out&nbsp;more...''''']]
