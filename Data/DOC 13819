'''''NBA 2K15''''' is a [[basketball]] [[simulation video game]] developed by [[Visual Concepts]] and published by [[2K Sports]]. It is the sixteenth installment in the ''[[NBA 2K (series)|NBA 2K]]'' franchise and the successor to ''[[NBA 2K14]]''. It was released in October 2014 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox One]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]]. [[Kevin Durant]] of the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], one of the three cover athletes of ''[[NBA 2K13]]'', is the solo cover athlete of ''NBA 2K15''.<ref>[http://www.nba2k.org/2014/07/nba-2k15-official-box-art-cover-revealed.html NBA 2K15 Official Box Art Cover Revealed]</ref> ''NBA 2K15'' was succeeded by ''[[NBA 2K16]]''.

== New features==

=== Scanning system ===
''NBA 2K15'' allows players to scan their faces into the game for created players, using the PlayStation Camera on PlayStation 4 or the Kinect on Xbox One.<ref>[http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/7/6939155/nba-2k15-face-scan-glitch-disaster-impossible NBA 2K15 Face Scan Glitch Disaster Impossible]</ref> The 3D mapping process creates a realistic rendition of the gamer's face to make their gaming experience as real as possible. The process of scanning the face will take about 30 seconds. Players need to get very close (6-12 inches) to the camera and slowly turn their heads 30 degrees to the left and right during the scanning process.<ref>[http://www.latinospost.com/articles/38772/20140917/nba-2k15-career-gameplay-best-3d-face-scan-offers-lifelike.htm 'NBA 2K15' My Career Gameplay is Best Ever! 3D Face Scan Offers Lifelike Version of Gamer [Watch Trailer Here<nowiki>]</nowiki>]</ref>

=== MyCareer mode and upgrading system ===

For 8th-Gen systems (PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One), MyCareer Mode has been revamped with new additions such as the mentor and upgrading system. The player's MyPlayer speaks to the leader of the team before and after games. 2K implemented their voices providing for a more in-depth user experience. These features have allowed for a greater "storyline" to be integrated into MyCareer mode. MyCareer also uses a new upgrading system which gets more virtual currency from endorsement deals, completing challenges, and badges (which come in bronze, silver, and gold). However, on 8th-Gen systems, players cannot view playoff stats or the playoff tree.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k15s-mycareer-mode-features-real-players-voic/1100-6422535/ NBA 2K15's MyCareer Mode Features Real Players' Voices]</ref>

=== Coaching advice ===
A new coach satisfaction system has been introduced that provides real-time feedback based on the MyPlayer's court performance. MyPlayer is mentored by [[Los Angeles Clippers]] head coach [[Doc Rivers]], who will either praise or admonish the player based on their gameplay.<ref>[http://www.sportsgamersonline.com/nba-2k15-defensive-tips-1557 NBA 2K15 Defensive Tips]</ref>

== Development ==
The game included a pre-order bonus pack which includes 5,000 Virtual Currency (VC), 2 MyTEAM card packs, a choice of an International MyTEAM card or rookie [[Kevin Durant]], and MyPLAYER jerseys inspired by Durant.<ref>[http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/5/5783664/nba-2k15-pre-order-bonuses NBA 2K15 Per Order Bonuses]</ref>  On August 6, 2014 it was announced that Crew  will be back in the game for current-gen consoles, then on August 7, 2014 it was announced that the game would have a new mode called MyLeague, which is similar to ''[[NBA 2K14]]''{{'}}s GM mode but with added customization and improvements. New [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] elements have also been introduced to the game, such as the conversation system and press conferences. On September 17, 2014 it was announced a face scanning system would be introduced into the game, allowing players to add their own likeness into the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.operationsports.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2046549232&postcount=29|title = NBA 2K15 MyGM To Distance Itself From VC, Be More Dynamic|accessdate = September 4, 2014|last = Zdyrko|first = Dave}}</ref> There is a ''MyNBA2K15'' mobile app that came out along with the game.
