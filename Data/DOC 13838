CAMILLA AND MARC expansion plans in Australia continue with 5 stores opening across the country over the past few years â€“ and with three more boutiques set to open by end of 2018. This growth has been complemented by a strong emergence in the US and International markets.

Renowned for their quality finishes and luxury design CAMILLA AND MARC opened their first boutique in Paddington's intersection in 2009. In 2014, they welcomed their second store in Fiveways and the Mosman boutique on Sydney's lower north shore in December 2015. Following on from this momentum, the brand opened Emporium in Melbourne's CBD in July 2016 joining their Armadale store in Melbourne's inner city suburbs. The Strand boutique in Sydney's CBD opened its doors in April 2017. Further in 2017, the Rosebery outlet was opened and 2018 has seen the opening of their first boutique in Western Australia at Perth's Claremont Quarter.

With a strong following by international industry forerunners such as US InStyle Editor Laura Brown and stylist Vanessa Traina, the brand's local awareness in the US has developed exponentially. In May 2018, CAMILLA AND MARC opened MBFWA to coincide with the label's 15th anniversary. The show garnered international attention and was widely well received as a triumphant celebration of their 15 years in the business. 60 tonnes of sand were used to create a Dystopian Australian landscape, exploring themes of futurism, reflection and light within the collection.
