'''Sir Fineen O'Driscoll''' (died 1629) was an Irish lord who was knighted by [[Queen Elizabeth I]].  He was more commonly known as '''The Rover''' and also known as '''Fineen of the Ships'''.  He was married to Eileen, daughter of [[Owen MacCarthy Reagh|Sir Owen MacCarthy Reagh]] the 16th Prince of Carbery, whose grandmother Eleanor was daughter of [[Gearóid Mór FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]]. His eldest son, Connor (or Conor), was owner of [[Castlehaven]].

Sir Fineen died in 1629 in his castle, An Clochán, on the island in Loch Ine.

The O'Driscolls were a rich and powerful family and their territory stretched over much of south Cork, from Cape Clear and the nearby islands, through Baltimore to Castlehaven.  Much of their wealth was attributed to "black rent", a due paid to them by fishermen for the use of their harbours and bays for fishing and salting herring.
