==Military career==
Sasha was originally assigned as a bomb detection search dog to Marianne Hay, who gave Sasha up as she felt that they couldn't work in the field together as they had become too close.<ref name=heyhoe9>[[#heyhoe2012|Heyhoe (2012)]]: p. 9</ref> Sasha was assigned to Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe in May 2008,<ref name=indi29apr>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Rob|title=Army sniffer dog killed in Afghanistan is awarded animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/army-sniffer-dog-killed-in-afghanistan-is-awarded-animal-equivalent-of-the-victoria-cross-9300416.html|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=29 April 2014}}</ref> while Hay was given the [[English Springer Spaniel]] Leanna.<ref>[[#heyhoe2012|Heyhoe (2012)]]: p. 264</ref> Prior to deployment in Afghanistan, Sasha and Rowe were well known to the other members of the 104 Working Dog Unit, based at [[North Luffenham]], [[Rutland]].<ref>[[#heyhoe2012|Heyhoe (2012)]]: p. 6</ref> Sasha was particularly friendly with [[Treo (dog)|Treo]], whose handler described Sasha as "Treo's bit of skirt" and said himself that "if there is one dog in the 104 that can rival Treo's abilities, it's her".<ref name=heyhoe9/>

===Service in Afghanistan===

Sasha served with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute regiment in the [[Kandahar]] region,<ref name=sasha>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/29/uk-army-dog-sasha-pdsa-dickin-medal-afghanistan | title = British army dog awarded bravery medal for work in Afghanistan | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate=29 April 2014|date=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=bbcnews29apr>{{cite news|title=Army dog killed in Afghanistan given posthumous medal|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27186205|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=29 April 2014}}</ref> working out of the Inkerman base.<ref name=heyhoe9/> The weapons Sasha found included mortars, mines, and other weapons, with one particularly large find in [[Garmsir]].<ref name=indi29apr/><ref name=sasha/> During her time in Afghanistan, she made 15 confirmed finds of either ammunition caches or hidden explosives.<ref name=chronicle/> Sasha was well liked by the troops in the Parachute regiment, and raised morale whenever she was on patrol.

Sasha and her handler were killed during an ambush on their patrol on 24 July 2008.<ref name=sky29apr/><ref name=dailymailjuly2008/> A sniper had shot Sasha, and although injured, the dog returned to her handler.

===Dickin Medal===
It was announced in April 2014 that Sasha was to be posthumously awarded the [[Dickin Medal|PDSA Dickin Medal]].<ref name=pdsadog/><ref name=sasha/> The Director General of the PDSA, Jan McLoughlin said of the award "We are extremely proud to be awarding a posthumous PDSA Dickin Medal to Military Working Dog Sasha. The award is even more poignant as we approach the centenary of World War One and are reminded of the huge debt we owe the animals who serve in times of conflict. Sasha's exceptional devotion to duty in Afghanistan saved many lives, both soldiers and civilians. This medal, recognised worldwide as the animals' Victoria Cross, honours both Sasha's unwavering service and her ultimate sacrifice."<ref name=sky29apr/>

The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=David|title=The animals' VC: for gallantry and devotion: the PDSA Dickin Medal - inspiring stories of bravery and courage|date=2012|publisher=Preface|location=London|isbn=9781848093768|ref=long2012}}</ref>
