'''''[[The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries]]''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas completed by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in 1812. It depicts French Emperor [[Napoleon]], wearing the uniform of a colonel of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] Foot Grenadiers, standing in his study at the [[Tuileries Palace]]. Unlike David's earlier painting ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]'', here the emperor is depicted as a civil hero rather than a military one, though his martial prowess is alluded to through the sword on his chair. The painting has been in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], since 1954.
