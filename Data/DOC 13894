:[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]]  I don't know how many DYKs you have submitted so I don't know if you are required to complete a QPQ. I know you've submitted at least one, since I recall reviewing it, and I had the pleasure of reviewing this one as well.  I believe I said of that one that you should submit it to [[WP:GA]], and I will say the same of this one.  I went over it pretty extensively and made some minor edits which you are free to disagree with, of course, and I've verified the hook citations via JSTOR.  So this is ready to go once we settle the QPQ issue.  Again, excellent work.

::Thanks very much for the nice words!  yes, I've submitted several DYKs, but I've never reviewed one (didn't realize about WP:QPQ until you mentioned it), so it might take me some time to learn.  I'll start reading about the process. -- [[User:Kosboot|kosboot]] ([[User talk:Kosboot|talk]]) 23:57, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:::You don't need to review if you've submitted less than five DYKs, but you are always welcome to chip in and review, especially since you are an experienced Wikipedian.

::::[[User:Kosboot|Kosboot]], I should have checked this earlier, sorry, but I ran the QPQ check and found 12 previous DYK submissions so you will have to review an article.  But otherwise this article is ready for the front page.

:::::I'd like to withdraw this nomination.  I've not fulfilled the QPQ - and it'll take me a while to figure out how to do it. -- 14:37, 20 May 2014 (UTC) <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Kosboot|Kosboot]] ([[User talk:Kosboot|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kosboot|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

:::::*[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] Withdrawn per creator, who will not be submitted a QPQ review as required for DYK. (Note: if someone would like to donate one of their DYK reviews, that could be used instead, but only if it's done before this closes.)

::::::*I'll donate a QPQ; we don't have enough manuscript articles. Give me a bit.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 10:25, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Updating review icon, since QPQ is going to be donated. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 14:07, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::::I didn't know we could do that.  I'm willing to do this as well if Crisco 1492 is unable to. [[User:Gamaliel|<font color="DarkGreen">Gamaliel</font>]] <small>([[User talk:Gamaliel|<font color="DarkGreen">talk</font>]])</small> 14:29, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*I plan on reviewing [[Template:Did you know nominations/Djawoto]] to completion after Blue brought issues up. Hope this is enough. Gamaliel, I'd avoid donating a QPQ so that you can continue to review this article.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 09:35, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::::* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] good point, we'd have to get another reviewer since I would be an involved party at that point.  Since you've already started your review, no reason why we can't promote this article.

*Excuse me, but I don't see anything on this template that says a review was actually done.  What was checked other than the missing QPQ? {{tq|please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed.}}  Details that are supposed to be checked in a review can be found  at [[Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide| DYKReviewing guide]].

::Please review my first comment.  I went through the entire toolbox and reviewed the article line by line.  I am confident that this meets DYK criteria.
