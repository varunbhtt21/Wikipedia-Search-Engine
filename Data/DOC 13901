The church was built for the Russian residents of the settlement of [[Russian Colony of Alexandrowka|Alexandrowka]], now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, below the ''Kapellenberg''.  Consecrated in 1826, it is still an active congregation and the oldest Russian Orthodox church in Germany.  Designed by [[Vasily Stasov]], Nevsky Church is a very early example of the [[Byzantine Revival architecture]] in Germany, and one of the earliest examples of Byzantine revival in [[Russian Revival architecture]].<ref>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM2102_Church_of_Saint_Alexander_Newski_Potsdam_Germany] Church of Saint Alexander Newski, Potsdam, Germany.</ref><ref>[http://www.alexandrowka.de/kirche.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601162049/http://www.alexandrowka.de/kirche.html |date=2013-06-01 }} Alexandrowka
