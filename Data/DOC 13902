'''Sue Wong''' is a [[China|Chinese]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[fashion designer]] best known for her dress designs with a contemporary twist based on [[old Hollywood]] glamor style.<ref name=Calvert>{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=Kim|title=Sue Wong – Fashion, Beauty and Bliss|url=http://singularcity.com/sue-wong-celebrity-fashion-designer/|work=Singular Magazine|accessdate=28 April 2014|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> Her collections, available in some 27 countries, have been noted for her interpretations of the traditions of [[Haute couture|couture]] dressmaking of romantic eras such as [[Weimar culture|Weimar Berlin]], [[History of Shanghai#Republic of China|1930s Shanghai]], [[pre-code Hollywood]], and Manhattan’s gilded [[Jazz Age]].  She owns Sue Wong Universe, based in [[Los Angeles]], Cal.

==Early life==
Born into humble circumstances in a remote countryside in Southern China, Sue was spirited away from her ancestral home at the age of five by her Mother, who longed to be reunited with her Father in America. Journeying to the United States a year later, mother and child reunited with Sue’s father in Los Angeles. As a child, her initial creative tendencies drew her to Art. The daughter of struggling immigrants, there would be no budget in the spare family economy for toys; Sue would create her own paper dolls and their entire lavish wardrobe, practicing her nascent interest in Fashion Design. However, Sue started making her own clothes when she was nine years old. In High School she was chosen from over three hundred female classmates to be a member of the May Company Teen Board, and landed the opportunity to work in various capacities including modeling, window display and merchandising. 

==Career==
While she was still trying to earn a Fashion degree, she interned with the resource brand Arpeja, after winning first place in a scholarship sponsored by the company, apprenticing under the head designer.When she was nine years old, Wong made her first blouse with her mom's [[Singer sewing machine]] from a scrap of fabric and some [[lace]]. A few years later, in [[junior high]] and [[high school]], she insisted on designing and sewing herself a new dress for each weekly dance of the school year. Her [[senior prom]] dress was her own creation as well, adorned with [[beads]] handsewn into the [[bodice]].<ref name="About interview">{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Justin|title=Sue Wong, The Fashion Alchemist|url=http://fashiondesigners.about.com/od/Couture-Fashion/a/Sue-Wong-The-Fashion-Alchemist.htm|work=About Fashion Designers|publisher=About.com|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>
