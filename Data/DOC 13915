'''''Khanom khrok''''' or coconut-rice pancakes ({{lang-th|ขนมครก}}, {{IPA-th|kʰā.nǒm kʰrók|pron}}) is a traditional [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] dessert.<ref>{{cite news |last1=CHAROENKIATPAKUL |first1=WICHAN |title=Nuts about coconuts |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1523898/nuts-about-coconuts |accessdate=18 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=18 August 2018}}</ref> They are prepared by mixing rice flour, sugar, and [[coconut milk]] to form a dough. Usually, ''khanom khrok'' is composed of two batters, one salty and one sweet, both of which are cooked in a heating mantle–a hot indented frying pan.  After heating, ''khanom khrok'' will be picked out of the mantle and the two half-circular doughs formed into a circular shape.

''Khanom khrok'' is fragrant, sweet and the texture is also smooth from the coconut milk. It can also be found in [[Bangladeshi cuisine|Bangladesh]], [[Burmese cuisine|Myanmar]], [[Lao cuisine|Laos]], [[Cambodian cuisine|Cambodia]], and there is something similar in [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]]. [[Indonesian people]] call it ''[[serabi]]''.
