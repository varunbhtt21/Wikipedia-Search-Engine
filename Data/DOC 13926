The '''James Spear House''' is a historic home in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] along Charleston's [[The Battery (Charleston)|Battery]]. The property upon which the house was built was acquired by James Spear in 1860 for $5,000; a plat connected with the sale does not reveal any improvements to the lot. However, by the time of a municipal census conducted in 1861, Spear was already occupying the house.<ref name="Stockton">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19771107&id=HZhJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4744,1446235 | title=Spear House Has Italianate Style | work=News & Courier | date=November 7, 1977 | accessdate=April 28, 2014 | author=Stockton, Robert P. | location=Charleston, South Carolina | pages=B1}}</ref>

The house is a three-story brick house in the Italianate style that was popular in Charleston just before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The house has a two-story porch across the front (south facade) with a third story that is open to the elements. Behind the house, there is a two-story service building original to the house. The service building was connected to the house some time after 1882.<ref name="Stockton"/>
