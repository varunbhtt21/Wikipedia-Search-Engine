Aged 11 years, James Lalor immigrated with his parents to [[New South Wales]] where the family lived in [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] and [[Carroll, New South Wales|Carroll]] before taking up the ''Bengall'' pastoral station on the [[Severn River (Queensland)|Severn River]] near [[Goondiwindi]] in 1852. He worked with his family on Bengall station, until 1860, when he established a pastoral station ''Gubberamunda'' (an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning ''little hills'') with his brother in the [[Bungil Creek]] area. Initially they ran sheep on the Gubberamunda, but later switched to cattle as they did better on the available grass.<ref name=obit/>
