Title : Workplace mentoring
Text : '''Workplace mentoring''' is a “learning partnership between employees for purposes of sharing technical information, institutional knowledge and insight with respect to a particular occupation, profession, organization or endeavor”.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcforestsafe.org/files/Mentoring%20draft%206%20for%20review%20with%20Committee.pdf|title=Mentoring Model|last=|first=|date=2008-08-29|website=BC Forest Safety Council|access-date=28 April 2014}}</ref> If this process is done correctly, the organization may reduce turnover and increase productivity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/0615-employee-monitoring.aspx|title=Monitoring Employee Productivity: Proceed with Caution|date=2015-06-01|work=SHRM|access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref> Workplace mentoring is not confined to a certain age and is a relationship that develops though close interactions with a [[Mentorship|mentor]] and their protégé.

== History ==
The original form of mentoring is the idea that an experienced worker train an incoming new worker.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Billet|first=Stephen|title=Workplace mentors: demands and benefits|journal=Journal of Workplace Learning|volume=15|issue=3|pages=105–113|doi=10.1108/13665620310468441|year=2003}}</ref> The concept of mentoring dates back to [[Odyssey|Homer's Odyssey]].

== Formal vs. informal mentoring ==

=== Formal mentoring ===
Many companies have had at one time, or currently have, a formal mentoring program in place.<ref>{{cite book | doi=10.1111/b.9781405133739.2007.00021.x|chapter = The Blackwell Handbook of Mentoring|pages = 345–367|year = 2007|isbn = 9781405133739| last1=Allen| first1=Tammy D.| last2=Eby| first2=Lillian T.}}</ref> Formal mentoring is typically contracted to last a designated amount of time, and the mentor is from the organization at which the protégé is currently employed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ragins|first=Belle Rose|date=1997|title=Diversified Mentoring Relationships in Organizations: A Power Perspective|jstor=259331|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=22|issue=2|pages=482–521|doi=10.2307/259331}}</ref> However, formal training for the mentor may come from outside sources and may not always work for all organizations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bridgewater|first=S.|date=January 1976|title=Criteria for selection of nursing textbooks|journal=The Journal of Nursing Education|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–5|issn=0148-4834|pmid=1477}}</ref> Formal mentors are less likely to have had a relationship with the protégé prior to the assignment, and will not develop a close relationship, which can cause the mentor to be more focused on company tasks than on the protégé's personal life.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last=Ragins|first=Belle Rose|last2=Cotton|first2=John L.|last3=Miller|first3=Janice S.|date=2000|title=Marginal Mentoring: The Effects of Type of Mentor, Quality of Relationship, and Program Design on Work and Career Attitudes|jstor=1556344|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1177–1194|doi=10.2307/1556344}}</ref>

=== Informal mentoring ===
Compared to formal mentors, informal mentoring is typically unstructured and relationships exist as long as the mentor and/or protégé deem necessary . A mentor will pick a protégé they identify with, while a protégé will pick a mentor due to similar career goals.<ref name=":0" /> While an informal mentor, who is not a part of the organization, may not have all the resources that a formal mentor will have to advance the protégé within the company’s hierarchy, they can provide a more personal relationship and will not be involved in workplace politics and will be able to provide bias free advice.<ref name=":0" />

== Additional types ==

* '''Relational Mentoring:''' This is a style of mentoring that is based on peer interaction. This type can be defined as "an interdependent and generative developmental relationship that promotes mutual growth, learning, and development within the career context."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292984493|title=The Oxford Handbook of Positive Organizational Scholarship|last=Ragins|first=Belle|date=2012-01-01|isbn=9780199734610|pages=519–536}}</ref> Whether it be an older associate or their boss, the mentoring comes from a close bond with another associate.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|last=Ragins|first=Belle Rose|date=July 2016|title=From the ordinary to the extraordinary|journal=Organizational Dynamics|volume=45|issue=3|pages=228–244|doi=10.1016/j.orgdyn.2016.07.008|issn=0090-2616}}</ref> Eg: coaches, advisors, and teachers.<ref name=":1" />
* '''Reverse Mentoring''': This type of mentoring takes place when a younger member of a company is the mentor to an older member of a company to foster a better pipeline of leadership in a company.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Silver|first=Jeff|date=2016|title=Real world mentoring fundamentals A practical guide to building-up security professionals.|journal=The Business & Management Review|volume=7|issue=4|pages=13–16}}</ref> The mentor has less overall experience in comparison to the mentee due to age. But in the particular mentoring area the mentor has more experience which reverses some dynamics of the mentorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-lexisnexis-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/?|title=Mentoring an employee at work|last=Time of India|date=May 6, 2014|website=Lexis Nexis Academic|access-date=}}</ref> Eg: A retired person goes back to work part time to stay busy at the local grocery store and gets assigned a mentor who is 30 years younger.

== Pros & cons ==

=== Pros ===
“Mentoring is likely to be marked by both positive and negative experiences over time.” One positive effect of workplace mentoring is that mentoring helps reduce stress and workplace burnout.<ref name=":2" /> This allows for the new employee to perform better at their careers. As a result, new employees typically learn different roles through their transition. Therefore, workplace mentoring has a tendency to create an amicable environment through transition for the new employee.<ref name=":1" /> Mentors then have the opportunity to grow and learn from teaching the mentees, which ultimately helps their work performance.<ref name=":1" /> Experts, leaders, and professionals benefit from passing the knowledge they’ve gained over the years to the next generation.<ref>[http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libweb.uwlax.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=91bbcd6d-ae0b-49e5-8e8d-7732f689287d%40sessionmgr4009]</ref>  Their self-images are reinforced by these interactions and in turn commit them to a sense of professional identity and engagement in development activities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blinn‐Pike|first=Lynn|title=The Benefits Associated with Youth Mentoring Relationships|pages=163–187|doi=10.1111/b.9781405133739.2007.00011.x|isbn=9780470691960|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2008|chapter=The Blackwell Handbook of Mentoring}}</ref> If high-quality mentoring is done it can create and experience where both the new and veteran employee can learn and grow in their jobs and have the opportunity to advance in the future.<ref name=":1" /> This relationship lowers company turnover rate if executed effectively because the mentors then have the opportunity to creates a greater success rate in mentees by giving them the proper tools to complete their job.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Holloway|first=John|date=May 2001|title=The Benefits of Mentoring|url=https://archive.is/1jloY#selection-1427.8-1427.191|journal=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|volume=58}}</ref>

=== Cons ===
Mentors often don’t have the time to schedule set meetings and provide feedback for their mentee. Some research has shown that there may be no benefit to formal mentorship programs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eric|date=2007|title=Why Youth Mentoring Relationships End|url=https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED502228|journal=Research in Action|issue=5}}</ref> Many organization employees work from home, which can make it difficult to establish a program. As the distance or [[globalization]] increases, then barriers to effective communication arise impeding the understanding between mentor and mentee.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Matuszek|first=Tish|last2=Self|first2=Dennis|last3=Schraeder|first3=Mike|date=|title=Mentoring in an increasingly global workplace: facing the realities and challenges|url=https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.79335!/file/Mentoring-in-an-Increasingly-Global-Workplace.pdf|journal=Development and Learning in Organizations|volume=22|pages=18}}</ref> The termination of mentor-mentee relations can be awkward. Studies show that over half of all mentees reported a negative experience with their mentor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eby|first=Lillian T.|last2=McManus|first2=Stacy E.|last3=Simon|first3=Shana A.|last4=Russell|first4=Joyce E.A.|date=August 2000|title=The Protege's Perspective Regarding Negative Mentoring Experiences: The Development of a Taxonomy|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1999.1726|issn=0001-8791|citeseerx=10.1.1.526.6986}}</ref> Dysfunctional mentoring relations are those in which the relationship is not beneficial for either the mentor, protégé, or both.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scandura|first=A|date=1998|title=Dysfunctional mentoring relationships and outcomes|journal=Journal of Management|volume=24|issue=3|pages=449–467|doi=10.1002/job.193}}</ref>
