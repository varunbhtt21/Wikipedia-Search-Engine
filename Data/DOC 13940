<s>The term "workplace mentoring" does not appear to be a notable term. I'm not nominating it for A11 since it's not a made-up term.

Thanks for those sources: could those be added to the article? I'm also not against merging this to [[mentoring]] since I don't really see much difference between it and just regular mentoring.

*'''Keep''' The topic is quite notable as several books have been written about it such as ''Designing Workplace Mentoring Programs''; ''Common-Sense Workplace Mentoring''; ''Workplace Mentoring Reference Guide''; ''Workplace Mentoring: Organising and Managing Effective Practice''; &c.  We have a more general start on the topic at [[mentoring]] too and so there are obvious [[WP:ATD|alternatives to deletion]] such as merger.
