== naturopathy ==

I am am MD and have some serious issues with your article about naturopathy. First of all, in 2007 a study was performed
evaluating the usage of alternative vs 'traditional' healthcare and it was found that people in the US had paid out of
pocket an amount for alternative healthcare surpassing the amount they spent on deductibles for 'traditional' medicine.
That year the established medical practioners realized they had to adapt to the changing desires of their patients or
they would lose them. There was two ways to look at this change: one they could try to discredit the move towards more
healthy ways of treating health issues or they could educate themselves on it and try to incorporate some of the ideas.
Of course some physicians chose one and some forward thinking MDs chose the latter. It must be understood how the current
medical field operates. For one, it is dominated by big corporate pharmaceutical companies who have a lot of money to
manipulate and otherwise control what is studied, accepted and put out for use by the population. It is never wise to 
allow big money to control what is made available as they will always go for their profit and NOT what benefits people
as a whole. Also involved in this is the fact that money is required to fund studies, and big pharma will not fund a 
study for herbals or other alternatives if they cannot patent it, which since herbals grow, it is difficult or impossible
to patent, therefore no studies, therefore established medicine cannot officially approve of this or that herbal application.
Secondly, if a study did get funded, performed, and had results;good or bad, the study must go before a board of their peers.
Remember that these establised physicians all have been prejudiced against this move to more natural means of healing and
preventing illness by their training in established medical schools so it is difficult for them to get over this prejudice
and evaluate the study objectively. After all, they spent many years studying very difficult materials and passing boards,
it is natural that they would not want to take more time to study more medicine after all that time they invested already.
And remember, not all MDs are altruistic, enough of them are in it for the money to make it difficult for different ideas
to be allowed or evaluated. Please re-examine this issue and have a less biased reporter redo this entry on Wiki pedia.

Thank you for your kind attention to this matter, sincerely,

:You probably want to bring this up on the discussion page for the article, which is at [[Talk:Naturopathy]]. There are probably more people who are well-versed in this topic to evaluate what you are saying. However, before you do, you should search the discussion archives (there should be a search box at the top of the discussion page). I'd also advise you to cite specific sources you have (including the 2007 study you mention) and understand that [[WP:NOR|Wikipedia cannot include information unless it comes from reliable sources]].

I have been uploading the page for my organization, and the logo stopped appearing on the page. When I went to the file, it said I didn't have the right rationale somehow? So I updated and fixed everything, using the non-free logo rationale and the copyrighted license, and no the file looks file, but it still won't show up on the page!

[[Template:Infobox organization]] adds its own image formatting so I removed the formatting code, but it wasn't this which prevented the logo from showing.

== Bot improvements; Web sites with dead content ==

Several questions:

1) Where is/are better place(s) to suggest improvements to bots?
(All content. i.e. web pages, under http://hometown.aol.com/ disappeared on Oct 31, 2008 (see [[AOL Hometown]]). All links to that content should be marked <nowiki>{{Dead link}}</nowiki>.  This is a task bots would be great at. I suspect this is a modification that quite a few bot maintainers would want to make. (I just manually marked one at [[Middlesex_and_Boston_Street_Railway#References]].)) [[User:Lentower|Lentower]] ([[User talk:Lentower|talk]]) 15:48, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

: There are some bots for this.  See [[Wikipedia:Link_rot#Bots]]  [[User:RudolfRed|RudolfRed]] - ([[User talk:RudolfRed|talk]]) 16:37, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::Do any of them handle this case? [[User:Lentower|Lentower]] ([[User talk:Lentower|talk]]) 16:43, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::Is there a simple way to let all of their maintainers know of this case? [[User:Lentower|Lentower]] ([[User talk:Lentower|talk]]) 16:43, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

2) Which place(s) can a web site with dead content be listed (like http://hometown.aol.com)? [[User:Lentower|Lentower]] ([[User talk:Lentower|talk]]) 15:48, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

== Problem with Template:Genealogy of the Olympians in Greek mythology ==

== Age of consent spain - wrong information in wikipedia ==

Hello,
someone changed the information about the minimum age of consent in Spain on this site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe#Spain based on that article: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/04/spain-raises-age-of-consent Actually the marriageable age was raised to 16 (with parental consent). But the raising of the age of sexual consent was just a proposal of the conservatives just as removing sex education from the curriculum, which would be ridiculous. In the referred article you can read "the change is expected to come into force this month". In this later article: http://theantifeminist.com/spain-raises-age-of-consent-to-16/ you can read "the measure is part of a draft law to be approved by the council of ministers by the end of this month. It will then be debated in Parliament for its final approval." There is no reliable hint to find on the net that it got it's final approval. In German press they reported the raising of the marriageable age, but there is no word to find about a raised  age of consent. I am really sure they would have reported that. The referred article is definitely not a reliable source. Before otherwise proven, the age of consent information in Wikipedia should be changed back to 13, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation. I don't know how to change that information back, so I ask you, dear reader, to do so. Thank you very much and have a great day.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/78.42.205.205|78.42.205.205]] ([[User talk:78.42.205.205|talk]]) 18:41, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Can quotes from 3 different paragraphs be combined in 1 blockquote? ==

Hello,

I've looked for an answer but can't find it. I'm looking at an article that combines quotes from different parts of a published article using (...) to combine them in blockquotes. Say, taking the first sentence from 3 different paragraphs in a 6 paragraph article. Is there a rule for this?

== How to contact writers of articles to query their sources? ==

Dear Wikipedia
Can you please tell me how to contact a writer of an article to query their sources. I have just read some information about an historical person which astonished me and if it is true it would be very significant to my research. Is it possible to contact a writer ( in a friendly way), simply to discuss this kind of thing and how would I find their contact details. The article in question has been edited very often already.
