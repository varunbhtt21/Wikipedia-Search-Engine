The '''Provinciaal Hof''' ('''''Province Court''''') is a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neogothical]] building on the [[Markt (Bruges)|market place]] in [[Bruges]], Belgium. It is the former meeting place for the [[Provinces of Belgium#Provincial government|provincial government]] of [[West Flanders]]. 

==History==
In 1294, the [[Waterhalle]], 95m long and about 30m high, was built as the central point of the port of Bruges, right in the heart of the city. When the boats no longer could reach the hall, it was demolished in 1787 and replaced with a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] building. From 1850 on, part of this was used to house the provincial government meetings, until it burned down in 1878. A replacement in neogothical style, intended to house the province and a postal office, was started in 1887 by architects [[Louis Delacenserie]] and [[Ren√© Buyck]]. The post office was opened in 1891, and the first part of the Provinciaal Hof in 1892. The last parts of the buildings were finished in 1920.<ref name=Inventaris/>

The building was used as the government meeting hall until 1999, and is now mainly a ceremonial building, and also used for exhibitions.<ref name=Inventaris>{{cite web|title=Provinciaal Hof|url=https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/dibe/relict/29455|publisher=Inventaris Onroerend Erfgoed|language=Dutch}}</ref> 

In 2012, the national government, which owns the building, was considering to sell it, but the provincial government, the main user of the Hof, protested.<ref>{{cite news|last=Deschacht|first=Tom|title=Belgische regering wil Provinciaal Hof verkopen|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20120614_00183852|newspaper=Het Nieuwsblad|date=14 June 2012|language=Dutch}}</ref>
