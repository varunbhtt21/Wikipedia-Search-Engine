person does not meet criteria for notability, this person is a relative unknown, no biographical significance, and the person in question is the likely creator for self-promotion.

* '''Keep'''. I think his role as a regular in a hit TV show (Alice) is enough to make him notable.  Sources should be added, but he certainly seems encyclopedia-worthy. [[Special:Contributions/209.90.140.72|209.90.140.72]] ([[User talk:209.90.140.72|talk]]) 21:43, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. One, partisan source cannot save an article. [[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 21:46, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' It's marginal whether he meets [[WP:ACTOR]]: "significant roles in multiple notable films, television shows, stage performances, or other productions." He was in every episode in [[Capital News]] and a regular in one series of [[Alice (TV series)]] and starred in 1980 TV movie Brothers (which currently doesn't have an article), as well as a reasonably big though not leading role in the film [[Honeysuckle Rose]] and the odd "footnote in tv history" role like the pilot of Golden Girls and in Seinfeld. How many of those were significant though? Plus some guest roles which normally aren't considered enough to meet that requirement. The lack of sources ''about him'' is a problem, and if there were a few things even saying "hey look at this guy he popped up in Spinal Tap" I'd lean keep, but no indication any of his roles were particularly noted or iconic. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 15:53, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
