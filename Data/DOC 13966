== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Goliath Games]] ==

I hit save page at the bottom of the Articles for Creation for Goliath Games, but it keeps saying it was not submitted for review.  Then it says to hit save page again.  I'm hoping it went through since I did what it said, but it's still saying it didn't.  I'm not sure what else to do.  Can you tell me if it submitted properly?

Thanks! [[Special:Contributions/24.131.180.120|24.131.180.120]] ([[User talk:24.131.180.120|talk]]) 03:15, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

:It's not submitted for review, but it's not suitable to be an article anyway. This is firstly because it's written like an advertisement, and secondly because it cites no independent reliable sources (see [[Wikipedia:VRS]]) to establish and verify the notability of the company.

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Solana Networks]] ==


I had developed a new entry for the following:

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Solana Networks]]

Feedback from review came back the 1st time to say that more verifiable
citations were needed. Spent a ton of time to dig up various citations
from the net and post. Then resubmitted. The 2nd review came back and
said there were too many citations - some of them "junk".

I am not sure where to strike the balance. It would be helpful if the
2nd reviewer (or someone else) indicates which specific citations are
problems so i can delete them. 

Help?

tthanks.

:The second reviewer specifically mentions press releases. You haven't removed them all yet; there is at least one still there, [http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1941853/solana_networks_signs_oem_agreement_with_lumeta_corporation/].

:[http://www.sytacom.mcgill.ca/news-events/conferences/conf-NMMC2010.html] is another example of a "junk" reference... all it confirms is that someone from the company gave a talk at a conference.

== Review of [[User:Margin1522/sandbox]] ==

If possible I'd like cancel my request for review.

It seems I misunderstood the purpose of the review. I am a registered user and I've created articles before. My article is a translation from the German Wikipedia, and I think it's good enough, so if it's OK I would like to just go ahead and create it. Thanks.

:I have accepted the article and added some appropriate templates. <s>There seems to be a citation error in the resulting text, you may wish to take a look.</s> A bot now claims to have fixed the error.

::Thank you very much. The citation was fixed and works as intended now. I agree that it needs more secondary references. Will try to work on that. [[User:Margin1522|Margin1522]] ([[User talk:Margin1522|talk]]) 09:55, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

:Hi Owneddistruktion. If the topic has not been discussed or detailed in any other website, there are possible concerns about whether it meets Wikipedia's notability requirements. Has it been described in detail in published books, music magazines or newspapers?
