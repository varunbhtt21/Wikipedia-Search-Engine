This appears to be a term paper pasted into Wikipedia. The content of the article is not about Perfetti per se, it's about his experiments. Perhaps he himself is notable per [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:PROF]], but this article does not demonstrate that.

*'''Speedy delete''' of some sort. Not suitable for an encyclopedia. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 01:29, 29 April 2014 (UTC).
*'''Delete''' per [[WP:TNT]] regardless of whether Perfetti is notable. This is not useful as a biography of the subject and it would not help to move it to a different article title. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 02:47, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
