'''''Grease: Live''''' (stylized as '''''Grease LIVE!''''') is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by [[Fox network|Fox]] on January 31, 2016. It was a live, televised remake of the 1978 film [[Grease (film)|''Grease'']], executive produced by [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], directed by [[Thomas Kail]], and starring [[Julianne Hough]], [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]] and [[Carlos PenaVega]].

Patterned on similar live television musicals that had recently been produced by [[NBC]], the production incorporated elements and songs from both the original stage musical and the [[Grease (film)|1978 film]] version of ''Grease'', as well as additional songs that were not present in either. In an effort to emulate the "energy" of a theatrical setting, live audiences were incorporated into the production's stagings. ''Grease: Live'' was broadcast from [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Studios]], utilizing two soundstages and the studio's outdoor [[backlot]]—the usage of the latter was notably affected by rain in the Los Angeles area on the day of the broadcast.

Critical reception was positive, with particular praise to the overall atmosphere and production style of the presentation, as well as the performances of the cast, particularly Hudgens as Betty Rizzo—the special was dedicated in the memory of Hudgens' father, who had died from cancer one day prior to the broadcast. The special was nominated for ten [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and won a total of five including Outstanding Special Class Program.

===Announcement and casting===
On April 28, 2014, Fox announced that it had partnered with [[Paramount Television]] to produce a live, three-hour televised adaptation of the 1978 musical ''Grease'' in 2015.<ref name=Keveney>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/04/28/fox-to-stage-live-production-of-grease/8414769/|title=Fox to go live with 'Grease'|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2016|work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> The move came in the wake of similar live musical adaptations that had been produced by [[NBC]], such as ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]'' and ''[[Peter Pan Live!]]''.<ref name=Keveney/><ref name="rollingstone-grease" />

On January 17, 2015, Fox officially announced that [[Julianne Hough]] had been cast as Sandy and [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as Rizzo and that the special would air on January 31, 2016. ''Entertainment Weekly'' reported that the special had been delayed from its original target of Summer 2015 due to difficulties in the casting process.<ref name="rollingstone-grease">{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fox-grease-live-musical-julianne-hough-vanessa-hudgens-20150117 |title=Fox Plans 'Grease' Live Musical With Julianne Hough and Vanessa Hudgens |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=January 17, 2015 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 1, 2016}}</ref> On May 28, 2015, it was announced that [[Keke Palmer]] would join the broadcast as Marty Maraschino, one of the Pink Ladies.<ref name=palmer>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/keke-palmer-joins-cast-of-foxs-grease-live-350121 |title=Keke Palmer Joins Cast of Fox's Grease: Live! |last=Hetrick |first=Adam |last2=Viagas |first2=Robert |date=May 28, 2015 |website=[[Playbill.com]] |access-date=April 20, 2018 |last3=Gioia |first3=Michael}}</ref> On July 9, it was announced that [[Aaron Tveit]] would star as Danny Zuko in the live TV broadcast, and [[Carlos PenaVega]] would play the role of Kenickie.<ref name=Hibberd/> On September 30, 2015, it was announced that [[Carly Rae Jepsen]], [[Kether Donohue]], and [[David Del Rio]] would play Frenchy, Jan, and Putzie, respectively.<ref name=FrenchyPutzie>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/broadways-cinderella-and-glee-choreographer-join-foxs-grease-live-364826 |title=Broadway's Cinderella and "Glee" Choreographer Join Fox's Grease: Live |last=Gans |first=Andrew |website=Playbill |date=September 30, 2015}}</ref> On November 6, it was announced that [[Jordan Fisher]], Andrew Call and Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer would join the cast as Doody, Sonny and Cha-Cha, respectively.<ref name=DoodySonnyChaCha>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/foxs-grease-live-gets-its-doody-sonny-and-cha-cha-370474 |title=Fox's Grease: Live Gets Its Doody, Sonny and Cha-Cha |last1=Viagas |first1=Andrew |last2=Clement |first2=Olivia |website=Playbill.com |date=November 6, 2015}}</ref>

===Production===
Director [[Thomas Kail]] envisioned ''Grease: Live'' as being a "combination" of elements from the original musical and the [[Grease (film)|1978 film version of ''Grease'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/thomas-kail-jumps-hamilton-grease-857961 |title='Hamilton's' Thomas Kail Makes the Leap to TV for "Bold" Take on 'Grease: Live' |last1=Rooney |first1=David |date=January 25, 2016 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Lynne Segall |access-date=February 3, 2016 |quote=&nbsp;What we're doing here is taking the spine of the film and then also having access to parts of the stage play.&nbsp;}}</ref> For instance, the production incorporated songs that were created for the film version, such as a performance of its theme song "[[Grease (song)|Grease (Is The Word)]]" by [[Jessie J]], "[[You're the One That I Want]]", and "[[Hopelessly Devoted to You]]", as well as songs that were exclusive to the stage version, such as "Freddy, My Love" and "Those Magic Changes".<ref name="people-newsongs" /> Kail explained that "very early on as I started imagining what this could be, talking to [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], our executive producer, and the folks at Paramount, one of the things we really were very focused on was trying to capture the spirit of both the original companies of ''Grease'' and that film that has left such an indelible impression on all of us. To try to honor that and pay homage to something that has moved us and we have such a great affection for, and then try to make our own version of it."<ref name="thr-studioaudience">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/foxs-grease-live-incorporate-studio-849706 |title=Fox's 'Grease: Live' to Incorporate Studio Audience |last=Rooney |first=David |date=December 17, 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=January 31, 2016}}</ref>

The production also contained several new songs including the original, "All I Need Is an Angel", which was written for the character of Frenchy ([[Carly Rae Jepsen]]) by [[Tom Kitt (musician)|Tom Kitt]] and [[Brian Yorkey]] of ''[[Next to Normal]]'' fame.<ref name="people-newsongs">{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/article/grease-live-2016-new-songs |title=Freddy, My Love?

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Jonas explained that the band was approached by the producers for the role following a concert they had performed in New York City.<ref name="rollingstone-dnce">{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/joe-jonas-talks-dnces-grease-live-cameo-20160127 |title=Joe Jonas Talks DNCE's 'Grease: Live' Cameo |last=Spanos |first=Brittany |date=January 27, 2016 |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 1, 2016}}</ref>

''Grease: Live'' was broadcast from [[Warner Bros.]] in [[Burbank, California]], using two soundstages, half of its [[backlot]], and 44 cameras.<ref name="adweek-cokesponsor" /> Set designer David Korins explained that the medium of a live, television musical would "really show off what theater does best, and also what film and television does best", having constructed a self-contained "cafegymatorium" set that is designed to provide an "immersive", 360-degree experience, as well as traditional theatrical-style stagings. ''Grease: Live'' was presented to live studio audiences at each of the three filming locations, who were also directly integrated into relevant scenes as extras on-stage, such as in crowds. Kail explained that he wanted to capture the "feeling" of the audiences at live stage productions, as there was "an energy and an undeniable vitality that real humans give back to real humans that are performing". ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' believed that the use of live audiences would help to stylistically distinguish ''Grease: Live'' from the NBC live musicals that it was patterned after.<ref name="thr-studioaudience" />

The price of a 30-second commercial during ''Grease: Live'' was set between $300,000 and $320,000. [[Coca-Cola]] was signed on as a major sponsor of the special; the sponsorship included [[product placement]] of classic Coca-Cola signage and beverages within the special (such as on a vending machine and on the diner set), and sponsored [[social media]] content.<ref name="adweek-cokesponsor">{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/grease-word-coke-fox-banks-first-live-musical-169290 |title=Fox Finds the Perfect Sponsor for Its 1950s-Era Grease Revival: Coca-Cola |last=Lynch |first=Jason |date=January 29, 2016 |website=Adweek |access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name="variety-cocacola">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/grease-live-coca-cola-tv-advertising-1201691992/ |title=Coca-Cola Hopes To Cut Through Fox's Live 'Grease' With Ad Play |last=Steinberg |first=Brian |date=January 29, 2016 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref> In order to be appropriate for broadcast television and to appease advertisers, several songs were edited for content; Platt stated that his goal was to make ''Grease: Live'' a "family-friendly" show, but still wanted to maintain "the appropriate edge" the musical required. Among the edits, "[[Greased Lightnin' (song)|Greased Lightnin']]" changed the lyrics to remove several profane and sexual words (edits that original songwriter [[Jim Jacobs]] had made to the officially licensed versions many years prior), while the Italian profanity "fongool" was replaced with "be cool" within "Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee".<ref name="vf-censor">{{Cite magazine |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |date=January 31, 2016 |title=Why Grease: Live Had to Censor Some of Its Most Famous Lyrics |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/01/grease-live-lyric-change-greased-lightning |magazine=Vanity Fair |publisher=Conde Nast |access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref>

====Weather issues====
The use of outdoor sets for portions of the production led to concerns that it could be affected by weather, especially in the wake of forecasts calling for a 100% chance of precipitation and possible thunderstorms on the day of the telecast. Kail stated that the production did have contingency plans in the event of rain, while Platt stated that his team had factored the possibility of rain into its plans for "many months", and that while safety was the highest priority, the show would still go on, rain or shine.<ref name="ew-alternate">{{cite web|title=Grease: Live producer on alternate opening, dedication to Vanessa Hudgens’ father|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/01/grease-live-producer-opening-vanessa-hudgens|date=February 1, 2016|last=Snetiker|first=Marc|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name="thr-greaseweather">{{cite web| title='Grease: Live' EP on Sunday Rain Forecast: "We're Fully Prepared"|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/grease-live-ep-rain-forecast-860278|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 29, 2016|last=Stanhope|first=Kate|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name="ew-rain">{{cite web|title=How Grease: Live plans to handle wet L.A. weather|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/31/grease-live-rain-weather-la|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Gomez|first=Patrick|date=January 31, 2016|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}</ref>

While prepared for the possibility of rain, wind was also a major factor: at around 3:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]], an hour before the telecast went live, Platt was informed that a particular structure on the outdoor set could not be used for safety reasons. By 3:40&nbsp;p.m. PT, while the team was in the process of re-staging the opening number to exclude the structure, the rain and wind passed, and engineers cleared the use of the structure—allowing a return to the original staging.<ref name="ew-alternate"/> The broadcast would ultimately feature references to the conditions: emcee [[Mario Lopez]] jokingly introduced "[[El Niño]]" as being a "special guest", while the opening number, "Grease (Is the Word)", was performed with the cast holding umbrellas,<ref name="deadline-review">{{cite web|title=With Spectacular ‘Grease Live’, Fox & Paramount Raise Bar On Live TV Presentations – Review|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/grease-live-review-1201693976/|website=Deadline Hollywood|last=Gerard|first=Jeremy|date=January 31, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref> and during a discussion about having a live broadcast at Rydell High, Principal McGee ([[Ana Gasteyer]]) quipped, "Let's just hope it doesn't rain."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/grease-live-preview-final-rehearsal-1201693213/| title='Grease Live': Inside the Final Dress Rehearsal|work=Variety|last=Birnbaum|first=Debra|date=January 31, 2016|access-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>

====Death of Greg Hudgens====
On the day of the broadcast, Vanessa Hudgens announced on [[Twitter]] that her father, Greg, had died of cancer the night before, and that she would dedicate her performance in ''Grease: Live'' to his memory.<ref name="latimes-hudgensfather">{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-vanessa-hudgens-dad-dies-grease-live-dedication-20160201-story.html |title=Vanessa Hudgens dedicates 'Grease: Live' to her father, who died a day before the show |last=Saad |first=Nardine |date=February 1, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/grease-live-stars-father-passes-away-but-she-says-i-do-the-show-in-his-honor-383219# |title=Grease: Live Star's Father Passes Away, But She Says, "I Do The Show In His Honor" |last=Gioia |first=Michael |date=January 31, 2016 |work=[[Playbill]] |access-date=November 26, 2018}}</ref> Platt told ''Entertainment Weekly'' that he was "fiercely proud" of Hudgens' handling of the situation, describing her as a "very determined young woman" who "knows that the show has to go on, as any actor of the theater or in a live event knows. So she decided she would take her feelings of loss and sadness and put them in a box for that afternoon, that she would use them to fuel her performance and she would do it in honor of her father."<ref name="ew-alternate"/> Additionally, Fox and Paramount allowed the production to be dedicated in memory of Greg; Platt went on to say that "the cast was behind her and we all joined hands and said, 'We're going to live in this moment. Sometimes life interferes. But you have all worked so hard for this moment and we're going to go for it.'"<ref name="ew-alternate"/>

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''Grease: Live'' received mostly positive reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] listed the special with a 91% rating based on 34 reviews, and an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus states that "''Grease: Live'' took the pressure and threw away conventionality — it belongs to yesterday. There was a chance that it could make it so far; we started believin' we can be who we are. ''Grease: Live'' is the word."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grease_live/ | title=Grease: Live! (2016) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] listed a weighted average of 74 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/grease-live|title=Grease: Live Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref>

Megan Vick of ''[[TV Guide]]'' felt that Kail had "upped the standard" for live television musicals, and had "successfully managed to combine all the nostalgic elements of ''Grease'' that everyone expected while creating a new experience. The set changes and scale of what they were able to accomplish—in a rainstorm no less—were incredibly impressive. Grease is the word, and ratings most likely will be too." While praising "All I Need Is an Angel" for demonstrating Carly Rae Jepsen's capabilities as a singer, Vick felt that the song was too modern for a musical that is set in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/grease-live-hits-misses-freddy-my-love-thunder-road-race |title=Grease: Live!

[[File:Vanessa Hudgens PCA 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Vanessa Hudgens]] received widespread acclaim for her performance and professionalism as her father had died the day before the live show.]]

Jeremmy Gerald of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' noted that ''Grease: Live'' was broadcast "with nary a hitch and one last-minute change in the out-of-doors opening number that paid tribute to the greatest movie musical of all time, ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''". Acknowledging that none of NBC's live musicals had "hit the stratospheric highs of this show", aspects of the production were praised, such as the live audiences and stage design. Vanessa Hudgens was judged to have "stolen" the show, and that Aaron Tveit and Julianne Hough "couldn't be better matched as the head of the T Birds and the sweet new girl from Utah." In conclusion, Gerald felt that he had "never seen a more inventive interplay between a show and just enough of the mechanics of the deal to make it all the more engaging. That, and the audience that played its essential part in moving ''Grease Live'' along with enthusiastic applause replacing the dead air that followed key moments in the earlier live broadcasts, set a new standard for this kind of presentation that will be tough to top."<ref name="deadline-review"/>

''Variety''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan felt that the performance of Hough and Tveit was weak, explaining that "when Danny has all the presence of a glass of milk and even the black-clad Sandy of the final scenes exudes all the sexual danger of a church choir director, well, rest assured that those concerned about the ''Grease'' legacies of [[John Travolta|Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] have nothing to worry about." Despite this and other shortcomings, such as audio issues during "Hopelessly Devoted to You", and the "surreality" of the audience's presence in certain scenes, Ryan felt ''Grease: Live'' got "most of the big things right", and that "by incorporating a live audience, using creative staging and employing energetic camera work", the production "boasted an impressive sense of momentum and even spontaneity." Of the individual performances, Ryan praised Keke Palmer's, Hudgens', and Carly Rae Jepsen's vocal performances, Elle McLemore's "simply terrific" Patty, Kether Donahue's "infectious joy", and Ana Gasteyer's "beautifully droll timing" as Principal McGee. She concluded that "If Fox can get the lead casting right in future and snag Kail again, audiences will surely be hopelessly devoted to the network’s next live endeavor."<ref name="variety-review">{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=TV Review: ‘Grease Live!’|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/grease-live-review-fox-julianne-hough-aaron-tveit-1201693411|website=Variety|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref> Writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', Robert Bianco noted various positive and negative aspects of the broadcast. While he praised performances by the supporting cast, he lamented "the progressive dumbing-down of the material. A Broadway musical that originally spoofed our rose-tinted-glasses view of the '50s has turned into a nostalgic wallow, leaving the show with an odd mix of tones – and in this particular version, a book that sometimes seemed to get lost between songs and inside jokes. ... it was often so flatly acted" that the "kinetic", "visually impressive" musical numbers came as a "much-needed relief". Nevertheless, he felt that the production "sprang to life at the end."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/columnist/2016/01/31/review-grease-live-fox-musical-tv/79614800/ |title=Review: Visually impressive 'Grease: Live!' still slips |last=Bianco |first=Robert |date=January 31, 2016 |website=[[USA Today]] |access-date=November 26, 2018}}</ref>

===Ratings===
''Grease: Live'' was seen by 12.18 million viewers, with a 4.3/13 share in the 18–49 demographic, making it the most-watched program of the night. The special brought Fox its best ratings of the 2015–16 television season since the [[Empire (season 2)|second season]] premiere of ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' in September 2015, which was seen by 16.18 million viewers. The overall and demographic ratings also beat NBC's December 2015 presentation of ''The Wiz Live!'', with 6% higher viewership overall, and 30% higher 18-49 ratings. While both competed against [[NFL]] games, ''The Wiz'' competed against a regular-season ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' game on CBS, and ''Grease'' against the [[2016 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] on ESPN. Over 1.2 million [[Twitter]] posts were made throughout the airing, with most providing condolences for Hudgens' father.<ref name="deadline-ratings">{{cite web|title=‘Grease Live’ Demo Ratings Close In On ‘Sound Of Music Live!’ – Update|url=http://deadline.com/2016/02/grease-live-ratings-vanessa-hudgens-fox-probowl-the-wiz-thes-sound-of-music-1201694028/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref> An encore of ''Grease: Live'' on March 27, 2016, [[Easter|Easter Sunday]],<ref>{{cite web|title=FOX to Air Special 'Tweet Along' Encore of GREASE: LIVE This Sunday|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/FOX-to-Air-Special-Tweet-Along-Encore-of-GREASE-LIVE-This-Sunday-20160325|website=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> was seen by 1.54 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunday final ratings: ’60 Minutes’ adjusts up, everything else holds|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2016/03/29/sunday-final-ratings-march-27-2016/|author=Rick Porter|website=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>
