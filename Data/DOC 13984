The '''Rio Grande Hydroelectric Complex''' is a [[pumped-storage]] [[hydroelectric]] power station in the [[Calamuchita Department]] of [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba Province]], [[Argentina]]. The complex consists of two dams and a power station in the Cerro Pelado Valley. Aside from power generation, the complex also serves to control floods and provide [[municipal water]]. The two dams on the [[Tercero River]] are the '''Cerro Pelado Dam''' which forms the upper reservoir and the '''Arroyo Corto Dam''' which forms the lower reservoir. The Cerro Pelado dam is {{Convert|104|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|410.5|m}} long while the Arroyo Corto is {{Convert|50|m}} tall and {{Convert|1500|m}} in length. Water from the upper reservoir is sent to the [[underground power station]] during periods of high power demand. The power station contains four {{convert|187.5|MW}} reversible [[Francis turbine]]-generators. Water from the power station is discharged into the lower reservoir. During periods of lower power demand such as at night, water is pumped with the same turbines back up to the upper reservoir for use in peak hours. The difference in elevation between the two reservoirs affords a [[hydraulic head]] of {{Convert|185|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.panedile.com.ar/archivos/Hidraulicas-in.pdf | title=Hydroelectric power plants | publisher=Panedile | accessdate=28 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045358/http://www.panedile.com.ar/archivos/Hidraulicas-in.pdf | archivedate=29 April 2014 | df= }}</ref> Construction on the complex began in 1976 and the generators were commissioned in 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.epec.com.ar/generacion_central_h_rio-grande-historia.html | title=Historical Review | publisher=EPEC | accessdate=28 April 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref>
