{{Nihongo|'''Kanji Tatsumi'''|Â∑Ω ÂÆå‰∫å|Tatsumi Kanji|lead=yes}} is a fictional character introduced in the 2008 [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''[[Persona 4]]'' by [[Atlus]]. In the game Kanji is a high school student who becomes famous in television after fighting delinquents in the streets.

Kanji has received generally positive reception for his role in ''Persona 4'' including his Social Links where he undergoes character development. However, his ambiguous sexual preference has become one of the game's most controversial themes with several writers commenting on whether the game does a good job in explaining Kanji's personality.

==Concept and creation==
[[File:Kanjiearlydesigns.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early designs for Kanji]]

Early designs of Kanji were drastically different from the final one. He was initially given the classic gang-style pompadour. His design was made by Shigenori Soejima.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 Visual Data|publisher=Atlus|year=2008|page=29}}</ref> Both of Kanji's Personas are based on his own visual appearance.<ref name="Atlus">{{cite book|title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 Visual Data|publisher=Atlus|year=2008|page=66}}</ref>

Yu Namba, the ''Persona 4'' Project Lead for Atlus USA, commented that while Kanji's Shadow might offend some players due to it being a gay stereotype, Kanji was nothing like a stereotype. Kanji's sexual orientation was left ambiguous to all players.<ref name="1up.com"/> Namba added "We would like everyone to play through the game and come up with their own answers to that question; there is no official answer ... What matters is that Kanji's other self cries out, 'Accept me for who I am!' I think it's a powerful message which many, if not all of us can relate to."<ref name="gamasutra"/> Nich Maragos, ''Persona 4'' Editor for Atlus USA, agreed with Namba, but personally held the opinion that Kanji was homosexual.<ref name="gamasutra"/> The localization team of ''Persona 4'' made a point of keeping as true to the original translation as possible.<ref name="gamasutra"/> He cited Shadow Kanji's flamboyant personality and stated, "That flamboyance was also what the viewers of the Midnight Channel wanted to see: a typical gay person on TV that people would laugh at. The TV station broadcasts what the audience prefers to watch -- it's a stark portrayal of modern society."<ref name="gamasutra"/> Namba also made some scenes which involved Kanji's sexual orientation more subtle without removing the scenes' value.<ref name="gamasutra"/>

His sexual orientation remains ambiguous across the series, with Kanji being first interested in [[#Naoto Shirogane|Naoto Shirogane]] when first meeting her, believing her to be a boy, but is still attracted to her when it is revealed that she is a girl.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 |developer=Atlus |publisher=Atlus |date=2008-12-09 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Rise''': Silly Kanji.

Gamasutra's Xu noted that Kanji was one of the first video game characters to address his sexual identity in an "engaging and meaningful manner." She followed by stating that while he "may not be politically progressive enough to dub him the Harvey Milk of gaming ... his unique existence in ''Persona 4'' is a small and positive move forward toward a more socially diversified gaming universe."<ref name="gamasutra">{{cite web|title=Opinion: Sexuality And Homophobia In Persona 4 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22015 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |last=Xu |first=Samantha |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2014-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131552/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22015 |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}</ref> Brenda Brathwaite, author of "Sex in Video Games" stated: "It would have been amazing if they would have made a concrete statement that he is gay. That we could play as a gay main character in a video game would be a big deal." She added, "I can find twenty things that I didn't like about how Kanji was portrayed, such as the game's juvenile nature in dealing with his sexuality, but there is a part of me that is thrilled there is a gay character in a game and that a game would portray how they are dealing with their inner struggles and interactions with friends."<ref name="gamasutra"/> Dr. Antonia Levi, author of "Samurai from Outer Space: Understanding Japanese Animation", discussed the differences between homosexuality's acceptability in the United States versus Japan. She claimed that unlike the US, Japan had no legislation related to homosexuality and did not view sexuality as a matter of "right or wrong." She explained that this was the reason for Kanji's sexual ambiguity.<ref name="gamasutra"/> Xu cited Levi in her article to explain that Japanese people tend to be outwardly traditional, and their private sexual life is not judged. She stated, "For Kanji, working at his family's textile shop was a very traditional and respectable job, one that could have been at risk had he made a lifestyle choice to have an openly gay relationship with another man."<ref name="gamasutra"/> She further cited Japan scholar Dr. Mark McLelland, who stated that "recent research has shown, the notion of 'coming out' is seen as undesirable by many Japanese gay men and lesbians as it necessarily involves adopting a confrontational stance against mainstream lifestyles and values, which many still wish to endorse." Xu explains that this culture may explain that Kanji was not rejecting the existence of his homosexuality or that the developers were not homophobic.<ref name="gamasutra"/>

[[GameSpot]]'s Carolyn Petit felt that his depiction "leaves a great deal to be desired" and stated that it "rejects" Kanji's sexuality instead of "embracing" it. She stated that she was intrigued by the idea behind Kanji initially, but was disappointed that Kanji's "shadow self" was based on his fear of women rather than his attraction to men. She felt that this theme didn't make sense, given the imagery of his dungeon. She claimed that the rejection of Kanji's sexuality "sends the message that homosexuality is shameful and should not be accepted." She also criticized the handling of how Yosuke reacts to Kanji's sexuality, claiming that his homophobia toward Kanji was left unaddressed and uncriticized by the end of the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Denial of the Self: Queer Characters in Persona 4 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/denial-of-the-self-queer-characters-in-persona-4/1100-6404712/ |work=[[GameSpot]] |last=Petit |first=Carolyn |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209052106/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/denial-of-the-self-queer-characters-in-persona-4/1100-6404712/ |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}</ref> ''[[Metro Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sean Bugg felt that while elements of Kanji weren't homophobic, they weren't "exactly a PSA for tolerance, either."<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: 'Persona 4 Arena' |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/arts_entertainment/games/?ak=7655 |work=[[Metro Weekly]] |last=Bugg |first=Sean |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424130247/http://www.metroweekly.com/arts_entertainment/games/?ak=7655 |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}</ref>

Author Jordan Youngblood described Kanji and Naoto's depictions as "meta-commentary" on how players' engagement disrupts the "idealized vision of queer utopia." He discussed how players could participate in queer play and used it to examine how game theory and queer theory can interact in a discussion. He suggested that the steam in Kanji's dungeon represents "concealment and uncertainty." The use of the word "queer" by Shadow Kanji was described by Youngblood as a word used to describe Kanji's feelings of failure about not "living up to" women's views on masculinity rather than men's. He claimed that the two enemies in his battle were representative of [[Bara (genre)|bara]] and [[yaoi]]. He also discusses Kanji's attraction to Naoto, noting that despite his efforts to dissociate from a "queer path" he still feels attracted to a character similarly regarded as queer.<ref>{{cite web|title="C'mon!
