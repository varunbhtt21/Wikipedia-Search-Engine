Not a notable actor yet and page seems bias. Apparently only 1 film so far (which was just released as well) [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 01:31, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' One sentence article and one source.  Nothing shows notability or significant coverage in reliable sources.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 16:02, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Redirect''' to [[Hrudaya Kaleyam]] and fix either the spelling of this name, or the spelling of the name there. --[[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|<sup><small><i>talk</i></small></sup>]] 17:11, 26 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Article is completely promotional and coverage is low. [[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 19:47, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
*:{{ping|Mr. Guye}} Neither of those is a valid deletion reason.  — [[User:Arthur Rubin|Arthur Rubin]]  [[User talk:Arthur Rubin|(talk)]] 21:01, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
::{{ping|Arthur Rubin}} My point was that the article has too little coverage to meet [[WP:NACTOR]], and promotional material is not allowed under [[WP:DEL-REASON]]. --[[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 21:09, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
:::{{ping|Mr. Guye}} The correct reason for your !vote would be "disregarding promotional material, there is inadequate coverage in reliable sources."  Except you have a broader idea of "promotional material" than I do, and mine seems a little more extensive than the general [[WP:CONSENSUS]].  — [[User:Arthur Rubin|Arthur Rubin]]  [[User talk:Arthur Rubin|(talk)]] 21:21, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per [[WP:BLP]].  Essentially, this is an unreferenced biography, because [[WP:RS|neither source is reliable]]. Even if everything were true, it is so badly written and sourced as [[WP:TNT|to require blowing up]]. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 15:53, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''  No reliable sources to even get a passing claim at notability.  Even if there were, the article itself has serious [[WP:BLP]] issues.
