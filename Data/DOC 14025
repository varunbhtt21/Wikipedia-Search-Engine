*Same edits: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pashtun_people&diff=602834039&oldid=602833639 diff1] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pashtun_people&diff=603393768&oldid=603327629 diff2]. I guess one user operate both accounts. Because of same edits, same behavior, same POVs, and same acitivty on [[Pashtun people]] article.
*Also, please see [[Talk:Pashtun people]] (Sections: Semi-protected edit request on 14 March 2014 and 19 March 2014). It seems that this user registered two accounts to edit that article after unsuccessful edit requests. [[User:Zyma|Zyma]] ([[User talk:Zyma|talk]]) 17:30, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::*{{adminnote}} I'm not surprised by the CU result (the result that Mintoo44 and Barakzai1919 are unrelated). Barakzai1919 and Mintoo44 may have similar points of view, but they have very different ways of communicating. Barakzai1919 seems much more comfortable with the English language than Mintoo44. Mintoo44 is the older account, so I'm blocking Mooch025 indefinitely as a sockpuppet, and blocking Mintoo44 for a month. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 21:19, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*Oh yeah, since we've now established that Mintoo44 is the sockmaster in this case and Barakzai1919 is unrelated, I'm changing the sockmaster above and I'm requesting this be archived under Mintoo44 for future reference. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 22:23, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
