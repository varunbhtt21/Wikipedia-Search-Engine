Cookiecutteramaru has been inserting the same piece of paleontological research into a number of dinosaur-related articles. When the insertion of the source was met with considerable opposition from long-term paleo editors, three new accounts popped up within hours of one another to support the original insertion. The original discussion is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Dinosaurs#.22The_Journal_of_Paleontological_Sciences.22 here] and diffs of supporting new accounts can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Dinosaurs&diff=prev&oldid=604953373] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Dinosaurs&diff=prev&oldid=604833966] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Dinosaurs&diff=prev&oldid=604805347]. The three new accounts have no other edits that are not in support of adding this paper.

One of the new accounts [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Dinosaurs&diff=prev&oldid=605085658 denies] being a sock, and other long-term editors have suggested a checkuser is needed to find out what's going on: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Dinosaurs&diff=prev&oldid=605015901] Instead of us continuing to argue about this, I think it would be better for an admin to give a definite answer about whether these accounts are the same person.

*{{adminnote}} That's enough for me. The fact that Oviraptorbill was created a day after the other two sockpuppets, and immediately leaped into the same discussion, that's a pretty clear sign for me. It looks from this editor's contributions that they are here to spread [[WP:FRINGE|fringe]], poorly-sourced or unsourced information, and are willing to use multiple accounts to push it. I'm blocking the whole lot of them indefinitely. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">щан</span>]] 20:35, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
**In an unblock request they're stating they're [[WP:BROTHER|family members]]. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 05:02, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
