*Obvious duck, blocked.  {{reply to|MER-C}}, this might need to go through CCI again, I'm afraid. Leaving open for opinions on whether a fresh CCI on the sock is needed. [[User:Courcelles|Courcelles]] 16:54, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:*All the remaining edits are trivial, so recycling the CCI is not necessary. The copyvios were in substantial edits of biographies of darts players, which the sockpuppet has not engaged in. [[User:MER-C|MER-C]] 11:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*Thanks, MER-C; then, we're done here.  [[User:Courcelles|Courcelles]] 16:46, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
