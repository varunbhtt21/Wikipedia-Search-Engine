This is a procedural opening of SPI before I block socks based on [[WP:DUCK]].  Evidence is as follows:

#*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gabe_Gabler&diff=596992560&oldid=590073246 TyTyKKWIki adds dubious info about person's cause of death]

Note that sockpuppet Tylkrby767 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tylkrby767&diff=606125013&oldid=606098141 received a final warning for disruptive editing], which applies to TyTyKKWIki and their future editing.

Another procedural SPI before blocking based on [[WP:DUCK]] the latest of multiple accounts for TyTyKKWIki.  Redsfan21 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Redsfan21&diff=606684764&oldid=606684510 provided tip about Tylkrby7677].  Name is similar to {{userlinks|Tylkrby767}}, blocked earlier as a sock, and also shares same interests of userboxes on user page of being a fan of Kansas Jayhawks and Kansas City Royals.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tylkrby767&oldid=606254987][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tylkrby7677&oldid=603869526] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tylkrby7677&diff=603868827&oldid=603868419 Tylkrby7677 was warned about providing proper notification about multiple accounts].  While [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tylkrby7677&diff=603900623&oldid=603880153 Tylkrby7677 claims on April 12 17:14 that they lost their password to Tylkrby767], Tylkrby767 edit history clearly shows edits at April 12 17:17 and later.

Redsfan21 is a new user created on April 30, a day after Tylkrby767 was blocked as a sock.  Suspicious that a new user is able to identify this specific sock so quickly.  Behaviorally, Tylkrby767 had a tendency to paste other users' signatures when addressing them on talk pages [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Teahouse/Questions&diff=prev&oldid=606241116][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bagumba&diff=prev&oldid=606028757]  as does Redsfan21.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Reddogsix&diff=prev&oldid=606683606][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ZappaOMati&diff=prev&oldid=606566978] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tylkrby767&oldid=606254987 Tylkrby767's user page] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Redsfan21&oldid=606702892 Redfan21's] share interest in Cincinnati Reds, Kansas Jayhawks, and Iron Bowl. —[[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]] ([[User talk:Bagumba|talk]]) 06:28, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*{{admin-note}} Sockpuppets indefinitely blocked and tagged.  Sockmaster TyTyKKWIki, previously unblocked in the last sockpuppet sweep, is now indefintely blocked and tagged as user has shown no interest in using one account.—[[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]] ([[User talk:Bagumba|talk]]) 06:55, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*{{admin-note}} CU requested to check for sleepers, as Tylkrby7677 was not caught before, and user is continuing to create new socks like Redsfan21.—[[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]] ([[User talk:Bagumba|talk]]) 06:55, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

Another procedural SPI before blocking based on [[WP:DUCK]].  Ran into this account while undoing non-constructive edits. Similarities include continuing to paste other users' signatures when addressing them on talk pages[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cincao03&diff=prev&oldid=612356458][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cincao03&diff=prev&oldid=612123327], similar to [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/TyTyKKWIki/Archive#02_May_2014|behavior of previously reported socks]]. User is drafting [[Draft:Kelly Oubre]], same subject as the twice speedily deleted [[Kelly Oubre]] that was created by sock [[User:Redsfan21]] before.  User box on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cincao03&oldid=612698852 their user page] lists a "real name" that is similar to usernames of past socks. —[[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]] ([[User talk:Bagumba|talk]]) 18:57, 13 June 2014 (UTC)
