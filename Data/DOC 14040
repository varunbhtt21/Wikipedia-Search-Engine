The '''TREX Regional Exchanges Oy''' ('''TREX''') operates an [[Internet exchange point]] in [[Tampere]], [[Finland]].
TREX was established in 2002 and traffic on its first switch started in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.trex.fi/change.html | title = TREX Change Log | accessdate = 28 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.digitoday.fi/mobiili/2003/09/12/tampereelta-lisavauhtia-internet-yhdysliikenteeseen/200310991/66 | title = Digitoday article on creation of TREX | accessdate = 18 June 2014}}</ref> TREX was preceded by some local private peering arrangements between its initial members since the 1990s. TREX is a member of the [[European Internet Exchange Association]].

TREX is a [[Osakeyhti√∂|company]] that provides Internet exchange point services to connected Internet operators. This differs from many other [[IXP]]s which are associations that Internet operators join as members in order to connect and exchange traffic.

TREX tries to provide both a service platform and a research platform for the Internet and they have taken part in a number of research projects over the years.<ref>

TREX also tries to promote the adoption of new Internet technologies.
E.g. TREX provides public
[[Teredo tunneling|Teredo server and relay]] and [[NAT64]] test services
as a result of some past and present research projects.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.trex.fi/research.html | title = TREX Research | accessdate = 28 April 2014}}</ref>

== Network ==

The primary TREX switch is an [[Arista Networks]] low-latency 10Gbit/s cut-through switch. Connecting ISPs bring their own [[Small form-factor pluggable transceiver|SFP]] or [[SFP+]] module to match their connection choices such as speed, distance and [[Wavelength division multiplexing]].

There are a number of smaller secondary switches, which are mostly used for TREX's services and a couple of ISPs connecting over [[1000Base-T]].

== TREX Workshops ==

TREX also hosts annual [[Internet network operators' group]] meetings called '''TREX Workshops''', in Tampere. These are currently the only open gatherings for [[ISPs]] and the [[peering]] community in Finland. The seminar topics change from year to year, but the presentations are always in English so that the seminar is also approachable by international visitors.
