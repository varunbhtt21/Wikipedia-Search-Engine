The result was    '''merge to [[Beresfield railway station]]'''. The strongest arguments about having a separate article reflect discussions of WP:EVENT, and show a consensus against.  No strong argument was made against including some material at the station, nor the creation of a redirect.

*'''Delete''' It's sad that four people were injured as a result of this accident (three of them seriously), but it has not had lasting significance. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 10:42, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Just because there were no deaths does not mean that the accident isnt notable. Sure, death give weight to the case for notability, but they are not a requirement. That said, the main reason that the accident is notable enough to sustain an article is that it resulted in a change of procedure by the train operator.

*'''Delete''' per nom, Fails EVENT & is a non notable incident. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 19:40, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*<s>'''Delete'''</s> A change in procedures by a single regional operator is not a significant lasting effect per [[WP:EVENT]]. National industry-wide changes would be, but almost every accident report produces some local recommendation. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 10:38, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge''' as above (to [[Beresfield railway station]]). I struck out my delete because it's already discussed in the railway station article so merge or at least redirect is best. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 13:38, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
