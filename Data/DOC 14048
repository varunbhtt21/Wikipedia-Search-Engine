Title : List of Prince Edward Island by-elections
Text : The list of Prince Edward Island by-elections includes every by-election held in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island since 1873. By-elections occur whenever there is a vacancy in the [[Prince Edward Island Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], although an imminent general election may allow the vacancy to remain until the dissolution of parliament. Until 1932 incumbent members were required to recontest their seats upon being appointed to Cabinet. These Ministerial by-elections were almost always uncontested.
