:* '''ALT1''':<s>... that footballer '''[[Choo Seng Quee]]''' was a British agent during [[World War II]]?</s>
:* ''Comment'': Choo retired as a player in 1949 so '''ALT1''' is technically correct too. [[User:LRD NO|LRD NO]] ([[User talk:LRD NO|talk]]) 01:39, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::* '''ALT2''':<s>... that Malayan Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] declared that '''[[Choo Seng Quee]]'''{{`s}} intended resignation as national football coach to be a definite "calamity"?</s>

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Article has appropriate length, is new, and is within policy. There are plenty of sources and they all look to be in good order. As for the hook, it is fantastic. It pulled me in and made me, a casual reader, want to review this. However, in the article, the hook is mentioned in barely two sentences that are paragraphs apart. The newspaper article used as the source offers more information, so more information should be used. Is it about his career as a footballer? Not necessarily, but the information in those two sentences could really makes the article stand out if it were expanded just a little bit. With another source or two, Choo's time as a propagandist/agent could even get its own subsection, in my opinion. So, how about expanding on those two sentences?

::* Thank you for taking time to review the nomination, [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]]. I am glad you like the hook. I have expanded on the section covered by the hook with more details from the articles. Shame Choo didn't get to publish his autobiography or I could have included more information on his life. [[User:LRD NO|LRD NO]] ([[User talk:LRD NO|talk]]) 10:16, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Agreed. It would be wonderful to know more about his work for the British. Maybe that mystery makes him all the more interesting. Anyhow, great article and great DYK! [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]] ([[User talk:Mvblair|talk]]) 10:51, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Which hook is desired/approved?  There are 3 choices and it isn't clear which of the three was being discussed. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 03:30, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:*The first hook. [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]] ([[User talk:Mvblair|talk]]) 13:38, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] I was going to add a tick, but first had to add the specific fact to the article from FN11 that he was a British agent (writing propaganda is not necessarily the same thing). I've also struck the two unapproved hooks.
