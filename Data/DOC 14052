'''Delete''' - Collegiate coaches and players are not inherently notable per [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tennis/Article_guidelines#Notability Project Tennis]. A slew of these Cal State Fullerton persons were created in recent days including: [[Stan Kula]], [[Ernest Becker (director of athletics)|Ernest Becker]], [[Craig Neslage]], [[Steve White (tennis)|Steve White]], [[Tom Ashley (tennis coach)|Tom Ashley]], [[Mark Kabacy]], [[Brad Allen]], [[Bill Etchegaray]], and [[Neale R.

*'''Delete''' Fails GNG.  Just being a college coach is not enough to show notability.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 16:14, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
