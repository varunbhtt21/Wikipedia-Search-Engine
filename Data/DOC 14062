The [[Allmusic]] review recommended the album awarding it 4 stars and stating "the two obscure sessions on this Xanadu set were pianist Walter Bishop Jr.'s only dates as a leader during the 1964-70 period... Throughout, Walter Bishop Jr. plays at his most creative, extending the bebop tradition during the enjoyable performances".<ref name="Allmusic">Yanow, S., [http://www.allmusic.com/album/bish-bash-mw0000875810 Allmusic Review] accessed April 29, 2014</ref>
