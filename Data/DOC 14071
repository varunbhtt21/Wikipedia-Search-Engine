*'''Delete''' - Collegiate coaches and players are not inherently notable per [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tennis/Article_guidelines#Notability Project Tennis]. A slew of these Cal State Fullerton persons were created in recent days including: [[Stan Kula]], [[Ernest Becker (director of athletics)|Ernest Becker]], [[Bob Osborn (Tennis)|Bob Osborn]], [[Steve White (tennis)|Steve White]], [[Tom Ashley (tennis coach)|Tom Ashley]], [[Mark Kabacy]], [[Brad Allen]], [[Craig Neslage]], and [[Neale R. Stoner]]. Perhaps more. [[User:Fyunck(click)|Fyunck(click)]] ([[User talk:Fyunck(click)|talk]]) 17:58, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Fails GNG.  Just being a college coach is not enough to show notability.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 16:15, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Fails GNG, fails WP:Tennis notability guidelines.--[[User:Wolbo|Wolbo]] ([[User talk:Wolbo|talk]]) 13:04, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
