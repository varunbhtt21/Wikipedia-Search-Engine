'''Delete''' - Collegiate coaches and players are not inherently notable per [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tennis/Article_guidelines#Notability Project Tennis] and [[WP:NCOLLATH]]. A slew of these Cal State Fullerton persons were created in recent days including: [[Stan Kula]], [[Ernest Becker (director of athletics)|Ernest Becker]], [[Bob Osborn (Tennis)|Bob Osborn]], [[Steve White (tennis)|Steve White]], [[Tom Ashley (tennis coach)|Tom Ashley]], [[Mark Kabacy]], [[Brad Allen]], [[Bill Etchegaray]], and [[Craig Neslage]].

*'''Comment''' The article has an unsourced claim that he coached San Diego St. to the national golf championship.  If true, wouldn't that be enough to show notability?[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 16:18, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::My thoughts would be no, but maybe check with the Golf Project and what is deemed notable. Players from the Penn State national champion volleyball team, or UCLA water polo team aren't inherently notable. They might be if they are a standout and get enough press... but the coaches? I guess it just depends. He is also an Athletic Director but are athletic directors automatically notable at wikipedia? That's out of my wikipedia comfort zone so others will have to determine that aspect. I would say they are not inherently notable.

*'''Delete''' Just being a college coach doesn't make him notable.  It turns out that the article's comment about leading the golf team "to the NCAA championship" meant they qualified for the tournament not that they won it.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 15:46, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Stoner is a former NCAA Division I head men's basketball coach and athletic director.  Just about any—if not every single—NCAA Division I head men's basketball coach or athletic director is going to be notable and a [https://www.google.com/search?q=neal%20stoner%20site:news.google.com/newspapers&source=newspapers#q=neale+stoner+site:news.google.com%2Fnewspapers cursory news search] for Neale shows him to be no exception.

::Almost all those tiny articles are about one incident... his resignation for improper gifting. I'm not sure I'd call that notable. I guess it's for the college sports projects to let us know if being an athletic director is always notable. He ain't for anything tennis that's for sure.

*'''Keep'''. He's notable for being a head athletic director at two Division I universities. There have also been articles written about him from independent, major news sources. [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-07-13/sports/8801140773_1_augie-garrido-fish-story-football-coach This] by the ''Chicago Tribune'' and [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-06/sports/sp-624_1_executive-director this] by the ''Los Angeles Times'', for example, and I only searched for three minutes. [[User:Jrcla2|Jrcla2]] ([[User talk:Jrcla2|talk]]) 13:08, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I actually found quite a number of stories about Stoner when I searched Google's historical newspaper archive (which they make very hard to find these days): [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22neale%20stoner%22%20site:news.google.com/newspapers&source=newspapers#q=%22neale+stoner%22+site:news.google.com/newspapers&start=0 here they are].  It's true that many of them are from when he was Illinois AD, but that was also his highest profile job (Athletic Director at a top 25ish D1 athletic program) and a lot of his other significant coaching experience was in the 60s and 70s where it is harder to find sources online.  He's been an AD at a significant University, was embroiled in a public controversy that received national press (because of the profile of that University), was a head coach in college basketball which generally gets significant coverage.  I say he's notable. [[User:Rikster2|Rikster2]] ([[User talk:Rikster2|talk]]) 15:24, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
