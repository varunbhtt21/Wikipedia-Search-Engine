'''Boguila''' is a town located in the [[Central African Republic]] [[Prefectures of the Central African Republic|prefecture]] of [[Ouham-Pendé]].

According to [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]],
<blockquote>
Since the coup d’état in March 2013, Boguila has been unstable with increasing tensions and violence. In August 2013, a peak of violence provoked a massive population displacement in the area. In December 2013, Muslims fleeing violence from Nana Bakassa sought refuge with host families in Boguila before moving further north.<ref name = "medicinssansfrontieres" />
</blockquote>

Between January and October 2013, approximately 95,000 people in the areas surrounding the town received treatment for [[malaria]].<ref>{{Cite web
