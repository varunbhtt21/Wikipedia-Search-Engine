== Review of [[Draft:LY-404,039]] ==

Hey Wikipedia,

I didn't realize how to submit my changes to the existing stub--- so this is not a new page to be submitted, I just submitted my changes to the existing page! So please disregard this submission for a page creation.

Thanks,

:Hi [[User:AGuha 175|AGuha 175]], please add <nowiki>{{db-user}}</nowiki> to the draft page so that it can be deleted as "no longer needed by the creator".  [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 14:38, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Abnormal psychology]]

The sentences I was contributing to an existing paragraph came from a textbook. It is from the Abnormal Psychology 6th edition. Is there something wrong with that?

:You can't copy material from a copyrighted source into Wikipedia, see [[WP:COPYPASTE]]. In addition, if you're preparing material in your sandbox preparatory to contributing it to an existing article, you don't need to submit it to Articles for Creation, since it is not going to be a new article. --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 16:56, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/D. B. Keele, Jr.]] ==

HI,
I'm confused on the status of my submission. It has been about three weeks. At the top it says not currently submitted for review. At the bottom it says "review waiting" two different times. Thank you for your insight.

:The status of your submission is declined. This is because I just now declined it. The surplus "review waiting" templates have been removed. Thank you for your contributions! --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 23:49, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
