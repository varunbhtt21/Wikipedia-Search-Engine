Title : Runting-stunting syndrome in broilers
Text : {{jargon|date=July 2018}}
'''Runting-stunting syndrome in broilers''' is a [[syndrome]] described in [[broiler]]s since the 1940s, but often with specific etiological appellations ([[viral enteritis]], [[malabsorption syndrome]], [[brittle bone disease]], [[infectious proventriculitis]], [[helicopter disease]] and [[pale bird syndrome]]). It consists of [[stunted growth]] in birds, which is clearly visible in the second month of growth (30â€“42 days).

== Symptoms ==
The mortality of the flock is unaffected, but a certain proportion of birds (1 to 10 percent) show decreased body weights ("runts") and elevated feed conversion. This leads to reduced uniformity of the flock.

== Aetiology ==
Causing agents may include:
* [[virus]]es: [[reovirus]] (often considered as unique cause), [[adenovirus]]es, [[enterovirus]]es, [[rotavirus]]es, [[parvovirus]]es. 
* [[bacteria]] like [[Escherichia coli]], [[Proteus mirabilis]], [[Enterococcus faecium]], [[Staphylococcus cohnii]], [[Clostridium perfringens]], [[Bacteroides fragilis]] and [[Bacillus licheniformis]], often isolated in affected birds.<ref>http://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/1110/runtingstunting-syndrome-in-broilers</ref>

== Control ==
Reovirus [[vaccine]]s are advocated (in dams or in broilers) but do not entirely solve the problem.

General [[hygiene]] and correct breeding conditions (especially correct brooding temperatures) may be efficient, but the disease often disappears as it had appeared, which makes it difficult to appreciate the effectiveness of control measures.
