'''Mercurio J. Martinez, Jr.''', often known as '''Merc Martinez''' (born July 25, 1937), is an educator, [[ranch]]er, and [[business]]man from his native [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Texas]]. From 1991 to 2002, he was the [[County Judge]] of [[Webb County, Texas|Webb County]] in [[South Texas]].

==Background==

Martinez was one of two children born at the age of sixty-three to Mercurio Martinez, Sr. (1876-1965), and his third wife, the 42-year-old former Cristina Treviño. The senior Martinez was a descendant of [[Spain|Spanish]]-[[Mexico|Mexican]] pioneers who had settled on the banks of the [[Rio Grande River]] in the mid-eighteenth century. An educator and public official in his native [[Zapata County, Texas|Zapata County]], Martinez subsequently practiced law in Laredo until 1942, when he retired at the age of sixty-six. He continued to associate with other lawyers on occasional cases dealing with land ownership and engaged in historical research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/tamucush/00083/tamu-00083.html|title=Inventory of the Mercurio Martinez Papers|publisher=[[Texas A&M University]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> The younger sister of Martinez, Jr., is named Rosa, which is also the name of his wife, the former Rosa Ancira, whom he married in 1959. Mercurio and Rosa Martinez have six children, Leticia, Adriana, Mercurio, III, Jorge, Carlos, and Rosalycia.<ref name=lisd/>

Martinez, Jr., was reared in the downtown La Azteca neighborhood of Laredo and graduated from [[Saint Augustine High School (Laredo, Texas)|St. Augustine High School]], then located downtown in the [[San Agustin de Laredo Historic District]] adjacent to the [[Cathedral of San Agustin (Laredo, Texas)|Cathedral of San Agustin]]. He studied at [[Laredo Community College|Laredo Junior College]], renamed in 1993 as [[Laredo Community College]].<ref name=bio/> He was exempt from [[conscription]] in the 1960s because he was a married father.<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/voces/template-stories-indiv.html?work_urn=urn%3Autlol%3Awwlatin.717&work_title=Martinez%2C+Mercurio|title=Vidushi Shrimali, "Mercurio Martinez, Jr."|publisher=lib.utexas.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> From 1968 to 1978, Martinez was trustee of LJC and its parent organization, the [[Laredo Independent School District]].<ref name=tamiudocument/> This was an era where the "Patron Party" ruled all local governmental entities providing political favors in return for loyalty and votes.<ref name="Patron Democracy">{{cite book|last1=Piñon|first1=Fernando|title=Patron Democracy|date=1985|publisher=Contraste}}</ref> He has served since 2004 on the elected LCC board. He received his [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] in 1959 from [[St. Mary's University, Texas|St. Mary's University]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. He procured a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from the [[University of North Texas]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]]. He did post-graduate study at [[Southern Methodist University]] near [[Dallas]], [[Colorado State University]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], and the [[Harvard University School of Business]].<ref name=lisd/>

Martinez was an LJC business and economics instructor from c. 1960 until 1967, when he joined Union National Bank of Laredo, since [[Wells Fargo]] near City Hall.<ref name=bio>"2014 honoree: Mercurio Martinez, Jr.: Former councilman, county judge to receive higher education award for community work," ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', February 6, 2014, p. 4D.</ref>

==Political life==

In 1978, Martinez was elected to the Laredo City Council, a nominally [[nonpartisan]] position. At the same time, [[Aldo Tatangelo]] was elected [[mayor]] to succeed the retiring [[J. C. Martin (Texas politician)|J. C. "Pepe" Martin]] of the former "Independent Club" or "Patron Party", who subsequently spent time in the Webb County Jail for theft of municipal services.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/wmiqt|title=Independent Club|encyclopedia=[[The Handbook of Texas]]|accessdate= April 27, 2012}}</ref> Martinez worked on the council to change the city government from "strong mayor" to "weak mayor" format through a new municipal charter.<ref name=bio/> After a brief time on the council, he was asked by [[U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]], a fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], to head the Southwest Regional Office in Dallas of the [[Small Business Administration]]. During this stint, he lived in Dallas on weekdays but returned to Laredo most weekends.<ref name=interview/>

In 1982, Martinez returned to Laredo to run for mayor against Tatangelo, and though he had led in the primary, he lost in the [[runoff election]].<ref name=tamiudocument>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/oatah/rmendiola/documents/MercurioMartinezJr..pdf|title=Mercurio Martinez, Jr.|publisher=tamiu.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Martinez was "considered the best Old Party (Patron) candidate to reclaim the mayorship" in Fernando Piñon's book titled Patron Democracy.<ref name="Patron Democracy"/> In 1990, he was elected county judge, having unseated the incumbent Andres "Andy" Ramos. Though he had no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent in the [[general election]], former Mayor Tatangelo, at the age of seventy-seven, opposed his former mayoral rival Martinez for county judge as a [[write-in]] candidate. Martinez still prevailed with some 75 percent of the votes cast, but the county Republican leadership, headed by [[Esther Buckley]], endorsed Tatangelo. After three terms as county judge, Martinez was unseated in the 2002 Democratic primary by [[Louis H. Bruni]], a former member of the Laredo City Council from District 2. Thereafter, beginning in the fall of 2003, Martinez began teaching accounting at [[Texas A&M International University]] in Laredo.<ref name=bio/><ref>Louis H. Bruni served only one term as county judge, having been defeated in 2006 by [[Danny Valdez]], who was himself defeated after two terms by former professional [[baseball]] player [[Tano Tijerina]] in 2014.</ref>

In 2006, Martinez ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to represent Texas House District 42, having  been defeated by the incumbent and still serving [[Richard Raymond (Texas politician)|Richard Raymond]] of Laredo. In the primary Raymond fell .07 percent plus one vote short of an outright victory. He finished first with 11,806 votes (49.8 percent); Martinez trailed with 7,650 (32.3 percent). Two other contenders held the remaining 17.9 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |title=2006 Democratic Party Primary Election: 3/7/2006 |publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109062336/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |archivedate=January 9, 2014 |df= }}</ref> In the runoff in April 2006, Raymond prevailed, 8,828 votes (57.8 percent) to 6,456 (42.2 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |title=Democratic Party Primary Runoff Election Results |date=April 11, 2006 |publisher=Texas Secretary of State |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109062336/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |archivedate=January 9, 2014 |df= }}</ref> Oddly, in 2005, Martinez  contributed $1,000 to Raymond's proposed run for the [[United States House of Representatives]], a race that never materialized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/elec2/06/elec-LAREDO-TX-06.html|title=LAREDO, Texas (TX) Political Contributions by Individuals|publisher=city-data.com|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

In 2016, Martinez ran for reelection for the Laredo Community College board of trustees and was challenged by educator, author, and political activist Justin Allen Hundsnurscher.  He won reelection with 61.89% of the vote or 28,723 votes against Hundsnurscher's 17,687 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laredo.edu/cms/LCC/News_and_Events/News/ImageRotation/content/2016/Nov/Election_results/ |title=LCC Board of Trustees 2016 Election Results }}</ref>

In 2017, the still staunchly Democratic Martinez emerged as one of the first persons in Webb County to endorse [[Beto O'Rourke]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] for [[Texas' 16th congressional district]], who unsuccessfully challenged Republican [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Cruz]] in the general election held on [[United States Senate election in Texas, 2018|November 6, 2018]]. Martinez claimed that Cruz has "alienated the majority of the senators ... We cannot afford somebody that has alienated the Senate that way. I've always felt that politics is the act of compromise. Let's reach a middle ground. In my opinion, Beto O'Rourke has that ability."  Martinez said at a campaign stop that he sees no reason why O'Rourke won't match [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 90 percent margin in Webb County in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lmtonline.com/local/politics/article/U-S-congressman-Beto-O-Rourke-returns-to-11723174.php|author=Julia Wallace|title=U.S. Congressman Beto O’Rourke returns to Laredo, hits up Palenque Grill|newspaper=Laredo Morning Times|date=August 1, 2017|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> However, though he ran strongly in large urban center and South Texas, O'Rourke finished with 48 percent of the vote but 71 percent in Webb County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elections.sos.state.tx.us/index.htm|title=Texas Election Returns|date=November 6, 2018|publisher=[[Texas Secretary of State]]|accessdate=July 15, 2019}}</ref>

==Honors==

In 2014, Martinez was honored with the "Higher Education Award" by the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], formally presented as part of the [[Washington's Birthday Celebration]] in Laredo.<ref name=bio/> He is a past recipient of the [[Paul P. Harris|Paul Harris]] Award from [[Rotary International]], the St. George and Silver Beaver medals from the [[Boy Scouts of America]], the Tejano Achiever Award from LULAC, and "Distinguished Alumni" in 2001 of Laredo Community College.<ref name=lisd>{{cite web|url=http://www.laredoisd.org/departments/tds/cabm.html|title=Mercurio Martinez|publisher=[[Laredo Independent School District]]|accessdate=April 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140129202511/http://www.laredoisd.org/departments/tds/cabm.html|archivedate=January 29, 2014|df=}}</ref>

Martinez's namesake grandson, Mercurio Martinez, IV, was killed in an automobile accident in 2009 at the age of eighteen. Each year the community honors his memory with the "Mercurio Martinez, IV, Teens in the Driver Seat, Annual 5K Run", sponsored by the [[Vidal M. Trevino School of Communications and Fine Arts|Vidal M.
