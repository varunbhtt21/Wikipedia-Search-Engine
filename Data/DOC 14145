==Narrative==
[[Sayyid]] Noureddin wants to participate the Iran–Iraq war, but he is not allowed at first because he is still young. He tries repeatedly and finally they let him go to war. He attends a military training course in the fall of 1980, and heads toward the western zones of Iran to serve in the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Sepah]] of the [[Mehabad]]. He moves to the southern war zones along with his brother, Sadegh. Nourreddin loses his brother in an Iraqi [[airstrike]]. With shrapnel in his body they make him go under surgery in the hospitals of [[Mashhad]] and [[Kermanshah]] many times. But he does not recover well because he is severely damaged in the face, eyes and stomach. Due to the severe injuries on his face, his countenance changes when he is only 18. In 1984, he marries a 16-year-old girl named Masoume and their child is born 4 years later. The war finishes but he is still suffering the injuries and he misses his lovely friends, especially Amir Maralbash who was killed in the war.<ref>[http://manvaketab.ir/145079-نورالدین-پسر-ایران/bz=fs Book introduction, Nourreddin, Son of Iran (Persian)]</ref>

==Why it was written==
In the last page of his memoir, Afi expresses his motivation for recounting his war memories as such:
{{quote|I never thought that, telling the memories is important nowadays. However, war memories and interviews were not discussed and I was involved with the side effects my injuries. In 1994, I dreamed that Mr [[Khamenei]] was reading some papers and crying. I was there, Some one said that these papers were the memories of a %70 [[veteran]] who had participated in war for 80 months and still said he had nothing for the war...My mind was busy with this dream and I felt my duty would finish by telling these memories. So, I  recounted the eight years of living in the war context to make those unique times survive for ever. (P632)<ref name="Mashregh"/>}}
