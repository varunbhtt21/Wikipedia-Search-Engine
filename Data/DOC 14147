*'''Soft Delete''' The special hasn't been released yet and because of that there seems to be a dearth of information concerning the special, which has resulted in actual question marks being used in place of words in the entry. The release date is in two weeks, which would suggest it passes the [[WP:NFF]] requirements, but I can't find any reliable sourcing that confirms that. However, assuming the arguments for the other Scooby direct-to-dvd specials holds, I think the author should have access to update the entry and add reliable sources when they become available, hence my thinking on deletion subject to userfication.

*'''Keep''' or '''Redirect''' until its release that is. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 02:59, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[Scooby-Doo#Direct-to-video specials]]. You could also do its predecessors. — '''[[User:CAWylie|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Wylie</span>]][[User talk:CAWylie|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">pedia</span>]]''' 07:52, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
