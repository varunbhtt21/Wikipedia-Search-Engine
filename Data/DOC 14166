==Company history==

As students at the [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras]] (IIT Madras) in 2008, the company's four founders—Nelson Vadassery, Sailaja Nori, Sowmya Balendiran, and Sayash Kumar—sought out the help of their professor, Shrikumar Suryanarayan, to aid in entering the [[iGEM competition]] hosted by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name="TheEconomicTimes"/> Suryanarayan, now the chairman of Sea6 Energy, helped the students enter their project in the competition and spurred their interest in the biofuel industry.<ref name="TheEconomicTimes"/> Suryanarayan had also previously worked at the Indian [[biotechnology]] company, [[Biocon]], where his own interest in studying seaweed as a biofuel was piqued.<ref name="IndiaRealTime">{{cite news | last = Mukherji | first = Biman | title =The Power of Seaweed | publisher = India Realtime via [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date =1 October 2012 | url =https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/10/01/indian-company-chases-seaweed-power/ | accessdate = 25 April 2014 }}</ref>

The company was founded in July 2010 with funding from a few IIT Madras alumni, Suryanarayan, the [[Department of Biotechnology|Indian Department of Biotechnology]], and other investors.<ref name="IndiaRealTime"/> The company began operation in [[Chennai]], using laboratories and equipment provided by IIT Madras.<ref name="BioSpectrum"/> The company would later move to their current location in Bangalore to take advantage of facilities and instrumentation at the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms|Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (C-CAMP)]],<ref name="CCAMPIncubation">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccamp.res.in/incubation |title=Incubation at C-CAMP |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=www.ccamp.res.in |publisher=C-CAMP |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> a company co-founded by Shrikumar Suryanarayan.<ref name="BioSpectrum02">{{cite news | last = Gunashekar | first = Raj | title =‘We are not a risk-loving country’ | publisher = [[BioSpectrum]] | date =14 February 2014 | url =http://www.biospectrumindia.com/biospecindia/news/209055/-we-risk-loving-country/page/1 | accessdate = 26 April 2014 }}</ref>

On 31 January 2012, Sea6 Energy signed a deal with [[Denmark|Danish]] [[biotech]] company, [[Novozymes]].<ref name="ForbesIndia">{{cite news | last = Singh | first = Seema | title =Bold and Beautiful: Turning Seaweed into Biofuels | publisher = [[Forbes Magazine|Forbes]] [[Forbes (India)|India]] | date =31 January 2012 | url =http://forbesindia.com/blog/technology/bold-and-beautiful-turning-seaweed-into-biofuels/ | accessdate = 26 April 2014 }}</ref> The goal of the partnership is to facilitate the conversion of seaweed [[carbohydrates]] into [[sugars]] that can be used to produce ethanol.<ref name="BiofuelsProduction">{{cite book | last =Babu | first =Vikash | authorlink = |author2=Ashish Thapliyal |author3=Girijesh Kumar Patel  | title =Biofuels Production | publisher =Wiley-Scrivener | series = | volume = | edition = 1 | date =2013 | location = | pages = | language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iezBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT155&dq=%22Sea6+Energy%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0exVU5TaCqbh2AWv2oGwCw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Sea6%20Energy%22&f=false | doi = | id = | isbn =978-1118634509 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}</ref>


Now the valuation of company is $10million. It's hoping to be valued around $90million by 2020

==Research and development==

Traditionally, algal-based biofuels have been derived from [[microalgae]] that grow in [[fresh water]] sources.<ref name="TheEconomicTimes"/> Shrikumar Suryanarayan and the 4 co-founders sought to research the viability of [[macroalgae]] (seaweed) as a fuel source.<ref name="BioSpectrum"/> To do this, they needed a way to efficiently farm the seaweed, which led to the creation of a farming system built from a marine plastics [[polymer]].<ref name="BioSpectrum"/> Sea6 Energy successfully applied for a patent for their aquatic farming structure in 2012 (one of their two patents that has been published).<ref name="GooglePatent">{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=pts&source=hp&q=sea6+energy&oq=sea6+energy&gs_l=hp.3..0l2j0i22i30l3.1166.2272.0.2415.12.12.0.0.0.0.259.1069.4j5j1.10.0.chm_loc%2Chmss2%3Dfalse%2Chmnts%3D50000...0...1.1.42.hp..6.6.383.0._7p7pBEOxUc |title=Sea6 Energy |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=www.google.com |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>

Sea6 Energy has successfully converted red seaweed into ethanol<ref name="IndiaRealTime"/> and [[natural gas]]<ref name="TheEconomicTimes02"/> in their labs. They believe that seaweed can replace fossil fuels and other types of green fuels in a way that is both sustainable and good for the environment.<ref name="IndiaRealTime"/> The current goal of Sea6 Energy (along with their partner, Novozymes) is to find an [[enzyme]] that breaks down red seaweed carbohydrate into [[monosaccharides]] more efficiently.<ref name="BioSpectrum"/> These monosaccharides must undergo fermentation in order to be converted into ethanol.<ref name="IndiaRealTime"/>
