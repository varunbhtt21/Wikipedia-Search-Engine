The article attained GA status last year. The topic name should also be moved to [[Han dynasty]] because the main article was renamed.--[[User:Khanate General|Khanate General <font color="#E30A17">☪</font>]] [[User talk:Khanate General|talk]] [[User:Khanate General/Project Mongol Conquests|<sup>project mongol conquests</sup>]] 03:27, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*As per above, [[Han–Xiongnu War]], [[Wang Mang]], and [[End of the Han dynasty]] would need to be included too. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 11:11, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delegate comment''' If there are no further comments, then I'll be closing this nomination as the end of the month as no consensus to add [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty]] to the topic.--<span style="background:white;color:">[[User:Juhachi|'''<font color="black">十</font>''']][[User talk:Juhachi|'''<font color="red">八</font>''']]</span> 05:06, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
