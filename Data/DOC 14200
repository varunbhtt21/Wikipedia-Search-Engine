===Accolades===
''Slant Magazine'' placed ''Goddess'' at number eight on its list of The 25 Best Albums of 2014, with Annie Galvin commenting, "The alt-pop landscape in 2014 was crowded with sultry female singers backed by über-hip electronic beatscapes, yet Jillian Banks managed to rise above the fray with her debut."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/the-25-best-albums-of-2014/P4 |title=The 25 Best Albums of 2014 |work=Slant Magazine |date=December 11, 2014 |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' named it the 17th best R&B album of 2014, and the magazine's Cady Drell wrote, "More than just an Internet sensation with on-the-nose Nineties R&B throwback hooks, L.A. native Jillian Banks can go from gloomy trance cuts one minute to lyrically explicit soul jams the next—all with an impressively modern gothic touch."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-best-rb-albums-of-2014-168202/banks-goddess-227628/ |title=20 Best R&B Albums of 2014 |work=Rolling Stone |date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=July 22, 2018}}</ref> It was also listed as the 24th best album of the year by ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/26/-sp-the-best-albums-of-2014 |title=The best albums of 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=November 26, 2014 |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}</ref>

''[[PopMatters]]'' ranked the album number 28 on its year-end list and concluded, "[Banks] is no [[Beyoncé]], but her failures are her strength and our gain, and her scars give Goddess a beauty and a feminist wisdom that the platinum features of ''[[Beyoncé (album)|Beyoncé]]'' will never have."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/188860-the-best-albums-of-2014/P5/ |title=The Best Albums of 2014 |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=December 8, 2014 |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221011619/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/188860-the-best-albums-of-2014/P5/ |archivedate=February 21, 2015 |dead-url=no }}</ref> Jessica Goodman and Ryan Kristobak of ''[[HuffPost]]'' included the album on their list of The 23 Best Albums of 2014, stating, "While exhilarating in bits, as a full listen, [the album is] a little hard to stomach. However, in the comedown, 'Brain' demonstrates what happens when Banks is at her spiciest, and 'You Should Know Where I'm Coming From' removes the ooze for a clear look at just how capable her voice is on its own, giving us hope for a more explorative follow-up."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goodman |first1=Jessica |last2=Kristobak |first2=Ryan |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/15/best-albums-2014_n_6326402.html |title=The 23 Best Albums Of 2014 |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}</ref>
