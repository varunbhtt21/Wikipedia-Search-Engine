'''Vanderhorst Row''' in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] is a three-unit residential building built in 1800 by [[Arnoldus Vanderhorst]], a governor of South Carolina (1792-1794). Each unit is four floors. The units at the north and south end of the range have doors along East Bay Street on the front in addition to doors on the sides of the unified building and exits to the rear. After the Civil War, the use of the building changed, and commercial purposes were installed. The building fell into disrepair before it was bought in 1935 by Josiah E. Smith for a restoration<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=0oeUc68sgesC&dat=19350623&printsec=frontpage&hl=en | title=Vanderhorst Row Will Be Restored | work=News & Courier | date=June 22, 1935 | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | location=Charleston, South Carolina | pages=12}}</ref> which cost $30,000.
