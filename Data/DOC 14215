The article attained FA status a few months ago and it's about a series of major wars involving the Song dynasty. The topic name should also be moved to [[Song dynasty]] because the main article was renamed.--[[User:Khanate General|Khanate General <font color="#E30A17">☪</font>]] [[User talk:Khanate General|talk]] [[User:Khanate General/Project Mongol Conquests|<sup>project mongol conquests</sup>]] 04:00, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*I find that the topic is more specific (a subset of History) than the other articles, which are more an [[Wikipedia:Featured topic criteria/Overview topics|overview]] of certain general sub-topics of the Song dynasty.--[[User:Cold Season|Cold Season]] ([[User talk:Cold Season|talk]]) 00:17, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
*The addition would be fine if it were to include [[Timeline of the Jin–Song Wars]], [[Battle of Caishi]], [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty]], and [[Battle of Yamen]] too. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 11:07, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
**Is it possible to add those articles to this topic? <s>}I[[User:Mr. Gonna Change My Name Forever|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#d4c00b;">'''Mr*'''</span>]]&#124;[[User talk:Mr. Gonna Change My Name Forever|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#808000;">(''6''0nna)</span>]]I{</s> 05:54, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
***If you are going to expand the topic, then you need to keep in mind that the expansion still needs to be an overview topic. Normally, those 5 articles could go into a separate, complete sub-topic on the history section; alternatively, they could be included here, if no other obvious articles that would cover some of the other sub-topics need to exist.

****After looking at the other sections of the topic, [[Jingkang Incident]], [[Islam during the Song dynasty]], [[Bao Zheng]], [[Song poetry]], [[Yingzao Fashi]] and possibly [[Peking opera]]?, [[Movable type]]?. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 09:05, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*****After adding these 10 or-so articles, the only subtopic to this overview topic would be the one on emperors. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 09:06, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*If you really want to contribute to the topic, I would suggest to try to start a separate nom on the history sub-topic with all the corresponding articles. After that, focus on these other sub-articles I've listed above. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 09:08, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delegate comment''' If there are no further comments, then I'll be closing this nomination as the end of the month as no consensus to add [[Jin–Song Wars]] to the topic.--<span style="background:white;color:">[[User:Juhachi|'''<font color="black">十</font>''']][[User talk:Juhachi|'''<font color="red">八</font>''']]</span> 05:06, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
