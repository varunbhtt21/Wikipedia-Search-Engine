Chocka’s work often references her life story and experiences, such as her Wadawurrung heritage, the importance of Christianity in her life, and the impact of politics, the law and other power structures on her lived experience and that of her family and community. Her deeply personal and powerful artistic practice questions the way people circumscribe and misconstrue contemporary identity and experience.

Bindi Cole's ''Not Really Aboriginal'' is a series of photographs including portraits and group photographs in which the faces of the subjects are [[blackface|blackened with paint]]. ''Not Really Aboriginal'' explores Cole's Indigenous identity and heritage, and the ways in which they are questioned by mainstream society due to Cole's fair complexion.

=="Sista Girls" [2010] ==

''Sista Girls'' is a 2010 photographic series which focuses on the ''Yimpininni'', a community of transgender women in the [[Tiwi Islands]], [[Northern Territory]].

Cole travelled to the [[Tiwi Islands]] in far north [[Northern Territory]] to shoot the Sista Girls after previously photographing Tiwi Island drag performer Foxxy in 2008. This work with Foxxy was shortlisted for the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards. A portrait from the series, ''Ajay'', won the 2009 Victorian Indigenous Art Awards ‘Deadly Award’.

In this work, Cole explores aspects of indigenous identity and culture, and how that is reconciled with transgender identity with the influence of colonization.
