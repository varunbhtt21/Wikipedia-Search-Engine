"'''The Back-Up Plan'''" is the eighteenth episode of the [[Glee (season 5)|fifth season]] of the American musical television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and the 106th episode overall. Written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and directed by co-creator [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]], it aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 29, 2014, and features the introduction of [[Shirley MacLaine]] as rich socialite June Dolloway.

==Plot==
Newly minted Broadway star [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]) signs with an agency called the ICA, and meets with her new agent Mr. Rifkin ([[Richard Kind]]), who urges her to branch out as much as she can from her leading role as Fanny Brice in ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]].'' She travels to [[Los Angeles|LA]] under the guise of being sick to audition for a television pilot, ''Song'' ''of'' ''Solomon'', against the advice of her roommate [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]). In California, she auditions with [[The Rose (song)|The Rose]], and is informed it is not a musical. The audition goes uncomfortably awry, partially due to the unfamiliar galactic jargon. Sidney, the producer of ''Funny Girl'', calls to tell her to be at the theater at 7:30 as her understudy has injured herself. Rachel is horrified to discover the state of the traffic jam her taxi is stuck in. Kurt tells her to tell Sidney the truth, but agrees to help when she points out that her career will be ruined. [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) suggests an alternative to Kurt's ideas as a distraction, and convinces a furious Sidney to let her temporarily step in as Fanny. Rachel later heartily thanks her with a meal. In a mandatory meeting with a furious Sidney, he reveals to Rachel that if she missed a show again, she will be fired and he will sue her, rendering her unable to work on Broadway.

[[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]) and Kurt prepare for the arrival of wealthy socialite June Dollaway ([[Shirley MacLaine]]), for whose opening Kurt has been selected to sing. They perform Story of My Life, impressing June, though she neglects Kurt, seeing only Blaine and inviting him to Soho Center for Outsider. Blaine reluctantly attends the party, Kurt maintaining that he's fine. At the Center, June and Blaine duet after the former find out her stock price is lower than normal to enthusiastic applause. She tells Blaine at a meal of a show she's planning to center around him, and refuses his request that Kurt be in it, going as far as to advise him to break off his engagement and venture out into the world instead of settling down. In the apartment, Blaine apologizes for his absences and shares the show's plans to Kurt, lying that he'd been waiting for the latter's part to be fleshed out.

[[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]) meets with Santana, worried about her music deal. She invites Santana to the studio to find some direction in her life. At the studio, they find themselves unable to get warmed up properly and Santana suggests to go out of studio, and they duet in the basement, successfully impressing the producer.<ref name="Fox0415" /><ref name="FoxFlashEp" /> Mercedes tries to convince DeShawn to let her duet with Santana, but he points out that an unheard-of partner might damage how well the album sells, and Santana agrees, saying that although she appreciates it, it should be all about Mercedes. She walks out, upset. Later in the Spotlight Diner, Mercedes convinces Santana to sign a contract when Kurt arrives with Rachel's news.

The episode ends with Rachel being contacted by Lee Paulblatt ([[Jim Rash]]), the FOX representative, who gives her good news and bad news: she has not been cast in ''Song of Solomon'', but a writer is being sent to New York for a new show.
