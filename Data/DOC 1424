*'''Weak Keep''' It appears he lost a fight for the WBO Africa welterweight title and I believe that's enough to meet [[WP:NBOX]]. [[User:Mdtemp|Mdtemp]] ([[User talk:Mdtemp|talk]]) 15:42, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak Keep''' While I'm not enamored of [[WP:NBOX]], Clottey does meet it. [[User:Papaursa|Papaursa]] ([[User talk:Papaursa|talk]]) 01:35, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Fought for a WBO Africa welterweight title which is sufficient to pass [[WP:NBOX]]. [[User:Finnegas|Finnegas]] ([[User talk:Finnegas|talk]]) 21:58, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
