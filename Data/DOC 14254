:({{Find sources|Dua Sanamain Quraish}})
This dua (prayer), if it is indeed real, is not notable. The article, whether the prayer is real or not, is merely a copy paste of a primary source. I have not found a single scholarly article or book from a notable publisher which even mentions this, though I have found a lot from publishing houses in India which make it clear that their content consists of Wikipedia articles. I have not found a single reputable website which mentions this prayer at all, though I have found a lot of Wikipedia mirrors showing exactly what is written here. I have found the prayer at some Muslim polemical websites where different sects argue, but all such sites are of disputed authenticity by other sects and none of them have proper editorial boards; they're just polemicists ranting. I have found mention of this prayer on Muslim discussion forums, but none of the discussions predate the creation of this article. Even if it is theoretically a real prayer, there is no proof for any sort of notability at all. It's just a copy paste of a primary source only reflected in Wikipedia mirrors.

:'''Rename or merge if appropriate, probably not simply delete''' -- I don't know any of the technical details, but Shi`ite traditions of cursing some or all of the pre-Ali (and therefore Sunni-only) caliphs are quite notorious in the Middle East, even if such customs are rarely practiced in most areas today.  This [http://www.google.com/search?ie=ISO-8859-1&hl=en&source=hp&q=%22cursing+the+first+three+caliphs%22&btnG=Google+Search&gbv=1 little Google search] turns up over 2,000 results, many quite reputable looking.  Probably preferable to set up an article with the title [[Shiite traditions of cursing the first caliphs]] or similar...

::By the way, [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22%D8%AF%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A1+%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%85%D9%8A+%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B4%22+-wikipedia this Arabic-script Google search] turns up quite a lot of results. Maybe part of the problem is that the letter "n" in Dua Sanamai'''<big>n</big>''' Quraish" is completely incorrect and bogus! [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22dua%20sanam%20quraish%22 This Google search] gets 700 results... [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 14:43, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::[[User:AnonMoos]], I actually would agree with creation of an article on "cursing first three caliphs," but what realistically can we merge from here? This is just copy paste of a prayer that, even in the links you provided, is only mentioned on discussion forums and Youtube. Even the Arabic version of the search you provided is entirely from blogs and discussion forums in Arabic. My question isn't rhetorical by the way, you might be on to something. If we have an article on "cursing the first three caliphs" we can surely find reliable sources on that topic, but how does this specific prayer in its current copy pasted form on this article fit in?
:::I still think this should be deleted per my reasoning above and because I can't think of how the text in this specific article could be used in another, but if there's something I've missed that can be pointed out to me, I'd withdraw the request.

* '''Redirect''' to [[Shia–Sunni relations]] or possibly [[Islam in Iran]]. It seems to have been a genuine custom in some parts of pre-15th century Shia-ism, but it's not notable; none of the sources give more than a sentence to it. --[[User:RaiderAspect|RaiderAspect]] ([[User talk:RaiderAspect|talk]]) 02:16, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - if not even one source gives [[WP:SIGCOV|more than passing mentions]], this is [[WP:NN|not notable]]. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 15:47, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  Doesn't meet notability requirements and, even if it did, the article does not contain sufficient scholarly value.  <span style="color:orange">[[User:Andrewman327|Andrew]]<sup>[[User talk:Andrewman327|327]]</sup></span> 03:20, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
