On 9 January 1862, Wood married Lucy Elizabeth Darvall, daughter of Fredrick Orme Darvall.<ref name=rem/>

==Politics==
Western Wood was given a lifetime appointment to the [[Queensland Legislative Council]] on 26 April 1861.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3718998 |title=LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. |newspaper=[[The Moreton Bay Courier]] |location=Brisbane |date=1 May 1861 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He resigned from the Council on 20 March 1868 in order to take up an appointment as police magistrate at Port Denison (now known as [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]]).<ref name=rem/><ref name=qpm>{{Cite QldMLA|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article123353537 |title=To the Editor of the Queensland Times. |newspaper=[[Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald & General Advertiser]] |date=21 March 1868 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1299396 |title=THE GAZETTE. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=6 April 1868 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Later life==
Wood's appointment as a police magistrate was short-lived, as he charged with embezzlement in April 1869.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1325977 |title=TELEGRAPHIC. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=22 April 1869 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In May 1869, the charge of embezzlement was withdrawn and replaced with a charge of having fraudulently appropriated £100 which he had received for the use of the trustees of the Bowen Cemetery.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60834860 |title=NOTES OF A VISIT TO YOUNG, GRENFELL, AND FORBES. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |location=Sydney |date=21 May 1869 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He was dismissed as police magistrate on 22 May 1869.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75460153 |title=THE GAZETTE. |newspaper=[[The Darling Downs Gazette and General Advertiser]] |location=Toowoomba, Qld. |date=26 May 1869 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> By July 1869, there were further charges in relation to £75 intended for the Kennedy Hospital.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article82098315 |title=Local and General News. |newspaper=[[Warwick Examiner and Times]] |location=Qld. |date=24 July 1869 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> A legal dispute then erupted as to whether the case should be dealt with in Bowen or in [[Rockhampton]], which concluded that the case should be dealt with in Rockhampton.  Wood strenuously objected to that location and refused to attend the court, resulting in a bench warrant for his arrest. Having been arrested, he was again released on bail.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20326210 |title=Latest by Telegraph. |newspaper=[[The Queenslander]] |date=23 October 1869 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The matter dragged on, until Western Wood fled Queensland in March 1870, claiming he was disgusted at how long it was taking to have the matter resolved.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1312926 |title=ODD NOTES. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=22 March 1870 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In November 1875, Wood initiated divorce proceedings against his wife Lucy, naming George Cresswell Crump as a co-respondent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1383871 |title=Telegraphic. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=4 November 1875 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> However, there is no evidence that the divorce was awarded.

Western Woods died on 17 April 1878 in [[Great Marlow]], [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=rem/>

His widow Lucy married George Cresswell Crump on 7 May 1878 in Brisbane.<ref>{{cite web|title=Search historical marriage records|url=https://www.bdm.qld.gov.au/IndexSearch/querySubmit.m?ReportName=MarriageSearch|publisher=Queensland Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
