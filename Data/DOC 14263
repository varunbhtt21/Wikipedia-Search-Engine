* ... that [[Beijing]]'s '''[[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng District]]''' ''(view from [[Dongzhimen]], pictured)'' has more than a quarter of [[Major national historical and cultural sites (Beijing)|the city's Major National Historical and Cultural Sites]]?
:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/A.V. Thamarakshan|A.V. Thamarakshan]]
:* ''Comment'': Fivefold+ text expansion. <s>Might want to hold off on reviewing from the top of the pile as there is still some more work I'd like to do on it, which might also generate a second hook.</s> Alright, that's done (now it's an ''absolute'' fivefold expansion), so feel free to review it. And there's an ALT2:
::<s>'''ALT2''': ... that over three-quarters of the economy of [[Beijing]]'s '''[[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng District]]''' ''(view from [[Dongzhimen]], pictured)'' is in the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]], due to its many tourist attractions?</s>
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Daniel Case|Daniel Case]] ([[User talk:Daniel Case|talk]]). Self nominated at 04:36, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough, 5x expansion verified. The original hook is verified with inline reference. I'm striking out ALT2 because of the outdated source, which is ten years old and refers to the old Dongcheng District before the 2010 merger with Chongwen. Image is public domain, and QPQ is verified. Good to go. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 06:10, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
