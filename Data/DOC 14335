'''Whale watching in Australia''' is a popular recreational pursuit and a tourist activity along various coasts. In 2008, whale and [[dolphin]] watching was worth an estimated {{AUD}}31&nbsp;million in direct expenditure to the [[Australian economy]] with an estimated 1.6&nbsp;million tourists participating in the activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-species/cetaceans/whale-and-dolphin-watching |title=Whale and dolphin watching|year=2014 |accessdate=4 May 2014|publisher=[[Department of the Environment]]}}</ref> [[Whaling in Australia]] took place from 1788 to 1978 and was once commercially successful. The [[Australian Whale Sanctuary]] was established in 1999 to protect dolphins and whales from hunting. [[Humpback whale]]s are the most common species seen in the waters surrounding Australia while [[southern right whale]]s, [[minke whale]]s and [[blue whale]]s are also seen.<ref name="wtsw">{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/where-to-spot-whales-in-sydney-20140523-zrlzx.html |title=Where to spot whales in Sydney |author=Nicky Phillips |accessdate=2 June 2014 |date=23 May 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media}}</ref>

In [[Western Australia]], whales are watched near [[Cape Naturaliste]] in the south-east [[Indian Ocean]] and at [[Cape Leeuwin]] where the Indian and [[Southern Ocean|Southern]] Oceans meet. Whale watching cruises operate along the west coast around [[Perth]] and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and as far north as [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westernaustralia.com/en/Things_to_See_and_Do/Sun_Surf_and_Sea_Life/Pages/Whale_Watching.aspx|title=Whale watching|year=2013|accessdate=4 May 2014|publisher=Tourism Western Australia}}</ref>

== Southern Australia ==
In the [[Southern Ocean]] there are many spots to see whales, both from land or aboard ship.
[[Southern right whale]]s are seen Juneâ€“August along the south coast of Australia. They are often readily viewed from the coast around [[Encounter Bay]] near [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]] and up to a hundred at a time may be seen from the cliff tops at the head of the [[Great Australian Bight]] near [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]].
[[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] on the south coast of Western Australia the town where the last land based whaling station in the Southern Hemisphere was located is now home to a thriving whale watching industry. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] a popular site is Logan's Beach at [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]], as well as in the waters off [[Port Fairy, Victoria|Port Fairy]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140914141221/http://www.abc.net.au/oceans/whale/spot.htm Whale Dreams: Spotting whales in Australia]</ref> In [[Tasmania]] whales can be seen all along the east coast and even on the [[Derwent River (Tasmania)|River Derwent]].<ref>[http://travelmedia.tourismtasmania.com.au/about/wildlife/whales.html Tourism Tasmania :: Media Site :: About :: Whales &amp; Dolphins]</ref> In [[South Australia]] whales are watched in the [[Great Australian Bight]] Marine Park areas and closer to Adelaide at [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/whale-watching/see-whales.html |title=Where to see whales and dolphins in the wild |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=2009-01-12 |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217042536/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/whale-watching/see-whales.html |archivedate=February 17, 2010 }}

During a good season it is estimated that approximately 400,000 people visit the region around [[Encounter Bay]] and spend some time whale watching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sawhalecentre.com/faq.html|title=South Australian Whale Centre|year=2011|accessdate=4 May 2014|publisher=South Australian Whale Centre}}</ref>

In [[East Coast of Australia|eastern Australia]], whale watching occurs in many spots along the Pacific coast. From headlands, whales may often be seen making their migration south. At times, whales even make it into [[Sydney Harbour]].  New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife took an active role in 2010 during the peak southern whale watching season between May and November with the launch of its whale watching site. At Cape Solander in the south of [[Botany Bay]] community volunteers participate in a long-term scientific study.  Each year from the 24 May until the 1 August they count whales swimming past from sunrise to sunset.<ref name="wwinsw">{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/whalewatchinginnsw.htm |title=Whale watching in NSW |date=31 January 2014 |publisher=Environment and Heritage |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}</ref>

The [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] and [[Hervey Bay]] (where the whales stay and rest before migrating) in [[Queensland]], offer reliable whale watching conditions for [[Humpback whale|southern humpback whale]]s from the end of June through to the end of November each year.<ref name="wwhb">{{cite web |url=http://www.racq.com.au/travel/drive_travel/must_dos/fraser-coast/whale_watching,_hervey_bay |title=Whale Watching, Hervey Bay |publisher=RACQ |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}</ref>  Hervey Bay is a particularly good spot for whale watching as the whales are not constantly on the move.  Instead they exhibit a range of playful behaviours.<ref name="wtwp">{{cite web |url=http://www.frasercoast.qld.gov.au/web/our-fraser-coast/whale-watching |title=Where the whales play |work=Our Fraser Coast |publisher=Fraser Coast Regional Council |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}</ref>  Each year in August Hervey Bay hosts the Whale Festival which marks the beginning of the whale watching season and includes various ceremonies such as blessing the fleet.<ref name="hbwf">{{cite web |url=http://www.frasercoast.qld.gov.au/home/-/asset_publisher/2UxW/content/hervey-bay-whale-festival-starts-this-week |title=Hervey Bay Whale Festival starts this week |date=29 July 2013 |publisher=Fraser Coast Regional Council |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}</ref>

Whale numbers and activity have increased markedly in recent years.{{When|date=October 2012}} [[Sydney]], [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]], [[Narooma]] and [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in [[New South Wales]] are other popular hot spots for tours from May to November.

One particular whale, which is suspected to be [[albino]], receives special attention due to its all-white appearance. Migaloo was first spotted in 1991 in the waters off Byron Bay.<ref name="erww">{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/extremely-rare-white-whale-migaloo-sighted-for-first-time-this-year-off-coast-of-australia-9546261.html |title=Extremely rare white whale 'Migaloo' sighted for first time this year off coast of Australia |author=Adam Withnall |accessdate=20 June 2014 |date=18 June 2014 |work=independent.co.uk}}</ref> In 2004, skin samples were taken by researchers interested in the whales genetics.<ref name="erww"/> Queensland and New South Wales both have laws stipulating that watchers must stay at least 500&nbsp;m from Migaloo.<ref name="mtgww"/>
