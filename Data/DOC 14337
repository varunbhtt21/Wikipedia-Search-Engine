'''Whale watching in New Zealand''' is predominantly centered around the areas of [[Kaikoura]] and the [[Hauraki Gulf]]. Known as the 'whale capital', Kaikoura is a world-famous [[whale watching]] site, in particular for [[sperm whale]]s which is currently the most abundant of large whales in New Zealand waters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.govt.nz/Publications/Appendix%209%20Marine%20Mammals%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marine Mammals and Salmon Farms |website=Epa.govt.nz |accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park (just outside [[Auckland]] city) is also a significant whale watching area with a resident population of [[Bryde's whale|Bryde's Whales]] commonly viewed alongside other [[Cetacea|cetaceans]] [[Common dolphin|Common Dolphins]], [[Bottlenose dolphin|Bottlenose Dolphins]] and [[Killer whale|Orca]].  Whale watching is also offered in other locations, often as eco-tours and in conjunction with dolphin watching. Land-based whale watching from New Zealand's last whaling station, which closed in 1964, is undertaken for scientific purposes, mostly by ex-whalers. Some compilations of sighting footages are available on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUzsK5eC2ixDWYvpGUsDwA/playlists |title=MrDaniel0816 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>

==Background==
Many places that were formerly whaling stations went into recession after the collapse of the whaling industry; New Zealand stopped whaling in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whale watching video|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/getting-involved/home-and-garden/involve-the-family/meet-the-locals-videos/first-series/whale-watching/|publisher=[[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]]|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> Whaling did not stop due to environmental or ethical concerns but because the declining number of whales made the industry uneconomic. Whilst New Zealand protected [[right whale]]s in 1935, it was not until 1978 that all [[marine mammal]]s were protected by law.<ref name="Te Ara" /> Kaikoura's recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of whale watching over whale hunting and other whale-watching operators such as Auckland Whale & Dolphin Safari have successfully combined scientific research and conservation efforts alongside their commercial offering.  Due to illegal whaling by [[Soviet Union]] (with help of Japan) in the 1970s, recovery state of [[baleen whale]]s migrating to New Zealand coasts were heavily slowed down, far worse than in [[Australia]]n waters, and this contributed to make public images that Kaikoura is the only site for whale watching, and Sperm Whale is the only species can be observed normally. New Zealand is the first nation in the world to protect marine mammals by law.

==Hauraki Gulf==
Largely regarded as one of the most abundant and diverse marine reserves in the world, the [[Hauraki Gulf]] is home to several species of cetaceans, most notably [[Bryde's whale]]<nowiki/>s, [[Killer whale]]s (Orca), [[Common dolphin|Common Dolphins]] and [[Bottlenose dolphin|Bottlenose Dolphins]].  Situated just off the coast of New Zealand's largest city [[Auckland]], the main whale watching operator [http://www.awads.co.nz/ Auckland Whale & Dolphin Safari] departs from the [[Viaduct Basin|Viaduct Harbour]] and runs daily trips (weather permitting) into the [[Hauraki Gulf Marine Park]].  <gallery perrow="5">

==Kaikoura==
The sea around Kaikoura supports an abundance of sea life, with the town's income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins. Recently the sperm whale watching at Kaikoura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader; arguably the most developed in the world.

The dominant organisation in Kaikoura's whale watching industry is Whale Watch Kaikoura, which is run as a charitable organisation. It takes around 100,000 visitors out by boat per annum, and has an annual turnover of [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]10m.<ref name="NZH March 14">{{cite news|last=Morton|first=Jamie|title=Study questions impact of whale watching|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11228056|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> Whale Watch Kaikoura began operating in 1987 with a {{convert|6|m}} boat.<ref name="Te Ara">{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Jock |title=Whaling – Modern whaling and whale watching |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/whaling/page-5 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=30 April 2014 |authorlink=Jock Phillips |date=13 July 2012}}</ref> Whale watching is also done by air, and the [[Kaikoura Aerodrome]] is mainly used for whale spotting tourist flights by Wings over Whales and Air Kaikoura – Kaikoura Aero Club.

==Tory Channel==
New Zealand's last whaling station was in Whekenui Bay in [[Tory Channel]] in the [[Marlborough Sounds]]. The high cliffs at the entrance of Tory Channel are ideal for land-based whale watching. During the migratory season for whales, the lookout is manned and whales passing [[Cook Strait]] are watched for research purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/8757218/Whalers-out-for-the-count|title=Whalers out for the count|work=Stuff|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> Most of the volunteers undertaking the work are ex-whalers.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/meet-the-locals/2007-episode-27-video-1538486 |title=Whale Watching |publisher=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> It is also the location where the first [[Southern right whale]] on main islands sighted since the end of whaling. Cetaceans can be seen in [[Waikawa, Marlborough|Waikawa]], [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturetours.co.nz/new-zealand/Dolphin-Seal-sightings/ |title=New Zealand Dolphins, Seals, Whales cruises in the Marlborough Sounds |publisher=Naturetours.co.nz |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> [[French Pass]], and in [[Abel Tasman National Park]] as well.

Sighting numbers of Southern rights, Humpbacks, [[Blue whale|Blue]]s are showing strong increases in recent years.

[[Southern right whale]]s, Tohora, 'the most important whale to New Zealand' is very slowly, but steadily making come backs to the nation's waters, and they will possibly become one of the most important species for whale watching as well since they are renowned as a target for non-harmful, land-based watching, and will recolonize the shores of the entire New Zealand to become seasonal residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/southern-right-whale-back-in-nz-waters-video-5395784|title=Southern right whale back in NZ waters|work=TVNZ|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> (see also [[Whale Rider]], and "real whale riders" sometimes appear for this species).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=165565816789382&set=a.151625964850034.29239.151318038214160&type=3&theater |title=Wade Doak – Timeline Photos |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> For Southern blue and [[Pygmy blue whale|Pygmy blues]], even before the historic discovery of a forging ground off [[Cape Egmont]], whales have been showing come backs along the coasts especially in Northland waters such as off Bay of Islands, [[Tutukaka]], and Kaikoura. [[Fin whale]]s and [[Sei whale]]s are confirmed in Chatham Rise in good numbers, but less frequently seen in coastal waters. [[Minke whale]]s can be seen off entire nation especially in Bay of Islands, but due to their small size it is not easy to observe them. Beaked whales are occasionally seen. Of these, most frequently observed species are [[Arnoux's beaked whale]]s (once a group of these had become a regular annual to [[Doubtful Sound]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fiordlandkindy.blogspot.jp/2009/04/whales-at-doubtful-sound.html | title = Whales at Doubtful Sound : Photographic images |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504084933/http://fiordlandkindy.blogspot.jp/2009/04/whales-at-doubtful-sound.html |archivedate=4 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiordlandhelicopters.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Fiordland-Coastal-Newsletter-April-2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fiordland Coastal Newsletter |website=Fiordlandhelicopters.co.nz |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> and [[Gray's beaked whale]]s. New Zealand's coasts are also renowned as prominent habitats for curious, ray-hunting Orcas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2wzDXcjaMQ|title=2014 March   Orca at Maraetai New Zealand|work=YouTube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htzexfbbVoc|title=Beautiful Orcas in New Zealand|work=YouTube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>

The deep sea canyon off [[Dunedin]] was revealed to be a rich habitat for toothed whales and its significance may be comparable to that of Kaikoura.<ref>Elder V.. 2017.
