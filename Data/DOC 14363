*'''Delete''' per [[WP:MADEUPINONEDAY]]. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 22:58, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[Archetypal psychology]], and remove copyvio from history. The last sentence in the article says "Imaginal psychology is also known as archetypal psychology". From a few sources, especially [http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/dec/21/james-hillman 3], there is a link between the two terms. If someone points out the two terms are different, then ''delete'' it. - [[User:Sidelight12|Sidelight]][[Special:Contributions/Sidelight12|<span style="color:#008504">12</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Sidelight12|Talk]]</sup> 12:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[Archetypal psychology]]; imaginal psychology seems to be a different term for the same thing. [[User:FreeKnowledgeCreator|FreeKnowledgeCreator]] ([[User talk:FreeKnowledgeCreator|talk]]) 21:21, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
