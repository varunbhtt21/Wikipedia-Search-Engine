==Life==
The youngest son of John Reid, a [[mahogany]] dealer and cabinet-maker in [[Glasgow]], he was born there on 27 January 1773, and was educated at [[Glasgow grammar school]] and the [[University of Glasgow]]. In 1793 he went into business as a [[muslin]] manufacturer, and in 1800 became a partner with his brother John as a wholesale mahogany dealer. On his brother's death he took over the business, adding to it that of cabinet-making and upholstery. In 1832 he sold off his stock-in-trade and retired from business.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Reid, Robert (1773-1865)|volume=47}}</ref>

Reid's ''Glasgow and its Environs'' was issued in 1864, and both works, with additions by other writers, were reprinted in three volumes at Glasgow in 1884: the third volume, by Reid, contained a short autobiography. He was also author of ''Fragments regarding the Ancient History of the Hebrides'', Glasgow, 1850.<ref name="DNB"/>
