[[Allmusic]] awarded the album 4 stars with its review by Scott Yanow stating, "For this excellent Xanadu set (an LP that was reissued briefly on CD), pianist Barry Harris (not particularly famous as a composer) performs seven of his catchy originals, most of which are based on the chord changes of bop standards".<ref name="Allmusic">Yanow, S. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/barry-harris-plays-barry-harris-mw0000919982 Allmusic Review], accessed April 29, 2014</ref>
