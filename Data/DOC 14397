The result was  '''Keep''' for [[Whale watching in Australia]] and [[Whale watching in New Zealand]]. The result was '''Delete''' for the remaining copypaste creations. (Note that all copypasting even -- even from within Wikipedia -- requires proper attribution per [[WP:CWW]] otherwise it is a copyright violation.) I suggest that any further discussion about [[Whale watching]] and the kept sub-articles should be done on a case-by-case basis. <span style="font-family: tahoma;"> — [[User:CactusWriter|<span style="color:#008000">Cactus</span><span style="color:#CC5500">Writer </span>]]<sup>[[User talk:CactusWriter|(talk)]]</sup></span> 15:48, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

::All the above articles have been simply ''copy pasted'' from [[Whale watching]], so there is nothing new in the above 11 articles, so merging won't do anything. --[[User:Fauzan|<font color="2F4F4F">  Fauzan</font>]]<sup style="margin-left:+0.5ex">[[User talk:Fauzan#top|<font color="BDB76B">✆ talk</font>]]</sup> <sub style="margin-left:-5.35ex">[[Special:EmailUser/Fauzan|<font color="BDB76B">✉ email</font>]]</sub> 04:41, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep all'''. No valid deletion criterion has been presented, and [[Whale watching]] is certainly notable. Even whale watching in some specific countries is notable, as a Google Books search shows. Some of these articles should probably be merged back into [[Whale Watching]], but a bulk AfD is not the place for such a merge discussion. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.29.29|101.117.29.29]] ([[User talk:101.117.29.29|talk]]) 03:50, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' [[Whale watching in New Zealand]] is certainly notable, and I have just expanded the article to make it more encyclopaedic. One of the senior NZ admins had already rated the article for [[WP:WikiProject New Zealand|Wikiproject New Zealand]] and has given it mid-importance, which further demonstrates the point. I have no opinion or knowledge about notability of other country articles.

*'''Delete'''. Some of the material should be merged back into [[Whale watching]], but the specific details of places would be more appropriate on WikiTravel. The article there on Whale watching needs work and will be deleted at the end of 2014 if not rescued, but that could be done with some of this material. --[[User:Bduke|<span style="color:#002147;">'''Bduke'''</span>]]  [[User_talk:Bduke|<span style="color:#002147;">'''(Discussion)'''</span>]] 22:20, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:*'''Query''' Given that you have commented after my keep vote, where I maintain that [[Whale watching in New Zealand]] is notable, could you please clarify / confirm that you have actually looked at the NZ entry, and that your global delete vote is supposed to apply to the NZ entry as well?

::* I did look at the NZ article and I have looked again at it. It still think it is WikiTravel material. A link to there could be on [[Whale watching]]. WMF has many projects. Not everything fits wikipedia. Some stuff should be on other projects. --[[User:Bduke|<span style="color:#002147;">'''Bduke'''</span>]]  [[User_talk:Bduke|<span style="color:#002147;">'''(Discussion)'''</span>]] 08:43, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Considering the fact that only the NZ article has been improved, and all the other ten were ''and'' are simply copy pastes from Whale watching, only the the NZ article may be considered for keeping. --[[User:Fauzan|<font color="2F4F4F">  Fauzan</font>]]<sup style="margin-left:+0.5ex">[[User talk:Fauzan#top|<font color="BDB76B">✆ talk</font>]]</sup> <sub style="margin-left:-5.35ex">[[Special:EmailUser/Fauzan|<font color="BDB76B">✉ email</font>]]</sub> 07:26, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''[[WP:NOTCLEANUP|AfD is not cleanup]]'''. The fact that the NZ article has been improved shows that the nom did not do a proper [[WP:BEFORE]] check and that this whole blanket nomination is flawed. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.108.195|101.117.108.195]] ([[User talk:101.117.108.195|talk]]) 22:40, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:*I have to agree with that comment. Either an article is notable, or it is not. That's independent to whether somebody improves an article. What an improvement may do is to show notability more clearly, but it doesn't establish notability in the first instance. '''<font color="#000000">[[User:Schwede66|Schwede]]</font><font color="#FF4500">[[User talk:Schwede66|66]]</font>''' 23:04, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Yes, AfD  is not a place to cleanup ''and'' wikipedia is not a place to keep multiple copies of insignificant articles. The  eleven articles were simply ''copy pastes'' from [[Whale watching]] created without discussion, rationale for keeping indipendent articles, or evidence of notability. A google search results in mostly links to tourism websites which is not an indication for notability and a google books search results in one [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7bZkzgAACAAJ on Australia and New Zealand] only, which I don't know whether it makes the subject notable or reliaible. But an editor experienced in the field may come out with some other obscure, but notable sources, which is not possible for an editor like me who is not an expert in the field. Atleast, we can initiate a discussion, which may bring the articles in question to the attention of intrested editors. And this is the place to discuss whether or not an article is worth keeping. Now the above comment was made by me to stress the point that ''may be the NZ article should be looked into separately'' since the article has been significantly expanded since the initiation of the deletion disscussion and the others are copy pastes. By looking just at the google search results, it is not possible to judge a subject's notability.

*'''Merge''' Whale watching in New Zealand with the article on [[Kaikoura]]. I don't think the article is sufficiently notable to stand alone, but it is appropriate within the Kaikoura article. [[User:NealeFamily|NealeFamily]] ([[User talk:NealeFamily|talk]]) 02:14, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' Whale watching in New Zealand with the article on [[Kaikoura]]. Improved article, yes but says little about whale watching and more about Kaikoura.--[[User:Egghead06|Egghead06]] ([[User talk:Egghead06|talk]]) 05:46, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[User:NealeFamily|NealeFamily]] and [[User:Egghead06|Egghead06]], please note that I have further expanded the article, and broadened it in its geographic scope away from the rather dominant Kaikoura. Feel free to review the amended article and reconsider your vote if appropriate.

:**I still have considerable doubt as to why ''Whale Watching'' is worthy of an article in Wiki. Essentially it is a tourist activity associated with particular localities of which there is a present only one in NZ, Kaikoura. I could see some merit of having a general article about human interaction with either the coastal maritime environment or whales in a more general sense. Are we heading down the lines of ''Bird watching in New Zealand'', ''Possum shooting in New Zealand'', etc? [[User:NealeFamily|NealeFamily]] ([[User talk:NealeFamily|talk]]) 22:19, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
