'''Pineapple cake''' ({{zh|t=鳳梨酥|zhu=ㄈㄥˋ ㄌㄧˊ ㄙㄨ}}, [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taigi]]: ông-lâi-so͘), [[Hiragana|(Hiragana]]: パイナップルケーキ), [[Hangul|(Hangul]]: 펑리수) is a sweet traditional [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]]  pastry containing butter, flour, egg, sugar, and pineapple jam or slices.

==History==
Pineapples became a critical component of Taiwan's economy during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]], during which Japanese industrialists imported a wide variety of pineapple cultivars and established numerous processing plants.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&post=14054|title=Taiwan's Growing Pineapple Industry - Taiwan Today|last=(Taiwan)|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|date=1960-11-01|website=Taiwan Today|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22}}</ref> By the late 1930s, Taiwan had become the third-largest exporter of pineapples in the world.<ref name=":0" /> However, when pineapple production in Taiwan shifted toward domestic sales and use of fresh pineapple, local bakeries sought to use this surplus in pastries.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/epochtaste/1742628-pineapple-cake/|title=Taiwan's Best-Known Treat: Pineapple Cake - Epoch Taste|work=The Epoch Times|access-date=2017-07-22|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fftc.agnet.org/library.php?func=view&id=20130628135136&type_id=3|title=Pineapple cakes boost Taiwan's rural industries|website=www.fftc.agnet.org|access-date=2017-07-22}}</ref> While pineapple cakes had historically been produced as a ceremonial food, a combination of governmental promotion and globalization popularized the pineapple cake. Pineapple cakes have become one of the top-selling souvenirs in Taiwan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://city543.com/taipei/2014/04/02/pineapple-cakes/|title=The Who’s Who of Taiwan’s Pineapple Cake Industry|work=City543|access-date=2017-07-22|language=en}}</ref>

Since 2005, the Taipei City Government has run an annual Taipei Pineapple Cake Cultural Festival to foster the growth the local tourism industry and promote sales of the pineapple cake.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://tcgwww.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=78700665&ctNode=15315&mp=111002|title=Pineapple Cake Festival to Take Place Next Weekend|last=黃紫緹|date=2014-07-04|website=tcgwww.taipei.gov.tw|language=English|access-date=2017-07-22}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://english.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=3648616&ctNode=8472&mp=100002|title=Pineapple Cake Fiesta Kicks off in Taipei|last=黃紫緹|date=2011-08-18|website=english.gov.taipei|language=English|access-date=2017-07-22}}</ref> In 2013, the revenue from Taiwan's pineapple cake bakeries totaled NT$40 billion (US$1.2 billion), and sales of pineapple cakes have also bolstered agricultural economies in rural parts of the country.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2016/01/the-pineapple-cake-chronicles/|title=The Pineapple Cake Chronicles - Taiwan Business TOPICS|date=2016-01-29|work=Taiwan Business TOPICS|access-date=2017-07-22|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2" />

== Symbolism ==
In [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], "pineapple" ({{zh|c=王梨|poj=ông-lâi|labels=no}}) sounds similar to a phrase meaning "to come forth, prosperous and thriving" ({{zh|c=旺來|poj=ōng-lâi|labels=no}}).<ref>{{holodict|1270|e=王梨}}</ref> This phrase conveys the hope that many children will be born to the family. As a result, pineapple cakes are often given as engagement gifts, or simply as well-wishing presents in an everyday context.<ref name=":1" />

== Varieties ==
Contemporary pineapple cake bakeries have created variations on the traditional pineapple cake. The filling may also incorporate preserved egg yolks or other dried fruits such as cranberries or strawberries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/08/25/2003541153|title=Pineapple cake festival opens in Taipei - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2017-07-22}}</ref>

Bakeries may also add [[winter melon]] to the pineapple jam. This practice was initially an effort to make the tart pineapple filling more palatable.<ref name=":1" /> However, in contemporary bakeries, adding winter melon to the filling may be seen as an indicator of lower quality.<ref name=":5" />

The annual Taipei Pineapple Cake Cultural Festival often features a contest in which bakeries compete to create pineapple cakes that incorporate unconventional ingredients, such as rice or Taiwanese tea.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":3" />
