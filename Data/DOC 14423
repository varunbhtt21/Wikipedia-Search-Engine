The '''Phelan Building''' is an 11-story office building located at 760 [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco, California]]. It has a triangular shape reminiscent of the [[Flatiron Building]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], with its tip at the meeting point of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]], O’Farrell Street, and Grant Avenue. It is a [[List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks|San Francisco Designated Landmark]].

The building was designed by [[William Curlett]] and built in 1908 by [[James D. Phelan]] on the place of the first, original Phelan Building, damaged by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and fire. It was once home to the George Haas and Sons Candy Store, marketed as the most beautiful candy shop in the country.<ref>https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/02/09/boxes-used-to-come-with-more-than-just-candy/</ref> Their business also operated a tea room on the second floor.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=5qhvCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT142&lpg=PT142&dq=george+haas+phelan&source=bl&ots=Kjb5pHmT0Y&sig=ACfU3U2vJ8Upg5fMdw-wT5AKB-M6DYJu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8it64--TgAhWKm-AKHWASBfMQ6AEwEXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=george%20haas%20phelan&f=false</ref>

==The original Phelan Building==

The first Phelan Building was constructed in 1881 by James Phelan, the father of James D. Phelan. It was a 6-story, [[bay window|bay-windowed]], [[mansard]]-roofed flatiron.<ref name="phelanbuilding">{{cite web|url=http://www.phelanbuilding.net/building.htm|title=The Phelan Building History|publisher=phelanbuilding.net|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> Despite being advertised as “thoroughly fire and earthquake proof”,<ref>{{Citation|title=Phelan Building advertisement|publisher=Fraternal Record|date=July 24, 1886}}</ref> the building was badly damaged in the 1906 post-earthquake fire, and its ruins were subsequently dynamited on April 20, 1906.<ref name="nps">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/prsf/historyculture/1906-earthquake-fire-fighting.htm|title=1906 Earthquake: Fire Fighting - Presidio of San Francisco  (U.S. National Park Service)|publisher=nps.gov|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

==The second Phelan Building==

Work on the new Phelan Building began on October 7, 1907 and was completed on September 1, 1908 for retail stores, and the first day of 1909 for offices.<ref name="brochure">{{Citation|title=Phelan Building: An Entirely New Modern Class “A” Office Building and a San Francisco Landmark (brochure)|year=1908}}</ref> It was one of the earliest office buildings to be rebuilt after the earthquake.

The building's exterior features metal windows and is clad in cream [[Glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed terra-cotta]]. The original steel structure was designed to accommodate 13 floors; eventually eleven were completed.<ref>{{Citation|title=Huge Phelan Building already is a landmark|publisher=San Francisco Call|page=40|date=December 29, 1907}}</ref>

At its opening, the building featured an [[assembly hall]] on the 11th floor, [[shopping arcade|arcade stores]] on the second floor, and a basement café.<ref name='brochure' />

For many decades, the Phelan Building was a ''de facto'' center for [[jewelry]], hosting dozens of jewelers and a jewelry school.<ref name="killyourmac">{{cite web|url=http://killyourmac.com/the-phelan-building/|title=The Phelan Building|publisher=killyourmac.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

An unusual feature of the building is a small [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]]. Originally adorned by a rooftop garden, it was used by James D. Phelan to entertain dignitaries. It has later served as a photography studio in the 1960s,<ref>{{Citation|last=Seidkin|first=Phyllis|title=High Life at O’Farrell and Market|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner, Pictorial Living|page=10|date=August 25, 1963}}</ref> and was abandoned some time in the 1980s.
