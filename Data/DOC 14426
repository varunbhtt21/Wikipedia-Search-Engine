Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was  '''speedy delete via [[WP:G11]]'''. There is an assertion of notability here, but it needs such a complete re-write that it's better to start over with this, preferably via [[WP:AfC]] since there is possibly a [[WP:COI]] here.
