'''Henrik Stiesdal''' (born April 14, 1957) is a Danish inventor and businessman in the modern [[wind power]] industry.  In 1978, he designed one of the first [[wind turbine]]s representing the so-called "Danish Concept" which dominated the global wind industry through the 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-87347251.html |title=Die Bändiger des Windes |last1=Ertel |first1=Manfred |last2=Traufetter |first2=Gerald |magazine=Der Spiegel |date=16 July 2012 |issue=29 |language=German |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> Until 2014, Stiesdal was the Chief Technology Officer of [[Siemens Wind Power]]. During his professional career, Stiesdal has made more than 175 inventions and has received more than 650 patents related to wind power technology.

== Early life ==
Henrik Stiesdal was born in [[Hørsholm]], a town located in the East of [[Denmark]]. Between 1979–1988 he studied medicine, physics and biology at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. In 1976, Stiesdal became motivated by the steam plume from a powerplant [[cooling tower]] in [[England]] to build two small test turbines out of wood, steel and fabric.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/article1298939.ece |title=Henrik Stiesdal: From scrapyard to wind industry prizewinner |last=Snieckus |first=Darius  |publisher=Recharge News |date=26 November 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capetocape2012.com/2012/05/25/siemens-wind-power-a-green-and-sexy-business/ |title=Siemens Wind Power – a Green and Sexy Business |last=Stevers |first=Gijs |publisher=CapetoCape 2012 |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=sara>Rosendal, Sara.

== Career ==
In 1978, Henrik Stiesdal designed (along with Karl Erik Jørgensen) one of the first wind turbines representing the so-called "Danish concept".<ref>Krohn, Søren (2001). [http://ele.aut.ac.ir/~wind/en/tour/design/concepts.htm Wind Turbines: How many blades?] ''windpower.org'', 2001.</ref>  In 1979, his design was licensed to Vestas A/S, a Danish manufacturer of farm wagons, truck cranes and ship coolers. Stiesdal's design formed the basis of this company's rise to become one of the leading wind turbine manufacturers. After first working for [[Vestas]] as a consultant, he joined the company in 1983 as project manager. 
In 1987, Stiesdal joined the Danish wind turbine manufacturer Bonus Energy A/S as a development specialist.<ref name="windpowermonthly.com">McKenna, John (2012).

== Inventions and Innovations ==
Stiesdal's initial work in the late 1970s and early 1980s contributed significantly to the development of the simple and robust technologies of the so-called Danish Concept, comprising upwind, automatic yawing and two-speed stall-regulated turbines with fail-safe safety systems.<ref>Reve (2011).

In 1996, Stiesdal developed the CombiStall® blade regulation system which was fully implemented in the company's megawatt-range turbines. 
Two years later in 1998, Stiesdal designed the first [[Variable speed wind turbine|variable-speed turbine]] for Bonus Energy A/S. The technology was tested commercially in 2002 and from 2005 onwards, it has been used in all of Siemens’ new products. 
From 1999 onwards, Stiesdal was in charge of the development of Siemens’ Direct Drive technology, eliminating the gearbox which is the classical weak spot of traditional wind turbine design.<ref>European Sustainable Energy Review (2008).
