'''''A Clinical Lesson at the Salpêtrière''''' ("''Une leçon clinique à la Salpêtrière''"), a group tableau portrait painted by the [[genre art]]ist [[André Brouillet|Pierre Aristide André Brouillet]] (1857–1914). The painting, which is one of the best known paintings in the history of medicine,<ref>HIMETOP: [http://himetop.wikidot.com/un-lecon-clinique-a-la-salpetriere-1887-by-andre-brouill History of Medicine Topographical Database: "Un Leçon Clinique à la Salpêtrière" (1887) by André Brouillet.]</ref> shows the neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] giving a clinical demonstration to a group of postgraduate students. It hangs in a corridor of the [[Paris Descartes University|Descartes University in Paris]].

== History ==
[[File:André Brouillet.jpg|thumb|<center>André Brouillet.</center>]]
Although "rather undistinguished … artistically … the painting is remarkable for its dimensions, the figures being nearly life size".<ref>Micale (2004), p. 74.</ref>

The painting is a rather large work, painted in bright, highly contrasting colours,<ref>Morlock (2007), p. 129.</ref> measuring 430&nbsp;cm x 290&nbsp;cm.<ref>Signoret (1983), p. 689.</ref>

The work was created by the academic history painter André Brouillet at the age of thirty, from individual studies of the thirty participants,<ref>Morlock (2007, p. 135) argues that most of these individual studies would have been taken by a photographer, rather than sketched by an artist. In support of his claim, Morlock draws attention to the "lack of interaction between the figures in the scene and the marked failures of their [[sightline]]s to meet".</ref>  and presented in the prevailing tradition of academic group portraits. It was first displayed (with favourable notices) at the ''salon d'art'' of 1 May 1887, and later purchased by the ''[[Académie des Beaux-Arts|Academy of Fine Arts]]'' for 3,000 francs.<ref name=Harris2005>Harris (2005), p. 471.</ref>

Brouillet was a pupil of [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] who was, himself, also renowned for the fact that his illustrative paintings, such as ''[[Phryne before the Areopagus]]'' (1861), were so popular as lithographic prints that it seemed they were  "painted in order to be reproduced".<ref>Morloch (2007), p. 134.</ref>

== The setting ==
The painting represents an imaginary scene of a contemporary scientific demonstration, based on real life, and depicts the eminent French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893)]] delivering a clinical lecture and demonstration at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital]] in Paris (the room in which these demonstrations took place no longer exists at the Salpêtrière).<ref name=Harris2005 />

On the rear wall of the lecture room is the (1878) large charcoal work, drawn by the anatomist and medical artist [[Paul Richer]],  which reproduces the hysterical pose captured in one of the many photographs taken in the Salpêtrière.

Entitled ''Periode de contortions'' ("During the contortions"), it depicts "a woman convulsing and assuming the arc-in-circle" posture:<ref name=Harris2005 /> the ''arc en circle'', or [[Opisthotonus]], "the hysteric's classic posture".<ref>Telson (1980), p. 58.</ref>
[[File:DuchenneAppareil.jpg|thumb|250px|Electrotherapeutic device invented by Charcot's teacher, [[Duchenne de Boulogne|Guillaume Duchenne (1806-1875)]].]]
Morloch (2007, p.&nbsp;133), from his study of the actual painting, remarks on the striking and dramatic coincidence that, "in 1878 Richer reproduced the pose in [his] drawing from a photograph … [and] now, 1887 … the hysteric is reproducing in life the pose from the drawing."

Resting on the table to Charcot's right "are a reflex hammer and what is thought to be a Duchenne electrotherapy apparatus".<ref name=Harris2005 />

== The participants ==
Except for the four individuals to Charcot's left, the participants are arranged in two concentric arcs: the inner circle displaying "sixteen of his current and former physician associates [arranged] in reverse order of seniority", and the outer, depicting "the older generation of [physician associates] … along with philosophers, writers, and friends of Charcot".<ref name=Harris2005 />

Both Signoret (1983, p.&nbsp;689) and Harris (2005, p.&nbsp;471) have identified each of the individuals depicted in Brouillet's tableau; and Signoret (passim) provides substantial biographical details of each.

=== The Charcot group ===
The Charcot group of five are (from right-to-left): Mlle. Ecary, a nurse at the Salpêtrière; Marguerite Bottard, the Salpêtrière's nursing director; [[Joseph Babinski]] (1857–1933), Charcot's chief house officer; [[Marie "Blanche" Wittmann]], Charcot's patient; and Jean-Martin Charcot himself.

=== The inner window-side group ===
The six sitting in the window-side of the painting are (from right to left): [[Paul Richer]] (1849–1933), medical artist, anatomist and physician (who created the painting on the back wall); [[Charles Féré|Charles Samson Féré]] (1852–1907), psychiatrist, Charcot's assistant, and Charcot's secretary; [[Pierre Marie]] (1853–1940), neurologist; [[Édouard Brissaud]] (1852–1909), neurologist and pathologist; Paul-Adrien Berbez (1859-?), physician, student of Charcot, and neurologist; and [[Gilbert Ballet]] (1853–1917), destined to be one of Charcot's last chief residents.

=== The outer window-side group ===
The six standing at the window-side of the painting are (from right to left): [[Alix Joffroy]] (1844–1908), anatomical pathologist, neurologist and psychiatrist; [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]] (1867–1936), Charcot's son, at the time a medical student and, later, a polar explorer; [[Mathias-Marie Duval]] (1844-1907), Professor of anatomy and histology; [[Georges Maurice Debove]] (1845–1920), later Dean of the medical school; [[Philippe Burty]], art collector, critic, and writer; and [[Victor André Cornil]] (1837–1908), pathologist, histologist, and politician.

=== The remaining group ===
The remainder are either sitting parallel to the back wall, or on the side of the lecture theatre immediately opposite the windows. The remaining thirteen individuals are (from left to right): [[Théodule-Armand Ribot]] (1839–1916), psychologist; Georges Guignon (1839–1932), neuropsychiatrist, and one of Charcot's last chief residents; [[Albert Londe]] (1858–1917), medical photographer, and [[Chronophotography|chronophotographer]] (wearing an apron); Léon Grujon Le Bas (1834–1907),<ref>A "chevalier de la Légion d'honneur", he was the illegitimate son of [[Philippe Le Bas]]. Originally known as Léon Grujon (Grujon was his mother's family name), he legally changed his name to Léon Grujon Le Bas on 25 June 1860 ([http://www.google.com.au/books?id=ezBS4Y6-koMC&hl=fr&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false Paris, L., ''État présent de la noblesse française'', Bachelin-Deflorenne, 1866, p. 1169.])</ref> chief hospital administrator; [[Albert Gombault]] (1844–1904), neurologist and anatomist; [[Paul Arène]] (1843–1896), novelist; [[Jules Arsène Arnaud Claretie|Jules Claretie]] (1840–1913), journalist and literary figure; [[Alfred Joseph Naquet]] (1834–1916), physician, chemist, and politician; [[Désiré-Magloire Bourneville]] (1840–1909), neurologist and politician; Henry Berbez, younger brother of Paul-Adrien Berbez (sitting opposite), and a student of Charcot; [[Henri Parinaud]] (1844–1905), ophthalmologist and neurologist; Romain Vigouroux, chief of electrodiagnostics, discoverer of the electrical activity of the skin; and, finally, in the apron, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]] (1857–1904), neurologist and physician.

== Current location ==
Apparently the painting has only recently returned to Paris, having "spent most of its life in obscurity in Nice and Lyon".<ref name=Morlock2007>Morlock (2007), p. 131.</ref>

Today it hangs, unframed, in a corridor of the [[Paris Descartes University|Descartes University in Paris]], near to the entrance of the Museum of the History of Medicine, which houses one of the oldest collections of surgical, diagnostic, and physiological instrumentation in Europe.<ref>History of Medicine Topographical Database.</ref>

== Reproductions ==
In the nineteenth century, a considerable number of different versions of the original painting were produced.

Morloch's approximation (2007, p.&nbsp;135) is that there were at least fifteen uniquely different reproductions produced by techniques as varied as "[[engraving]], [[etching]], [[Lithography|lithograph(y)]], [[photogravure]], along with other photomechanical processes" between the painting's first appearance in 1887, and its disappearance from public view in 1891.

=== Freud's lithograph ===
[[Sigmund Freud]] had a small (38.5&nbsp;cm x 54&nbsp;cm)<ref>Morlock (2007), p. 130.</ref> lithographic version of the painting, created by Eugène Pirodon (1824-1908), framed and hung on the wall of his Vienna rooms from 1886 to 1938.<ref name=Morlock2007 />

Once Freud reached England, it was immediately placed directly over the analytical couch in his London rooms.<ref>According to Morlock (2007, p. 130) — who suggests that "[it is almost] as if the painting itself was painted in order to be reproduced" — Pirodon's lithographic reproduction of Brouillet's original "was so successful that it was published at least three times by two separate printers".</ref>
