==Works==
Venables translated in 1864 [[Karl Wieseler]]'s ''Chronological Synopsis of the Four Gospels'', which was included in 1877 in [[Henry Bohn]]'s ''Theological Library'', and he edited in 1869 a translation by his brother G. H. Venables of [[Friedrich Bleek]]'s ''Introduction to the Old Testament'', reproduced in 1875 in Bohn's ''Ecclesiastical Library''. For the Clarendon Press series he edited in 1879 [[John Bunyan]]'s ''Pilgrim's Progress and Grace Abounding''; his life of John Bunyan appeared in 1888 in the ''[[Great Writers Series]]''; and in 1883 he edited the ''Private Devotions'' of [[Lancelot Andrewes]]. He contributed an essay on the ''Architecture of the Cathedrals of England considered Historically'' to [[John Saul Howson]]'s ''Essays on Cathedrals''; and he undertook, though he did not live to finish, a volume on the ''Episcopal Palaces of England'' (it came out in 1895, the accounts of seven of the palaces being by Venables).<ref name="DNB"/>

In 1845 Venables became a member of the [[Royal Archæological Institute]], and contributed papers to its journal. While in the Isle of Wight he compiled, with the assistance of local naturalists, a guide to the island, which was published in 1860. In 1867 he brought out, mainly bases on that book, a smaller ''Guide to the Undercliff of the Isle of Wight''. The city of Lincoln inspired papers by Venables, including lectures: ''A Walk through the Minster'', and two series of ''Walks through the Streets of Lincoln''. An essay by him on Lincoln Cathedral was included in 1893 in ''Our English Minsters'', and printed separately in 1898. He edited in 1882 the fourth edition of Murray's ''Handbook for Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire'', and published in that year a ''Historical Sketch of Bere Regis, Dorset''.<ref name="DNB"/>

Four addresses on ''The Church of England'' delivered in Lincoln Cathedral in September 1886 were published by Venables that year. He was a major contributor to [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]'s ''[[Dictionary of the Bible]]'', ''[[Dictionary of Christian Antiquities]]'', and ''[[Dictionary of Christian Biography]]''; also to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', [[John Kitto]]'s ''Biblical Encyclopædia'', and the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''. He was a frequent writer in the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'', ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenæum]]'', ''[[The Guardian (Anglican newspaper)|The Guardian]]'', and ''[[Good Words]]''.<ref name="DNB"/>

She died the day after his own death, and both were buried on 9 March in the same grave in the cloisters of Lincoln Cathedral. They had one son and six daughters.<ref name="DNB"/>
