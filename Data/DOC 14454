Do you want the chance to improve Wikipedia science coverage? Do you care about women in science? Do you want to be part of an event working with Wiki editors, university librarians and other enthusiasts and make a difference? Then sign up for our Edit-a-thon at the University of Liverpool. Working with Wikimedia UK and the Medical Research Council, the University of Liverpool are organising a Women in Science themed editing event that will take place on Tuesday 13th May 2014 in Liverpool to celebrate Women in Science. 

There are 30 places available at the Wikipedia Edit-a-thon workshop (10:45am – 5:00pm), at which the workshop’s representatives from Wikimedia UK will explain how Wikipedia works and be on hand to answer questions about editing and improving Wikipedia articles.

We will have access to a rich collection of printed and electronic works about women in science, including biographies and works authored by scientists; together with target articles to edit on Wikipedia. Attendees will be encouraged to work together to edit those articles, using the University’s resources and with support from University librarians. The workshop is open to people who are new to Wikipedia as well as experienced Wikipedia editors.

In addition we are pleased to announce that there are 90 places available for an evening Women in Science reception and panel discussion (5:00 – 7:30pm) including a talk by Professor Dame Julia Higgins, who will be accompanied on the panel by Professor Sue Wray, Professor Tara Shears, Professor Ian Greer,  Prof. Jude Robinson of Anthropology of Health and Illness (Department of Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology) and two MRC Fellows, Dr Lauren Walker and Dr Sarah Skeoch.

Come along to discuss how women can be better represented in science and hear how female scientists' careers have flourished.

===Logistics notes===
The university will research some target articles, and will be able to provide printed materials for 3 – 5 of the targeted women. Unfortunately the venue is some distance from the library so we will identify a number of printed resources held by the library and transport them over. 

The university should be able to provide full access to the University’s electronic materials (journals, e-books etc.) However, to do that '''we will need a list of names of non-university editors''' so we can get them set up with access rights/library membership for the event.
