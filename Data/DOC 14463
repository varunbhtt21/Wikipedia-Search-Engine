Title : Nashboro Records
Text : '''Nashboro Records''' was an American [[gospel music|gospel]] label principally active in the 1950s and 1960s.

Nashboro was founded in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] by Ernie Lafayette Young (1892-1977), who was the owner of a record store, Ernie's Record Mart, and sponsor of a weekly hit parade show on radio station [[WLAC]]. In 1951, Young founded Nashboro to issue gospel records, and the following year also created [[Excello Records]] to release secular music, especially R&B and blues acts.<ref name=encyc>Robert Darden, "Nashboro Records". W.K. McNeil, ed. ''Encyclopedia of American Gospel Music''. Routledge, 2013, pp. 270-271.</ref>

Nashboro became a prolific issuer of Southern gospel groups, and Young frequently signed gospel acts from competing labels after they had folded. Some of the groups were backed by the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] in the studio.<ref name=encyc/>

Young died in 1977, by which time Nashboro was increasingly reissuing out of its back catalogue rather than issuing new material. The label's catalogue was sold to [[AVI Records|AVI Entertainment]] in 1979,<ref>{{cite news |last=Lichtman |first=Irv |date=September 1, 1979 |title=American Variety Acquires Nashboro |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT2&dq=%22AVI+Records%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBmoVChMIwpbziouIxgIVhRCSCh2jywDh#v=onepage&q=%22AVI%20Records%22&f=false |newspaper=Billboard |page=3 |access-date=June 11, 2015}}</ref> [[MCA Records]] in 2000, and [[Hip-O]] shortly thereafter.<ref name=encyc/> Relatively little of it has seen reissue, though in 2014 [[Tompkins Square Records]] released a four-CD compilation of Nashboro artists.<ref>''I Heard the Angels Singing: Electrifying Black Gospel from the Nashboro Label, 1951-1983.''

Nashboro was one of several labels to have its catalog of master recordings destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/universal-fire-master-recordings.html|title=The Day the Music Burned|last=Rosen|first=Jody|date=2019-06-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
