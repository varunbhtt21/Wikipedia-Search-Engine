==Overview==
Sources say that common method of the ritual developed during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868).<ref name="nelson">{{Harvnb|Nelson|1996|pp=143–144}}, citing {{cite book|last=Ono|first=Susumu (小野進)|title=古語辞典|year=1974}}</ref>

The woman performing the curse is generally portrayed as dressed in white, with disheveled hair,<ref name="pfoundes"/> wearing an iron "crown" that holds three burning candles,<ref name="joly"/><ref name="nelson"/> suspending (from her neck) a mirror upon her chest<ref name="sekien"/><ref name="joly"/><ref name="kojien"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Mitford|1870|pp=139–140}}</ref> (which lies hidden<ref name="sekien"/>) and wearing a pair of tall [[clogs]] (''[[Geta (footwear)|geta]]'').<ref name="griffis"/><ref group="lower-alpha">{{Harvnb|三橋|2011|pp=264–5}} states that she wears tall clogs with only one support board (「一本歯の高下駄」) , even though the accompanying illustration from a [[Toyohiro|Utagawa Toyohiro]] print clearly shows two supports.</ref> She would then nail a straw doll representing her target to a {{nihongo|sacred tree|[[:ja:御神木|神木]]|shimboku}} at the [[Shinto shrine]].<ref name="pfoundes">{{Harvnb|Pfoundes|1875|pp=19–20}}, quoted in {{Harvnb|Hildburgh|1915|loc=65.

The iron "crown" that she wears is actually a {{nihongo|tripod|[[:ja:五徳|五徳]]|gotoku}} (or [[trivet]],<ref name="kusano"/> a stand for setting cooking pots, etc., above a heat source) which she wears in inverted,<ref name="griffis">{{Harvnb|Griffis|1876|p=474}}</ref> slipping the iron ring over her head and sticking candles on its three legs.<ref name="pfoundes"/>

[[File:A woman makes a cursing ritual ceremony.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|A woman summoning a [[yōkai]] through ''ushi no toki mairi'', by [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]]]]

It was believed that the spot struck on the straw doll corresponded to the area of the body where the target would begin to experience illness or injury.<ref name="pfoundes"/><ref  name="nkdj"/> However, this straw doll or other form of effigy was not a definitive requisite in the ritual even relatively late in the Edo Period. For instance, in [[Toriyama Sekien]]'s  ''[[Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki]]'' (1779, pictured top right) depicts the woman holding a hammer but no doll, nor is the doll mentioned in the caption.<ref name="sekien">Sekien (1779), quote: 「丑時まいりハ、胸に一ツの鏡をかくし、頭に三つの燭〔ともしび〕を點じ、 丑みつの比神社にまうでゝ杉の梢に釘うつとかや。 はかなき女の嫉妬より起りて、人を失ひ身をうしなふ。 人を呪咀〔のろわ〕ば穴二つほれとは、よき近き譬ならん」 Translation: In the ''ushi doki mairi'', [a woman] conceals a mirror in the bosom, lights three candles around her head, visits the shrine in the ''ushi mitsu'' hour (third quarter of the hour of the [[ox (zodiac)|ox]], 2:00~2:30 AM), and drives nails into a [[sugi]] tree. The fleeting jealousies of a woman, brings ruin to the person and body. It is well said the proverb "curse someone, dig a second grave [for yourself]".</ref> In this case, the nails are driven directly into the branches of the sacred tree.

The props used are described somewhat differently, depending on the source. Nails of a particular size called {{nihongo||[[:ja:五寸釘|五寸釘]]|gosun kugi|extra="five inch nails"}} are prescribed according to some authorities.<ref name="kojien"/><ref name="komatsu"/> She may hold in her mouth a [[comb]],<ref name="komatsu">小松和彦(Komatsu, Kazuhiko)「いでたちは白い着物を着て、髮を乱し、顔に白粉、歯には鉄漿、口紅を濃くつくる、頭には鉄輪をかぶり、その三つの足にろうそくを立ててともす。胸に鏡を掛け、口に櫛をくわえる。履き物は歯の高い足駄である」 quoted in:{{citation|last=松井|first=吉昭|contribution=多賀社参詣曼陀羅を読む|publisher=歴研]|year=2000|format=snippet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXY0AQAAIAAJ|isbn=978-4947769022|page=173|title=時と文化: 日本史攷究の視座 : 岡田芳朗先生古稀記念論集}}</ref> or a "torch of bamboo and pine roots lighted at both ends".<ref name="pfoundes"/> The "proper witching hour" is, strictly speaking, the ''ushi no mitsu doki'' (2:00–2:30&nbsp;am).<ref name="sekien"/>

In Sekien's or [[Hokusai]]'s print (above), the woman performing the curse ritual is depicted with a black ox by her side. Such a black ox, lying [[wikt:recumbent|recumbent]], is expected to appear on the seventh night of the ritual, and one must stride or straddle over the animal to complete the task to success,<ref>{{citation|editor-last=関|editor-first=一敏|editor2-last=大塚|editor2-first=和夫|title=宗教人類学入門|publisher=弘文堂|year=2004|page=149}}</ref> but if one betrays fear at the ox's apparition the "potency of the charm is lost".<ref name="pfoundes"/>

==History==
{{See also|Hashihime}}

In earlier times, the term simply referred to worshiping at the shrine during the hours of the ox, and the curse connotation developed later. At the [[Kifune Shrine]] in [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], there was a tradition that if one prayed here on the "ox hour of the ox day of the ox month of the [[Ox (zodiac)|ox year]]" the wish was likely to be granted, because it was during this alignment of the hour, day, month, and year that the Kibune deity was believed to have made descent upon the shrine. However, the shrine became known a cursing spot in later development.<ref name="mitsuhashi">{{Harvnb|三橋|2011|pp=264–5}}</ref>

The Kibune Shrine became strongly associated with the ox hour curse following the fame of the medieval legend of the [[Hashihime]] of [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] ("The Princess of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Uji Bridge{{!}}Bridge of Uji|2=ja|3=宇治橋|preserve=1}}"). The legend is considered the prime source of the later conception ''Ushi no toki mairi'' curse ritual.<ref name="mitsuhashi"/><ref name="marvin">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Marvin|first=Stephen E.|title=Heaven has a face, so does hell: the art of the Noh mask|volume=1|publisher=Floating World Editions|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bNJAQAAIAAJ|page=278|isbn=978-1891640322}}</ref> According to legend, Hashihime in mortal life was the daughter of a certain nobleman, but consumed by jealousy, made a wish to become a ''kijin'' (an ''[[oni]]'' demon) capable of destroying her love rival. After  7 days at Kifune Shrine, she was finally given revelation by the resident deity "to bathe for thirty seven days in the rapids of the [[Uji River]]."<ref name="kato-on-heike-hashihime">{{citation|last=Kato|first=Eileen|contribution=The Iron Crown (Kanawa)|editor-last=Keene|editor-first=Donald|work=Twenty Plays of the Nō Theatre|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1970|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ea1vu0-3FiUC&pg=PA193|pages=193–194ff|title=Twenty Plays of the N? Theatre|isbn=9780231034555}}</ref> Note that even though Kibune has later been seen as a mecca for the ritual, Hashihime only learned the recipe here, and enacted it miles away (Kifune is in the north of Kyoto, the Uji River is to the south).

The earliest written text of the legend occurs in a late [[Kamakura period|Kamakura-period]] variant text (''Yashirobon'' codex<ref name="selinger"/>) of ''[[The Tale of Heike]]'', under the ''Tsurugi no maki'' ("Book of the Sword") chapter.<ref name="kawashima">{{citation|last=Kawashima|first=Terry|title=Writing Margins: The Textual Construction of Gender in Heian and Kamakura Japan|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC807wsyLA0C&pg=PA272|pages=272–|isbn=978-0674005167}}</ref> According to it, Hashihime was originally a mortal during the reign of [[Emperor Saga]] (809 to 823),<ref name="kato-on-heike-hashihime"/> but after turning demon and killing her rival, her man's kinsmen, then indiscriminately other innocent parties, she lived on beyond the normal human life span, to prey on the samurai [[Watanabe no Tsuna]] at the {{nihongo|Ichijo Modoribashi|[[:ja:一条戻橋|一条戻橋]]|extra2="Turning Back bridge at the street crossing of Ichijō and Horikawa"}} bridge, only to have her arm severed by the sword {{nihongo|Higekiri|[[:ja:髭切|髭切]]}}.<ref name="kawashima"/> Tsuna kept the demon's arm, whose power was contained by the {{nihongo|Yinyang master|[[:ja:陰陽師|陰陽師]]|[[Onmyōdō#onmyōji|onmyōji]]}} [[Abe no Seimei]], via chanting the [[Humane King Sutra|Ninnō-kyō]] sutra.<ref name="selinger">{{citation|last=Selinger|first=Vyjayanthi R.|title=Writing Margins: The Textual Construction of Gender in Heian and Kamakura Japan|publisher=BRILL|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbwdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA130|pages=130|isbn=978-9004255333}}</ref> In this variant of the "chapter of the sword",  the ceremony that the woman undergoes at the Uji River to transmogrify into the demon is described as follows:

<blockquote>
Secluding herself in a deserted spot, she divided her long hair into five bunches and fashioned these bunches into horns. She daubed her face with vermilion and her body with cinnabar, set on her head an iron tripod with burning brands [* <ref group="lower-alpha">or "to each of its leg, a torch made with pine wood is tied and afired" in {{Harvnb|Kusano|1962|p=30}}</ref>] attached to its legs and held in her mouth  another brand, burning at both ends. 
{{right|&mdash;From ''Tsurugi no Maki''<ref name="kusano">{{citation|last=Kusano|first=Eisaburō|title=Stories behind noh and kabuki plays|publisher=Tokyo News Service|year=1962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USm1AAAAIAAJ|page=30}}</ref><ref name="kato-tr-kanawa">{{Harvnb|Kato|1970}}</ref><ref>Kato, quoted in {{Harvnb|Murguia|2013}}</ref>}}
</blockquote>

Thus in the ''Tsurugi no maki'' can be seen such elements as the wearing of the tripod (here called {{nihongo||鉄輪|kanawa}}) and propping lit torches (similar to candles in later tradition), but the woman painted her entire face and body red, rather than remain in pure white garb.

Later during the [[Muromachi period]], this legend was adapted by [[Zeami Motokiyo|Zeami]]<ref name="kusano"/> into the [[Noh]] play ''Kanawa'' or "The Iron Crown".<ref name="kato-tr-kanawa"/> The Noh play inherits essentially the same outfit for the principal woman, who is commanded by the oracle to  "daub your face with red and wear scarlet clothing,"<ref name="mitsuhashi"/><ref name="kato-tr-kanawa"/> and uses neither a straw doll or hammer,<ref name="mitsuhashi"/> but has the yingyang master Seimei creates "two life-size straw effigies of the man and his new wife [with] their names [placed] inside" in order to perform the rites to excorcize Hashihime's demon.<ref name="kato-tr-kanawa"/> Therefore, the later form of the ''ushi no mairi'' developed afterwards, {{Citation needed span|date=April 2014|text=through the marriage of the use of dolls in the Japanese esoteric art of ''[[onmyōdō]]'' with the shrine visiting of the ox hour}}.

=== Curse using dolls in antiquity ===
The use of dolls in the cursing ritual has been practiced since antiquity, with a reference in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' chronicle under the reign of [[Emperor Yōmei]], which relates that in the year 587, Nakatomi no Katsumi no Muraji "preparede figures of the {{Nihongo|Imperial Prince Oshisaka no Hikohito no Ōe|[[:ja:押坂彦人大兄皇子|押坂彦人大兄皇子]]}}&nbsp;... and [spellcast] them", but it did not work.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|author-link=William George Aston|last=Aston|first=William George|title=Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697|volume=1|place=London|publisher=Japan Society of London|year=1896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IJrNAKBpycC&pg=PA109|page=109–}}</ref> However, this record does not clarify if the dolls were poked by sharp implements.

There are unearthed [[Archeology|archeological]] relics shaped like human dolls suspected of being used in curses. Called {{nihongo|wooden purificatory figurines|木製人形代|Mokusei hitogatashiro}}, some have faces realistically drawn and ink, and others with iron nails driven into the breast. One such from the 8th century is held by the [[Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties]].<ref>{{citation|last=永藤|first=靖 (Nagafuji, Yasushi)|title=古代仏教説話の方法: 霊異記から験記へ|publisher=三弥井書店 |year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNcxAAAAMAAJ|pages=22}}</ref><ref name="umeya">{{cite web|last=梅屋|first=潔 (Umeya, Kiyoshi)|title=のろい (noroi)|website=日本民俗学会編『民俗学事典』丸善、近刊予定|volume=Ⅲ-④-10 および 19|format=pdf|url=http://www2.kobe-u.ac.jp/~umeya/site01/_userdata/noroi.pdf|accessdate=April 2014}}</ref> Another from the Tatechō site in [[Matsue, Shimane]], a wooden tag depicts a female figure, apparently a noblewoman deducing from attire, and this doll had three wooden pegs or nails driven into it, aiming at her breasts and her heart.<ref>{{citation|last=勝部|first=昭|others=川原和人, 宮澤明久, 柳浦俊一, 大谷祐司, 長峰康典|title=タテチョウ遺跡発掘調査報告書III|publisher=島根県教育委員会|year=1990|url=http://rar.lib.shimane-u.ac.jp/Repository/metadata/8441|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429184253/http://rar.lib.shimane-u.ac.jp/Repository/metadata/8441|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-04-29|pages=375, 377註2}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140429190353/http://rar.lib.shimane-u.ac.jp/Repository/file/8441/20090804000000/%E3%82%BF%E3%83%86%E3%83%81%E3%83%A7%E3%82%A6%E9%81%BA%E8%B7%A1%E7%99%BA%E6%8E%98%E8%AA%BF%E6%9F%BB%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A%E6%9B%B8III%E6%9C%AC%E7%B7%A8(2).pdf 本編(2).pdf ]</ref>
