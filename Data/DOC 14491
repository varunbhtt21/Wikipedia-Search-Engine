Text : {{more citations needed|date=April 2014}}

A '''functional brief''', in [[project management]], is a [[document]] that talks about the functional [[Specification (technical standard)|specifications]] of the product that is being developed. A well-defined functional brief allows for all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] to be aware of the scope of the product, the intended functionality and when finalized ensures that there is no [[feature creep]]. Once the document is created it is used to conduct a [[feasibility study]] and can be used to develop costs and time estimates of the final product.

* The major functional aspects of the product, 
* How they are intended to interact and their inter-dependencies, 
* How the product being developed matches the organization's goals and policies,
* How the user would interact with the product and 
* What output they intend to obtain from the product.

The functional brief can also contain information about the future plans for the product so that developers can ensure that while designing the product these considerations are included.
