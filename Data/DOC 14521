== Development ==
The original purpose for ''EverQuest Next Landmark'' was mainly as a player content creation tool for ''[[EverQuest Next]]''.<ref name=AboutLandmark /><ref name=Polygon-2014-4-21>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/4/21/5637236/landmark-sony-online-development-model-interview|title=How Landmark forced Sony Online to change its usual development model|author=Samit Sarkar|work=Polygon}}</ref>  In April 2014, Dave Georgeson, director of development on the ''[[EverQuest]]'' series, told [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] in the interview that "Sony Online [Daybreak] won't ever be finished making ''Landmark''".<ref name=Polygon-2014-4-21 /> On February 2, 2015, [[Sony]] sold [[Sony Online Entertainment]] to the investment company [[Columbus Nova]], who renamed it [[Daybreak Game Company]]. In June 2015, it was announced that [[Daybreak Game Company]] shifted its focus of development from ''Landmark'' to ''EverQuest Next'', meaning that "any features that are ''Landmark''-only are lower in priority and will have to wait until we have time to come back to them."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.landmarkthegame.com/news/landmark-everquest-next-eqn-producer-letter-june-2015|title=Producer's Letter: June 2015|date=5 June 2015|publisher=Daybreak Game Company}}</ref>
