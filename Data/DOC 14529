This good article is about an episode of [[Breaking Bad (season 4)|fourth season]] of the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. [[User:Fanaction2031|Fanaction2031]] ([[User talk:Fanaction2031|talk]]) 07:40, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Comments''' This article is pretty good, at least a solid GA, but has its main contributor [[User:Hunter Kahn]] been informed of the nomination? Does he think it is ready for FAC?—[[User:Indopug|indopug]] ([[User talk:Indopug|talk]]) 05:47, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*I will inform him now. Thanks! [[User:Fanaction2031|Fanaction2031]] ([[User talk:Fanaction2031|talk]]) 23:53, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
**I was not aware of the FAC nomination prior to being notified, and I haven't worked on the article for quite some time, but I see that Fanaction2031 has done a bit of work on it. I'm sure it was comprehensive and used every available source at the time that I wrote it, but I am not sure whether there have been any new sources published since then. (Perhaps Fanaction2031 is aware of this.) But in any event, I'd be happy to help in any way I can with the FAC process if it moves forward. (I'd also be happy to be listed as a co-nominator since I'm the main contributor, but that can be up to Fanaction since he first nominated it.) — <b>[[User:Hunter Kahn|<font color="#C0C0C0">Hun</font>]][[User talk:Hunter Kahn|<font color="#C0C0C0">ter</font>]] [[Special:Contributions/Hunter_Kahn|<font color="#595454">Ka</font>]][[User:Hunter Kahn/Autographs|<font color="#595454">hn</font>]]</b> 14:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
***I've seen this situation arise before. I think it would be appropriate for Kahn's name to be placed first, followed by the editor who did some recent enhancements. I have to say though Fanaction, your actions look a bit selfish to say the least.--[[User:Petergriffin9901|<font color="black" face="Lucida Calligraphy">'''CallMe'''</font><font color ="purple" face= "Lucida Calligraphy">'''''Nathan'''''</font>]]  &bull; [[User talk:Petergriffin9901|<font face="Garamond">Talk2Me</font>]]  03:40, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
****Fanaction is the second major contributor, and Hunter Kahn hasn't worked on the article in eight months. If both are happy to proceed with the nomination there's merit for review. As a religious BB fan I'll be happy to review the article (after seeing if there's additional material that could be mentioned).

*****I'd just like to note I'm not accusing Fanaction of any ill intentions or anything like that. I assume he made the nomination [[WP:AGF|in good faith]] because he legitimately thinks it could be an FA, and I don't read anything into my exclusion with the nomination. And again, I'm happy to work with him or anyone else in getting the article up to the proper standards. — <b>[[User:Hunter Kahn|<font color="#C0C0C0">Hun</font>]][[User talk:Hunter Kahn|<font color="#C0C0C0">ter</font>]] [[Special:Contributions/Hunter_Kahn|<font color="#595454">Ka</font>]][[User:Hunter Kahn/Autographs|<font color="#595454">hn</font>]]</b> 19:20, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

==== Comments from CR4ZE ====
*The Plot section should be written with as broad an audience as possible. The unfamiliarised reader has not seen previous episodes and cannot understand "who insisted that if Gale is dead, Gus could not kill them as he had planned because he would have nobody to produce meth for him". This begs the question as to why Gus is planning on killing them. Somebody like myself who has seen every episode of the show will understand this, but others won't. Would [[Full Measure|Gale to death]] be violating [[WP:EGG]]?
*A big problem for the article is the Production section, which is quite disorganised. The first paragraph is different facts about the production that seem to have been pieced together. For example, it begins to discuss Gale's death, but then in the second paragraph there's more explanation about Gilligan's final decision to kill him off. This information should be kept together within a paragraph. I think the entire section should be reworked as such. There may be merit in splitting off into sub-subsections.
*"the audience reaction to "Full Measure" made Gilligan and the Breaking Bad writing staff" – What was the audience reaction exactly?
*The fifth and penultimate paragraphs get into thematic analysis that doesn't really fit. Should certainly be split off, either as a sub or its own standalone section.
*Reviews to me feels lacking in concision. It would work much better if paragraphs were organised by individual aspects instead of by reviewer. The paragraphs feel too bulky and lacking flow. "However, he said it felt like [...] the two main protagonists" doesn't feel particularly relevant, but it could be reworked into a new final paragraph addressing criticisms. "could make the actor worthy of ''contention'' for an Emmy Award"—not the right word choice.
*The article needs some TLC, but the issues are not completely unassailable. [[User:CR4ZE|CR<font size="3">4</font>ZE]] ([[User talk:CR4ZE|t]] &bull; [[Special:Contributions/CR4ZE|c]]) 07:01, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

:*No edits have been made to the article in over four weeks.

::*Looks to me like this review's gone stale, because the nominator has [[Special:Contributions/Fanaction2031|barely been editing]] lately. On those grounds, you can take my above comments as an '''Oppose''' vote.

*'''Oppose''' - Per everything and above.
