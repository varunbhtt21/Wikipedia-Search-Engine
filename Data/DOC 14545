Title : South African Defence Review 2012
Text : {{Use South African English|date=November 2014}}
The '''South African Defence Review 2012''' was a policy review process carried out by a panel of experts, chaired by retired politician and former Minister of Defence, [[Roelf Meyer]]. The review was commissioned by [[Lindiwe Sisulu]] the then [[Minister of Defence and Military Veterans]], in July 2011. The review was motivated by the need to correct the errors and shortcomings of the previous review.

== The 1998 Defence Review and its consequences ==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
The [[South African Defence Review 1998|previous Defence Review]], performed by management consultants from [[Deloitte and Touche]] in 1998, which forms the basis of current defence policy, resulted a number of serious problems.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} 
* Aging lower ranks and medically unfit personnel cannot be discharged due to enlistment contracts being based on civil service employment principles.
* Inadequate provision for expeditionary/foreign deployment capacity. The review in fact assumed the SANDF would not perform any foreign deployments. The reality is however that the SANDF has been and still is heavily engaged in [[United Nations]] and [[African Union]] peacekeeping and enforcement operations (see the [[United Nations Force Intervention Brigade]] for example) in numerous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. This oversight has necessitated the expensive chartering of foreign civilian heavy airlifters to support the deployed troops.
* "Corporatised" structure not suited to military operational requirements - [[South African Army]] brigade and division structures were abolished and replaced by separate "formations" by role such as infantry, armour, intelligence, training, artillery, engineers, etc. This created a "silo" structural system which complicated and hindered interaction and integration of the different elements. Deane-Peter Baker of the South African [[Institute for Security Studies]] said that the D&T plan, while alleviating, to an extent, the mistrust of the new South African leadership of the remaining apartheid-era [[South African Defence Force]] personnel in middle management positions, reduced the combat effectiveness of the Army, and was seen by 2011 as a mistake, as was the decision to limit the force design of the SANDF to rely on short logistic lines for highly mechanised mobile forces in defence of national territory, as it causes many supply issues during modern foreign deployments. This is one of the major problems of the army and various solutions are being considered by the government to better equip forces deployed in out-of-area force projection operations.<ref name=ISSAF>{{cite web|title=The post-apartheid South African military: Transforming with the nation|url=http://www.issafrica.org/pubs/Books/Evol_Revol%20Oct%2005/Chap9.pdf|publisher=Institute for Security Studies Africa|accessdate=3 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503151643/http://www.issafrica.org/pubs/Books/Evol_Revol%20Oct%2005/Chap9.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2014|df=}}</ref>
* "Top heavy" command structure (generals/troops ratio too high)

According to defence minister Lindiwe Sisulu, the old report was no longer relevant to South Africa's current situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sanews.gov.za/south-africa/draft-defence-review-report-released-0|title=Draft Defence Review report released|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207194545/http://sanews.gov.za/south-africa/draft-defence-review-report-released-0|archivedate=2014-12-07|df=}}</ref>

=== Immediate capability enhancements ===
Immediate capability enhancements that are required to ensure that the SANDF can adequately perform its missions were identified in the consultative draft of the defence review.<ref name="first draft">{{cite journal|url=http://sadefencereview2012.org/publications/Defence%20Review~Draft%20005A~Print%20Version.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115195336/http://sadefencereview2012.org/publications/Defence%20Review~Draft%20005A~Print%20Version.pdf |title=South African Defence Review 2012 - Draft Document for Public Engagement |publisher=sadefencereview2012.org |date=2012-04-12 |archivedate=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}</ref>{{rp|pages 418–420}}

==== Special forces ====
The [[South African Special Forces]] require additional weapons and systems, including a small number of dedicated aircraft for insertion/extraction missions. Additional units should be created for specialised missions.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|pages 418–419}}

==== Border security ====
The following needs were identified to ensure the SANDF can adequately defend South African borders.
* Agile and protected patrol vehicles.
* Surveillance equipment including [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAVs), particularly micro-UAVs. Mobile and fixed acoustic, [[Optoelectronics|optronic]] and [[radar]] monitoring systems.
* A "backbone" communications system integrated with tactical [[South African Air Force|air]], [[South African Army|ground]] and [[South African Police Service|police]] communication systems.
* Various types of [[non-lethal weapon]]s.
* A system to collate data for intelligence led operations.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|page 419}}

==== Air Space Surveillance and Protection ====
The review found that static, mobile and airborne radar systems to track low-flying aircraft, and aircraft with the capability to intercept low and slow flying target aircraft, were required in order for the SANDF to enhance its air surveillance and protection capabilities.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|page 419}}

==== Extended Maritime Security Capability ====
[[Somalia|Somali]]-based piracy expanding into the [[Mozambique channel]] had been identified as a risk, and an urgent reason to expand South Africa's maritime capability. Immediate requirements for [[maritime patrol aircraft]], [[offshore patrol vessel]]s, additional shipboard helicopters and shoreline patrol equipment, were identified.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|page 419}}

==== Crisis Response Capability ====
[[File:Boeing 707 b.jpg|thumbnail|The SAAF's [[Boeing 707]]s, previously used for in-flight refuelling, were retired in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saairforce.co.za/the-airforce/squadrons/12/60-squadron|title=60 Squadron|publisher=The Unofficial South African Air Force|accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref>]]
The following requirements were identified to enable the SANDF to fulfill South Africa's regional security responsibilities:
* Equipment and weapons for parachute and [[air assault|air-landed]] battalion groups.
* A rejuvenation and expansion of medium airlift capability.
* Heavy/long range aircraft that when combined with the medium airlift aircraft, will allow the Defence Force to deploy a parachute battalion group or an air-landed battalion group within 48 hours from South Africa to anywhere within the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) region, or from a forward base within the continental SADC region to anywhere in an adjoining country.
* The establishment of [[in-flight refuelling]] capabilities to enable effective fighter support for crisis response deployments, and to extend the reach of the Special Forces.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|pages 419–420}}

=== Urgent capability enhancements ===
[[File:Ratel 90 armyrecognition South-Africa 008.jpg|thumb|A [[Ratel IFV]], in service since 1977.]]
[[File:Denel AH-2 Rooivalk (1988329653).jpg|thumb|{{As of|2014}}, the South African built [[Denel Rooivalk]] has still not received its  [[Mokopa]] [[anti-tank guided missile]]s due to a lack of funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/36210/south-africa-s-defence-minister-calls-for-rooivalk-line-to-be-reopened|title=South Africa's defence minister calls for Rooivalk line to be reopened |date= 31 March 2014 |last=Heitman |first=Helmoed |publisher=Jane's Defence Weekly|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>]]
[[File:SAS Drakensberg A301 a.jpg|thumb|The [[SAS Drakensberg (A301)]], in service since 1987]]
Various areas were identified by the review in which the SANDF lacks adequate capability to perform near/medium term missions. Obsolete equipment that needed to be replaced in order for the SANDF to retain its capabilities were identified.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|420}}

==== Infantry Combat Vehicles ====
Infantry combat vehicles are suited to peacekeeping missions. The 30-year-old [[Ratel IFV]] was identified as being obsolete, making maintenance difficult, so it was suggested that they be replaced urgently.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|420}}

==== Armoured Personnel Carriers ====
The [[Casspir]] and [[Mamba APC]] vehicles were identified as obsolete and in urgent need of replacement. The [[Mfezi Ambulance]] is also in need of replacement. A need for [[MRAP|Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected]] patrol vehicles has arisen.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|421}}

==== Logistic Vehicles ====
The currently used [[SAMIL Trucks]] were identified as obsolete and in need of replacement.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|421}}

==== Light Artillery ====
Recent conflicts in Africa have proven that light artillery that can be deployed quickly is needed. A [[G7 howitzer|105mm long-range gun]] and ammunition family has been under development by [[Denel Land Systems]] since 2012.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|421}}

==== Aerial Weapons ====
Weapons for the [[JAS-39 Gripen]], [[BAe Hawk]] and [[Denel Rooivalk]] are needed in order for them to be operated effectively.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|421}}

==== Combat Support Ships ====
It was identified that future operations of the [[South African Navy]] might be extended to the Mozambique Channel. The [[SAS Drakensberg (A301)]] was identified for replacement.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|421}}

=== Force support requirements ===
Requirements for essential supporting equipment were also included in the consultative review. It was identified that there was a lot of obsolete or unsuitable equipment. This included water purification, field kitchen, field accommodation equipment, obsolete field workshop equipment and old field hospital equipment. The need for the re-establishment of a tactical airfield unit capability for the Air Force, in order to operate aircraft away from bases, was also identified. The acquisition of munitions and explosives to allow rebuilding of ammunition stocks and effective live-fire and explosives training was also highlighted.<ref name="first draft"/>{{rp|421}}

The Defence Review identified 4 main goals of the SANDF:
#Defend and Protect South Africa
#Safeguard South Africa
#Promote Peace & Security
#Developmental & other tasks

To meet these goals the Review identified a number of Required Defence Capabilities:
* Joint Command and Control
* Defence Diplomacy
* Special Forces
* Special Operations forces
* Medium-Combat forces - configured and maintained as a projectable, multi-roled medium-combat capability with enhanced fire-power, manoeuvreability and protection making it suitable for a range of contingencies.
* Heavy-Combat forces - to deter South Africa’s potential adversaries and conduct landward operations in high-threat situations and to augment the Medium-Combat forces
* Maritime Operations
* Air Operations
* Military Health
* Information Warfare capability

Realising that the cost of implementing all of the recommendations was immense, the Review recommended 5 Planning milestones for implementing the Review's recommendations:
* Planning Milestone 1: Arrest the decline in critical capabilities through immediate, directed interventions.
* Planning Milestone 2: Rebalance and re-organise the Defence Force as the foundation for future growth.
* Planning Milestone 3: Create a sustainable Defence Force that can meet current ordered defence commitments.
* Planning Milestone 4: Enhance the Defence Force’s capacity to respond to nascent challenges in the strategic environment.
* Planning Milestone 5: Defend the Republic against insurgency and/or armed conflict to the level of limited war.

===Force Design===
The Review proposed a re-organisation of the combat forces. <!-- Need to add Air Force, Navy, MHS and J Ops -->

====Army====
It is proposed that operational forces be grouped under a Land Command, with the combat elements organized into brigades
grouped into three divisions, each of which has a specific operational focus. In addition, some specialized elements will be
under direct command of the Land Command.:<ref name=final/>{{rp|page 232}}
The three divisions are:
# Mechanised Division
# Motorised Division
# Contingency or Special Operations Division

As a short term measure it is recommended that the South African Army consolidate its existing force structure into a Land Command comprising one Division and two Brigades:
# A motorised division.
