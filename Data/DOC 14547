'''David Page''' [[FRSE]] FGS LLD (1814–1879) was a 19th-century Scottish [[geologist]] and scientific author. He was President of the Edinburgh Geological Society.

==Early life==

Page was born on 24 August 1814 in [[Lochgelly]], [[Fifeshire]], where his father was a mason and builder. After being educated locally he was sent, at age 14, to the [[University of St Andrews]], to be study divinity. However, he never joined the ministry and instead worked in scientific lecturing and journalism, acting for a time as editor of a Fifeshire newspaper.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Page, David|volume=43}}</ref>

==At Chambers, and the ''Vestiges'' controversy==

In 1843 Page became the Scientific Editor to [[W. & R. Chambers]], publishers in [[Edinburgh]]. He is supposed to have assisted [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] in writing the ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''.<ref name="DNB"/> He was recruited to Chambers in 1843, while ''Vestiges'', published 1844, was being written. His role is said, in fact, to have been to correct mistakes in science, in the first few editions. Later Page was in dispute with Chambers over his conditions of employment, wishing to be made a partner. He left the firm on bad terms with management, and revealed the authorship of Robert Chambers in 1854, after one of his lectures: up to this point it had been a well-guarded secret.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=21091|title=Page, David|first=J.
