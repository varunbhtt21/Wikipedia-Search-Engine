'''Anna Richards Brewster''' (1870–1952) was an American painter.

==Biography==
She was born in the [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. Her parents were the poet and playwright [[Anna Matlack Richards|Anna Matlack]] and the landscape painter [[William Trost Richards]]. One of her brothers, [[Theodore William Richards]], won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1914.

She studied at [[Cowles Art School]] in [[Boston]], where she won a First Scholarship in Ladies Life Classes in 1888, as well as with [[William Merritt Chase]] and [[John LaFarge]] at the [[Art Students League of New York]] in 1890.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Book of Sketches|last=Richards Brewster|first=Anna|last2=Tenney Brewster|first2=William|publisher=|year=1954|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}</ref> In 1890, she won the Dodge Prize awarded by the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy]] for the best picture painted by an American woman of any age. The winning painting, titled ''An Interlude to Chopin'', has since been lost.<ref>Dodge Prize Certificate, 1890, Brewster family papers (AAA), reel 3796, frame 0224.</ref> She traveled to Europe periodically between 1890 and 1895, painting alongside her father in England, Ireland and Scotland, and studying at [[Académie Julian]] in Paris.<ref>Brewster, p. 10.</ref> In 1896, she relocated to [[London]] where she lived for nine years, keeping a public studio in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and exhibiting four times at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]].<ref>Brewster McClatchy, p. 12.</ref>

Brewster illustrated several publications in collaboration with her mother [[Anna Matlack Richards|Anna Matlack]] throughout the 1890s, including ''[[A New Alice in the Old Wonderland]]'' in 1895, ''Letter and spirit, dramatic sonnets of inward life'', published 1898, and a translation of a German folktale, ''Sintram and His Companions,'' published in 1900. The success of these publications led to a commission for illustrations in ''Bill Nye's Comic History of England''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anna Richards Brewster American Impressionist|last=Brewter McClatchy|first=Susan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-520-25749-8|editor-last=Maxwell|editor-first=Judith|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|pages=11}}</ref>

In 1905, she married [[Barnard College]] literature professor William Tenney Brewster, who thereafter encouraged her to paint. The couple traveled extensively in Europe, North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, Syria and the United States. Her active professional output slowed after the death of her young son, Herbert, in 1910, yet she continued to paint landscapes abroad, exhibit work and participate in artistic communities. She was a founding member of the [http://www.scarsdaleartassociation.org/ Scarsdale Art Association], , where she served as the first Vice President of Artist members, and a member of the [[National Association of Women Artists|National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]]. Throughout the 1910s she carried out commissions, including a [[World War I]] poster distributed nationally by the [[Red Cross]], as well as a series of eight portraits of [[Columbia University]] professors. During this period she also had several solo shows at New York art galleries, and continued to exhibit periodically at the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy]] until 1935.

==Legacy==
Anna Richards Brewster was among the most successful international women artists of her time, yet her name has largely been forgotten. Upon her death in 1952, memorial exhibitions were organized at the [[Museum of the City of New York]], the [[Butler Institute of American Art]] and the [[Georgia Museum of Art|Georgia Art Museum]]. Her husband gave much of her work to public and private institutions at the time, and published a series of four books detailing her life and art.
She is known today for sculptures and illustrations as well as paintings, which are found in museums and private collections across the United States and Europe. Like many American artists at the turn of the 20th century, Brewster made paintings of scenes from her travels; the [[Huntsville Museum of Art]] has one of fishermen in [[Volendam]].<ref name="RKD">[http://explore.rkd.nl/nl/artists/12496 "Anna Richards Brewster"].

Recent decades have seen a slight revival of interest in her work, including a solo exhibition at the [[Newport Art Museum]] in 1985, and a major solo exhibition in 2008 which traveled between the [[Hudson River Museum]], [[Butler Institute of American Art]] and the [[Fresno Metropolitan Museum]]. The catalogue for the 2008 exhibition, edited by Judith Kafka Maxwell, contained extensive biographical articles, as well as the first scholarly appraisals of her life and works within the context of late Victorian and early twentieth century women artists.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/oclc/192045624.html|title=Anna Richards Brewster, American impressionist|last=Brewster|first=Anna Richards|last2=Maxwell|first2=Judith Kafka|last3=Hudson River Museum|last4=Butler Institute of American Art|last5=Fresno Metropolitan Museum of Art|first5=History, and Science|date=2008-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|language=English}}</ref>
