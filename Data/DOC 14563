| ShortSummary    = In 1957, Jenny Lee ([[Jessica Raine]]) arrives for her new job at Nonnatus House, a nursing convent in the [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] district of London. The convent is home to a small order of nuns consisting of Sister Julienne ([[Jenny Agutter]]), Sister Evangelina ([[Pam Ferris]]), Sister Bernadette ([[Laura Main]]), and Sister Monica Joan ([[Judy Parfitt]]). Two other midwives, Beatrix "Trixie" Franklin ([[Helen George]]) and Cynthia Miller ([[Bryony Hannah]]), already work at the convent, as does handyman Frederick "Fred" Buckle ([[Cliff Parisi]]). Jenny also meets local physician Dr Patrick Turner ([[Stephen McGann]]). After some initial difficulties fitting in, Jenny's first assigned expectant mother is Conchita Warren, a Spanish woman who does not understand English and already has a huge family. Conchita suffers a [[concussion]] in a fall, which also triggers premature labour, making Jenny's first delivery a traumatic and difficult one which she must handle alone.

She hails from an upper-class background and aspires to become a Christian missionary, but finds getting to grips with her new job difficult and Sister Evangelina a harsh critic. While struggling to learn to ride a bicycle (which the midwives use to make their rounds), she encounters local policeman Peter Noakes (Ben Caplan). Meanwhile, Jenny befriends Mary, a pregnant teenaged girl from Ireland, who was forced into prostitution upon her arrival in London but wants to try to make a better life for herself and her child.

Meanwhile, Trixie and Cynthia deal with the case of a woman in her forties who is upset at having become pregnant comparatively late in life, even though her husband is delighted at the prospect. It is later revealed that her reluctance to give birth is because she knows that the child will be dark-skinned, the result of a brief affair. When the child is born, her husband adores the baby nevertheless.

| ShortSummary    = Most of the Nonnatus House staff travel to a tiny rural mission hospital in [[South Africa]], which is threatened with closure. There they hold a well-attended oral polio vaccination clinic. They find the health of the patients severely threatened by a dwindling and dirty water supply, and must try to convince a local land-owner with a grudge against the establishment to allow a new life-saving pipeline to run across his farm.
