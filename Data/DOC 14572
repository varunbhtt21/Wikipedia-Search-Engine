*<s> ... that the '''[[Hildesheim Cathedral]]''' ''(pictured)'', now a [[World Heritage Site]], was destroyed in World War II but the symbolic "Thousand-year Rose" survived?</s>

<small>5x expanded by [[User:Furius|Furius]] ([[User talk:Furius|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) at 08:04, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] I have my doubts whether this article meets DYK criteria because large parts of it are completely unreferenced although I realise it was translated from the German Wikipedia article. There is also no inline citation for the hook fact and no reference for the whole rose section. Nice article though.

::* I noticed the major expansion - which I had asked for - only today and nominated immediately, because it was a few hours late anyway, sorry for that. I will look into referencing myself, but can start only later today. The rose section is in preparation, with refs. I [[User talk:Hafspajen#Rose blooming|asked]] about inclusion here or separate article, another point that will need patience, --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 13:30, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::Oooops, that was an article we started a draf on. About the "Thousand-year Rose"... if this is what the shall be ... [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 18:50, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::<s>'''ALT1''': ... that the treasure of the '''[[Hildesheim Cathedral]]''', a [[World Heritage Site]], contains the 11th century [[Hezilo chandelier]] ''(pictured)''?</s> --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 16:03, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Sorry to be awkward, the article is coming along well, but there is still much unreferenced material. With regard to ALT1, the word "Ottonian" is not used in the article when referring to the cathedral. The chandelier is not in the cathedral at this time but that is OK because the hook has it in the treasure rather than in the building. The chandelier, or “Heziloleuchter”, may be a "wheel" chandelier but it does not actually say this in the source (maybe this is a bit of a nitpick). [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 18:18, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::: No need to be sorry, I didn't expect to be done, just wanted to report that things are moving ;) - we can always replace Ottonian by Romanesque, but I thought of the recent improvements of [[Ottonian art]]. How can we deal with the fact that this Unesco heritage site is covered in books, only we don't know on what pages of which book. The German ''Radleuchter'' is translated differently in different sources, wheel chandelier is literal (and the name of the en-WP article), other names are ''corona'' (of light) and circular chandeliers. Can the official [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/187 Unesco page] be used as ref (which mentions "Ottonian Romanesque")? --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 20:46, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::: Please look again, --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 13:32, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::: Now we have a stub article to link to, may grow, - Ottonian dropped, not too may links, 11th century and image should tell, --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 22:56, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

'''ALT2''': <s>... that the treasure of the '''[[Hildesheim Cathedral]]''', a [[World Heritage Site]], contains two of four extant 11th century Romanesque [[wheel chandelier]]s ''([[Hezilo chandelier]] pictured)''? </s>--[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 16:03, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:The referencing is much better now. ALT2 states "two of four extant 11th century Romanesque [[wheel chandelier]]s" while the article states "two of four notable Romanesque wheel chandeliers". These do not really have the same meaning. "Two of four" is a bit vague. Do you mean that there are only 4 of these Romanesque chandeliers in churches in Germany, anywhere in Germany or anywhere in the world?

:: Simpler, I hope, a fact that is unusual and can be seen on images:
:: '''ALT3''': ... that after the '''[[Hildesheim Cathedral]]''', a [[World Heritage Site]], was destroyed in World War II, the westwork ''(pictured)'' was restored without the additions made in 1840? --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 08:22, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:::ALT3 is good (I have tweaked it slightly) and we just need an inline citation at the end of the sentence supporting it. [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 09:09, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Found even an online source that I will use for other facts also, - later, --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 09:35, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] This article is new enough and long enough. All the hook facts (I think) are now covered by inline citations. The image is appropriately licensed and I have removed the unwanted ones for clarity. Going with ALT3. I have added Gerda Arendt to the creator credits as she has done a lot of work on the article.
