==History==
''Ajax-nieuws'' was established in 1917 by association football club AFC Ajax to provide a monthly magazine surrounding the Dutch club under then chairman Willem Egeman. The first issue of the magazine appeared in 1917 and had a photograph of the team on the cover. The magazine would go on to appear with 12 issues a year for 70 years before shutting down operations following the 1986/87 season. The magazine was briefly put on hold during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], when it was illegal to print, but the publication resumed soon after.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethesis.net/ajax/ajax.htm |title=De bal bleef rollen.
