==Reception==
Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' called ''Return to Zero'', "A delicately etched and intimately powerful portrait of grief and bitter loss. Return to Zero stars a fearless Minnie Driver and the ever-affable Paul Adelstein as a couple rocked to their emotional core by the loss of their unborn child, discovered to have died in the womb shortly before the delivery date. We follow them through the wrenching procedure and recovery process with a stark realism in which husband and wife are often seen at their worst, as their once-solid relationship frays when Maggie plummets into depression and neither seem able to say or do the right things to be able to heal and move on. Though sometimes hard to watch, Zero is a compelling and beautifully acted character study that will make you care as it dramatizes a domestic tragedy with a minimum of melodrama, so rare for TV and TV-movies."<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Weekend-TV-Review-Good-Wife-Finale-Lifetime-Zero-1081951.aspx Matt Roush]</ref>

Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote, "Minnie Driver and Paul Adelstein give first-rate performances in this lovely, moving film about a couple whose marriage falters when their baby is stillborn… It's a subject worthy of education and one that seldom gets dealt with on television."<ref>Robert Bianco, [http://www.guampdn.com/usatoday/article/8822089 Weekend TV: "Return to Zero"] May 16, 2014.</ref>

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called ''Return to Zero'' "a painful portrait of devastating loss, pivoting on a performance by Minnie Driver that acutely captures those raw feelings."  He also wrote, "Hanish deftly zeroes in on how all the preparation and enthusiasm surrounding a new baby magnifies the enormity of the parents’ pain here — as well as the different ways people cope, or don’t, with such events."<ref>Brian Lowry, [https://variety.com/2014/tv/reviews/tv-review-return-to-zero-1201175755/ TV Review: ‘Return to Zero’], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', May 15, 2014.</ref>

==Crowdsourcing==
During post-production, Hanish turned to [[Kickstarter]] to raise additional funds to cover music, post-production sound and color-correction.  This crowdsourcing effort raised more than the requested amount.<ref>[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1994087663/return-to-zero-starring-minnie-driver-and-paul-ade?ref=discovery]</ref>  Minnie Driver stated on the ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'' show (June 8, 2014) that more than 700 families of stillborn children contributed to the crowdsourcing.  As the film is based on a true story, Hanish dedicated it to his own son, "in loving memory of Norbert Krekorian Hanish b. July 12, 2005", and listed the names of many other stillborn children.{{cn|date= October 2017}}
