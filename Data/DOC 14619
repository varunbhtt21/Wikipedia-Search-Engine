==Biography==
Hwang has probably spent most of his career in the [[Organization and Guidance Department]] (OGD),<ref name=leadership/> gaining reputation as the organization's ''[[éminence grise]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How the world misunderestimated Kim Jong Un |last=Foster-Carter |first=Aidan |work=NK News |date=8 October 2018 |access-date=9 October 2018 |url= https://www.nknews.org/2018/10/how-the-world-misunderestimated-kim-jong-un/ }}</ref> In September 2010, Hwang was appointed an alternate member of the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Party Central Committee]], holding the position of deputy head of the OGD since the early 2000s with a military and security portfolio. In March 2014 he was elected to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] during the [[2014 North Korean parliamentary election|2014 SPA election]]; during the same month, he was identified as the first vice-director of the party organization department.<ref name=leadership>{{Cite web |title=Hwang Pyong So (Hwang Pyo’ng-so’) |work=North Korea Leadership Watch |date=2 July 2014 |access-date=9 October 2018 |url= https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/leadership-biographies/hwang-pyong-so-hwang-pyong-so/ }}</ref>

On April 28, 2014 Korean Central News Agency reported that the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea]] and [[National Defense Commission]] promoted Hwang to the rank of vice marshal in the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA) on April 26. He was first seen wearing the four stars of a full general on April 15, meaning he moved up two ranks – from colonel general in a short time. In an April 27 KCNA report on an artillery drill, Hwang was referred to for the first time as a member of the party Central Military Commission.<ref>[http://www.nknews.org/2014/04/hwang-pyong-so-promoted-to-vice-marshal-elevated-in-party/ Hwang Pyong So promoted to Vice-Marshal, elevated in Party, NK News, April 28, 2014]</ref> Later on May 1 he was revealed to be the new chief of the [[KPA General Political Bureau|General Political Bureau]] of the KPA, considered the most senior position in the military after the supreme commander. On September 25 he also replaced former No. 2 [[Choe Ryong-hae]] in his last military capacity as first vice-chairman of the [[National Defence Commission]], retaining the position as the NDC was transformed into the [[State Affairs Commission]] on 29 June 2016. On 18 February 2015 he was elevated to the top Presidium during a Politburo meeting. Hwang Pyong-so is seen as a key aide to [[Kim Jong-un]].

Hwang is widely reported to have been a university classmate of Kim's aunt [[Kim Kyong-hui]] and reportedly maintained close ties with Kim Jong-un’s mother [[Ko Yong-hui]].<ref>[http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=11813&cataId=nk00100 Hwang Pyong So Elevated to Vice Marshal, Daily NK, April 28, 2014]</ref>

Hwang's appearance at the closing ceremony of the [[2014 Asian Games]] in the absence of Kim Jong-un, and his subsequent trip to South Korea, led to speculation in the Western press about his role within the North Korean government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/kim-jong-un-north-korea-coup|title=Kim Jong-un: has the North Korean dynasty fallen?|author=Christopher Green|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/05/has-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-been-toppled.html|title=Has North Korea’s Kim Jong Un Been Toppled?|author=Gerdon G. Chang|date=5 October 2014|publisher=The Daily Beast}}</ref>

In November 2017, according to South Korean intelligence, Hwang was facing unspecified punishment.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics-analysis/once-inside-kim-jong-uns-inner-circle-top-aides-star-fades-idUSKBN1DL15H</ref> On 9 February 2018, [[North Korean media]] confirmed that Hwang Pyong-so had been replaced by [[Kim Jong-gak]] as the Director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA.<ref name="chan_Nort">{{Cite web | title = North Korea confirms dismissal of top military general | work = Channel NewsAsia | date = 9 February 2018 | accessdate = 2018-02-09 | url = https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/north-korea-confirms-dismissal-of-top-military-general-9944512 }}</ref> Hwang was soon rehabilitated, reappearing in public in February 2018.<ref>http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/02/15/0200000000AEN20180215007100320.html</ref>

In December 2018, the South Korean Ministry of Unification reported that Hwang held the post of First Vice-chairman of the [[Organization and Guidance Department]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/12/north-korean-leadership-shakeups-revealed-in-latest-mou-reference-book-release|title=North Korean leadership shakeups revealed in latest MOU reference book release|first=Colin|last=Zwirko|publisher=NK News|date=28 December 2018}}</ref>
