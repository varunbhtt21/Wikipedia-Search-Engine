[[File:Statue-Sichuan-Army.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to the [[Sichuan Army]] Martyrs of the [[War of Resistance Against Japan]]]]
The park is located in the former Shaocheng ("small city"), which was built by the [[Qing dynasty]] as the garrison for the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] and [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] soldiers from the [[Eight Banners]].<ref name=about/> In 1911, Yu Kun (玉昆), the last Qing general in Chengdu, converted part of Shaocheng into the city's first public park, known as Shaocheng Park.<ref name=about/><ref name="Dai2009">{{cite book|last=Dai|first=Yingcong|title=The Sichuan Frontier and Tibet: Imperial Strategy in the Early Qing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&pg=PA301|year=2009|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98952-5|page=301}}</ref>

In 1911, the [[Railway Protection Movement]] erupted in Sichuan, which led to the [[Xinhai Revolution]] that overthrew the Qing dynasty and replaced it with the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. From 1913–14, the new republican government built the Monument to the Martyrs of the Railway Protection Movement (辛亥秋保路死事纪念碑) in the park, which is now a [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level|Major Historical and Cultural Site]] of China.<ref name=about/>

The park was enlarged in 1914. In 1924, Governor [[Yang Sen (1884–1977)|Yang Sen]] appointed prominent businessman [[Lu Zuofu]] ([[:zh:卢作孚|卢作孚]]) to be the education minister of Sichuan. Lu made many improvements to the park, building museums, a library, a zoo, and sports facilities.<ref name=about/>

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], a bronze statue of General [[Wang Mingzhang]] of the [[Sichuan Army]] was erected in the park, after Wang was killed in the [[Battle of Xuzhou]]. On 27 September 1940 and 27 July 1941, Shaocheng Park was twice bombed by Japanese warplanes, which destroyed many facilities and caused thousands of casualties, although the Railway Protection Monument survived.<ref name=about/>

After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the new [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] government renamed the park as People's Park in 1950. The park was enlarged, refurbished, and reopened in October 1952, but the Wang Mingzhang statue was demolished.<ref name=about/>
