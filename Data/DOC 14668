Writing in The Jewish Week, film critic George Robinson called it a "Holocaust documentary with a subtle but very real difference, its structure combining the present with memory in a way that most such films cannot."<ref>{{cite web|author=George Robinson |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/arts/film/holocaust_documentary_difference |title=A Holocaust Documentary With A Difference |publisher=The Jewish Week |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>

==Production==
Many of the details of this rescue story were contained in a diary kept by one of the survivors, the late Moshe Maltz, whose granddaughter produced the film. The diary was translated into English and self-published in 1993.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maltz|first=Moshe|title=Years of Horror: Glimpse of Hope|date=1993|publisher=Shengold|location=New York|isbn=0-88400-168-7|page=175}}</ref>  Shot largely on location in Sokal, the film also incorporates testimonies from other survivors, the descendants of the rescuer and local townspeople. Following the release of the film, the Anti-Defamation League post-humously honored Halamajowa with its "Courage to Care" award.<ref>{{cite web|title=ADL Honors Woman Who Sheltered Jews During the Holocaust|url=http://archive.adl.org/presrele/holna_52/5978_52.html|publisher=Archive.adl.org|accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In March 2013, a Canadian money manager, J.L. Witterick, (also known as Jenny Witterick and Jennifer Witterick) published a book, "My Mother's Secret,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mymotherssecret.com/ |title=Inspirational Novel &#124; True Holocaust Story &#124; Novel by J. L. Witterick |publisher=Mymotherssecret.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref> which she said was inspired by the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jenny Witterick, a self-published money maven, makes a bet on Holocaust fiction|newspaper=Globe and Mail}}</ref> The book was originally self-published by iUniverse, but after entering the ''Globe and Mail'' bestseller list, it was picked up by the international Penguin group.<ref name="cas-satj1">{{cite web|author= |url=http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/IndexingQueries/infp_RE_info_e.php?court_no=T-500-14 |title=Recorded entry(ies) for T-500-14 |publisher=Cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref>  In February 2014, the filmmakers filed a suit in the [[Canadian Federal Court]] against her and her publisher, Penguin Canada, for copyright and moral rights infringement.<ref name="cas-satj1"/> The suit lists 30 instances of copying or near copying from the film in the book. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/holocaust-novel-focus-of-copyright-suit/article17494819/%7Cnewspaper=Globe/|title=Holocaust novel focus of copyright suit|first=KATE|last=TAYLOR|date=14 March 2014|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

On May 10, 2016, Judge Keith Boswell of the Canadian Federal Court ruled in favor of the respondents and said that the copyright of the filmmakers had not been infringed because the story told in the film was "common historical fact." He ordered the applicants to pay the respondents' costs.<ref name="canlii.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2016/2016fc524/2016fc524.html|title=Maltz v. Witterick, 2016 FC 524 (CanLII)|website=Canlii.org|accessdate=2017-08-03}}</ref>
The judge dismissed an argument by [[Jack Granatstein]], a Canadian historian who served as an expert witness for the applicants. Granatstein had argued that a distinction needs to be drawn between big and little facts when it comes to copyright protection. Little facts, like those included in the film, he said, deserved copyright protection.<ref name="canlii.org"/> By contrast, the judge relied in his ruling on an affidavit submitted by Sara Horowitz, a professor of comparative literature at York University hired by J.L. Witterick and Penguin. In her affidavit, Horowitz suggested that there was nothing unique about the story told in "No. 4 Street of Our Lady."<ref name="canlii.org"/> 

Reporting on the ruling, Kate Taylor of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote: "Whatever you think of Witterick’s fast-track approach to publishing – you could call it derivative, or impolite – it does not infringe Maltz’s copyright, according to a court decision this week." <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/kate-taylor-should-the-law-protect-original-research/article30017704/|title=Kate Taylor: Should the law protect original research?|last=Taylor|first=Kate|date=May 13, 2016|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref>
