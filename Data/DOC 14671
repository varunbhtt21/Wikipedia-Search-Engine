'''Fiji–Tuvalu relations''' are diplomatic and other relations between [[Fiji]] and [[Tuvalu]].

The countries are neighbours in the vast expanse of the [[Pacific Ocean]]; Tuvalu lies directly north of Fiji, and they share a [[maritime border]]. Tuvalu is by far the smaller, lesser developed and more remote of the two countries, and is therefore dependent on its close relationship with Fiji. The two countries established formal [[diplomatic relations]] in 1979, the year after Tuvalu's independence from the United Kingdom. As of 2014, their relations are described by the Fijian government as "warm and friendly".<ref name="IB 2013">[http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/fiji/2379/fijian-pm-commends-new-tuvalu-pm/ "Fijian PM commends new Tuvalu PM"], Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, 14 August 2013</ref>

==History==
The countries were first linked together as [[British colonies]] in the late 19th century, when they both came within the jurisdiction of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]], the administrative centre of which was in Fiji.<ref name="Italeli">[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Center/Speeches/HE-Sir-Iakoba-Taeia-Italeli---Tuvalu-Governor-Gene.aspx "HE Sir Iakoba Taeia Italeli - Tuvalu Governor General Dinner Speech"], Fiji Government, 24 February 2014</ref> After the Second World War, Tuvalu's first doctors were trained at the [[Fiji School of Medicine]], while some of the Tuvaluans from the overcrowded atoll of [[Vaitupu]] moved permanently to the island of [[Kioa]], in Fiji, where they and their descendants still live.<ref name="Italeli" /> Fiji remains Tuvalu's gateway to the outside world. The only flights to and from [[Funafuti International Airport]] are via [[Suva]], on [[Air Fiji]].<ref>[http://www.timelesstuvalu.com/travel-to-the-tuvalu-islands "Travel to the Tuvalu Islands"], Timeless Tuvalu, Government of Tuvalu</ref> In addition, Fiji "is by far Tuvalu’s largest source of imports".<ref name="IB 2013" />

When the Commander of [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Fiji's military]], Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama|Voreqe Bainimarama]], took power in Fiji in a [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|coup in 2006]], Tuvalu did not join countries such as Australia, New Zealand or Samoa in condemning the new regime. Tuvalu remained supportive of Bainimarama's statements that he would restore democracy on his own schedule.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5561034/Support-for-Fiji-strongman-to-humiliate-NZ ”Calls for Fiji to be restored to Pacific Forum”], [[Stuff.co.nz]], 4 September 2011</ref> Akuila Yabaki, of the Citizens' Constitutional Forum in Fiji, noted that Tuvalu had little choice in the matter, as it was heavily dependent on maintaining good relations with Fiji.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2963038.htm "PNG leader lends support to Bainimarama”], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 23 July 2010</ref>

In 2013, [[Gordon Ward|Sir Gordon Ward]], a British national serving as Chief Justice of Tuvalu, was a denied a [[travel visa|visa]] by the Fijian government to transit via Fiji on his flight to Tuvalu. Ward had previously sat as a judge in Fiji's [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Court of Appeal]], before resigning in protest against the 2006 coup. As there are no flights into Tuvalu other than through Fiji, Tuvalu's Chief Justice was unable to enter Tuvalu. Fiji remained unresponsive to Tuvalu's attempts to resolve the matter, although the incident was said not to have severely affected bilateral relations.<ref name="IB 2013" /><ref>[http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/tuvalu/4346/visa-issue-between-chief-justice-ward-and-fiji-gov/ "Visa issue between Chief Justice Ward and Fiji Government says Tuvalu PM"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201200435/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/tuvalu/4346/visa-issue-between-chief-justice-ward-and-fiji-gov/ |date=2014-02-01 }}, ''[[Islands Business]]'', 22 January 2014</ref>

==Agreements==
In October 2014, the Prime Ministers of Fiji and Tuvalu signed the Fiji-Tuvalu Maritime Boundary Treaty, which establishes the extent of the national areas of jurisdiction between Fiji and Tuvalu as recognized in international law under the 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|first= |last= |work=Xinhua News Agency |title=Fiji, Tuvalu settle maritime boundary issue through negotiations |date=17 October 2014 |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/141017/fiji-tuvalu-settle-maritime-boundary-issue-through-negotiati |accessdate=18 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023055018/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/141017/fiji-tuvalu-settle-maritime-boundary-issue-through-negotiati |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df= }}</ref>

In December 2014,  a technical agreement was signed between Fiji, Tuvalu and [[France]] at the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]]’s headquarters in London over [[maritime boundaries]]. This agreement uses [[satellite data]] to pinpoint where the waters of Fiji, Tuvalu and the French territories of [[Wallis and Futuna]] meet. The agreement will help the countries to defend their waters from illegal fishing operations and provide clarity over rights to marine natural resources.<ref>http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/agreement-reached-between-fiji-tuvalu-and-france-maritime-boundaries</ref>

==Educational cooperation==
Fiji continues to provide most of Tuvaluans' higher education and vocational training, through the [[University of the South Pacific]] (USP) and the [[Fiji National University]].<ref name="Italeli" /> Tuvalu does not have its own universities. Students attending the USP at its campus in [[Funafuti]], Tuvalu, rather than its main campus in Fiji, "can listen to lectures broadcast from Fiji, use audio and video-conferencing facilities and employ the USPNet system for communication with lecturers and other students".<ref>[http://www.icde.org/projects/regulatory_frameworks_for_distance_education/country_profiles/tuvalu/education_system/ "Tuvalu: Education System"], [[International Council for Open and Distance Education|ICDE]]</ref>

==Diplomatic missions==
Tuvalu has only four embassies abroad: its permanent mission to the [[United Nations]] in New York, its embassy to the [[European Union]] in Brussels, its newly opened embassy to the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] in Taipei since 2013, and its [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)#Current practice|high commission]] to Fiji in Suva.<ref>[http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/tuvalu/pid/3718 Embassies of Tuvalu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525153650/http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/tuvalu/pid/3718 |date=2014-05-25 }}, Permanent mission of Tuvalu to the United Nations</ref> Fiji in turn does not maintain any diplomatic presence in Tuvalu,<ref>[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Government-Directory/Fiji-Overseas-Missions.aspx "Fiji overseas missions"], Fiji government</ref> but does have a "roving ambassador" accredited to ten independent Pacific Island states, including Tuvalu.<ref>[http://www.foreignaffairs.gov.fj/about-us/roving-ambassador "Roving Ambassador"], Fiji Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation</ref>
