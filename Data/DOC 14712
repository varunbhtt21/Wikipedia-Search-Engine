:* ''Comment'': Expanded x5
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]). Self nominated at 09:26, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Date and length/expansion check out. Ext links OK. Hook checks out with citation #5. Image has free licence. An interesting article - that's why I like doing reviews - you get to read some fascinating things. (No need for QPQ, because this editor has achieved fewer than 5 DYKs so far.) 
:*Items to be dealt with: (1) Stub template at end of article needs to be removed because it's no longer a stub. (2) Four disambig links to be corrected: Democratic Alliance, Zulu, Devil's Peak, Xhosa. (3) Please remove the refimprove template at the top of the article, because there are sufficient citations now.
:* When the above three items have been sorted out, I'll be happy for this nom to be taken forward. --[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 14:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
