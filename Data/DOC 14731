The '''Kowloon Park Swimming Pool''' ({{zh|九龍公園游泳池}}), located in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], [[Kowloon]], is the most heavily used swimming pool complex in Hong Kong, serving over 2,000 swimmers daily. It includes four indoor heated pools, including an Olympic sized 50-metre main pool, two 25-metre training pools, and a 20-metre diving pool. There are also several outdoor leisure pools.

As one of the best-equipped swimming pools in Hong Kong, it is the only venue in Kowloon suitable for staging major or international swimming events.

==History==
The Kowloon Park Swimming Pool was built as part of a greater redevelopment and expansion of Kowloon Park that was completed in 1989 under the sponsorship of the [[Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club]].<ref name="forks">{{cite news|last1=Lau|first1=Muriel|title=Club forks out $300m for project|work=South China Morning Post|date=1 February 1989|page=66}}</ref> The swimming complex-cum-indoor games hall was designed by a joint venture between United Kingdom-based [[Derek Walker|Derek Walker Associates]] and Hong Kong firm Simon Kwan and Associates.<ref name="credit">{{cite news|last1=Rees|first1=Richard|title=Kowloon Park complex proves a credit to architecture|work=South China Morning Post|date=8 February 1989|page=12}}</ref><ref name="kwan">{{cite news|title=Kwan turns plans into reality|work=South China Morning Post|date=1 February 1989|page=66}}</ref> It was engineered by [[BuroHappold Engineering|BuroHappold]], and the main contractor was Shui On.<ref name="credit"/> It opened on 12 September 1989 and was originally managed by the [[Urban Council]].

The HK$6 million bilingual scoreboard, the "most sophisticated of its kind in Hongkong", was custom-built for Kowloon Park Swimming Pool by [[Omega SA]]. An integrated timing system allowed the scoreboard to display individual times for each of the competition pool's eight lanes. A special computer terminal could be used to input Chinese characters, which could be displayed along with Latin characters using the scoreboard's 20,000 lamps. The scoreboard drew interest from the sporting community, and a delegation from China visited the swimming pool to view and assess its capabilities.<ref name="bilingual">{{cite news|title=Pool to have bi-lingual scoreboard|work=South China Morning Post|date=1 February 1989|page=70}}</ref>

Other innovative features employed for the first time in Hong Kong were the depth-adjustable main pool, which allows the water depth to be changed according to the function, as well as the use of ozone disinfection for water treatment in order to reduce reliance on chlorination.<ref name="olympic">{{cite news|title=Swimming complex up to Olympic standard|work=South China Morning Post|date=1 February 1989|page=70}}</ref>

In 2000 the Urban Council was disbanded by the government, and management of the swimming pool became the responsibility of the newly formed [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] (LCSD).

From 2007–2009, major improvement works were carried out. The indoor free form leisure pool was converted into one of the 25-metre training pools, and a trampoline room extension was constructed.<ref>{{cite web|title=14 EAG Projects|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/b5/forms/project.pdf|publisher=Leisure and Cultural Services Department|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref> The pool hosted the [[2009 East Asian Games]], and ahead of this event facilities were added for swimming officials, marshals, doping control, first aid, equipment and the media.<ref name=govnews/>

==Capacity and patronage==
The complex can accommodate a maximum of 1530 swimmers at one time, and has an annual attendance of more than 1 million visitors. It is the most heavily visited swimming pool in Hong Kong, with daily attendance of more than 2,000.<ref name=govnews>{{cite news|title=Park pool ready for 3rd HK Games|url=http://archive.news.gov.hk/en/categories/health/html/2011/04/20110418_174508.shtml|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=news.gov.hk|date=23 April 2011}}</ref>

==Recent developments==
In April 2017, a large fence was built down the middle of the main outdoor leisure pool, separating it in two. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) stated that the fence helped improve safety by improving lifeguard sight-lines, which are partly obstructed by the columns supporting the public footbridge above the pool. Swimmers protested the construction as unnecessary, and said that it diminished the character of the pool as well as its recreational value, as some visitors enjoyed the shade beneath the bridge. Legislative councillor [[Leung Yiu-chung]] echoed these sentiments, stating that the fence was excessive and urged the LCSD to find a balance between safety and public amenity.<ref name="applefence">{{cite news|last1=Choy|first1=Wan-ting|title=九龍公園突增金屬圍欄劏開泳池兩半 泳客嬲爆促康文署收回成命|trans-title=Kowloon Park Swimming Pool suddenly cut in two by metal fences, angry swimmers urge the LCSD to reconsider|language=Chinese|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/breaking/20170408/56535310|work=[[Apple Daily]]|date=8 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="mingpao">{{cite news|title=九龍公園泳池突增圍欄|trans-title=Kowloon Park Swimming Pool suddenly gets fences|language=Chinese|url=https://news.mingpao.com/ins/instantnews/web_tc/article/20170408/s00001/1491640894312|work=[[Ming Pao]]|date=8 April 2017}}</ref>
