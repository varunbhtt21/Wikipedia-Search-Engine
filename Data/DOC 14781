In June 2000, Pavlenko hit the headlines when at short notice she danced the leading role in [[George Balanchine]]'s ''[[Jewels (ballet)]]'' at London's [[Covent Garden Theatre|Covent Garden]]. Her performance was all the more remarkable as she had less than a day to rehearse the part. Later that year, she also played the lead in ''Diamonds'' and ''Emeralds'', becoming one of the few ballerinas to master all three roles.<ref name=ibm>{{cite web|url=http://www.balletmasterclass.com/staff/daria_p.htm|title=Artistes: Daria Pavlenko|author=Marc Haegeman|publisher=International Ballet Masterclasses in Prague|date=2008|accessdate=29 April 2014 |language=}}</ref>
