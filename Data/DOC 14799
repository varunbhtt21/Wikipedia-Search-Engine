[[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]]. This was discussed and kept at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of killed Euromaidan members]], when there were 6 people on the list[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_killed_during_Euromaidan&oldid=593484228]. Now, there are sadly more than 100 deaths, and the list is one giant memorial for them. Understandable, but not the purpose of Wikipedia. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 10:00, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]] is meant to avoid the proliferation of pseudo-articles on some beloved dead but unnotable relative and stuff like that. Here we are instead dealing with a thoroughly sourced list on a notable subject (while perhaps none of the dead is notable in their own right, the whole topic is). --[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 13:50, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
**Do we have (and want) list of people dead during battle X, aircrash Y, terrorist attack Z? For many of these, the list of victims can easily be sourced, but still the consensus seems to have been ''not'' to have such separate lists, e.g.
***[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of victims of the Virginia Tech massacre (4th nomination)]]
***[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of victims of the 1913 Great Lakes storm]]
***[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of victims of the Rock Springs massacre]]
**Other articles, like [[List of victims of the Our Lady of the Angels school fire]], have not been challenged so far, but should be treated the same IMO. (Let's not get started on utterly useless and unsourced lists like [[List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States, 2013]]). 
**And of course, we don't even list the individual [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks]], which are also easily sourceable. The topic of who exactly was killed is not a notable subject, the protests and the fact of the killings are of course very notable subjects but the list does nothing to increase our understanding of the events. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 14:03, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
****Uh, I see what you are trying to claim as evidence of previous consensus, but still I am not really convinced. Looks more like a [[WP:OTHERSTUFFDOESNTEXIST]], but actually you yourself show that such stuff ''does'' exist, even if you feel it should be challenged. The AfD linked also weren't exactly much participated and/or unanimously commented on the delete/merge side. So there is hardly evidence of binding consensus either way. Most of these discussions also ended up in a merge, at least in theory, which would require to preserve the information; given the size and detail of this list a merge would not be a reasonable option, so to [[WP:PRESERVE]] the information, we should keep it separate. That said, I disagree with assessments as "the list does nothing to increase our understanding". First of all, we should not delete articles on the basis that we find them [[WP:USELESS]]; information which does not increase my understanding can increase someone else's. For example the list reports the dates, nationalities and causes of death, which can be useful instead to dissect what was going on and/or to compare with similar events. Second, even if we don't feel it is useful, it is still notable and well sourced information, and as such there is no real reason to delete it -the NOTMEMORIAL argument in this case looks more like a [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT]] argument, since this is not a mere memorial bio of a loved one.--[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 17:09, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''delete''' I think that this is a great example of WP:Notmemorial. Also, the number of deaths will continue to grow, and we cannot list thousands of names in an article. I also feel that this is no different than the articles about list of deceased from Virginia Tech massacre and etc. This should be treated no differently. [[User:Staglit|Staglit]] ([[User talk:Staglit|talk]]) 23:29, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  Seems like a pretty clear memorial.  Although this article may not have been created by a grieving relative, it still serves no purpose but to memorialize the victims of a tragedy.  If everyone on the list had an article, that would be different, but these are generally non-notable people.  There are more appropriate places for this content; an encyclopedia is not a good fit. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 04:01, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]] does not apply here. Well sourced article. Covering deaths after a highly notable subject.--[[User:BabbaQ|BabbaQ]] ([[User talk:BabbaQ|talk]]) 11:47, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Note to closing user''' - I see that this article has been nominated quite recently in late January with a Keep result. You find it at the talk page. I think this nomination is too soon. --[[User:BabbaQ|BabbaQ]] ([[User talk:BabbaQ|talk]]) 11:49, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**The article then was about 6 people killed at the protests. By now, it is a list of over 100 people killed there. With such a different scope, a new discussion is not unwarranted. I did note the original discussion and the "keep" at the start of my nomination. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 14:33, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
***Yes, but in this case a different scope means more inclusive and correct than the original keep discussion.--[[User:BabbaQ|BabbaQ]] ([[User talk:BabbaQ|talk]]) 15:02, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
****It is not a different scope. It is the same scope, only the amount of people covered under this scope is now bigger. Why should this change anything? We're not made of paper; 6 people or 6000 makes no difference, in principle.--[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 15:10, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. The ''Titanic'' casualty list is notable because it has received an enormous amount of attention. This event doesn't reach that level of notice. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 04:06, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*:How would you measure the amount of attention? I do think that both [[Passengers of the RMS Titanic]] and people killed during Euromaidan received outstanding amounts of attention, much higher than average accident, with all members of the list receiving particular coverage on their own — [[User:Nick UA|NickK]] ([[User talk:Nick UA|talk]]) 21:02, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::*I just don't think Euromaidan has gotten the intense, '''sustained''' scrutiny of ''Titanic''. Others at this level are the dead at the Alamo and the 300 at Thermopylae (though of course there were other Greeks who fought and died there). [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 10:15, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::*:Speaking in terms of number of sources, I do believe it did. There were many initiatives of coverage of Euromaidan events and biographies of people killed there, including English-language ones. There are streets and squares named in their honour (see [[:uk:Площа Героїв Майдану]]) and monuments erected in their memory (the first one is [[:uk:Пам'ятник Небесній сотні (Буда)]]). There was an initiative to award the title of the Hero of Ukraine to all mentioned here. Unlike victims of various accidents, there are places named in their honour, thus the nature of coverage is closer to the one of the 300 of Thermopylae. If you think anything important is lacking, please provide what exactly is needed — [[User:Nick UA|NickK]] ([[User talk:Nick UA|talk]]) 21:00, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strongly keep''' This article is of a great memorial and educational value for any citizen of the world. [[User:Al Baymar|Obaymar]] 21:47, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strongly keep''' This is not merely a memorial but it is well linked with the history of killings and other important and deciding events of Euromaidan. The article is also well sourced. Presently, there are monument and numerous streets and squares in Ukraine named after some of these people or after Heaven's Hundred, and so an increasing interest to this article.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Valizka|Valizka]] ([[User talk:Valizka|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Valizka|contribs]]) 11:41, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
*'''Keep''', all people in the list received a high level of coverage, including English-language sources (for example, the website http://nebesnasotnya.com.ua/en/ contains bios of all on this list), all of them have received more than trivial media coverage in Ukrainian and most of them in English (like [http://www.vice.com/read/obituaries-for-the-euromaidan-sniper-victims-from-the-people-who-loved-them this], [http://ukrainianweek.com/News/99729 this], [http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/another_victim_of_confrontations_in_hrushevskoho_street_45_year_old_roman_senyk_dies_at_kyiv_hospital_316527 this] or [http://en.svoboda.org.ua/news/events/00010404/ this]), and there was even media coverage in such languages as Chinese (like [http://www.taiwan.cn/taiwan/roll/201403/t20140302_5754876.htm this website]), [http://www.koolnews.gr/diethni/autoi-erixan-ton-gianoukovits-10-iroes-pou-potisan-me-to-aima-tous-tin-anatropi-tou-sklires-eikones/ Greek] or [http://tn.nova.cz/bin/mobile/index.php?article_id=439645 Czech]. As all members of this list have more than trivial media coverage like biographic articles for each of them, coverage in national and international media, there is no doubt all of this people are notable, although most are notable for only one event. According to [[WP:NLIST]] and [[WP:BIO1E]] list of such people is appropriate — [[User:Nick UA|NickK]] ([[User talk:Nick UA|talk]]) 20:55, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Notable event, many sources. Five interwikies. [[User:Nickst|NickSt]] ([[User talk:Nickst|talk]]) 17:25, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' To quote [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]]: "Subjects of encyclopedia articles must satisfy Wikipedia's notability requirements. Wikipedia is not the place to memorialize deceased friends, relatives, acquaintances, or others '''who do not meet such requirements'''." If this article meets notability requirements, then the notmemorial policy is not grounds for deletion. As the people killed during Euromaidan were the subject of intense media coverage and caused an intense political reaction, I would say notability requirements have been met. [[User:Spirit of Eagle|Spirit of Eagle]] ([[User talk:Spirit of Eagle|talk]]) 21:53, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]] and the fact that each individual death is low encyclopedic relevance. Including this memorial-article would be a bad precedent for other Wikipedia articles.  [[User:Sietecolores|Sietecolores]] ([[User talk:Sietecolores|talk]]) 21:15, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' some of the keep comments make the argument to delete this more eloquently than I ever could, e.g. "all people in the list received a high level of coverage, including English-language sources (for example, the website http://nebesnasotnya.com.ua/en/ contains bios of all on this list)"; that site is a pure memorial site, including the sorrow ribbon in the corner; furthermore, it is an Ukranian site which has translated its content in English, hardly evidence of notability outside Ukraine (which may in itself be sufficient, but the "there is English language coverage" gives a different impression than what it truly is), and finally and most importantly, this site is not a reliable source at all, so using it to strengthen a "keep" argument is rather baseless. It is good that such sources exist; bu that doesn't mean that they are a valid argument to have a Wikipedia article on the same subject. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 08:11, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*:I have cited coverage in [http://www.taiwan.cn/taiwan/roll/201403/t20140302_5754876.htm Chinese], [http://www.koolnews.gr/diethni/autoi-erixan-ton-gianoukovits-10-iroes-pou-potisan-me-to-aima-tous-tin-anatropi-tou-sklires-eikones/ Greek] and [http://tn.nova.cz/bin/mobile/index.php?article_id=439645 Czech], with all these media located definitely outside Ukraine.

::'''Comment''': I disagree with Marshall's reasoning. Much of the political and media coverage I mentioned above was specifically about those killed during Euromaidan, not Euromaidan in general. Many sources have been given proving this, and the article itself lists some specific political reactions. I believe that the article could be cleaned up so its less of a list and more of an article about those killed, but this does not require deletion to do. To the contrary, deletion will only make this much more difficult as all of the information will have to be gathered from scratch. Also, Fram was making a WP:NOTMEMORIAL argument to justify deletion. Many of the arguments were about why the not-memorial policy is not a valid argument for deletion, so I feel that Fram's point has been addressed.[[User:Spirit of Eagle|Spirit of Eagle]] ([[User talk:Spirit of Eagle|talk]]) 16:17, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
