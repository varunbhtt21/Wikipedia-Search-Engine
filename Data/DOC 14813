'''''Raorchestes ghatei''''' (common name: '''Ghate's shrub frog''') is a species of [[shrub frog]]s from the [[Western Ghats]] of [[Maharashtra]].<ref name=frost>{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Anura/Rhacophoridae/Rhacophorinae/Raorchestes/Raorchestes-ghatei |title=''Raorchestes ghatei'' Padhye, Sayyed, Jadhav, and Dahanukar, 2013 |author=Frost, Darrel R. |year=2014 |work=Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference.

The species differs from its congeners based on a combination of characters including small to medium-sized adult males, snout [[mucronate]] in dorsal view, [[canthus rostralis]] angular and sharp, snout slightly projecting beyond mouth ventrally, [[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympanum]] indistinct and one third of the eye diameter, tongue without papilla but with a [[lingual pit]], [[nuptial pad]] rudimentary to absent, a bony [[tubercle]] on humerus at the end of deltoid ridge present in males and absent in females, skin finely granulated or smooth dorsally, lateral side marbled with white blotches on brown to black background. Molecular phylogeny based on 16S [[rRNA]] gene sequence suggests that the new species is genetically distinct and forms a monophyletic clade within ''Raorchestes''. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism with males having single sub-gular vocal sac and a tubercle on the humerus while females lack them. The species shows direct development. The species is widely distributed in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Padhye | first1 = Anand D. | last2 = Sayyed | first2 = Amit | last3 = Jadhav | first3 = Anushree | last4 = Dahanukar | first4 = Neelesh | year = 2013 | title = ''Raorchestes ghatei'', a new species of shrub frog (Anura: Rhacophoridae) from the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, India | journal = Journal of Threatened Taxa | volume = 5 | issue = 15 | pages = 4913â€“4931 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.11609/JoTT.o3702.4913-31 | url = http://threatenedtaxa.org/ZooPrintJournal/2013/November/o370226xi134913-4931.pdf | format =  | accessdate = }}</ref>
