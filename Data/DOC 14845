* ... <s>that the [[hagiography]] of '''[[Patriarch Euthymius I of Constantinople]]''' ''(consecration pictured)'' is one of the main historical sources on the reign of the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo VI the Wise]]?</s>
:* '''ALT1''':... that '''[[Patriarch Euthymius I of Constantinople|Euthymius I]]''' became [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]  ''(consecration pictured)'' because his predecessor, [[Nicholas Mystikos]], refused to sanction Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]]'s un-[[canon law|canonical]] fourth marriage?

:* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] Long enough, well sourced. Approved for ALT1, as I think that hook will be of interest to more readers.--[[User:3family6|<font color="navy">&iquest;3fam</font>]]'''''[[User talk:3family6|<font color="black">ily6</font>]]''''' <sub>[[Special:Contributions/3family6|<font color="purple">contribs</font>]]</sub> 15:21, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] This review needs more details, in accordance with [[T:TDYK#How to review a nomination|DYK review instructions]].

:::I'm not sure what I missed. I don't see any copyright violations. I tried to check for QPQ but the site is down.--[[User:3family6|<font color="navy">&iquest;3fam</font>]]'''''[[User talk:3family6|<font color="black">ily6</font>]]''''' <sub>[[Special:Contributions/3family6|<font color="purple">contribs</font>]]</sub> 22:06, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*Besides "long enough" and "well sourced", you should also mention that you checked if it was new enough (created within 5 days); whether the hook ref is verified and cited inline; and whether or not you found [[WP:Close paraphrasing|close paraphrasing]] or copyvios. Other housekeeping checks include at least 1 inline citation per paragraph, and [[WP:NPOV|neutral]] tone. Best, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 22:59, 14 May 2014 (UTC) 
[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] Sorry about that, I checked these things but didn't know I had list it all explicitly in the review. There are no copyvios or close paraphrasing that I can see, I'm assuming good faith as the sources are offline. Article was created in time, it presents a neutral view, the hook is cited, and every paragraph has at least one citation.--[[User:3family6|<font color="navy">&iquest;3fam</font>]]'''''[[User talk:3family6|<font color="black">ily6</font>]]''''' <sub>[[Special:Contributions/3family6|<font color="purple">contribs</font>]]</sub> 00:22, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Thanks for updating your review. But 2 of the 3 sources '''are''' online; I changed one link to Google Preview mode. You can now compare the writing with the sources to see if there's close paraphrasing. Best, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 10:20, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] No problems found, at least in what's available in Google Preview.--[[User:3family6|<font color="navy">&iquest;3fam</font>]]'''''[[User talk:3family6|<font color="black">ily6</font>]]''''' <sub>[[Special:Contributions/3family6|<font color="purple">contribs</font>]]</sub> 13:34, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
