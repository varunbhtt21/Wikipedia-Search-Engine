'''Kristaps Porziņģis''' ({{IPA-lv|ˈkris.taps ˈpuɔr.ziɲ.ɟis}}; born 2 August 1995) is a Latvian professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Dallas Mavericks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He is the [[List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history|one of the tallest active players]] in the NBA, standing at {{height|ft=7|in=3}} tall, and plays both the [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and [[Center (basketball)|center]] positions.

Born in [[Liepāja]], Porziņģis began his professional career with [[EuroLeague]] team [[CB Sevilla|Sevilla]] in 2011. Porziņģis quickly rose through the team's youth ranks and became the figurehead of the senior team by 2013. He subsequently won the [[EuroCup Basketball Rising Star]] award in 2015, where, at age 18, he became the youngest ever recipient of the award. The following summer, he declared for the [[NBA draft]], where he was selected fourth overall by the [[New York Knicks]]. 

In New York, Porziņģis shone as the team's star, but after disagreements with the front office, was traded to Dallas in 2019.

==Early career==
Porziņģis followed his parents' footsteps and started to play basketball at age 6. Once he turned 12, his older brother, [[Jānis Porziņģis|Jānis]], who played professionally in Europe, would take him to offseason training sessions.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Begley| first1= Ian|title=Big brothers are watching Kristaps Porzingis and it's paying off| url= http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14373136/nba-kristaps-porzingis-owes-success-basketball-life-family| accessdate=15 December 2015 |work=ESPN.com|date=15 December 2015}}</ref> He played in youth competition with [[BK Liepājas Lauvas]], the most famous club based in hometown of [[Liepāja]], until he was 15 years old. An agent from Latvia sent video of him around this time to teams in Spain and Italy.<ref name= eurocup /> In 2010, [[CB Sevilla|Baloncesto Sevilla]], a club that had a professional team competing in the [[Liga ACB]] in Spain, called Porziņģis for a tryout in an attempt to recruit foreign talent to its junior squads. He stood {{cvt|6|ft|8|in}} and weighed {{cvt|157|lb}} at this time.<ref name= eurocup>{{cite web| url= http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/eurocup/features/player-spotlight/i/141583|title=Kristaps Porzingis, Baloncesto Seville |work= Eurocupbasketball.com|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref><ref name= draftexpress>{{cite web|title=Kristaps Porzingis|url=http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Kristaps-Porzingis-7119/|website=Draft Express|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> Porziņģis recalled the moment and said, "I came here with my brother for two or three days, but it was really hot and I couldn't play at my best because of that. Still, I received a contract in summer 2010 and I signed it."<ref name=eurocup /> Inmaculada Avivar, a nutritionist for Sevilla, diagnosed that Porziņģis was suffering from [[anemia]], meaning that he had fewer [[red blood cell]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anemia|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anemia|website=Merriam-Webster: Dictionary and Thesaurus|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref> This caused him to feel fatigue, shortness of breath, and inability to exercise. Nevertheless, he gradually overcame the condition and began seeing improvement in his game.<ref name=eurocup /> In addition to his medical problems, Porziņģis had trouble picking up the [[Spanish language|language]] in [[Seville]], making him reluctant to return there after his first tryout. In his first season playing for the junior squad, he struggled to communicate with the coaching staff and his teammates and was often sleepy due to his health.<ref name=eurocup />

Porziņģis debuted for the youth squad on 4 January 2012, against its counterpart from [[FC Barcelona Bàsquet|Barcelona]], adding 12 points and 10 rebounds. The opposing side was led by Alexander Zhigulin, who would go on to enter the [[2015 NBA draft]] and withdraw.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexandr Zhigulin Player Profile|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/player/Alexandr-Zhigulin/Summary/25104|website=[[RealGM]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> However, Sevilla was defeated, 56–75.<ref>{{cite web|title=FC Barcelona Regal Junior Team 75,  Cajasol Seville Junior Team 56|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/international/boxscore/2012-01-04/FC-Barcelona-Regal-Junior-Team-at-Cajasol-Seville-Junior-Team/87361|website=[[RealGM]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> This game was part of the Ciutat de L'Hospitalet tournament, which led up to the [[Euroleague Basketball Next Generation Tournament|Nike International Junior Tournament]] (NIJT).<ref name=eurocup /> On 5 January, he scored a personal best of 16 points on the [[OKK Spars Sarajevo|Spars Sarajevo]] youth squad, helping Sevilla beat their opponents by a margin of 8 points.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cajasol Seville Junior Team 80,  KK Spars Junior Team 72|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/international/boxscore/2012-01-05/Cajasol-Seville-Junior-Team-at-KK-Spars-Junior-Team/87369|website=[[RealGM]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> Porziņģis said, "I knew it was a prestigious tournament and that I had to do well", he said. "I think I could have done much better, but I wasn't physically 100 percent. I have seen videos and could have been much more aggressive. But I wish I could have played better."<ref name=eurocup /> He finished the tournament averaging 9.2 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.6 blocks.<ref name=eurocup /> Porziņģis represented the Sevilla junior team again at the same tournament in early 2013. Against [[KK Olimpija|Union Olimpija]] on 4 January, he recorded 15 points and 6 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Union Olimpija Junior Team 70,  Cajasol Seville Junior Team 78|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/international/boxscore/2013-01-04/Union-Olimpija-Junior-Team-at-Cajasol-Seville-Junior-Team/120276|website=[[RealGM]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> On 6 January, in the team's tournament finale vs [[Real Madrid Baloncesto B|Real Madrid]]'s youth squad, he scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. He also made a total of five three-pointers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cajasol Seville Junior Team 66,  Real Madrid Junior Team 72|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/international/boxscore/2013-01-06/Cajasol-Seville-Junior-Team-at-Real-Madrid-Junior-Team/120286|website=[[RealGM]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> Porziņģis proved to be more effective in his second year, averaging 16.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.6 blocks and going .481 on three-pointers.<ref name=eurocup /> This would be his final stint in the youth categories of Sevilla.

==Professional career==
===Sevilla===
====2012–13: Rookie season====
Entering the [[2012–13 ACB season]], Sevilla had hired [[Aíto García Reneses]], who previously worked with the likes of [[Pau Gasol]], [[Juan Carlos Navarro (basketball)|Juan Carlos Navarro]], [[Ricky Rubio]] and [[Rudy Fernández (basketball)|Rudy Fernández]].<ref name=eurocup /> On 29 September 2012, Porziņģis got the opportunity to make an appearance with the club's first team, but was allowed to play just a minute. Sevilla took a tremendous loss to [[CB Murcia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Universidad Católica De Murcia CB 93,  Baloncesto Sevilla 77|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/international/boxscore/2012-09-29/Universidad-Catolica-De-Murcia-CB-at-Baloncesto-Sevilla/103535|website=[[RealGM]]|access-date=20 June 2015}}</ref> Following a return to the youth categories of the club at the Torneig de Bàsquet Junior Ciutat de L'Hospitalet, he went back to competing for the senior squad. On 16 January 2013, he logged only four minutes against [[BC Spartak Saint Petersburg|Spartak Saint Petersburg]] in the [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]], scoring no points, but contributing one rebound and one assist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baloncesto Sevilla 59, Spartak Saint Petersburg 78|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/international/boxscore/2013-01-16/Baloncesto-Sevilla-at-Spartak-Saint-Petersburg/119941|website=[[RealGM]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref> He scored his first basket for the senior team on 20 February 2013, in a rematch with Spartak. Porziņģis said, "I was very nervous at the beginning: I wanted to do well and not pick up turnovers. At the same time, I got a lot of confidence with players of my same age. That allowed me to play better with the first team and practice with more confidence."<ref name=eurocup /> On 4 May 2013, he posted a season-high 7 points with the senior team, hitting two of three shots vs [[Bilbao Basket]] in [[Liga ACB|ACB]] competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bilbao Basket 81, Baloncesto Sevilla 60|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/international/boxscore/2013-05-04/Bilbao-Basket-at-Baloncesto-Sevilla/103817|website=[[RealGM]]|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref>

====2013–14: Second season and NBA consideration====
Porziņģis opened his second season on Sevilla's main squad strong in his third game against the [[EuroLeague]] team [[Saski Baskonia|Laboral Kutxa]], leading them to a 20-point ACB victory on 2 November 2013.<ref name=eurocup /> He notched a career-high 12 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 blocks.<ref name=second>{{cite web|title=2013–2014 International Games|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/player/Kristaps-Porzingis/GameLogs/32861/International/2014|website=[[RealGM]]|access-date=22 June 2015}}</ref> He broke his scoring record once more against [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] on 30 November 2013, nearly leading his team to a victory.<ref name=eurocup /><ref name=second /> Against the very same team on 6 April 2014, Porziņģis scored a career-high 20 points, nailing 2 three-pointers.<ref name=second /> Despite his team losing, he began to trend on social media because of his performance. He said, "It was a very good game for me on offense. I didn't get any rebounds in that game. I had a good shooting night, but could have helped more on defense. Still, fans in Madrid gave me a nice ovation when I fouled out and I liked that a lot."<ref name="eurocup" /> On 25 May, he got the chance to face his idol [[Justin Doellman]] of Barcelona, whom he called the "best power forward in Spanish basketball". He scored 14 points against Doellman's team.<ref name=eurocup /><ref name="second" /> In May 2014, Porziņģis was selected in the [[ACB Best Young Player Award|ACB All-Young Players Team]] of the [[2013–14 ACB season|2013–14 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acb.com/redaccion.php?id=103864|title=2013–14 ACB All-Young players Team|date=20 May 2014|publisher=ACB.com|language=Spanish|access-date=2 June 2014}}</ref>

In April, Porziņģis declared himself eligible for the [[2014 NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diena.lv/sports/basketbols/porzingis-tomer-pieteicies-nba-draftam-14053842|title=Porziņģis tomēr pieteicies NBA draftam|date=28 April 2014|publisher=Diena.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref> Before and after he made the decision, he drew interest from [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams such as the [[Orlando Magic]], who held the 12th overall pick, and traveled to Europe to scout him. The [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] reportedly were certainly going to select him with the 21st pick in the case that he remained. Porziņģis was considered an unfinished product and a top-15 draft pick. According to DraftExpress.com, he was the fourth-youngest prospect in their top-100 rankings.<ref name=draftexpress /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Herbert|first1=James|title=NBA Draft 2014: Latvian prospect Kristaps Porzingis to enter draft|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/4/28/5660788/kristaps-porzingis-nba-draft|website=SB Nation|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref> Shortly before the day of the draft, however, he withdrew his name. Porziņģis's [[sports agent|agent]] Andy Miller released the information to [[ESPN]], saying that his client did not feel prepared to become a part of the NBA and wanted to develop his skills until the [[2015 NBA draft|2015 draft]]. One of the league's general managers commented on him, "He's very talented. He wasn't ready, but we would've seriously considered drafting him anyway. If he continues to develop his game, get more minutes and his body develops, I think he could be a top-five pick in 2015. He has that kind of talent."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ford|first1=Chad|title=Kristaps Porzingis pulls out of draft|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/draft2014/story/_/id/11090062/2014-nba-draft-kristaps-porzingis-latvia-pulls-draft|website=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref>

====2014–15: EuroCup Rising Star====

However, he had a strong EuroCup performance against [[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma]] in the weeks that followed, in which he contributed 18 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks. He recorded a double-double in mid-November in a win over [[CB Estudiantes|Estudiantes]], adding 11 points and 11 rebounds.

Porziņģis has been compared to [[Dirk Nowitzki]], with the pair having both been groomed in Europe before entering the NBA.

Due to his height and mobility, Porziņģis is able to shoot over any defender, with his sheer size and high volume creating a unique advantage shared by no other player in the league.<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Micah|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22259303/kristaps-porzingis-uses-height-unlike-other-player-nba|title=Porzingis can shoot over anyone, and that might be a problem|work=ESPN.com|date=30 January 2018|accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Kristaps Porzingis in 2017 summer.png|thumb|175px|Kristaps Porziņģis in 2017, when he was in Latvia]]
Porziņģis was born to parents who had experience playing the game of [[basketball]]. Tālis, his father, competed semi-professionally before becoming a [[bus driver]]. His mother, Ingrīda, was previously on [[Latvia women's national basketball team|Latvia women's youth national basketball team]].<ref name=aol /> Kristaps's older brother, [[Jānis Porziņģis|Jānis]], also played professionally,<ref name=eurocup /> while Mārtiņš, who is approximately fifteen years older than his youngest sibling, was also an avid player.<ref name=aol>{{cite web|last1=Weitzman|first1=Yaron|title=NBA Draft Watch: The Kristaps Porzingis Experience|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2015/06/22/nba-draft-watch-the-kristaps-porzingis-experience/21199493/|website=[[AOL]]|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref> In a 2017 ''[[E:60]]'' documentary on Porziņģis' life, his parents revealed that they had another son, Toms, who was born four years before Kristaps and died at 14 months. Through an interpreter, Ingrīda said about Toms' death, "It felt like a bulldozer had run over my life. We had two other children who we had to care for. We had to live on. After Kristaps was born, it was like he had to live for two lives."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/06/25/the-quiet-porzingis-family-tragedy/ |title=‘Had to live for two lives’: The tragedy that shaped Kristaps Porzingis |first=Marc |last=Berman |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date=25 June 2017 |accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref>

Jānis Porziņģis competed at the [[European professional club basketball system|European 2nd tier]] [[EuroCup Basketball|EuroCup]] level, the same level in Europe that Kristaps later played at, in one game,<ref>[http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/eurocup/competition/players/showplayer?pcode=JTZ&seasoncode=U2004 PORZINGIS, JANIS SUPERFUND KAPFENBERG BORN: 13 JULY, 1982 NATIONALITY: LATVIA.]</ref> and played European professional club basketball in various national leagues, including the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]],<ref>[http://web.legabasket.it/player/?id=POR-JAN-82 Janis Porzingis|#10 Naz. di Nascita: LAT Naz.

He is known to mentor his younger brother on and off the court and often called him after playing games for Cajasol Sevilla in Spain. Kristaps talked about the relationship in an interview, "We'd break down the details. We watched the film together. He's always pushing me to work hard. We just spend a lot of time together and we just talk about basketball all the time..."<ref name=interview>{{cite web|last1=Robbins|first1=Josh|title=A Q-and-A with NBA Draft prospect Kristaps Porzingis|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/orlando-magic/os-kristaps-porzingis-interview-20150622-story.html#page=1|website=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref> The elder Porziņģis helped him train in the summer and work out in the gym in preparation for international competition in 2012.<ref name=eurocup />

Following two seasons in Spain and almost two years living in Seville, Porziņģis was able to speak Spanish far more fluently.

===Rape allegation===
In March 2019, it was publicly revealed that a woman accused Porziņģis of raping her at the [[Sky (skyscraper)|Sky]] building in February 2018, hours after he tore his ACL. The woman reportedly told police she waited more than a year to come forward because she had discussed getting a $68,000 payout from Porziņģis to keep quiet. Porziņģis' attorney, Roland G. Riopelle, publicly denied the claim, and said he had previously referred the case to federal authorities due to the "accuser's extortionate demands".<ref>{{cite web|last=Begley|first=Ian|last2=MacMahon|first2=Tim|last3=Young|first3=Royce|title=Report: Porzingis accused of rape in New York|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26401287/report-porzingis-accused-rape-new-york|website=[[ESPN]]|date=30 March 2019|accessdate=31 March 2019}}</ref>
