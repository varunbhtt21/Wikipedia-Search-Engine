Title : File:La Cueva Spanish Poster 2014.jpeg
Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
|Description = This is one of the first posters for the Spanish language horror film La Cueva. 
|Source = http://es.paperblog.com/poster-y-trailer-de-la-cueva-de-alfredo-montero-2529257/
|Date = 2014
|Author = Filmax International, Morena Films
|Article = La Cueva (film)
|Purpose = to serve as the primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the work in question.
|Replaceability = n.a.
|Minimality = This poster was distributed as part of a press kit to promote La Cueva while it was on its initial film festival tour. It will be used to identify the film, its cast/crew, its tagline, and other elements that cannot be done with words alone. Usage will not harm or otherwise impede sales/distribution of the film.
|Commercial = n.a.
|Other information = I have chosen to use the Spanish language poster as opposed to the English poster, as this is one of the earliest posters out there and much of the coverage refers to it as "La Cueva" as opposed to "In Darkness We Fall". If an earlier poster can be found and sourced, I'd suggest using that one instead.
