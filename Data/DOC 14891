:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Article is new enough, having been started three days before the nomination, and long enough, with 1821 B of readable prose. The article has inline sources, adheres to a neutral point of view, and no close paraphrasing or copyvios were detected. The hook is formatted properly, fewer than 200 characters, interesting, accurate, and neutral. QPQ has been done. This one looks good to go.
