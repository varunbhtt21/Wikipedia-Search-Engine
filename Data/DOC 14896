The '''Rahrovan minaret''' is located 6 km northeast of [[Isfahan]]. The [[minaret]] is 30 m high. It dates back to the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] era and has almost kept its original shape, but its [[inscription]]s has been damaged severely. It is the fourth oldest minaret in [[Isfahan province]] after [[Ali minaret]], [[Sarban minaret]] and [[Ziyar minaret]]. Its decorations are simple, featuring a stripe of [[Rhombus|rhombic]] shapes around the minaret, in which the names of [[Mohammad]] and [[Ali]] are repeated. On the top of the minaret, there is a window for [[muezzin]] and signal fire for orientation of [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]]s and passengers in the [[desert]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān(Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan)|publisher=Rouzane|isbn=964-334-218-2|author=Hosseyn Yaghoubi|editor=Arash Beheshti|page=146|language=Persian|year=2004}}</ref>
