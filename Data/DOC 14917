==History==
The initiative was named after Mt. [[Igman]] in remembrance of the intellectual activists, who traveled from all over former [[Yugoslavia]] via the Igman Mountain Road to Sarajevo in April 1995 in solidarity with the besieged population.<ref>In an interview with Radio Free Europe one of the activist, Ivan Stambolić, said “because of the people in Sarajevo and solidarity with them, but also in support of the people in Serbia who have been against the war and destruction of the city and the people in it, but also because of war monger and instigators . . . with this act I want to show that patriotism, lest humanism, is a lie.”</ref> In November 2000 a conference ''Prospects of Relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the FRY''<ref>At that time the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) still consisted of Serbia and Montenegro.</ref>” was convened in [[Zagreb]]. The conference gathered more than a hundred [[NGO]]s from the nations ratifying the [[Dayton Agreement]]. The participating organizations agreed to formally join their efforts to stimulate the normalization of relations among the three countries. In 2001 in [[Novi Sad]] the second session of the conference was held where the Initiative was formally established and a Council was appointed.

The Igman Initiative was founded by the [[Center for Regionalism]] (Novi Sad, Serbia), the [[Forum of the Democratic Alternative BiH]] (Sarajevo, BiH) and the [[Civic Committee for Human Rights]] (Zagreb, Croatia).<ref name="II-History">{{cite web |url=http://www.igman-initiative.org/about-us/history/ |title=Igman Initiative: History |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref> [[Freedom House]] provides nearly all of the funding for the Igman Initiative projects.<ref name="II-History"/>
