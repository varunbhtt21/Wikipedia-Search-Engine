=== Henry Howard Spowers ===
Henry Howard Spowers was born on 18 Jul 1872 in Melbourne, Vic., Australia. He died on 7 Jan 1933 in Hawthorn.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4518446 Obituary of Henry Howard Spowers], ''The Argus'' (Melbourne, Victoria : 1848 - 1957)  9 January 1933 page 6.</ref> Spowers Trained with Charles d’Ebro.<ref name=spowers-history/>

== Firm History ==
In 1895, William Scott Purves Godfrey formed an architectural partnership with a surveyor named Howitt. They called their firm Howitt & Godfrey. After six years Howitt left and Henry Howard Spowers joined the firm.  The firm was then registered as Godfrey and Spowers,<ref>{{cite book|title=Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trhUAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Transition Pub.,.}}</ref> and shortly afterwards they moved into an office at 34 Queen Street, Melbourne.

Although a few commercial buildings were undertaken, until WW1 the firm’s practice consisted mainly of houses for the 'well-to-do', with coach-houses and servant’s wings. They were for a time the architects for [[Melbourne Grammar School]] completing the Cuming Wing in 1908,  the Ross Memorial Gates in 1910, and the Jubilee Wing in 1913.

The First World War slowed the growth of the firm. In the mid-1920s a number of commercial and industrial projects were carried out, most significantly the 1926 Argus Building, a newspaper office and printery, on the north-west corner of Elizabeth and LaTrobe Streets.

After WW1 the firm built a number of branches for the State Savings Bank of Victoria and the Bank of New South Wales in the Melbourne suburbs and the country Victoria, the most notable being the Egyptian influenced Bank of NSW branch at 190 Bourke Street in 1930.

In December 1932 Spowers died and in about 1934 Godfrey's son also named William, but known by his middle name as Race Godfrey succeeded as partner. The practice was commissioned to design the new Melbourne headquarters for the Bank of New South Wales,<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11776313?searchTerm=%22Godfrey%20and%20Spowers%22&searchLimits= "New Bank Building for Northcote"]. The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)  12 October 1935 page 21.</ref> and this building was the winner of the Street Architecture Medal for 1936.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goad|first1=Phillip, Ed.|title=Judging Architecture|date=2003|publisher=Royal Australian Institute of Architects (Victoria)}}</ref>

In 1941, the practice was suspended due to the war.  Race Godfrey worked with the RAAF as a civilian architect in Melbourne and Sydney, while W S P Godfrey, who was then 69, carried out a few commissions for air-raid shelters and other requirements of ARP authorities until the war ended. Race Godfrey returned to Melbourne to recommence practice late in 1944. W S P Godfrey did not continue with the new firm, and retired from practice in 1944.<ref name=spowers-history/>

In 1961, John M. Davidson was made a partner of the firm.  He later became a director and eventually chairman.<ref name="Publications2003">{{cite book|author=Europa Publications|title=The International Who's Who 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SK-81iI6NJQC&pg=PA396|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85743-217-6|pages=396–}}</ref> By the early 1960s, the firm was expanded to become Godfrey Spowers, Hughes Mewton & Lobb.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goad|first1=Phillip (Ed).|title=Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> and designed the National Mutual Building, demolished in 2015.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjBaAAAAYAAJ|volume=160-184|year=1965|publisher=Nation Review.|page=xxv}}</ref> The firm continued to design commercial projects through the succeeding decades, changing name to Spowers in the 1990s, a firm that contunies to design a wide range of buildings styles, and provide a range of services across Australia and internationally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spowers|url=https://www.spowers.com.au/|website=Spowers|accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref>
