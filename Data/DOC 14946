'''Big Pharma conspiracy theories''' are [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] which claim that the medical establishment in general and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] in particular, especially the large ones, operate for sinister purposes and against the public good.<ref name=Blaskiewicz/><ref name=Dunning>{{Skeptoid | id=4589 | number=589 |title=The Big Pharma Conspiracy | date=September 19, 2017 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>

==History and definition==
The term ''Big Pharma'' is used to refer collectively to the global [[pharmaceutical industry]]. According to [[Steve Novella]] the term has come to connote a [[demonized]] form of the pharmaceutical industry.<ref name=Novella/> Professor of writing Robert Blaskiewicz has written that conspiracy theorists use the term ''Big Pharma'' as "shorthand for an abstract entity {{sic|comprising |hide=y}} corporations, regulators, NGOs, politicians, and often physicians, all with a finger in the trillion-dollar prescription pharmaceutical pie".<ref name=Blaskiewicz/>

According to Blaskiewicz, the Big Pharma conspiracy theory has four classic traits: first, the assumption that the conspiracy is perpetrated by a small malevolent cadre; secondly, the belief that the public at large is ignorant of the truth; thirdly, that its believers treat lack of evidence as evidence; and finally, that the arguments deployed in support of the theory are irrational, misconceived, or otherwise mistaken.<ref name=Blaskiewicz>{{cite journal |last=Blaskiewicz |first=Robert |journal=Medical Writing |year=2013 |volume=22 |issue=4 |page=259 |title=The Big Pharma conspiracy theory |doi=10.1179/2047480613Z.000000000142}}</ref>

In a New Statesman article, [[Robert Bartholomew (sociologist)|Robert Bartholomew]], a sociologist specializing in mass hysteria, observes that although conspiracy theories have always been around, social media enables them to spread faster and have more staying power since it's far easier for people to construct their own version of reality through social media. In the same article, Mike Woods, a psychologist specializing in online conspiracy theory techniques, points to alienation, a lack of control, and a sense of uncertainty about the world as common traits of conspiratorial thinkers. He goes on to say that “basically conspiracy theories are a way to try and make sense of the world that in that moment doesn’t particularly make sense” and that lets the theorists "allege that things that are happening are basically controllable".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tait |first1=Amelia |title="They’re turning the frogs gay": the psychology behind internet conspiracy theories |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2017/03/they-re-turning-frogs-gay-psychology-behind-internet-conspiracy |website=newstatesman.com |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>

==Manifestations==
The conspiracy theory has a variety of different specific manifestations. Each has different narratives, but they always cast "Big Pharma" as the villain of the piece.<ref name=Blaskiewicz/> Some of the most prominent variants include the following:

===Alternative treatments===
In ''[[Natural Cures "They" Don't Want You to Know About]]'', [[Kevin Trudeau]] proposes that there are all-natural cures for serious illnesses including [[cancer]], [[herpes]], [[arthritis]], [[AIDS]], [[acid reflux disease]], various [[phobia]]s, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[lupus]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[attention deficit disorder]], [[muscular dystrophy]], and that these are all being deliberately hidden and suppressed from the public by the Food and Drug Administration, the [[Federal Trade Commission]], and the major food and drug companies.<ref>[[Michael Shermer]], "[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cures-and-cons/ Cures and Cons: Natural scams "he" doesn't want you to know about]," ''[[Scientific American]]'', March 2006.</ref>

===HIV/AIDS===
In a 2006 column for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', journalist [[Celia Farber]]  claimed that the antiretroviral drug [[nevirapine]] was part of a conspiracy by the "scientific-medical complex" to spread toxic drugs.<ref name=Schaffer>{{cite journal |title=Drug trials and error: conspiracy theories about big pharma would amuse, if they were not a matter of life and death |last=Schaffer |first=A.

===Hidden cancer cure===
The idea that big pharma has a cure for cancer and is suppressing it so that they can maintain a profit is believed by as much as 27% of the American public according to a 2005 survey.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Gansler | first=Ted | last2=Henley | first2=S.

[[Steven Novella]] writes, in [[Skepticblog]], about the general misunderstanding and sensationalizing of cancer research that typically accompanies a conspiratorial mindset. He points out that cures for cancer, rather than being hidden, are not the cures they are initially touted to be by the media and either result in a dead end, further research goals, or a decrease in the mortality rate for a specific type of cancer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Novella |first1=Steven |authorlink= Steven Novella|title=ANOTHER CURE FOR CANCER? |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2011/05/16/another-cure-for-cancer/ |website=skepticblog.org |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref>

==Reception==

Novella writes that while the pharmaceutical industry has a number of aspects which justly deserve criticism, the "demonization" of it is both cynical and intellectually lazy.<ref name=Novella>{{cite web |last=Novella |first=Steven |authorlink=Steve Novella |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/demonizing-big-pharma/ |title=Demonizing 'Big Pharma' |date=22 April 2010 |work=Science-Based Medicine}}</ref> He goes on to consider that overblown attacks on ''Big Pharma'' actually let the pharmaceutical industry "off the hook" since they distract from and tarnish more considered criticisms.<ref name=Novella/>

An argument against the [[U.S. government]] taking part in the suppression of cures is the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]] wherein incentives are created for developing treatments for disease which the treatments have no profitable outcomes for the companies involved.<ref name="GPO">{{cite web | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-96/pdf/STATUTE-96-Pg2049.pdf | title=Orphan Drug Act of 1983 | work=US Food and Drug Administration | date=4 January 1983 | accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>

A common claim among proponents of the conspiracy theory is that pharmaceutical companies suppress negative research about their drugs by financially pressuring researchers and journals. There are in fact papers critical of specific drugs published in journals on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Radford |first1=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Radford|title=Big Pharma Conspiracy Debunked |url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/big_pharma_conspiracy_debunked/ |website=centerforinquiry.org |accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> A prominent and recent example was a systematic review published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' showing that [[paracetamol]] is ineffective for lower back pain and has minimal effectiveness for [[osteoarthritis]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Machado | first=G.

In 2016 [[David Robert Grimes]] published a research paper elaborating about the mathematical non-viability of conspiracy theories in general.<ref name="Grimes p=e0147905">{{cite journal | last=Grimes | first=David Robert | editor-last=Bauch | editor-first=Chris T. | title=On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs | journal=PLOS ONE | publisher=Public Library of Science (PLoS) | volume=11 | issue=1 | date=26 January 2016 | issn=1932-6203 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905 | page=e0147905| pmc=4728076 }}</ref> He specifically showed that if there was an actual big pharma conspiracy to conceal a cure for cancer that it would take about 3.2 years for it get exposed due to the sheer number of people required to keep it secret.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Berezow |first1=Alex |title=Maths study shows conspiracies 'prone to unravelling' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35411684 |accessdate=25 June 2018 |agency=Science and Environment |publisher=BBC}}</ref>
