Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was '''Keep''' as a [[WP:SNOW|snowball close]]. It appears the subject satisfies [[WP:NPOL]] requirements, and the overwhelmingly rapid consensus in favor of retaining the article suggests the discussion has already reached its logical conclusion. A non-admin closure. [[User:And Adoil Descended|And Adoil Descended]] ([[User talk:And Adoil Descended|talk]]) 17:35, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

Fails to satisfy the stipulations of [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:BASIC]]
Barely satisfies the stipulations of [[WP:NPOL]] <span style="font-family:trebuchet ms">'''[[User:M.O.X|<span style="color:#003366">James</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:M.O.X|<span style="color:#003366">T</span>]] • [[Special:Contributions/M.O.X|<span style="color:#003366">C</span>]])</sup> • 10:42pm''' •</span> 11:42, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' (as creator). [[WP:NPOL]] says: "1. Politicians and judges who have held international, national or sub-national (statewide/provincewide) office, and members or former members of a national, state or provincial legislature". Green was for 18 years an elected [[Member of Parliament]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], which is a national legislature. Why does the nominator describe that as "barely" meeting NPOL? <br />I will add some more refs, but this nomination appears to be completely ill-founded. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 11:53, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Quite obviously meets the requirements of [[WP:POLITICIAN]]. Ludicrous nomination. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 12:26, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Barely satisfying [[WP:NPOL]] is still satisfying [[WP:NPOL]]. Cheers! [[User:BD2412|<font style="background:gold">'''''bd2412'''''</font>]] [[User talk:BD2412|'''T''']] 13:37, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Snow keep''' - elected to a national assembly.  I also note that even if this lacks in depth sourcing at present, it won't after the [[History of Parliament Online]] project is completed. [[User:Barney the barney barney|Barney the barney barney]] ([[User talk:Barney the barney barney|talk]]) 13:53, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Clearly passes [[WP:NPOL]] as he was elected to Westminster on numerous occasions. [[User:Finnegas|Finnegas]] ([[User talk:Finnegas|talk]]) 14:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Proposer is attempting to promote [[John Green (author)]] by deleting all namesakes from Wikipedia, e.g. [[John Green (Medal of Honor)]] who is also unambiguously notable as a Medal of Honor recipient per [[WP:SOLDIER]], and [[John Green (judge)]], who plainly meets [[WP:POLITICIAN]]. Proposal says the article fails to satisfy [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:BASIC]] but offers no indication of what searches have been done for sources, suggesting [[WP:BEFORE]] has not been done. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 14:52, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
**I don't know what his motive is, but he is certainly prodding articles that should definitely not be prodded. His argument seems to be that these people are not notable, which they clearly are, and/or that there are no reliable sources, which is not a good reason to prod clearly notable articles. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 15:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': clearly notable as an MP. '''But posibly move to Greene?''': it's not clear whether his name is "Green" or "Greene" - see my note on the talk page. Could someone with access to a useful [[WP:RS]] please check? (Too early to be in "History of Parliament": Hansard has him as "Greene", probably more reliable than Rayment who has "Green"; article title and text are at odds.)

**{{ping|PamD}} Edit conflict while I drafted the comment below. Yes, his name is Greene. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 15:50, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Note mis-spelt name'''. The source I used when I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Green_%28MP%29&oldid=268490361 created the article] in 2009 mis-spells his name.  Other sources confirm that it should be "Green''e''": Walker's book, which I have added, plus [http://landedestates.nuigalway.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/estate-show.jsp?id=3196], [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-john-greene], [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oQj3WHhDjYYC&pg=PA383&dq=%22john+greene%22+mp+kilkenny+-wikipedia+-%22books,+llc%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LsdfU5XSBcTOOIL_gZAP&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22john%20greene%22%20mp%20kilkenny%20-wikipedia%20-%22books%2C%20llc%22&f=false], and more in a [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22john+greene%22+mp+kilkenny+-wikipedia+-%22books,%20llc%22&tbm=bks Gbooks search]. Some publications do mis-spell the name (see [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22john+green%22+mp+kilkenny+-wikipedia+-%22books,%20llc%22&tbm=bks Gbooks earch for "John Green"]), but a [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Greenville+Kilkenny+greene&tbm=bks search for Greenville (the family's estate) and Greene] confirms the spelling.  I don't want to move the page while it is at AFD, but if [[User:M.O.X]] would like to withdraw the nom I can move the page and correct the other links to him. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 15:48, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
