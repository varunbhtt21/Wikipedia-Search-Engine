The '''National Board for Prices and Incomes''' was created by the government of [[Harold Wilson]] in 1965 in an attempt to solve the problem of [[inflation]] in the British economy by [[prices and incomes policy|managing wages and prices]].

The Board's chairman was [[Aubrey Jones]], formerly a [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, who resigned his seat to take the position.<ref>Goodman (n.d.)</ref> Amongst the other members was the academic [[Hugh Clegg (industrial relations)|Hugh Clegg]].<ref>Thompson (n.d.)</ref>

The Board's initial topics, given by the Government, were to deal with the pricing of soap, bread  and road haulage. Its first report (July 1965) attacked [[price-fixing]] by the British [[Road Haulage Association]]. The Association's combative response was to prove a typical reaction to most of the Board's findings throughout its existence. Recommendations on wages were no more effective, especially as the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] was opposed from an early stage to the government's attempts at wage control. From 1966 onwards, the Government introduced a series of [[Prices and Incomes Act 1966|Prices and Incomes Orders]] to limit price and wage increases by law. This was in effect the end of the voluntary policy which had been envisaged. [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]], the [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs]] responsible for the Board, was moved later that year to become [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]].<ref>Broadway (1970), pp. 48-9.</ref>

With the failure of Brown's national economic plans, and especially after [[devaluation]] in 1967, wage control was more consistently opposed by British trades unions, and eventually in 1970 Wilson proposed to merge the Board with the [[Monopolies Commission]], with Jones at its head. In the event the 1970 General Election was won by the Conservatives, who scrapped the organization.<ref>Goodman (n.d.)</ref> Clegg wrote a book on his experience entitled ''How to Run an Incomes Policy, and Why We Made Such a Mess of the Last One''. (1971).<ref>Brown (1995)</ref> Subsequently in 1972 the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Edward Heath]] revived the idea with a [[Prices Commission]] and a Pay Board, which were similarly unpopular, although the Prices Commission was retained (and the Pay Board abolished) by the returning Wilson government in 1974.
