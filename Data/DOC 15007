Text : [[File:28 Chapel.JPG|thumb | The Elias Vanderhorst House, 28 Chapel Street, Charleston, South Carolina]]

The '''Elias Vanderhorst House''' at 28 Chapel Street, [[Charleston, South Carolina]], is a four-story mansion house which was built around 1835 as a home for members of the prominent Vanderhorst family of plantation owners.

==The house==
Built in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style, the house stands on a high basement and features a porch across the front with six large columns and a double flight of stone steps leading to a piazza. Most of the original late federal woodwork is intact, along with some of the finest examples of wrought-iron in the city. The plot of land was purchased by the eponymous Elias Vanderhorst in 1832 and the house remained in his family for almost a century.<ref name=dwelling>{{cite book

==The Vanderhorst family==

Elias Vanderhorst, the builder of the house, was a fifth-generation member of a prominent South Carolina family. The Vanderhorst family was established in South Carolina towards the end of the 17th century by Baron Johannes Van Der Horst (1662-1717), a Dutch army officer who had accompanied [[William III of England | William of Orange]] when he claimed the English throne during the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and who later emigrated to Charleston.<ref name=Burke>{{cite book |last=Colburn |first=H |title=Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NEKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1109 |year=1847|publisher=H. Colburn |pages=1108}}</ref> 

Baron Johannes van Der Horst's son, John Vanderhorst (1689-1739), was born in Charleston as part of the family's second generation in the city and had 12 children (the family's third generation in Charleston), including several who became notable in their own rights.<ref name=ancestry>{{cite web |url=http://records.ancestry.com/john_vanderhorst_records.ashx?pid=3164251 |title=Family tree of John Vanderhorst |publisher= [[Ancestry.com]] |accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref> 

One son in the third generation, Arnoldus Vanderhorst I (1720-1765), was the father of [[Arnoldus Vanderhorst | Arnoldus Vanderhorst II (1748-1815)]] who developed the [[Arnoldus Vander Horst House | Vanderhorst House]] and plantation on [[Kiawah Island, South Carolina | Kiawah Island]] in South Carolina in the late 18th century.<ref name=kiawah>{{cite web |url= http://www.sciway.net/hist/chicora/quash-1.html |title= A Short History of Kiawah Island and Quash Stevens |publisher= South Carolina Information Highway |accessdate=11 April 2014 }}</ref> Arnoldus Vanderhorst II also served in the South Carolina militia during the Revolutionary War and later as [[List of Governors of South Carolina|Governor of South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sciway.net/hist/governors/vanderhorst.html |title= SC Governors â€“ Arnoldus Vanderhorst, 1794-1796 |publisher= South Carolina Information Highway |accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref>

The Elias Vanderhorst who built this house was most likely his son, Elias Vanderhorst III (1780-1874), who lived for much of the time in Charleston at this residence. He inherited the Kiawah plantation and both properties were passed on to his own son, Arnoldus Vanderhorst IV (c. 1829-1881), who married Adele Allston Vanderhorst. She eventually owned the plantation and Elias Vanderhorst House, until she died in 1915.<ref name=kiawah /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southcarolinahistoricalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vanderhorst-Family-1169.00.pdf |title=Catalogue of the Vanderhorst family papers, 1689-1942 |publisher=[[South Carolina Historical Society]]

By the 1980s, the neighborhood had substantially deteriorated. In February 1983, the City of Charleston's Commission on Redevelopment and Preservation approved a plan to leverage federal community redevelopment funding as part of a program to offer relatively low interest loans for the renovation of 28 Chapel Street and the houses on either side. The work on all three houses was expected to cost $570,000<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19830217&id=hWpJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0goNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4761,4282620 | title=Chapel Street Project Funds Are Approved | work=News & Courier | date=February 17, 1983 | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | author=McCarthy, Patricia | location=Charleston, South Carolina | pages=5B}}</ref> and had to be completed before December 31, 1983, to qualify for various tax benefits for the year.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19830827&id=eXxJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kgsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1567,7731122 | title=Chapel Street restoration | work=News & Courier | date=August 27, 1983 | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | author=White, Marsha | location=Charleston, South Carolina | pages=B1}}</ref>
