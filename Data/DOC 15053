I have had this on my watchlist for over a year and am disgusted with myself for not AfDing this earlier. {{u|IronGargoyle}}'s rationale for redirecting the article, "no references, all original research", is probably a better summary than any diatribe of mine. <span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 12:21, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per nom - A brief summary on [[Raven]] would be better. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 17:20, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Its issue tags (which haven't been addressed in 3.5 years) say it all. — '''[[User:CAWylie|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Wylie</span>]][[User talk:CAWylie|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">pedia</span>]]''' 07:47, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. There exists a good-quality article on the show itself. I see nothing in this obsessively detailed accounting that seems at all encyclopedic.  [[User:Bustter|Bustter]] ([[User talk:Bustter|talk]]) 16:56, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
