:*I will start reviewing this one now...  <font face="Helvetica">[[User:Hassocks5489|<font color="#00BFFF"><b>Hassocks</b></font>]][[User talk:Hassocks5489|<font color="#228B22">5489</font><font color="#C71585"><small> (Floreat Hova!)</small></font>]]</font> 12:34, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*Creation date and article length are fine.
*The references are of high quality: obituaries/articles in respected newspapers, the ODNB, Margaret Thatcher's autobiography and a well-referenced history of the TUC.  References have been used and represented appropriately.
*No copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns.
*The hook fact is interesting and verifiable in more than one of the references.  It does not exceed maximum length.
*QPQ review done.

*I do feel there is more that could be included in the article, though, especially from the ODNB source.  His bio there is quite extensive.  For example, he apparently helped to launch the [[Warwick Business School]] â€“ admittedly Warwick is my alma mater, but I find that quite significant.  The paragraph starting "He joined Nuffield College, then in its infancy..." in the ''Independent'' obituary also has some interesting material.  Still, this is a decent start, and definitely not Stub-class.
