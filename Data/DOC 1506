::The offending material was added with [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Youngren&diff=596705340&oldid=595317324 this edit]. I reverted to the edit before that, and then put the maintenance tags back in. [[User:Cnilep|Cnilep]] ([[User talk:Cnilep|talk]]) 08:10, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::That seems to have been a good call by {{u|Cnilep}}. However, looking further back, is there any reason at all to suppose that {{oldid|Peter Youngren|36324531|this}} is original content?

::::I searched a bit and did find one very similar sentence in a list of pastors, [http://www.angelfire.com/ab3/donaldbsanders/7-ChristianLinks.html/ here]. I check the web site of Youngren's ministry, but couldn't find either that sentence or other information in the 2006 Wikipedia article. Both the Wikipedia content and the angelfire site might come from some third source, but so far I can't find it. I've asked [[User:Norum]] to comment here.

:::::  I made those edits 8 years ago, back in January 2006.  I am a bit surprised to be asked about the edits now, I can't really remember were I found the source.  [[User:Norum|Norum]] 07:26, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::It may never be possible to identify the source, but it seems quite obvious that it was copied from something - content like "World Impact Ministries - Founded by Peter Youngren in 1976, World Impact Ministries reaches millions each year with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, through festivals and conferences" is clear "PR speak". But never mind the copyright concerns - it's a clear [[WP:BLP]] issue. Even in 2006, sources were required. :) I've rewritten it from scratch, with sourcing. Unfortunately, I can't find much. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 13:29, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Given {{u|Moonriddengirl}}'s certainty that this content was copied, I looked at other edits by {{u|Norum}}. Based on what I found, I've requested a [[WP:CCI]]. [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]] ([[User talk:Justlettersandnumbers|talk]]) 12:43, 8 May 2014 (UTC)


In plain English, what does it all mean?  [[User:Norum|Norum]] 18:19, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
:{{u|Norum}}, it means that I think that some of the articles you created a long time ago include stuff that you copied without permission from other places, either websites or books. So I've asked for a check on your edits to see if I'm right or wrong. I left a note on your talk page about it. The request is [[Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations#Requests|here]], and that is the place to make any comments you may have. [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]] ([[User talk:Justlettersandnumbers|talk]]) 19:10, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

I have read and yes, I have done that back 8 years ago, when I was still new and inexperienced.  So I am no denying anything.  My question is, what could be the final outcome?  [[User:Norum|Norum]] 19:30, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
