The '''Football West State Cup''' is a [[association football|soccer]] competition held between clubs in the Australian state of Western Australia, known as the Belt Up Cup for sponsorship reasons. It serves as preliminary rounds for the [[FFA Cup]], with the 2 finalists also entering the final stages of that competition.

==History==
Several knockout competitions have been held since 1895 in various forms,<ref name="Kreider">Kreider, R.N. (2012) Paddocks to Pitches. The Definitive History of Western Australian Football. Published by SportsWest Media</ref> with one of the two major Western Australian knockout cup competitions initially called the '''Challenge Cup''', from 1903 to 1959 as the '''Challenge Cup and Shield''', between 1960 and 1995 as the '''D’Orsogna Cup''', and since that time with a number of naming rights sponsors.

The other major knockout competition in Western Australia was the '''Charity Cup''', held between 1903 and 1961. This was considered the pre-eminent cup competition prior to the Second World War.<ref name="Kreider" />

Since 2014, this knockout competition has also served as preliminary rounds for the [[FFA Cup]], with Western Australia represented by the 2 finalists, along with the [[A-League]] club [[Perth Glory FC]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Structure of the NPL & State League|url=http://www.footballwest.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/NPL/NPL_Structure_Final.pdf|publisher=footballwest.com.au|accessdate=15 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104025104/http://www.footballwest.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/NPL/NPL_Structure_Final.pdf|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
