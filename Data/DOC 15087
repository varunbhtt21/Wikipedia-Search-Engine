Title : Falling-film column
Text : A '''falling-film column''' (or '''wetted-wall column''') is a particular [[chemical equipment]] used to achieve [[mass transfer|mass]] and [[heat transfer]] between two [[fluid]] [[Phase (matter)|phases]] (in general one [[gas]] phase and one [[liquid]] phase).

It is essentially formed by a vertical tube-shaped vessel: the liquid stream flows through the inner wall of the tube and the gas stream flows in correspondence of the centre of the tube.

== Description ==
[[File:Wetted wall column.svg|thumb|Schematics of a typical falling-film column.]]

In the most common case, the column contains one liquid stream and one gas stream. The liquid forms a thin [[film]] that covers the inner surface of the vessel,<ref name=Dutta>Binay K. Dutta, Principles of Mass Transfer and Separation Processes, Nuova Delhi, Prentice-Hall of India Private Limited, 2007, p. 91. {{ISBN|8120329902}}.</ref> instead the gas stream is normally injected from the bottom of the column, so the two fluids are subjected to a [[counter-current exchange]] of matter and heat, that happens in correspondence of the gas-liquid interface.

Sometimes, the same equipment is used to achieve the [[co-current exchange|co-current mass and heat transfer]] between two [[miscibility|immiscible]] liquids.<ref>Satoru Asai, Junichi Hatanaka , Toshiya Kimura , Hidekazu Yoshizawa, Mass transfer in wetted-wall column with cocurrent laminar liquid-liquid flow in Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, vol. 26, n. 3, ACS Publications, marzo 1987, pp. 483â€“488. DOI:10.1021/ie00063a014.</ref>

== Applications ==

Because of its easiness of [[Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences|modelling]], falling-film column is generally used as [[laboratory equipment]], for example to measure experimentally the values of transport coefficients.<ref name=Dutta/> A significant experiment was carried out in 1934 by [[Edwin R. Gilliland]] and [[Thomas Kilgore Sherwood]] that used a falling-film column to study the mass transfer phenomenon between a liquid phase and a gas phase, obtaining an experimental correlation between [[Sherwood number]], [[Reynolds number]] and [[Schmidt number]].<ref>Robert S. Brodkey, Harry C. Hershey, Transport Phenomena: A Unified Approach, Brodkey Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|0972663584}}.</ref>

It is not used at an industrial scale, because it has low [[surface area]] and liquid [[liquid holdup|hold-up]] compared to other [[gas-liquid contactor]]s (e.g. a [[packed column]] or a [[plate column]]).
