'''PCKeeper''' is advertised as an optimization services package featuring a set of software utilities for [[Windows OS]] owned by Essentware S.A. (company based in Bratislava, Slovakia).<ref name="Essentware S.A. Official website">{{cite web|url=http://essentware.com/|title=Essentware S.A. Official website}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=November 2015}} It includes 2 separate products for Windows: '''PCKeeper Live''' and '''PCKeeper Antivirus'''.<ref name="About PCKeeper. Official website">{{cite web|url=http://pckeeper.com/company|title=About PCKeeper. Official website|accessdate=2015-11-11}}</ref>

PCKeeper was originally developed by [[Zeobit|Zeobit LLC]] which was founded in 2009 by Slava Kolomiychuk. PCKeeper was released in September 2010. Kromtech Alliance acquired PCKeeper and MacKeeper from Zeobit in May 2013. In 2015, PCKeeper has changed its legal owners from Kromtech Alliance Corp. to Essentware S.A. Kromtech Alliance has made the decision to focus on the products for Mac users only.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kromtech Official website|url=http://kromtech.com/}}</ref> Essentware S.A. office registered in Panama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paginasamarillas.com.pa/empresa/essentware++s+a-panama+lang+en_16831109?ad=27403095#branchSection|title= Essentware SA Location}}</ref>  The principal officers and developers of the company remain in Ukraine.

== Exaggerated warning messages ==

Two class action lawsuits have been filed against Kromtech for the Mac OS version of PCKeeper, MacKeeper. The first lawsuit, filed in Illinois, alleges that "Contrary to ZeoBIT's marketing and in-software representations, however, neither the free trial nor the full registered versions of MacKeeper perform any credible diagnostic testing of a user's Mac. Instead, ZeoBIT intentionally designed MacKeeper to invariably and ominously report that the consumer's Mac needs repair and is at-risk due to harmful errors, privacy threats, and other problems, regardless of the computer's actual condition."<sup>[11]</sup> The second complaint, filed by Holly Yencha of Pennsylvania, alleges that the free starter version of MacKeeper identifies harmless programs as "critical" problems. The complaint claims that "under MacKeeper's reporting algorithm, even brand new computers are in 'critical' condition and require repair by purchasing the full version." <sup>[12]</sup><ref>{{Cite web|title = Class Action Lawsuit: ZeoBIT Dupes Users into Buying MacKeeper Upgrade|url = http://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/26392-class-action-lawsuit-zeobit-dupes-users-buying-mackeeper-upgrade/|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref>

PCKeeper Live is sometimes installed on users' PCs with other partner programs, which can cause unwanted pop-up windows.

PCKeeper Live is rated "Good" (3.5 out of 5) by the PCMag editor,<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2473479,00.asp|title=Kromtech PCKeeper Live by PCMag}}</ref> stating  "improves PC performance", and "great for novice users" , "The utility won't clean your PC as well as Iolo System Mechanic, but considering its accessibility and wallet friendliness, it's one to check out"  and "Kromtech PCKeeper Live's human specialists and unique price plans make this tune-up utility worthy of consideration, but rival applications offer better PC improvement".

Techradar.pro rates its 3 out of 5 stars and that noted, that "Overall, PCKeeper is a light-weight tool that won't annoy you with pop-up windows", "When you consider the fact most of PCKeeper Live's optimization features are easily found on most free tools, and that some were simply not useful at all, the price for the Kromtech solution seems unreasonably high." and "Kromtech's 24/7 support is what elevates PCKeeper Live from an overpriced utility program to a tool that even a non-geek can use to optimize his/her computer."<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/pckeeper-live-1276082/review/|title=PCKeeper Live review by Techradar}}</ref>

=== Reviews ===
PCMag rated PCKeeper Antivirus Good (3 out of 5), noting that PCKeeper Antivirus has a "Streamlined, attractive interface. Easy to use for non-techies. Good score in our hands-on malware blocking testing".  However, it scored poorly in independent lab testing and the chat based support was "soured by the fact that they served me misinformation." PC Mag concluded "you'd be better off with Panda Free Antivirus 2015, an Editors' Choice for free antivirus. It slightly edged PCKeeper in my own tests and swept the field in lab tests, with high marks across the board.  For the same price as PCKeeper, you could have Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2015 or Kaspersky Anti-Virus (2015), both of which we named Editors' Choice for paid antivirus. Any of these is a better choice." <ref name="PC Mag AV Review"/>

== Social campaigns ==
In May 2013 PCKeeper let its customers decide how much to pay for the software, launching a [[pay what you want]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/pckeeper_antivirus_tests_pay-what-you-want_business_model2013|title=Pay what you want campaign launch}}</ref>
