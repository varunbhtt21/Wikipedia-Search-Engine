Title : Asseek River
Text : The '''Asseek River''' is a [[river]] in the [[British Columbia Coast|Central Coast region]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], flowing north out of the [[Pacific Ranges]] to enter saltwater at the head of [[South Bentinck Arm]].  The name has been used since 1930, but an earlier map from 1913 shows it as the '''Talolail River'''.<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/25996.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Asseek River"]</ref>  Also entering South Bentinck Arm a few miles north on the east side of the inlet is the [[Taleomey River]],<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/17593.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Taleomey River"]</ref> whose estuary forms Taleomey Narrows, a constriction of the inlet,<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/40897.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Taleomey Narrows"]</ref> and also where is the location of [[Taleomy Indian Reserve No. 3]] of the [[Nuxalk Nation]].  Another constriction south of the Taleomey estuary, and immediately north of the Asseek's mouth is '''Bentinck Narrows''',<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/40241.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Bentinck Narrows"]</ref> which is formed by the [[alluvial fan]] of Ickna Creek.<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/865.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Ickna Creek"]</ref>

There was a [[List of Nuxalk villages|Nuxalk village]] named ''Aseik'' in the area of the Asseek's mouth, as was also ''Koapk''.<ref>[http://www.canadiangenealogy.net/indians/bellacoola_indians.htm ''The Indian Tribes of North America'', John Swanton, 1953, quoted in canadiangeneaology.net website]</ref>
