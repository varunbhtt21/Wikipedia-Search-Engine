==Round 1==
# {{User|Bejnar}} I do a lot of citation work and verification. I often write one or two new articles per month.  I do mostly non-BLP biography, geography, and occasional geology articles.  In the past I have worked on Afghanistan history and geography, Libyan history and geography, Burma history and geography, New Mexico history and geography and Indian geography. I would say that about half of my biographies have been Americans, primarily scientists.  Typical of my biographical articles are [[Michael Mbabuike]] and [[James Smoot Coleman]] both from 2008 when there was less emphasis on inline citation.  For newer examples, see [[Yolanda Bedregal]] and last month's [[William Cattley]]. [https://tools.wmflabs.org/supercount/index.php?user=Bejnar&project=en.wikipedia&toplimit=10 WikiChecker] says I have over 40,000 edits, and [http://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/pages/index.php?user=Bejnar&lang=en&wiki=wikipedia&namespace=0&redirects=noredirects Pages created] says I've created 1289 new pages, excluding redirects, but including new disambiguation pages.  I have edited since December 2005. I expect to use the OUP resources mostly for biographies, but also to add verification in existing history articles. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 04:04, 5 June 2014 (UTC)

# {{User|SMcCandlish}}. Not a renewal, but formerly approved for both Credo and Highbeam.  Wikipedian for 8+ years.  I have a degree in anthropology and applied linguistics, but am not a professional academic so I don't have journal access any longer.  My main (relevant) research needs are in arts (especially Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Symbolism, Arts & Crafts and Romanticism, as well as contemporary art, and post-punk music), biography (especially obscure but important sports figures, e.g. [[William A. Spinks]], which is about 95% my work, and about read for Feature Article review), life sciences (felinology, herpetology, commercial animal breeding, history of domestication), anthropology/archaeology/history (e.g. Celtic history and religion, pre-Indo-European archaeology, history of sport), and various other topics (I'm a major contributor to articles on albinism, linguistics, and other subjects that require citation high-quality sources). <span style="white-space:nowrap;font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:SMcCandlish|'''SMcCandlish''' ☺]] [[User talk:SMcCandlish|☏]] [[Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢]] ≽<sup>ʌ</sup>ⱷ҅<sub>ᴥ</sub>ⱷ<sup>ʌ</sup>≼ </span> 13:13, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

# Hello I am [[User:Carriearchdale]] I have been on Wikipedia since 2007 and currently have over 2700 edits globally over all the wikis. I am interested in having access to this wonderful resource to expand and verify articles in several different interest areas including biographies, linguistics, literature, classic antiquity studies, the arts, and education. I do not have access through local libraries since I live in a quite rural type setting. I would especially like to have access to the "Dictionary of National Biography" to further my verification of bio articles and move into creation of new bio articles.

# [[User:JonRichfield]]. In the past four years or so I have done well over 3000 edits, and a fair proportion of my work has been on articles that I initiated.  Most of the topics that I deal with are substantial, plus many RFCs (no groupie celeb touting for example). Most of my work is in a wide range of scientific and technical matters, particularly biological and computing, though I deal with a certain amount of historical and philological material as well. This often gets me into situations where OUP publications are the most desirable citations, and the accessible abstracts are not always an adequate basis for a good-faith citation. A good proportion of my work is in dealing with "citation wanted" material, so my requirements for reputable citations is atypically high. I am retired and cannot often reach the local university libraries where otherwise I could have got access to the desired publications, which I certainly could not afford myself, and do not apply for any material benefit to myself nor to any third party, commercial or otherwise. In short, I could make excellent use of access to the publications, publicising their value in the process. I am thoroughly aware of my responsibilities in protecting the interests of the publisher. Thank you for your attention. [[User:JonRichfield|JonRichfield]] ([[User talk:JonRichfield|talk]]) 19:56, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

#{{u|Justlettersandnumbers}} Access to Grove, Grove Art and the DNB would be invaluable to me, both in content creation and (in the case of the DNB) in copyright cleanup, this being unfortunately a much-plagiarised source.

# [[User:Ealdgyth]] I do not have access to Oxford journals at a local library, and now that I'm taking care of my elderly mother full time, I can no longer drive the hour and a half to get to a university library to access them.

I have well over 50 featured articles I've worked on, as well as over 100 Good articles, with a long list of other articles I wish to work on. I had been paying for ODNB access myself, but it would be much easier on my life if I didn't have to cough that amount up each year.

On Norwegian Wikipedia, I used to be active in content competitions. I mostly write society related articles, both contemporary and historical; many biographies.

I live outside the UK and much of the year in a remote area where access to anything but online resources is difficult (one reason I love Wikipedia, and try to contribute as much as I can).

This is why the OUP collection would be so valuable, as I could add useful, up-to-date, accurate information to many different articles if I had better access to it. My areas of special interest are early China, ancient and medieval Europe, onomastics, and in general, literature, history and poetry, especially of China, France, Germany and the British Isles.

#{{user8|InformationvsInjustice|Project=en}} I have been contributing more recently as part of a decision to increase my contributions to improve content in the areas in which I have something to offer.  I am involved in the Ancient Rome and Greece project.  Inadequate sourcing is endemic in many of the pages of interest to the project.  Right now, I'm working on an overhaul of the [[Romulus and Remus]] article.  I am a practicing attorney.  I have high research and citing skills.  I get frustrated often when I cannot access specific resources that I have located on line while editing.  I'm also a very good proofreader and writer.  My preferences are 1st: Journal, 2nd: Scholarship, 3rd: Law.  Thanks for contributing!

#:::::{{re|Cameron11598}} Sure.  For example, right now I am trying to re-work the [[Romulus and Remus]] article as part of my involvement with the Classical Greece and Rome project.  This article is in desperate need of adequate sourcing.  I have (through access to the Loeb Classical Library) sufficient primary sources to do the job.  What I need is reliable, peer-reviewed scholarship on the myth and it's evolution and role in Roman life.  That is where I could really use access to the OUP Journals.  Among the articles of interest to the CGR project (and me), a significant number of them are in desperate need of contemporary scholarly sources.  OUP Scholarship similarly would be useful.  It has content on many of the project's topics of interest.  I do have a J.D. and would be able to make use of OUP Law as well, although I am not currently undertaking any projects that would utilize it.[[User:InformationvsInjustice|Informata ob Iniquitatum]] ([[User talk:InformationvsInjustice|talk]]) 00:21, 12 November 2016 (UTC)

#{{user8|Gnom|Project=de}} Hi, would it be possible for me to have access to Oxford Music Online? I would like to use ''The New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments'' which is apparently included in this database, at least in part. The reason is that I started a project called "[[:de:Wikipedia:Wiki Loves Music|Wiki Loves Music]]" aimed at improving the quality of articles about musical instruments on German Wikipedia. Other language versions are profiting as well, especially through our image partnerships. You can find more out about the first results of this initiative [[:de:Wikipedia:Wiki Loves Music/Dokumentation|here]]. In June, we will host [[:de:Wikipedia:Wiki Loves Music/Hamburg 2017|an editathon in Hamburg, Germany]], where having access to this database would also be very valuable.
