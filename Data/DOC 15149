==Career==

When [[Dan Pinchbeck]] was developing his experimental video game ''[[Dear Esther]]'' he turned to his wife Curry to write a score. Thus Curry became the co-founder of [[The Chinese Room]] game studio.<ref name=mmag>{{cite web |url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/features/interview-jessica-curry/ |title=Interview: Jessica Curry |work=M magazine |date=20 September 2016  |accessdate=5 February 2017 }}</ref>

Following the success of that game, The Chinese Room went on to develop ''[[Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs]]'' which Curry describes as her first "journey into interactivity" as her score had been "shoehorned" into ''Dear Esther''.<ref name=mmag/>

While ''Amnesia'' was in production, The Chinese Room received an approach from [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s [[SIE Santa Monica Studio|Santa Monica Studio]] to develop an exclusive game for them. ''[[Everybody's Gone to the Rapture]]'', which had originally been envisaged as a [[PC game|PC release]], subsequently became a [[PlayStation 4]] exclusive.<ref name=mmag/> Curry describes ''Rapture'' as "the first time I would say that I wrote a truly interactive score".<ref name=mmag/>

In October 2015 Curry announced via her blog on The Chinese Room's website that she was leaving her role with the studio. She stated that her decision was based on various factors including a [[degenerative disease|degenerative condition]], the stress that she felt from the studioâ€™s relationship with a commercial publisher and her treatment as a [[Gamergate controversy|woman in the game industry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/10/10/9493789/in-a-heartbreaking-letter-jessica-curry-says-goodbye-to-the-chinese |title=In a heartbreaking letter, Jessica Curry says goodbye to The Chinese Room |first=Charlie |last=Hall |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=5 February 2017 }}</ref>
