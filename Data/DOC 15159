The '''Solomon Piper Farm''' is a historic farmhouse at 227 Valley Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  The 1-1/2 story vernacular [[Cape Cod (house)|Cape]] style house was built c. 1794 by Solomon Piper, progenitor of the locally prominent Piper family, and is an excellent local example of a typical early 19th century farmhouse.  It is five bays wide, with narrow windows, and a small extension added to the east end.  Interior details which have been retained include wainscoting, chair rails, and fireplace mantels.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004067}}|title=NRHP nomination for Solomon Piper Farm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.<ref name="nris"/>  The home of Solomon Piper's son, the [[Rufus Piper Homestead]], also still stands and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
