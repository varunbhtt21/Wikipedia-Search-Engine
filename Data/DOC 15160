Title : Technicolor Specials (Warner Bros. series)
Text : '''Technicolor Special''' was a common term used for [[Major film studio|Hollywood studio]] produced color [[film short]]s of the 1930s and 1940s that did not belong to a specified series (as marketed in the trade periodicals).

With the [[Warner Brothers]] studio, the key word “special” was applied to those color ''live-action'' shorts that ran two reels or roughly 20 minutes in length. Those running longer were dubbed [[Warner Featurettes]]. Other series names used occasionally were “Technicolor Broadway Brevities” (briefly in the ‘30s <ref>''BoxOffice''. August 25, 1936 (p.46), April 17, 1937 (p. 42) use “Broadway Brevities”, January 8, 1938 (p 71) use “Technicolor Special”</ref>) and “Technicolor Miniatures” (for a pair of ballet performances filmed in 1941 <ref>''BoxOffice''. March 14, 1942 (p. 103) also uses “Technicolor Special”</ref>).

==Overview==

Warner Brothers distinguished their two-reel Technicolor Specials from their many shorter color films, running under ten minutes (or one reel) in length. These included the animated [[Merrie Melodies]] and later [[Looney Tunes]], [[Vitaphone Varieties]] (in color from 1929–30), [[E. M. Newman Travelogues|E. M. Newman]] “Colortours”, [[Vitaphone Color Parade]], [[Sports Parade (Warner Bros. film series)|Sports Parade]], [[Technicolor Adventure (film series)|Technicolor Adventures]] and [[Scope Gem]]s, the last series occasionally running longer but distinguished by its use of [[CinemaScope]].

Combined, the studio was able to supply theater owners with enough color short subjects practically on a weekly or bi-weekly basis by the end of the thirties. In fact, only one or two feature films needed to be shot annually in color during the years 1940-47 since there was more than enough presented as “extras” before the main feature attraction.<ref>Finler, Joel W. ''The Hollywood Story''. 2003. Wallflower Press. p. 294-296, 369</ref>
At a time when the studio stopped making features in color, four back-to-back two-reel musicals (over 70 minutes worth) were made in Burbank, California in the autumn of 1933, with [[Eddie Cline]] supervising almost as if he was making a feature film.<ref>Liebman, Roy. ''Vitaphone Films – A Catalogue of the Features and Shorts''. 2003. McFarland & Company, p. 104</ref>

1934’s ''Service with a Smile'' was the first shot in the full [[Technicolor]]. Previously a more primitive 2-strip system was used. Two decades later, these were processed under the studio’s own Warnercolor system and occasionally dubbed “Warnercolor Specials”.

The studio was particularly successful with some recreations of American history during the years 1936-1940, the first being ''Song of a Nation'' with [[Donald Woods (actor)|Donald Woods]] playing [[Francis Scott Key]]. These kept the costume and set design departments busy and provided major stars like [[Claude Rains]] alternative projects to exercise, develop or diversify their acting skills between features. Another sub-series dramatized young men and women (again played by actors on the studio payroll) involved in the different military branches. Such titles as ''Service with the Colors'' helped prepare movie-goers for the inevitable conflict overseas and encouraged enlistment. Both series provided enough [[stock footage]] for later history lessons like ''March on America!'' (stretching from the pilgrim landing on Plymouth Rock through the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor) and ''My Country ‘Tis of Thee'' (reusing much of the same footage, but continuing through the war years thanks to recent additions like ''Beachhead to Berlin'').

Likewise, the ambitious mini-musicals of the thirties allowed similar recycling for a trio of forties titles:  ''Musical Movieland'', ''Movieland Magic'' and ''Hollywood Wonderland''. These only required a “framing scene” with a tour guide showing Hollywood visitors films in production. The production numbers shown were lifted from earlier shorts like ''[[Swingtime in the Movies]]''.<ref>Maltin, Leonard. ''The Great Movie Shorts''. 1972. Bonanza Books, p. 26</ref>

By 1942, an increasing number of these were [[documentary]] and [[travelogue (films)|travelogue]] subjects. Among the most notable from the post-war crop were a pair of prestigious India travelogues, ''Soap Box Derby'' (the first of many trips to the mini-car races in Ohio), ''Down the Nile'' (showcasing Egypt post-war), ''Jungle Terror'' (covering Hassoldt Davis and his wife’s Amazon adventure), ''[[The Seeing Eye (film)|The Seeing Eye]]'' (covering the Morristown, New Jersey training of dogs for the handicapped),  ''Winter Paradise'' (John Jay’s ski adventure down the Austrian slopes), ''Thar She Blows!'' (aboard a whaling ship) and some well-liked scenic tours of Europe filmed by [[André de la Varre]]. [[Edgar Bergen]] appeared in a comic-travelogue ''Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd in Sweden''; its director [[Larry Lansburgh]] supplied a number of outdoor and animal interest documentary shorts for both Warner Bros. and [[Walt Disney]] in the fifties including some Oscar winners.

The later documentaries also benefited greatly from energetic narration (i.e. [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] also voiced popular radio shows and animated cartoons of the period) and orchestra scores that only a major film studio could provide. Not surprisingly, they continued to do well annually at awards time, with Warner Brothers eventually surpassing [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in the number of short subject [[Academy Awards]] and nominations. Making the [[Motion Picture Herald]] lists of top ten money making shorts in 1944-45,<ref>''1965 International Motion Picture Almanac''. 1964. Quigley Publishing Company. pp. 86-88A</ref> the best titles enjoyed a second life as reissues in theaters along with Warner’s newer features and shorts, from the mid-‘40s through 1967.

A full list is provided below, arranged by the year of release (but not necessarily the year filmed). Sometimes a date reviewed by [[Film Daily]] or a copyright date is listed.<ref>''Motion Pictures 1912-1939 Catalog of Copyright Entries''. 1951. Library of Congress</ref> All run 16-22 minutes unless otherwise noted. Since [[Howard Jackson (composer)|Howard Jackson]] handled the majority of music scores after 1934, only the [[William Lava]] solo efforts are indicated.<ref>McCarty, Clifford. ''Film Composers in America: A Filmography, 1911-1970''. 2000. Oxford University Press</ref> [[Gordon Hollingshead]] produced many titles from ''Moroccan Nights'' through ''Thar She Blows''. [[Cedric Francis]] took over a key producer in charge after Hollingshead’s passing in 1952.
