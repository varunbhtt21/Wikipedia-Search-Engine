== Function ==

This gene encodes a protein with a conserved domain, referred to as the TBC domain, characteristic of proteins which interact with [[GTPase]]s. TBC domain proteins may serve as GTPase-activating proteins for a particular group of GTPases, the [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab]] (Ras-related proteins in brain) small GTPases which are involved in the regulation of [[membrane trafficking]]. Mutations in this gene are associated with [[Infantile myoclonic encephalopathy|familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy]]. [[Alternative splicing]] results in multiple transcript variants.
