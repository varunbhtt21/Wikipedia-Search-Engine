Other evidence included straw and packaging foam, as well as a bedspread that was waterlogged with fragments of a newspaper that had been used to wrap parts of the body.

The medical examiner noted that a set of numbers had been written on the victim's body. The ink, believed to have been from a pen, was on the left hand of the victim, indicating that she was right-handed if she had indeed written it herself. The writing consisted of the letters '''WSR''' and the number '''4''' or '''5''', followed by '''4''' or '''7'''.<ref name=images/>
