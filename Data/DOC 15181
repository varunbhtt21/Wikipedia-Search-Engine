The '''Pumpelly Studio''' is the principal surviving house on the former summer estate of geologist [[Raphael Pumpelly]].  Located off Snow Hill Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]], the studio was designed by Walter Atherton and Pumpelly's daughter Margarita "Daisy" Pumpelly Smyth and built in 1912.  It was built adjacent to Pumpelly's summer house, a large [[Shingle style]] structure that was built in 1883 and burned in 1922.  The studio was built of steel and concrete, in part because it was intended to house Pumpelly's papers; these were lost when the main house burned.  Notable visitors to the Pumpelly estate included dancer [[Martha Graham]], who summered there in 1924.  The studio is a one-story stucco house with a red tiled roof.  It has [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] arched windows and porch details, and has historic and archaeological items embedded in its walls.  It is set high on the hill overlooking [[Dublin Pond]].<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004069}}|title=NRHP nomination for Pumpelly Studio|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>
