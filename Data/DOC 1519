==U.S. Navy career==
After working at sea as a civilian oceanographer on board a seismic survey vessel, he was commissioned through Navy Officer Candidate School in 1983, and assigned as a surface warfare officer to USS John L.

Due to global warming, the Arctic ice is melting and dispersing faster than previously anticipated. In response, the US Navy is examining an increased presence in polar areas. In 2012, White was designated to direct this research. His group are considering increased satellite coverage in high-latitude areas, modifying existing ship designs to safely operate in polar conditions, and budgetary projections to cover such operations.

White retired from active duty in the U.S. Navy on 31 October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio_ret.asp?bioID=545|title=Rear Admiral Jonathan W. White|website=U.S. Navy|accessdate=2017-09-16}}</ref>
