Title : 2-factor theorem
Text : In the [[mathematical]] [[discipline]] of [[graph theory]], '''2-factor theorem''' discovered by [[Julius Petersen]], is one of the earliest works in graph theory and can be stated as follows:

: '''2-factor theorem'''. Let ''G'' be a [[regular graph]] whose [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] is an even number, 2''k''. Then the edges of ''G'' can be partitioned into ''k'' edge-disjoint 2-factors.<ref>Lovász, László, and Plummer, M.D.. ''Matching Theory'', American Mathematical Soc., Jan 1, 2009. Print</ref>

Here, a 2-factor is a subgraph of ''G'' in which all vertices have degree two; that is, it is a collection of cycles that together touch each vertex exactly once.

==Proof==

In order to prove this generalized form of the theorem, Petersen first proved that a 4-regular graph can be [[Graph factorization|factorized]] into two 2-factors by taking alternate edges in a Eulerian trail. He noted that the same technique used for the 4-regular graph yields a factorization of a 2''k''-regular graph into two ''k''-factors.<ref>Mulder, H. "Julius Petersen’s theory of regular graphs".

To prove this theorem, it is sufficient to consider connected graphs. A connected graph with even degree has an Eulerian trail. Traversing this Eulerian trail generates an [[Orientation (graph theory)|orientation]] ''D'' of ''G'' such that every point has indegree and outdegree&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''. Next, replace every vertex ''v''&nbsp;ϵ&nbsp;''V''(''D'') by two vertices ''v’'' and ''v”'', and replace every directed edge ''uv'' of the oriented graph by an undirected edge from ''u’'' to ''v”''. Since ''D'' has in- and outdegree equal to ''k'' the resulting [[bipartite graph]] ''G’'' is ''k''-regular. The edges of ''G’'' can be partitioned into ''k'' perfect matchings by [[Kőnig's theorem (graph theory)#History|a theorem of Kőnig]]. Now merging ''v’'' with ''v”'' for every ''v'' recover the graph ''G'', and maps the ''k'' perfect matchings of ''G’'' onto ''k'' 2-factors of ''G'' which partition its edges.<sup>[1]</sup>

==History==
The theorem was discovered by [[Julius Petersen]], a Danish mathematician. It is in fact, one of the first results in [[graph theory]]. The theorem appears first in the 1891 article ''"Die Theorie der regulären graphs"''. To prove the theorem Petersen's fundamental idea was to 'colour' the edges of a trial or a path alternatingly red and blue, and then to use the edges of one or both colours for the construction of other paths or trials.<ref>Lützen, J.; Sabidussi, G. and Toft, B.
