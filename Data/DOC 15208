'''''Philiris bubalisatina''''' is a species of [[butterfly]] of the family [[Lycaenidae]]. It is found in [[Papua New Guinea]] ([[West Sepik]] and [[Western Highlands Province|Western Highlands]] provinces).

The length of the forewings is about 20&nbsp;mm. The ground colour of the forewings is black, with a large area of shining purple lilac extending from the base to near the end of the cell and the postmedian area. The underside is uniformly glossy pale buff cream, the apical area suffused with dark scales. The hindwings are shining purple blue and bluish white nearest to the costa.

==Etymology==
The species name is a combination of the Latin word ''bubalinus'' (referring to the colour [[Buff (colour)|buff]], reflecting the unusual pale yellowish-brown hue to the underside) and ''satina'' (referring to the [[satin]] lustre to the underside).<ref>[https://www.pensoft.net/inc/journals/download.php?fileId=8136&fileTable=J_GALLEYS Six new species of ''Philiris'' Röber, 1891 (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) from Papua New Guinea]</ref>
