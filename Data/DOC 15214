Title : Blue light station
Text : A '''Blue Light Station''' is a combined [[emergency telephone]] and [[kill switch|emergency power-off switch]] in [[rapid transit]] stations and other points along electrified railways. They are common in the United States.{{fact|date=December 2018}} The location of such a device is usually indicated by a blue light. Blue Light Stations provide a direct communication path to the rail system's [[operations control center]] and a switch to disconnect traction power from the power rail(s) or overhead [[overhead lines|catenary]] in case of emergency.

This emergency trip system (ETS) immediately shuts down the traction power supply in the adjacent track section, to protect people already on or about to enter the track from the dangers of electric current.

Requirements of Blue Light Stations are defined in the [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] standard 130, "Standard for Fixed Guideway Transit and Passenger Rail Systems".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/~/media/Files/Codes%20and%20standards/Glossary%20of%20terms/glossary_of_terms_2013.pdf|
