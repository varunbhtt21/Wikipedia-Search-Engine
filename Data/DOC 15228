'''''Once More 'Round the Sun'''''  is the sixth studio album from American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]  band [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]. The album was released on June 24, 2014, via [[Reprise Records]].<ref name="blabbermouth">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mastodon-high-road-audio-visualizer-clip-posted-online/|title=Mastodon: &#x27;Once More &#x27;Round The Sun&#x27; Cover Artwork, Track Listing Revealed - Blabbermouth.net|publisher=blabbermouth.net|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>  On April 17, 2014, Mastodon released the album's first single, titled "[[High Road (Mastodon song)|High Road]]".<ref name="blabbermouth2">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mastodon-new-song-high-road-available-for-streaming/|title=Mastodon: New Song &#x27;High Road&#x27; Available For Streaming - Blabbermouth.net|publisher=blabbermouth.net|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> On June 16, 2014 the album was made available for streaming on [[iTunes]]. The album sold around 34,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 6 on The Billboard 200 chart, making it the band's second consecutive top 10 debut after their previous album, ''The Hunter'', peaked at No.10 after opening with 39,000 copies in 2011.<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mastodons-once-more-round-the-sun-cracks-u-s-top-10/</ref>

==Background==
In late 2012, Mastodon guitarist [[Brent Hinds]] mentioned in an interview that he had begun writing material for the band's next release.<ref name="mtvhive">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvhive.com/2012/10/24/mastodon-new-album/|title=Brent Hinds Is Working on &#8220;Radioheadish,&#8221; &#8220;Spooky Sounding&#8221; Songs for Mastodon &#124; MTV Hive|publisher=mtvhive.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>
The band continued writing and demoing their sixth studio album throughout 2013, while touring for their 2011 release ''[[The Hunter (Mastodon album)|The Hunter]]''.<ref name="loudwire">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/mastodon-brann-dailor-new-album-2013-mayhem-festival-more/|title=Mastodon&#8217;s Brann Dailor Talks New Album Progress, 2013 Mayhem Festival + More|publisher=loudwire.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> The band began recording in late 2013 at Rock Falcon Studios in [[Franklin, Tennessee]], with producer [[Nick Raskulinecz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2014/02/mastodon-new-album-interview/|title=Mastodon Near Completion of 'Wild' Summer LP  &#124; SPIN &#124; Profiles &#124; In The Studio|publisher=spin.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref><ref name="pastemagazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/04/mastodons-troy-sanders-talks-new-album-once-more-r.html|title=Mastodon&#39;s Troy Sanders Talks New Album Once More &#39;Round the Sun :: Music :: News :: Paste|publisher=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

==Musical style==
[[Troy Sanders]] has stated in an interview that the album is a continuation, where the band left off with their previous album (''[[The Hunter (Mastodon album)|The Hunter]]'').<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/mastodon_new_material_picks_up_where_the_hunter_left_off.html |title=Mastodon: 'New Material Picks Up Where 'The Hunter' Left Off' &#124; Music News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref>

[[Bill Kelliher]] stated also about the album's musical style: "We're always trying to surprise ourselves and write something that's new and fresh. It's definitely got the elements of ''The Hunter'' in there, but also [of] ''[[Remission (Mastodon album)|Remission]]'' and some heavier stuff. There's a lot of different influences, from [[Alice in Chains]] to [[Deftones]]. There's a lot of [[rock music|rock]] going on."<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/mastodon_guitarist_on_the_new_record_theres_a_lot_of_rock_going_on.html |title=Mastodon Guitarist on the New Record: 'There's a Lot of Rock Going On' &#124; Music News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref>

[[Brann Dailor]] stated following about the album: "It's gonna be massive and insane, lots of epic greatness. There will be lots of huge riffs and new directions. It's real weird, real [[math rock|math-y]], real straightforward. It's up, down and all around."<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/entertainment/mastodon_announce_weird_mathy_stevie_wonder-inspired_album_confirm_nick_raskulinecz_as_producer.html |title=Mastodon Announce 'Weird, Mathy,' Stevie Wonder-Inspired Album, Confirm Nick Raskulinecz as Producer &#124; Music News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref>

Kelliher also stated that the album's theme might be "[[death]]". He stated the following: "It always makes for really good story telling. It's kind of the theme that we have a lot in our music. We've had a lot of friends pass away since the last record. I'm not really sure yet. I think we're kind of focusing more about living on this earth and what would happen if this was your last year to live. I think that's sort of maybe a little bit of what we might be kind of touching on."<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/mastodon_guitarist_on_new_album_death_is_always_a_good_theme.html |title=Mastodon Guitarist on New Album: 'Death Is Always a Good Theme' &#124; Music News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref>

==Artwork==
Oakland-based artist Skinner, who characterizes his work as "psychedelic nightmare paintings," created the album's artwork. Prior to its release, bassist and vocalist Troy Sanders stated: "It's going to be a work of art for sure. It's going to be very eye-opening. Very striking. It's from another dimension, and a lot of our music is geared toward that idea—taking you to another planet on songs. It's out there, and I think it's incredible."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Tyler |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/04/mastodons-troy-sanders-talks-new-album-once-more-r.html |title=Mastodon's Troy Sanders Talks New Album Once More 'Round the Sun :: Music :: News :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}</ref>

''Once More 'Round the Sun'' was well received by contemporary [[music journalism|music critics]] upon its initial release. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from [[music critic]]s, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 78, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", based on 28 reviews.<ref name=metacritic/>

In the review for [[AllMusic]], writer Thom Jurek wrote that "Once More 'Round the Sun furthers what Mastodon began on [[The Hunter (Mastodon album)|The Hunter]]: expanding their music past metal's rigid borders -- toward an integrative sound that doesn't leave metal out."<ref name=allmusic/> Michael Madden also praised the album in the review for ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'', claiming that "Mastodon are starting to look more like that band’s peers, not disciples. Nick Raskulinecz’s eternally crunchy production helps them reach those heights on Once More ‘Round the Sun, and, as Oakland artist Skinner’s cover suggests, the record is vibrant, too. There could be more structural risk-taking and the band could stand to have more grandiose moments, but, well, you know: Consider them six for six."<ref name=CoS/> Dom Lawson spoke highly of the album in his review for ''[[The Guardian]]'' writing that "Once More 'Round the Sun sounds very much like the album they need to make to edge a little further into the mainstream – it has a largely straightforward air and a tendency to favour the big hooks of 2011's The Hunter over the labyrinthine weirdness of 2009's [[Crack the Skye]]."<ref name=guardian/>

Giving the album and eight out on ten for ''[[PopMatters]]'', Dean Brown felt that "when compared to the band’s previous stratospheric evolutions, its substance may be just as important to the tale of Mastodon when the inevitable is written, hopefully decades into the future and many albums later from one of the best bands, regardless of genre, roaming the earth at present."<ref name=popmatters/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' writer Johnathan Zwickel shared similar sentiments, claiming that "While the rest of heavy music’s luminaries follow in their wake, Mastodon’s sound — and their ambition — is bigger than metal."<ref name=spin/>

Zoe Camp was more critical of the album in the review for ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', stating "it's possible to view Once More 'Round the Sun as a vow to honor their roots, even as they set out in search of broader horizons. So far, however, Mastodon’s paradigms simply don’t mesh the way they should. Evolution takes time, and Mastodon continue to publicly work out their growing pains as they determine which traits best represent the unified sound they’ve been chasing this decade."

===Accolades===
The album appeared on several album of the year lists published in 2014. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' ranked it as it's 28th best album of the year, it appeared on ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]'' magazine's end-of year list at #29 and on ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine's list at #35.<ref name="EoY">{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A5464.htm|title=Acclaimed Music - One More 'Round the Sun|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Loudwire]]'' list the album as number 5 on their list of the 20 Best Metal Albums of 2014<ref name="LoudwireAlbum">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/best-metal-albums-2014/|title=20 Best Metal Albums of 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref> and the song "Chimes at Midnight" at number 3 on their list of the 20 Best Metal Songs of 2014.<ref name="LoudwireSong">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/best-metal-songs-of-2014/|title=20 Best Metal Songs of 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref>
