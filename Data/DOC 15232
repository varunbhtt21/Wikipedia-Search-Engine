Title : Big V Comedies
Text : The '''Big V Comedies''' (also known as “Vitaphone Comedies”) were two-reel (17 to 20 minute long) comedy [[film short]]s produced by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Vitaphone]] between 1931 and 1938, contemporary of the more famous [[Hal Roach]], [[Mack Sennett]] and [[Columbia Pictures]] comedies. 

==Overview==

Most of these Warner short subjects were filmed at the Brooklyn, New York facilities, but a few 1935 titles handled by [[Ralph Staub]] were done in Hollywood, including the classic ''[[Keystone Hotel (film)|Keystone Hotel]]''. <ref>Maltin, Leonard. ''The Great Movie Shorts''. 1972. Bonanza Books, p. 25</ref> (This was a similar situation with the contemporary [[Educational Pictures]], which also made its film shorts in both New York and Hollywood during the same period.) [[Samuel Sax]] was often producer in charge.

Among the most famous of these were the very last films starring [[Fatty Arbuckle]], along with vintage screen appearances of [[Shemp Howard]] of [[Three Stooges]] fame and [[Bob Hope]] before his big break in features and radio. One mini-series, dubbed “Girlfriends Comedies” featured [[Thelma White]] and [[Fanny Watson]]. 

The production standards were usually first rate (since the same company made the popular [[Broadway Brevities]] and [[Melody Master (film series)|Melody Masters]]), but the success of an individual film depended on both the talent of the performers and the writers involved. Also many titles were filmed indoors with fewer outdoor action scenes than many California produced comedy shorts. 

The name “Big V” was used rather loosely in the trade periodicals, with later logos “Vitaphone Comedy” and “Vitaphone Gay-ety” (for the more musical product) alternating as substitute names in the later years. <ref>''1936 Film Daily Year Book of Motion Pictures''. 1936. Film Daily, p. 447 lists 19 “Big V Comedies”</ref> <ref>''BoxOffice'' magazine. December 5, 1936 (p. 38), January 8, 1938 (p.71) use “Vitaphone Comedy”</ref> Some titles were given alternative series names by [[Motion Picture Herald]] as “Big Star Comedies” or simply “2-reel comedies”. <ref>''Motion Picture Herald'' magazine, "Release Chart Lists" including issues December 26, 1931 (p. 73), April 23, 1932 (p. 88) & December 31, 1932 (p. 89)</ref>

The studio stopped making two-reel comedies in 1938, the same year that Hal Roach sold his [[Our Gang]] series to MGM and 20th Century Fox stopped distributing the Educational product. Apart from an occasional special, the [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Merrie Melodies]] supplied much of the comedy before the Warner feature attraction, until the [[Joe McDoakes]] series began in the 1940s.

==List of titles==

Below is a listing arranged by year of release with title listed first, followed by major credits, release date <ref>''BoxOffice'' magazine, including issues July 20, 1935 (p. 33), December 7, 1935 (p. 46)</ref> (and sometimes [[Film Daily]] review or copyright date <ref>[https://archive.org/details/Motionpict19121939librrich0010 ''Catalog of Copyright Entries: Cumulative Series. Motion Pictures 1912-1939''] (51,112 films), published in 1951. L.C. card, 51-60018.
