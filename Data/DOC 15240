'''IHG Army Hotels''' is a collection of private-sector hotels located on Army installations and Joint Bases throughout the U.S. 
It is the result of a partnership between [[InterContinental Hotels Group]] (IHG) and [[Lendlease Group|Lend Lease Group]]. This partnership was formed in response to the Privatization of Army Lodging (PAL) program by the [[United States Army]]. The Armyâ€™s request for qualifications (RFQ) sought to fulfill specific requirements that included improving the quality of on-post lodgings throughout the U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This RFQ sought entities with experience in the management of room inventory and hotel service, expertise in construction, and financing experience relating to the upgrades and renovations of existing on-post Army lodgings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Privatized Army Lodging|url=http://www.pal.army.mil/|publisher=U.S. Army|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>
U.S. Army awarded the PAL program to Lend Lease (US) with a 50-year lease deal, and IHG, with a 25-year management agreement with options to extend.<ref>{{cite news|title=IHG Upgrading Army Hotels Through PAL Program|url=http://www.lodgingmagazine.com/ihg-upgrading-army-hotels-through-pal-program/|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=Lodging Magazine|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref> As part of the RFP agreement, these hotels provide lodging to service members of all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, government and civilian contractors, military families, veterans, civilians and retirees.
There are 76 IHG-branded hotels with about 11,600 rooms located on Army bases in the U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kalinoski|first=Gail|title=Lend Lease, InterContinental Obtain $465M to Build Private Hotels on Army Bases|url=http://www.cpexecutive.com/property-types/hospitality/lend-lease-intercontinental-to-build-465m-private-hotels-on-army-bases/1004072145.html|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=Commercial Property Executive|date=May 3, 2013}}</ref>
