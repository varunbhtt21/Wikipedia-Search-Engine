The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, is a memorial to the more than 11,500 American [[prisoners of war]] who died in captivity aboard sixteen British [[prison ship]]s during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=nyt1995>Martin, Douglas.

Their remains were first gathered and interred in 1808. In 1867 landscape architects [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], designers of [[Central Park]] and [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], were engaged to prepare a new design for Washington Park as well as a new crypt for the remains of the prison ship martyrs.<ref name=parks>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/FortGreenePark/monuments/1222 "Fort Greene Park: Prison Ship Martyrs Monument: History"] on the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] website</ref> In 1873, after urban growth hemmed in that site near the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], the remains were moved and re-interred in a crypt beneath a small monument. Funds were raised for a larger monument, which was designed by noted architect [[Stanford White]]. Constructed of granite, its single Doric column {{convert|149|ft|m}} in height sits over the crypt at the top of a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide 33 step staircase. At the top of the column is an eight-ton bronze [[brazier]], a funeral urn, by sculptor [[Adolph Alexander Weinman|Adolf Weinman]]. President-elect [[William Howard Taft]] delivered the principal address when the monument was dedicated in 1908.

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=1501sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1501 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1501|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act would direct the [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]] in [[Fort Greene Park]] in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]] as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).<ref name="1501sum"/>

The bill would require the study to include: (1) an analysis of operational issues that should be considered if the Monument were to be designated as an [[List of the United States National Park System official units|NPS unit]]; (2) an analysis of the feasibility of administering the Monument, considering its size, configuration, and other factors including an annual cost estimate; (3) an analysis of the economic, educational, and other impacts of the designation of the Monument as an NPS unit; (4) an analysis of the effect of such designation on existing commercial and recreational activities, and on the authorization, construction, operation, maintenance, or improvement of energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the authority of state and local governments to manage those activities; and (5) an identification of any authorities, including condemnation, that will compel or permit the Secretary to influence or participate in local land use decisions (such as [[zoning]]) or place restrictions on non-federal lands if the Monument is designated as an NPS unit.<ref name="1501sum"/>

The bill would require, upon commencement of the study, owners of private property in or adjacent to the Monument to be notified of the study's commencement and scope.<ref name="1501sum"/>

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on March 13, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=cbo1501>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 1501|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45196|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

H.R. 1501 would require the [[National Park Service]] (NPS) to conduct a study of the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in New York City to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the monument as a unit of the National Park System. Based on information provided by the NPS and assuming the availability of appropriated funds, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that carrying out the study required by H.R. 1501 would cost about $150,000. Enacting H.R. 1501 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.<ref name="cbo1501"/>

H.R. 1501 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.<ref name="cbo1501"/>

==Procedural history==
The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 11, 2013 by [[Hakeem Jeffries|Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries (D, NY-8)]].<ref name=1501allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1501 – All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1501/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation]]. On April 1, 2014, the committee reported the bill (amended) alongside [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt392/CRPT-113hrpt392.pdf House Report 113-392].<ref name="1501allactions"/> The House voted on April 28, 2014 to pass the bill in a [[voice vote]]. The bill was received in the [[United States Senate]] on April 29, 2014 and referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]].<ref name="1501allactions"/>

==Debate and discussion==
The Department of the Interior supported the bill.<ref name="NPSmorningreport"/> The National Park Service said that "the monument commemorates the sacrifice over more than 11,000 patriots during the American Revolution."<ref name=NPSmorningreport>{{cite web|title=The Morning Report – March 17, 2014|url=http://www.nps.gov/morningreport/?date=03/17/2014&as_sfid=AAAAAAU2dk06b8ePwqb9UdA4e6UFnP1mf5DvWqoDz4PylwF3CGxB1JfKfhH5Vi18a84YxFLMFDrFLy0rpw/AEQZB/yLdnRBnTTzDeBuL64QmOHneRw%3D%3D&as_fid=CFBKo0nRU2DCXgiZPMH/|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

Rep. [[Yvette Clarke]], who co-sponsored the bill, argued that the bill was a good idea because "this monument commemorates not only the sacrifices of soldiers in the Revolutionary War who dedicated themselves to the cause of liberty, but a reminder than even in wartime we must protect basic human rights. These thousands of deaths were an atrocity that should never occur again."<ref name=ClarkePR>{{cite web|title=Congresswoman Clarke Urges Designation Prison Ship Martyrs Monument as a National Monument|url=http://clarke.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-clarke-urges-designation-prison-ship-martyrs-monument-as-a|publisher=Office of Yvette D.

Rep. Jeffries, who introduced the bill, said that "as one of America's largest revolutionary war burial sites and in tribute to the patriots that lost their lives fighting for our nation's independence, this monument deserves to be considered as a unit of the National Park Service."<ref name=JeffriesPR>{{cite web|title=Bill To Preserve Brooklyn's Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Passes The House Of Representatives|url=http://jeffries.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-jeffries-denounces-callous-republican-budget|publisher=Office of Congressman Hakeem Jeffries|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=29 April 2014}}</ref>
