*'''Delete''': I could not find any independent secondary sources that would be prominent enough to establish notability of this [[WP:PRODUCT|product]]. The closest one I could find was [http://www.embedded.com/electronics-products/electronic-product-reviews/debug-and-optimization/4212784/Cantata--6-0 review on embedded.com], which alone is not enough (unfortunately, given that article is well-written). — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.
