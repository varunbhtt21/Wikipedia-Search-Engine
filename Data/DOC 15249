The '''Saint-Denis Crystal''' or ''Cristal de Saint-Denis'' is a Caroligian [[engraved gem]] depicting the crucifixion of Christ, that was originally held in the treasury of the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] in France. During the [[French Revolution]] many pieces in the Abbey's treasure were either broken up and destroyed or sold - the Saint Denis Crystal eventually made its way to the [[British Museum]] in London, where it resides to this day.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=61985&partId=1&searchText=saint+denis+crystal&page=1 British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>

==Description==
The Saint-Denis Crystal is one of 20 or so engraved [[Engraved gem|intaglios]] of rock crystal to survive from the Middle Ages. On the flat surface of the crystal is engraved the [[crucifixion of Christ]], who is flanked by the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Baptist|Saint John]] who are holding clothes to their faces in expressions of grief. Above this scene are two images of the moon and the sun.

==History==
Estimated to date between 846 and 869 AD, the [[crystal]] was clearly made for an important client from the [[Carolingian]] court. For a long time, it was kept in the treasury of the Abbey of Saint-Denis, where almost all the [[monarchs of France]] are buried. Following the French Revolution the crystal was sold at auction in 1798 and, after going through various hands, was purchased by the British Museum in 1855.
