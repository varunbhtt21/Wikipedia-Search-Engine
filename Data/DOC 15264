* ... that in 2005 about 1.5 billion people lived in '''[[earth structure]]s''' ''(example pictured)''?
:* ''Reviewed'': [[List of All India Forward Bloc candidates in the Indian general election, 2014]] and [[Pancham Lal]]
:* ''Comment'': As of 26 April this was a DAB page wiith 69 chars readable, tagged for conversion to a [[WP:broad-concept article]]. I started by copy-pasting about 11,000 chars readable from sub-articles, then rewrote much of that and brought it up to the present 24,041 chars readable. It is at least 90% new material. It is a bit long but covers a huge subject. [[User:Aymatth2|Aymatth2]] ([[User talk:Aymatth2|talk]]) 14:17, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Aymatth2|Aymatth2]] ([[User talk:Aymatth2|talk]]). Self nominated at 14:17, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] This excellent article qualifies for DYK as a five-fold expansion and is new enough and long enough. The hook fact has an inline citation and I was able to verify that the year the source was published was 2005. The image is appropriately licensed and QPQ has been done.
