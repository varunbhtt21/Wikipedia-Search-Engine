No references and I think the topic is not notable enough; At some places it reads like advertisement. I think it also violates [[WP:NOTGUIDE]]. Now lets see what others think.

*'''Comment'''.  NOTGUIDE seems a little more specific than that.  It prohibits listing the best restaurants, phone numbers, hours of operation, etc.  There's no actual prohibition that I can see on listing landmarks.

*If this were renamed to [[:Category:Visitor attractions in Vijayawada|List of visitor attractions in Vijayawada]], would anyone have a problem with it? '''[[User:Postdlf|postdlf]]''' (''[[User talk:Postdlf|talk]]'') 02:13, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
** That seems like a good solution.  The current name does lead one to assume that it's a violation. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 03:53, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Keep''' I do not see something seriously wrong with it.[[User:Shyamsunder|Shyamsunder]] ([[User talk:Shyamsunder|talk]]) 12:02, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep/Rename''' per {{u|Postdlf}} - I see no reason why this shouldn't be renamed to [[List of visitor attractions in Vijayawada]], Much better than It being deleted.

*'''Keep/Rename''' :There is no promotional content, they are only the historic places and main landmarks in the city like the city of Hyderabad page which has the similar page for tourism, the city of vijayawada also should be having such page. In fact, change the name to '''List of tourist attractions in Vijayawada'''. --[[User:Vin09|Vin09]] ([[User talk:Vin09|talk]]) 07:36, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
