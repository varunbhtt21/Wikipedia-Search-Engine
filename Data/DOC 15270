'''Broadway Brevities''' are two-reel (17–21 minutes long) musical and dramatic [[film short]]s produced by [[Warner Bros.]] between 1931 and 1943. The series continued as '''Warner Specials''' in later years.

==Overview==

Other titles used for these black and white two-reel films included “Vitaphone Musicals”, “Broadway Headliners”, “Presentation Revue” (for a couple 1938 releases<ref>''BoxOffice'', November 19, 1938, “Shorts Chart” & May 6, 1939, p. 12</ref>) and “Blue Ribbon Comedy” for a trio featuring [[Elsa Maxwell]].<ref>''BoxOffice'', December 7, 1940, “Shorts Chart”, p.134</ref> Usually the trade periodicals grouped them as “Broadway Brevities” for easier marketing purposes.

Many of these glossy productions, a few winning [[Academy Awards]], featured dance spectaculars and mini-dramas with top [[Broadway theatre]] or Warner studio stars; famous names included [[Russ Columbo]], [[Ruth Etting]], [[Hal Le Roy]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Red Skelton]]. They were filmed at the [[Vitaphone]] studio in Brooklyn, New York until 1939, with [[Samuel Sax]] as a key producer. Production then moved to Burbank, California.

By the forties, an increasing number were of the [[documentary]] genre and the title “Broadway Brevity” was officially dropped in mid-1943 in favor of “Warner Special”. In 1948-1956, many were re-released to theaters under the heading “Classics of the Screen”.<ref>''BoxOffice'', March 25, 1944, “War Victory Shorts” chart</ref><ref>''BoxOffice'', Jan 5, 1946, “Shorts Chart” temporarily uses “Featurettes” instead of “Specials”</ref>
