:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/INS Sindhukirti (S61)|INS Sindhukirti (S61)]]
<small>Created by [[User:IgnacioR96|IgnacioR96]] ([[User talk:IgnacioR96|talk]]), [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] ([[User talk:The Bushranger|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] ([[User talk:The Bushranger|talk]]) at 22:17, 23 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] The article exceeds 1500 characters. It qualifies as new per it's creation date on 22 April 2014 relative to the time it was nominated here. The hook is cited in the fourth paragraph of the Career section. Spot checking for copyvios reveals no problems. A problem is that the Motorsports career results section is unsourced, and requires sources to [[WP:V|verify]] the content therein. Once this is performed, this appears that it would be good to go for dyk. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 07:37, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]]  Confirming that The Bushranger sourced the section in question. Based upon the rest of the review by Northamerica1000, I'm giving this the green tick.
