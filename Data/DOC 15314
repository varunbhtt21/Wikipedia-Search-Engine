:* I'm sorry, I just don't see how this is particularly interesting. "Picturesque old building is available to host weddings" ? So what? [[User:DragonflySixtyseven|DS]] ([[User talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk]]) 15:24, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:::* What is so interesting about that? --[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]]) ([[WP:Editor review/Jakec|my editor review]]) 22:59, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*Hmm. Perhaps if we combined them -- that it was a hospital during WWI but today hosts weddings? [[User:DragonflySixtyseven|DS]] ([[User talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk]]) 23:42, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::* '''Alt 2''': <s>... that '''[[Spring Hall, Halifax]]''' ''(pictured)'' served as a hospital during [[World War I]], but now hosts weddings? </s>--[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 07:43, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::* The idea behind the original hook was to draw attention to the disjunction between the gothic appearance of the outside (think US gothic horror movie cliché) and what actually goes on inside. --[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 06:21, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::*Yeah, but that implies that people would have that specific mentality about the architecture. I look at the picture and I just see "an old-style building". Alt 2 seems okay, I think - certainly it's a disjunct to have weddings in a hospital. [[User:DragonflySixtyseven|DS]] ([[User talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk]]) 12:29, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::* OK, fine by me. --[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 12:55, 13 May 2014 (UTC) 
::::::::* The article seems to meet requirements. <s>Both the links to Commons need to go at the bottom of the page, near '''See also''' or '''References''', rather than chopping into the continuity of the text</s>. 
::::::::*Re Hook, why don't you add the lot: "DYK that the  Neo-Gothic mansion ''[[Spring Hall, Halifax]]''' has been a boarding house, a ballet studio, a hospital and a registry office?"
