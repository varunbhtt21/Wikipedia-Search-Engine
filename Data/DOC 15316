He was Liberal candidate for the [[Clapham (UK Parliament constituency)|Clapham]] division of London at the 1929 General Election. Clapham was not a good prospect for the Liberals as it had been a Unionist seat since 1886. No Liberal candidate had stood at the previous general election. He polled a respectable third place vote;
