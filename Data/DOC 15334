Title : Melody Master
Text : The “Melody Masters” were a series of first-rate [[big band]] musical [[film short]]s produced by [[Warner Brothers]], under the supervision of [[Samuel Sax]] at their [[Vitaphone]] studio in New York between 1931 and 1939, and in Burbank, California with producer [[Gordon Hollingshead]] in charge between 1940 and 1946.

==Overview==

Among the most popular short subjects of their kind (making the [[Motion Picture Herald]] top money-making shorts lists in 1939 <ref>''1965 International Motion Picture Almanac''. 1964. Quigley Publishing Company. pp. 86-88A</ref>); these were an offshoot of the [[Vitaphone Varieties]]. Each ran from 9 to 11 minutes in length and was produced in black and white.

While rival studios like [[Universal Pictures]] focused mostly on the performance itself in their own “Name Band Musicals” shorts, Warner Bros. added more storyline material and visual experimentation. Early films often used a gimmick to frame the musical performances such as the roller skates used in ''Eddie Duchin & His Orchestra''. As the series progressed, the uses of multiple exposures (a great example being ''Symphony of Swing'' with [[Artie Shaw]]), optical effects, mirrors (i.e. ''Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra'') and stark shadow lighting (i.e. ''Henry Busse and His Orchestra'') made this series stand out against the competition.<ref>Maltin, Leonard. ''The Great Movie Shorts''. 1972. Bonanza Books, p. 25 & 213</ref>

[[Jean Negulesco]] was a key director on some of the best titles of the early 1940s before graduating to features. [[Life (magazine)]] photographer [[Gjon Mili]] contributed to the most frequently seen today title, ''[[Jammin' the Blues]]'', entered into the [[National Film Registry]] in 1995.

After the series’ official end in 1946, there were two follow-up series called “Memories from Melody Lane” and “Hit Parade of the Gay Nineties” that differed somewhat in style and narration, tracing the history of popular music since the 1890s.

==Current availability==

A group of them were released on laser disc (through MGM/UA) and Warner DVD, starting in the 1990s. In the latter format, they were mostly “extras” with various Warner features before the [[Warner Archive Collection]] produced a set titled ''Warner Bros. Big Band, Jazz & Swing Shorts'' in 2010.
