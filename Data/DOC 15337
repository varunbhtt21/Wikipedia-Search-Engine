'''''Dileptus margaritifer''''' is a species of [[ciliate]]s in the family ''[[Dileptidae]].'' It is common in freshwater streams, lakes and ponds, as well as mosses and soil.  The species has been found on every continent except Antarctica.<ref name=Vdacny>Vďačný, Peter, and Wilhelm Foissner. Monograph of the dileptids (Protista, Ciliophora, Rhynchostomatia).

Because of a taxonomic error by one researcher in the 19th century, specimens of ''Dileptus margaritifer'' have been misidentified in most studies as ''[[Dileptus anser]]'' (Müller, 1773).<ref name=Vdacny/>

==Morphology==

''Dileptus margaritifer'' has a slender body, usually about 450 [[micrometre|µm]] in length and very flexible, narrowing at the posterior into a small, sharp tail.  At its front, it has a broad and tapering [[proboscis]], reminiscent of an [[elephant]]'s trunk in its shape and flexibility, but with a flattened rather than round cross-section.  The proboscis is 1/3 to 1/2 of the total body length.  The cellular mouth ([[cytostome]]) sits at the base of the proboscis within a protuberance called the "oral bulge." The cell has a row of 4-20 [[contractile vacuole]]s along the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] surface, and at least 200 [[macronucleus|macronuclei]] scattered in the [[cytoplasm]], with several spherical [[micronucleus|micronuclei]] distributed among them.

==Feeding habits==
''Dileptus margaritifer'' feeds upon other unicellular organisms, using toxic [[extrusome]]s embedded in its proboscis to strike and stun its prey.  The tip of the proboscis sometimes adheres to other objects, and can become detached. Most of the proboscis may be lost in this way during a feeding period, but is quickly regenerated. Captured prey is ingested through an oral aperture ([[cytostome]]) at the base of the proboscis. In one study, it was found that ''Dileptus margaritifer'' fed almost exclusively in the early morning, between 4am and 9am.<ref>Stephen Miller (2007), ''The Predatory Behavior of Dileptus anser''.

==Reproduction==
Like most ciliates, ''Dileptus margaritifer'' reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], by transverse division of the cell ([[fission (biology)|fission]]). Division may be preceded by [[ciliate#Conjugation|conjugation]], a sexual phenomenon in which two ciliates of compatible mating types exchange genetic material by reciprocal transfer of haploid [[gametes]], derived by [[meiosis]] from each cell's [[micronuclei]]. The species is known to have three distinct mating types (sexes), conventionally designated I, II, and III. Individuals may cycle through several mating types in the course of their lives. However the final and (usually) stable type is genetically determined by a single genetic locus ''mat'' with three [[allele]]s, one for each type, with type I being dominant over type II, and II over III.<ref name=yudin>A.

==History and classification==

''Dileptus margaritifer'' has had a confusing [[nomenclature#Nomenclature, classification and identification|nomenclatural history]].  The species was originally described by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|C. G. Ehrenberg]], under the name ''Amphileptus margaritifer''.  Eight years later, [[Félix Dujardin]] created the new genus ''[[Dileptus]]'' and placed ''A. margaritifer'' within it.<ref>Dujardin, Félix, and Georges-Louis Leclerc Buffon. Histoire naturelle des zoophytes: infusoires, cómprenant la physiologie et la classification de ces animaux, et la manière de les étudier a l'aide du microscope. Librairie encyclopédique de Roret, 1841.</ref> In the same work, he misidentified a specimen of ''Dileptus margaritifer'', and published a description and illustration of it under the name ''Dileptus anser.'' The error was repeated by later taxonomists, including the influential [[Alfred Kahl]]. As a result, ''Dileptus margaritifer'' has been widely cultured and studied under the name ''Dileptus anser.''<ref name=Vdacny/>
