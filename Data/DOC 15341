The '''Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG)''' is an unrecognised [[labor union]] formed in 2012 by pilots working for the low cost Irish airline, [[Ryanair]].  The RPG consists solely (with the exception of the interim council) of pilots flying Ryanair aircraft and allows pilots to register via their online website.  More than 50% of pilots in Ryanair are registered and represented by the RPG in all categories (i.e. Rank and Contract Type).<ref name="bloomberg1">{{cite web|last=Lundgren |first=Kari |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-29/ryanair-pilot-group-calls-on-o-leary-to-discuss-work-conditions.html |title=Ryanair Pilot Group Calls on CEO to Discuss Work Conditions |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/1029/483268-ryanair-pilots/ |title=Ryanair Pilot Group calls for negotiations - RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

== Ryanair Recognition ==

In a landmark Irish Supreme Court case of Ryanair Limited v Labour Court & Impact in 2007, Mr Justice Geoghegan stated, that:

''“As a matter of law Ryanair is perfectly entitled not to deal with trade unions nor can a law be passed compelling them to do so. There is an obvious danger however in a non-unionised company that employees may be exploited and may have to submit to what most reasonable people would consider to be grossly unfair terms and conditions of employment.''<ref name=Dohrety2007>{{cite journal|last=Doherty|first=Michael|title=Union sundown?

{{As of|2013|October}}, Ryanair has not officially recognised the Ryanair Pilot Group. In an August 2013 interview, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary dismissed the group as a "joke" and claimed that the pilots group was an attempt by pilot unions from other airlines to unionise Ryanair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000190256 |title=Ryanair CEO: Ryanair Pilot Group is a joke - CNBC |publisher=Video.cnbc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> Following a comment from the Ryanair CEO [[Michael O'Leary (businessman)|Michael O'Leary]] in August 2013 in which he agreed to meet with the RPG if more than 1601 pilots were registered with them, an invitation to talk was sent by the RPG.<ref name="bloomberg1"/><ref name="autogenerated1"/>  In response, Ryanair released a short statement, stating that "We don’t comment on the activity or false claims of KLM or Aer Lingus pilots,” a reference to the five-member interim council of the Ryanair Pilot Group consisting of non-Ryanair pilots.<ref name=Keena>{{cite news|last=Keena|first=Colm|title=Ryanair Pilot Group plans to meet investors|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/transport-and-tourism/ryanair-pilot-group-plans-to-meet-investors-1.1577281|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=30 October 2013|quote=The indications yesterday were that Mr O’Leary was not going to respond positively to the request for a meeting.  “We don’t comment on the activity or false claims of KLM or Aer Lingus pilots,” the airline said in a short statement.
