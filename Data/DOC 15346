The '''Col. John A.S. Ashe House''' is a historic home in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] along Charleston's [[The Battery (Charleston)|Battery]].  Col. John A.S. Ashe, Jr. received the property upon which 26 South Battery is built upon his father's death in 1828 along with $10,000 for the construction of a house. Col. John A.S. Ashe, Jr.'s father had built the nearby [[Col. John Ashe House]] at 32 South Battery in the 1780s. 

The house he had built by 1853 was designed by Charleston architect [[Edward C. Jones]]. It is one of his only extant houses in the Italianate style that swept Charleston in the 1850s. The house features heavy detailing inside the house and an asymmetrical layout of rooms.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19750331&id=PvplAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p1ENAAAAIBAJ&pg=5527,6450176 | title=Italian Architecture Mania Typified At 26 South Battery | work=News & Courier | date=March 31, 1975 | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | author=Stockton, Robert P. | location=Charleston, South Carolina | pages=B1}}</ref>
