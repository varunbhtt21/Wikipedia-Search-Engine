Different types of railroad [[rolling stock]] have different couplers depending on the purpose and type of equipment being used and its intended destination. European rolling stock tend to use [[buffers and chain coupler]]s while American rolling stock uses a [[Janney coupler]] or "knuckle coupler". These are incompatible with each other, but where some railroads have obtained older, less expensive used rolling stock from different countries or regions, instead of having to standardize on one form of coupler, it may be useful to be able to use either type of coupler on a piece of rolling stock without having to remove anything.

It is possible to mount both buffers and chain and knuckle couplers on the same car, provided that one can swing out of the way. Alternatively, either a lug to hold the chain is cast in the body of the coupler or a chain is mounted on top of the coupler. This is also done with an [[SA3 coupler]] built by [[SAB WABCO]].<ref>[http://www.ba-bautzen.de/wirtschaftssenioren/amk/amkenglish/wabconeu_e.htm SAB WABCO C-AK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519233410/http://www.ba-bautzen.de/wirtschaftssenioren/amk/amkenglish/wabconeu_e.htm |date=2009-05-19 }}</ref>

Locomotives and some freight cars of the [[Indian Railways]] are fitted with a 'transition coupler' that incorporates a screw coupling within a [[Janney coupler|knuckle coupler]]: the knuckle coupler remains in position and does not swing away when not in use. The screw coupling is mounted on a [[hinge]] on the opposite side of the knuckle coupler. Most Indian freight cars use the knuckle coupler alone, without buffers, whereas passenger coaches almost exclusively use screw couplers and buffers. Exceptions are the new LHB coaches imported from Europe, and a few other makes of carriages converted to use [[Tightlock coupling|knuckle couplers]].<ref>[http://irfca.org/faq/faq-stock2.html Coupler conversion]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/~mrinal/alstomcoaches.html |title=Centre Buffer Coupler of AAR type |access-date=2014-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221103601/http://irfca.org/~mrinal/alstomcoaches.html |archive-date=2014-02-21 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>

Some Russian locomotives and wagons have buffers together with the central coupler. When coupling to Finnish equipment, a short chain with a block that fits in the [[SA3 coupler|central coupler]] is placed on the Russian side, backing up and compressing the buffers so that the chain can be laid on the hook. (That is also the common way of coupling locomotives to or from wagons, faster than unscrewing the link.)

British locomotive-hauled passenger carriages adopted a dual coupling system in the 1950s. They have retractable buffers and a central Buckeye automatic [[Janney coupler#AAR coupler|knuckle coupler]] that lowers to reveal a hook for a screw-type chain coupling. When in use, a pin through the buckeye shank rests in the conventional hook. No chain is provided on dual-coupled vehicles, since the chain on the other vehicle can be used when the knuckle coupler is out of the way (down). Inter-stock coupling was with the automatic coupler (with the buffers retracted), while connection to the locomotive was with the buffer-and-chain system with a screw coupler. Today this dual coupling system has been adopted for all loco-hauled passenger trains in Great Britain to allow faster shunting operations.

The gap in the knuckle accommodates the link of a [[Railway coupling#Link and pin|link and pin coupler]] or a [[Railway coupling#Johnston coupler|Johnston coupler]] and the vertical hole in the knuckle accommodates the pin of these couplers. The gap could also have accommodated the [[chain]] of a [[Buffers and chain coupler]] and the pin would have been an extra, but this was probably never done anywhere.
