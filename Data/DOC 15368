'''Erodr''' (stylized '''erodr''') is a college student-focused, online [[social networking service]]. It is available for iOS and Android. Erodr is a place where students can express themselves and get genuine feedback from each other.

== History ==

The first prototypes were created in August 2012 by founder Drew Halliday while he was a student at the [[University of Missouri]], and the app was launched on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] in November of the same year.<ref name="Daily Dot 2014">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/erodr-the-next-facebook/|title=Why an app you've never heard of could be the next Facebook|last=Knibbs|first=Kate|date=20 March 2014|newspaper=The Daily Dot|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="October 2013">{{cite news|url=http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2013/10/social-media-app-erodr-establishes-itself-at-mizzou-expands-to-15-schools|title=Social media app erodr establishes itself at Mizzou, expands to 15 schools|date=21 October 2013|newspaper=Silicon Prairie News|accessdate=29 April 2014|author=Unknown}}</ref> Drew got the idea when he was sitting in class watching students around him checking social media, surprisingly being not invested in the social opportunities available nearby. He thought that all the students inside of the classroom are inherently interested in each other, but there was no easy way for them to connect with each other.

The solution became erodr, a social media app that limits the viewable range and lifetime of posts. Drew and his father Andy launched the first prototype in August 2012. In November 2012 the app launched on the Apple App Store, and by January 2013 the app was gaining popularity rapidly.

By October 2013, erodr was open to users at 15 colleges. At the University of Missouri, where it had gained its biggest following, the app had 8,700 active users and 1 million app refreshes a week.<ref name="October 2013" /> The company has not begun [[Monetization|monetizing]] the service.<ref name="Daily Dot 2014" /><ref name="October 2013" />

In 2015, [http://mlsdev.com/en/ MLSDev Inc.] became a partner of erodr Inc.

A major update of erodr, developed by MLSDev, was launched in October 2016, introducing a complete redesign of the app and functional improvement.

As of February 2017, erodr is open to users at 1550 colleges. The most active erodr community is that of the University of Missouri.

== Features ==
Account creation is restricted to those with validated [[email addresses]], and users can only log in from the erodr [[mobile app]]. Users can set up a profile and view posts by others in a feed from a selected geo range, with filters such as only posts made by one gender.<ref name="October 2013" /> Profiles are not publicly searchable.<ref name="Daily Dot 2014" />

Posts made to erodr are [[Ephemerality|ephemeral]], the length of time a post stays live on the stream depends on how many likes or dislikes it receives. A post without likes stays up only for several hours, or minutes if it is disliked or flagged by community users. Highly liked posts can be live for many days. Posts can also be made anonymously, and as an additional privacy feature, the poster can limit visibility of the post to users within a certain distance.<ref name="October 2013" /><ref name="Vox, first">{{cite news|url=http://archive.voxmagazine.com/stories/2013/03/14/conversation-drew-halliday/|title=A conversation with: Drew Halliday|date=14 March 2013|publisher=Vox Magazine|quote=As you can limit the audience on any post, you can also limit it in time and range. For example, you can create a post that lasts 30 minutes and is only visible to people within 100 yards (of you). How private is that?|last1=Cole|first1=Claire|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref>

Within a user personal profile (which is only accessible from a public post by that user, or from a private comment by that user on someone else's post) there is a profile photo gallery and optionally a validation of the user's school attended.  Users can make anonymous posts to the community, which collect private comments from other users, those private comments reveal the commenting user's profile to the anonymous poster. This allows more honest expression than fully attributed posts, and provides a safer context for comments and responses that are important feedback to the anonymous poster.

Founder Drew Halliday says all content is deleted from the servers when the post lifetime expires.<ref name="October 2013" />

Users who post, like or comment, can be seen by other users, but if they don’t make a post with their profile, that profile is not visible or searchable by others. Originally however, despite claims of anonyminity, privacy was a strong issue with Erodr.

== Community and culture ==

Users of Erodr are called "rodies."<ref name="Daily Dot 2014" />

The erodr team has chosen to concentrate on piloting the app at a small number of colleges through [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word of mouth]], while continuing to develop the app. This has led to smaller scale adoption than other social networks, but gaining a [[cult following]] at some schools.<ref name="Daily Dot 2014" />

On erodr, users post all kinds of content, but the prevailing number of posts can be classified as real-time observations, posts asking and giving advice, thoughts on relationships, group support, school life, sports and pets.

Rodies often get together in real life for various activities. In November 2016, official [https://www.facebook.com/erodrapp erodr Facebook page] posted an update saying that the first couple who met each other on erodr got married. This event was greatly supported by the erodr community.

== Reception ==
An article in ''The DePauw'', the student newspaper of [[DePauw University]], criticized the app for encouraging lewd behavior on campus saying, "The app, in theory, is really interesting. The concept of creating a social network just for the University to share is really cool. But the way it’s being used — and the way erodr is encouraging it be used — is distasteful."<ref name="DePauw criticism">{{cite news|last=Green|first=Emily|title=Erodr glorifies campus party life|url=http://www.thedepauw.com/opinion/erodr-glorifies-campus-party-life-1.3053965#.U1_K7vldV8F|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The DePauw|date=30 August 2013}}</ref>

== Revenue models ==
