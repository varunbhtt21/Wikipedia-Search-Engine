*'''Redirect''' to [[Kadhalan (soundtrack)]], which contains much of the same content already. I'm unable to find coverage in reliable sources for this song to meet [[WP:NSONGS]] or warrant a standalone article. <small><span style="border:1px solid">[[User:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:black">&nbsp;Gongshow&nbsp;</span>''']]</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color:black">[[User_talk:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:#ffffff">talk</span>''']]</span></small> 01:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[Kadhalan (soundtrack)]], the article doesn't seems to have enough sources to be an independent one.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 03:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
