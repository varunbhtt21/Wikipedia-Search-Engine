The '''Boroboroton''' ({{lang-ja|暮露暮露団}} [[Help:IPA for Japanese|[bo̞ɺo̞bo̞ɺo̞to̞ɴ]]]; meaning "tattered [[futon]]") is a [[tsukumogami]] [[yōkai]], and is believed to be evil and dangerous to humans.

== Description ==
The Boroboroton is described as a tattered futon (a Japanese nap mat) who comes to life at night. It rises up into the air and throws its (former) owner out of bed, then begins to twine around the head and neck of the sleeper with the intent of strangling him.<ref name=KMM>Kenji Murakami: 妖怪事典.

== Background ==
The Boroboroton belongs to a specific group of yōkai: the ''Tsukumogami'' (jap. 付喪神; lit. "artifact spirit"). Tsukugami are various yōkai derived from manmade objects, such as kitchenware, tools and everyday accessories, that have become alive, either through possession by spirits or ghosts, or through constant use for at least 90 to 100 years.  Tsukumogami of this last origin often appear as new, or otherwise pristine condition despite their age.<ref>Michaela Haustein: ''Mythologien der Welt: Japan, Ainu, Korea.'' ePubli, Berlin 2011, {{ISBN|3844214070}}, p. 25.</ref> Boroboroton will come to life when feeling ignored or needless. As some kind of revenge (and out of frustration), they float through the rooms of inhabited houses at night and try to strangle any sleeping person they can find. Alternatively, they meet with other Tsukumogami and throw noisy parties or they leave the house and stroll around in search of other companion beings.<ref name=KMM/><ref name=STM/><ref name=TAS/>
