Title : Big Time Vaudeville
Text : '''Big Time Vaudeville''' was a series of black-and-white 9- to 10-minute [[short film]]s resembling the [[Vitaphone Varieties]] and also produced by [[Warner Brothers]] and [[Vitaphone]] (at the Brooklyn studios in New York). These consisted of four to six [[vaudeville]] acts and are historically interesting with many performers rarely seen on film.

==Overview==

In 1934, Warner Bros. released four [[Vitaphone Varieties#Pepper Pots .281931-1936.29|Pepper Pots]] titled “Vaudeville Reel” that featured several acrobatic acts, dancers, singers and comedians appearing on a stage, much like a vaudeville show. Their success prompted the studio to fashion a new series using the same set-up.

Since few of the performers appearing in these became household names, they were seldom reissued after their initial run and were rarely seen on television. The more familiar performers also appeared in other Vitaphone-Warner shorts, including the eccentric Chaz Chase, [[Eddie Peabody]] and a pre-radio [[Edgar Bergen]]. The latter starred in the most frequently shown today title, ''Bring on the Girls'', with both he and “dummy” Charlie McCarthy commenting on the different acts.
