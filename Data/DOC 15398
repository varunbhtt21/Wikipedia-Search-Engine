Title : The Naggers
Text : '''The Naggers''' was a series of 18 film [[short film]]s produced by [[Warner Brothers]] at the [[Vitaphone]] studio in Brooklyn, New York. These featured [[Jack Norworth]] and Dorothy Adelphi as an arguing husband and wife in a variety of domestic settings. This basic premise predated the popular radio series [[The Bickersons]] and many future TV marital comedies. 

==Overview==

Often listed in the trade magazines as either part of the [[Vitaphone Varieties]] or “Pepper Pots”, these black and white comedies averaged 7 to 10 minutes in length. 

Jack Norworth was a songwriter and ex-husband of the famous [[Nora Bayes]], both subjects of a later Warner feature, ''[[Shine On, Harvest Moon (1944 film)|Shine On, Harvest Moon]]'' (1944).<ref>Liebman, Roy. Liebman. ''Vitaphone Films – A Catalogue of the Features and Shorts''. 2003. McFarland & Company. p. 376</ref> He teamed with his then-wife Dorothy Adelphi in a pilot film, ''Odds and Ends'', released in May 1929 as part of the Vitaphone Varieties. Norworth also had appeared in a few other films for Warner-Vitaphone, starting with 1928’s ''Songs and Things''.

The little Nagger comedies were played before the main features in 1930-1932, along with the latest [[Looney Tune]] or other accompanying Vitaphone short subject, and were generally well received by the critics (writing in ''[[Film Daily]]'' and other periodicals). Today, much of the humor may seem a bit milder to viewers. A few have been shown on [[Turner Classic Movies]].
