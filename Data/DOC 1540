This is an article that was deleted and then restored and userfied on 14 July 2013. Since then, it has never been edited, and the editor in whose userspace the page exists has not edited Wikipedia at all since 9 September 2013. It clearly falls under the provisions of [[WP:STALEDRAFT]]. The page is also redundant, as the article has in the meanwhile been re-created, at [[Laravel (framework)]]. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 11:58, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
