The '''Wran ministry (1978–80)''' or '''Second Wran ministry''' was the 72nd ministry of the [[New South Wales Government]], and was led by the 35th [[Premier of New South Wales]], the Honourable [[Neville Wran]], {{post-nominals|AUS|QC|MP}}, representing the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]].

==Background==

{{Empty section|date=May 2014}}

==Tenure of ministry==
The ministry covers the period from 19 October 1978 when the Wran&ndash;led Labor Party was re-elected at the [[1978 New South Wales state election|1978 election]], until 29 February 1980, when Wran reconfigured his ministry and the [[Wran ministry (1980–1981)|Third Wran ministry]] was formed.

==Composition of ministry==
The composition of the ministry was announced by Premier Wran and sworn in on 19 October 1978, and covers the period up until 29 February 1980. One month earlier, former Premier and minister, [[Jack Renshaw]], announced his decision to retire from politics, necessitating a minor rearrangement of the ministry; pending the swearing in of the Third Wran ministry. Ministers are listed in order of seniority and in all cases except Renshaw, serve the full term of this ministry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/Archives_MemberPage |title=Former Members - Chronological List of Ministries 1856 to 2009 (requires download) |work=Project for the Sesquicentenary of Responsible Government in NSW  |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |format=[[Microsoft Excel|MS Excel spreadsheet]] |accessdate=26 April 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Wah |first=Malvyne Jong |author2=Page, Jeffrey E. |date=November 2007 |title=New South Wales Parliamentary Record 1824 &ndash; 2007 |volume=VI |pages=[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/cbe381f08171c2e8ca256fca007d6044/660e50b1b26c72acca257cc3007fd15b/$FILE/Part%206.pdf#page=46 46] |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/cbe381f08171c2e8ca256fca007d6044/660e50b1b26c72acca257cc3007fd15b/$FILE/Part%206.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=26 April 2014 }}</ref>
