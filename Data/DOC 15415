Title : Vitaphone Pictorial Revue
Text : '''Vitaphone Pictorial Revue''' (sometimes spelled “Review”) was a series of 9-11 minute [[newsreel]] oriented ([[documentary]]) [[film short]]s produced by [[Vitaphone]] and [[Warner Brothers]]. 

==Overview==

Mostly edited in New York at the Vitaphone studio, but a few also made in California with [[Gordon Hollingshead]] producing, these were human-interest newsreels that resembled such rival series like “Pathé Audio Review”, distributed by [[RKO Pictures]], and [[Paramount Pictures]] “Paramount Pictorial”. Each film is divided into three or four separate segments. In a couple, a segment was presented in [[Cinecolor]].

The series lasted just two years in the 1930s and was mostly forgotten until [[Turner Classic Movies]] started showing a few as filler between feature presentations, sometimes with the color segments missing.
