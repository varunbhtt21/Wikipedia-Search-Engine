In 2008, there were 21,989 employees of the NPS who oversaw {{National Park Units}} [[List of the United States National Park System official units|units]], of which 59 are designated [[List of National Parks of the United States|national parks]].<ref>Budget Justifications and Performance Information, Fiscal Year 2008, National Park Service</ref> National parks must be established by an act of the [[United States Congress]]. The first national park, [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], was signed into law by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1872, followed by [[Mackinac National Park]] in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] in 1890. Criteria for the selection of National Parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (though these criteria are not always considered together). National Monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance.
