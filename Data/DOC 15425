==Early life==

In 1944 he began an [[apprentice]]ship as a mechanic, and after the end of the Second World War he was trained as chef.<ref name=deutsche-biographie.de/>

==Career==
In 1947, Scholz attended a boxing school in Berlin.<ref name=von/> On 8 October 1948, he was a last-minute replacement for a professional match against Werner Eichler, though he had not previously competed as an amateur, and he won the fight.<ref name=archive/><ref name=cnnsi>{{cite web|last=Mulliken|first=John|title=The Bubi of Berlin|url=http://www.cnnsi.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1002984/index.htm|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=20 October 1958}}</ref><ref name=von/> Eicher was injured so badly that he had to postpone his wedding which was scheduled to be held the next day.<ref name=muller>{{cite web|last=Müller|first=Von Felix|title=Sportler-Tragödien : Auch Bubi Scholz erschoss seine Frau durch die Tür - Nachrichten Geschichte - DIE WELT|trans-title=Athlete tragedies: Even Bubi Scholz shot his wife through the door|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article114163258/Auch-Bubi-Scholz-erschoss-seine-Frau-durch-die-Tuer.html|work=Die Welt|accessdate=14 May 2014|location=Germany|language=German|date=6 March 2013}}</ref> Scholz logged his first defeat on 10 March 1958 against Charles Humez.<ref name=boxrec/>

On 19 May 1951, Scholz won a points victory against defending champion Walter Schneider and became the German champion in the welterweight category for the first time.<ref name=archive/><ref name=von/> He defended his title successfully against Charles Oechsle and Leo Starosch in 1952.<ref name=archive/> At the end of 1952, Scholz put his championship title in the welterweight division and stepped down from the middleweight category. In 1954 he appeared in [[Madison Square Garden]] in his first U.S. match, defeating American boxer [[Al Andrews]].<ref name=cnnsi/> In 1955 he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]],<ref name=cnnsi/> which forced him to take a one and a half year sabbatical.

After recovering from his illness, he won a knockout match against defending champion [[Peter Müller (boxer)|Peter Müller]] in a 29 June 1957 German middleweight championship.<ref name=cnnsi/><ref name=von/> He defended the title with another knockout victory in May 1958 against Max Resch. On 4 October 1958, he defeated Charles Humez<ref name=von/><ref name=tagesspiegel/> in Berlin's [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] by technical knockout in the 12th round, and thus won the European Championship in the middleweight division. Humez announced his retirement on 18 January 1989.<ref name=boxrec>{{cite web|title=Gustav Scholz - Boxer|url=http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=28407&cat=boxer|publisher=boxrec.com|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> Scholz successfully defended both titles against Hans Werner Wohlers (by point victory in July 1959) and against Peter Müller<ref name=tagesspiegel/> (by technical knockout in the first round in November 1959). He successfully defended his European title against Andre Drille in December 1959. In the same year, he published the book ''Ring Free'' with memories of the beginnings of his career.

In 1961 Scholz put down his two middleweight title and moved to the light heavyweight division. In this class, he lost a fight against [[Harold Johnson (boxer)|Harold Johnson]] for the championship on 23 June 1962,<ref name=archive/><ref name=tagesspiegel>{{cite web|title=Bubi Scholz ist tot: Eine Nation lag ihm zu Füßen |trans-title=Bubi Scholz is Dead: A nation lay at his feet|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/bubi-scholz-ist-tot-eine-nation-lag-ihm-zu-fuessen/160812.html|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=German|date=21 August 2000}}</ref> but on 4 April 1964, he won the European light heavyweight championship against defending champion [[Giulio Rinaldi]].<ref name=von>{{cite web|last=Ehrenberg|first=Von Peter|title=Siege, Tränen, Tod: Die Tragödie des Bubi Scholz |trans-title=Victory, Tears, Death: The Tragedy of Bubi Scholz|language=German|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article529563/Siege-Traenen-Tod-Die-Tragoedie-des-Bubi-Scholz.html|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=tagesspiegel/> After that, Scholz finished his boxing career.

Between 1948 and 1964 Scholz had a total of 96 fights, of which he won 88, including 46 by knockout; only two times he lost,<ref name=von/> both on points. His success as a boxer earned him great popularity in Germany, especially in the 1950s and 1960s when he was compared to [[Max Schmeling]], the most prominent boxing star of Germany.<ref name=muller/>

His success in boxing brought him a short-lived career in the entertainment industry. He appeared in 1960 as Boxer Breitenbach in the television production ''The Champion Boxer''. That same year, he played the role of Ralf Moebius in Paul Martin's musical comedy ''Marina''. In the ''Music Film Hit Parade 1961'' by Franz Marischka, he was known as Ralf Hegener.

Following his career as a professional boxer, Scholz opened the advertising agency Zühlke and Scholz in Berlin, trying to build on his popularity as an athlete. In 1971 he was seen in a supporting role as a police officer in Thomas Engel's teleplay ''Lucky''. In 1977 he made a guest appearance as a boxing coach in the 20th episode of the TV comedy series ''Odds and Ends''. In 1980 he published his autobiography, ''The Way Out of Nowhere'',<ref name=archive/> but received negative publicity in those years due to his drinking habits.<ref name=von/>
