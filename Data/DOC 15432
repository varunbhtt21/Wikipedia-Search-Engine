Title : Warner Featurettes
Text : '''Warner Featurettes'''<ref name=USC-WB-shorts> {{cite web |url= https://warnerbrosarchives.wordpress.com/home/about/wb-filmography/short-subjects/ |publisher= USC School of Cinematic Arts |work= Warner Brothers Archive |title= Filmography Short Subjects }} </ref> were an imprint for [[featurette]]s released by [[Warner Brothers]]. 

A featurette is a [[motion picture]] with a running time between a half hour and 50 minutes in length, too short to be labeled a [[feature film|feature]] and often considered too long to be labelled a [[film short]].

Warner Brothers released several of these between 1953 and 1964. Although the trade periodicals like [[Film Daily]] and [[BoxOffice (magazine)]] occasionally listed the two-reel “Warner Specials” (actually [[Technicolor Specials (Warner Bros. series)|Technicolor Specials]] and [[Broadway Brevities]]) as “featurettes”, the term usually applied to Warner shorts lasting a full half hour or longer.

==Overview==

A decade earlier, the studio cut down a [[Technicolor]] [[documentary]], ''Pledge to Bataan'', initially shown at 54 minutes in 1943, and released it as a 20 minute [[Technicolor Specials (Warner Bros. series)|Technicolor Special]] on February 3, 1945.<ref>''BoxOffice'', July 21, 1945, p.7</ref> At the time, theater exhibitors preferred receiving their short films packaged by series.

By the 1950s, however, the success of [[Walt Disney]] and others with such series as the [[True-Life Adventures]] made the “extra length” short subject fashionable as a double bill presentation. The terms varied according to references, with a longer than usual ''Deep Adventure'' occasionally labeled a feature.<ref>Blume, Daniel. ''Screen World Vol. 9'', 1958. Biblo & Tannen Publishers, p.166</ref>

Two titles hosted by [[Jack Webb]] of [[Dragnet (series)]] fame, ''24 Hour Alert'' and ''The John Glenn Story'', were [[Academy Award]] nominees.

Also between 1958 and 1961, Warner Brothers produced four of [[The Bell Laboratory Science Series]] for television, but utilizing longtime short film director/writer Owen Crump.
