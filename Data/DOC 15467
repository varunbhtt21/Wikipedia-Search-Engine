'''''Pseudomonilicaryon anser''''' is a species of [[unicellular]] [[ciliate]]s in the family [[Dileptidae]], also known under the names ''Dileptus anser'' and ''Dileptus cygnus''.  The species is common in fresh water ponds, stagnant pools, mosses and soils.

For nearly a century and a half, the species was classified in the genus ''[[Dileptus]]''.  In 2012, following a comprehensive review of the dileptid group, it was moved to the genus ''Pseudomonilicaryon'', which is distinguished from ''Dileptus'' by the shape of its [[macronucleus]].  The macronucleus of ''Pseudomonilicaryon'' is arranged like a string of beads, whereas that of ''Dileptus'' is composed of small nodules scattered throughout the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell.<ref name=Vdacny>Vďačný, Peter, and Wilhelm Foissner.

==History and classification==

''Pseudomonilicaryon anser'' has had a long and confusing history, complicated by a series of name changes and misidentifications. The species was first described and illustrated by [[Otto Friedrich Muller|Otto Müller]] in 1773, under the name ''Vibrio anser'', and redescribed by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]] in 1838, as ''Amphileptus anser''. In 1841, [[Félix Dujardin]] moved the species to the new genus ''[[Dileptus]]''. However, Dujardin's ''Dileptus anser'' was actually a misidentified specimen of ''Dileptus margaritifer (Ehrenberg, 1834''), a dileptid of similar size with a shorter [[proboscis]] and scattered macronucleus. In 1931, [[Alfred Kahl]] entrenched the error by treating ''D. margaritifer'' as a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''D. anser''.<ref name=Vdacny/>

[[File:Muller vibrio anser.jpg|thumb|310 px|right|''Vibrio anser'' from ''Animalcula Infusoria'', 1786, by [[Otto Friedrich Müller|Otto Müller]].]]The identity of ''Dileptus anser'' is also entangled with that of another long-necked dileptid, the nominal species ''Dileptus cygnus (Clap. & Lach., 1859)''.  Kahl describes and illustrates ''Pseudomonilicaryon anser'' under this name, and most studies of the organism have used this nomenclature.<ref name = Vdacny/> In 1984, ''Dileptus cygnus'' was formally identified as a [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Zoology|junior synonym]] of ''Vibrio anser'' (Müller, 1773).<ref>Wirnsberger, Von Erna, Wilhelm Foissner, and Hans Adam.

Archiv für Protistenkunde 128.4 (1984): 305-317.</ref>

In 2012, Peter Vďačný and Wilhelm Foissner transferred ''Dileptus anser'' to the genus ''Pseudomonilicaryon'' Foissner, 1997.<ref name=Vdacny/>

==Morphology==
''Pseudomonilicaryon anser'' is about .5&nbsp;mm long, with a narrow, flattened body tapering at the posterior into a distinct tail. At the front end, is a long, extremely mobile proboscis, making up about 55% of the cell's entire length. The oral aperture ([[cytostome]]) sits at the base of this proboscis, within a visible swelling called the "oral bulge."  The macronucleus is composed of 7 to 25 nodules, like a string of beads. Along the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] surface is a row of 15-20 [[contractile vacuole]]s.<ref name=Vdacny/>

==Habitat and feeding==
''Pseudomonilicaryon anser'' is found in mud and soft sediments at the bottoms of stagnant ponds and puddles.  A rapacious predator, described by one writer as "surely the king of beasts of the Protozoa," it feeds exclusively on other microscopic organisms.<ref name=Hausman>Hausman, Leon Augustus. "Observations on the Ecology of the Protozoa." American Naturalist (1917): 168.</ref> ''P. anser'' hunts by clinging to the substrate and waving its long proboscis in a counter-clockwise direction.  When the proboscis makes contact with its prey, toxic [[extrusome]]s are released, disabling the smaller organism, which is then gathered into the dileptid's [[cytostome]]. Smaller prey are swept into the mouth by the movement of cilia, while large organisms are pushed toward the oral bulge by "the writhings of the proboscis."<ref name=Hausman/>
