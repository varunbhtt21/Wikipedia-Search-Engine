All the sources about this appear to be directly linked to the same German psychiatrist, who's been harping on this for 10 years with apparently no luck persuading others. There's a single source relevant to the article that's not authored by him and it's a puff piece about him. The whole article, even if it's saved, needs a thorough clean out of all the stuff that's trying to make this "disorder" seem like a serious, widely supported thing rather than the pet project of one man with little research to back it up.

*This is a classic case of [[WP:OR|WPOR]], so '''delete'''. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 22:45, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''', there are enough references for this to be notable, so no deletion indicated. Pubmed results: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22Post-traumatic+embitterment+disorder%22] Google books results: <strike>[https://www.google.com/search?q="Post-traumatic+embitterment+disorder"&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1]</strike> (''link broken, just type in the phrase to google books''). Deletion is not a substitute for improving the article. [[Special:Contributions/188.29.95.225|188.29.95.225]] ([[User talk:188.29.95.225|talk]]) 11:07, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
** There are seven results on pubmed, and 5 of them have M Linden as a co-author. [[User:Tombomp|Tombomp]] ([[User_talk:Tombomp|talk]]/[[Special:Contributions/Tombomp|contribs]]) 21:58, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*<strike>'''Merge''' very selectively to Linden or as a second choice, '''Redirect''' or '''Delete'''.   [[WP:MEDRS]] warns that " Primary sources should generally not be used for medical content," and far too much of this content, which is in a medical context, is covered by this theory, we have no real secondary coverage of the topic, or is alternatively only covered by Linden. I don't believe that precludes a basic synopsis of the topic at Linden, however. --[[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|<sup><small><i>talk</i></small></sup>]] 06:07, 7 May 2014 (UTC)</strike>

*'''Keep'''. Deficiencies in the current article are not grounds for deletion. To quote the AfD admin instructions at [[WP:BEFORE]]:
::"'''C. Consider whether the article could be improved rather than deleted
:::1. If the article can be fixed through normal editing, then it is not a candidate for AfD."
:If the topic's notability is in question, I agree with [[User:Tombomp|Tombomp]] that there are a lot of references that discuss the topic (google the term in quotes at scholar.google.com or books.google.com), including in dozens of journal articles written by a wide variety of authors. Not all the search results are reliable sources, but a good many of them seem to be. [[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]]'s merge/redirect/delete opinion seems based on the sources currently cited, rather than the sources that could be cited to improve the article. And even within the current article, I don't really agree that much of the content "is in a medical context", though perhaps I'm wrong on that (pharmacological treatment of PTED is a medical topic, but is PTED itself a medical topic?).

* Moved to '''keep'''.  You were correct, Agyle,   Gscholar provides sufficient sources to indicate notability..  I tend to consider physiological topics medical, but we can disagree on that and it doesn't really matter here, since your primary sourcing point is valid.  Linden is well-represented in the available sources (and probably over-represented in the tone of the text), but there is other support, as well as criticism out there (which should also be included in the article.) --[[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|<sup><small><i>talk</i></small></sup>]] 03:10, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
