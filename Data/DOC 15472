<small>Improved to Good Article status by [[User:Jamesx12345|Jamesx12345]] ([[User talk:Jamesx12345|talk]]). Self nominated at 16:06, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:*Hi, thanks for working on this. The article is in good shape, except that I think the lead should be expanded to more properly summarize the article, since the article is a little longer. I would also suggest making a hook that uses the James Bond connection, this would suck me in more than the others, and DYK is about the "hooking" :) [[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] ([[User talk:Hekerui|talk]]) 11:31, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

::*Sorry about the delay in getting this fixed - I've been bogged down somewhat in exams. I've fixed the lead along with a few other possible ambiguities. I can't find anything further about the Bond connection, or even what sequences were filmed there, but it must have been the missile silo in Kazakhstan. To be honest, I think alt1 is "cooler" than James Bond having been filmed there - it's a lot of water per second - but I don't know what works well at DYK.

:::*Good! I only suggested it because it sprang at me, but we can certainly go with the existing. I like the second one better, because the first lacks an explanation what Ben Cruachan is and it's not obvious.
:::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] for '''ALT1'''. In conclusion: the article has been nominated within five days of the promotion to good article status, the article follows policy, the hook is correctly formatted, short enough, and properly sourced, and quid pro quo is not yet applicable.
