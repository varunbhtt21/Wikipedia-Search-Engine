The first predecessor of the '''914th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron''' was organized in 1942 as the '''8th Observation Squadron'''.  It trained in the [[United States]] during [[World War II]] as a [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] unit and then provided target support for [[anti-aircraft warfare|antiaircraft]] units until being disbanded in 1944 during a general reorganization of [[Army Air Forces]] units in the United States.  It was reactivated and deployed to the [[South West Pacific Theater of World War II]] and was inactivated in the [[Philippines]] in February 1946.

The '''914th Air Refueling Squadron''' was activated by the [[United States Air Force]] in 1961 at [[Blytheville Air Force Base]], Arkansas, where it was assigned to the [[97th Bombardment Wing]].  The squadron flew [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] aircraft to support the [[Strategic Air Command]]. It was inactivated in 1964, when its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the [[97th Air Refueling Squadron]].

The two squadrons were consolidated in September 1985 but the consolidated squadron was not activated.  In 2003 it was redesignated the '''914th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron''', converted to provisional status, and assigned to [[Air Mobility Command]] to activate or inactivate as needed.

===World War II===

The first predecessor of the [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was activated as the '''8th Observation Squadron''' at [[Pope Field]], North Carolina in February 1942.<ref name=Maurer14TTS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 80–81</ref>  Two months after activating, it moved to [[Langley Field]], Virginia.  Although the squadron was equipped with a variety of aircraft,<ref name=Maurer14TTS/> at Langley it flew primarily [[Martin B-10]] and [[North American O-47]] aircraft.<ref name=14TTS1943>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/041.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 14 Tow Target Squadron Activation-Oct 1943|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>  At Langley the unit began the [[target tug|target towing]] mission in addition to the [[artillery spotting]] mission of an [[air observer|observation]] squadron.<ref name=14TTS1943/>  The squadron moved to [[Camp Davis Army Air Field]], [[North Carolina]] a month later and by the end of the year was redesignated the '''14th Tow Target Squadron'''.<ref name=Maurer14TTS/>  While at Camp Davis the squadron was assigned several [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]].<ref name=14TTS1943/>

However, by 1944 the [[Army Air Forces]] found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were proving less well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit,<ref>Goss, p. 75</ref> while the groups and squadrons acting as training units were disbanded or inactivated.<ref>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 7</ref>  This resulted in the 14th, along with other units at [[Camp Davis]], being disbanded in the spring of 1944<ref name=Maurer14TTS/> and being replaced by an AAF Base Unit which absorbed the squadron's mission, personnel, and equipment.<ref group=note>At the time of the [[United States Army Air Forces|AAF]] reorganization, Camp Davis AAF was a subbase of [[Bluethenthal Field]]. where the 130th AAF Base Unit was organized. {{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/169/871.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History Bluethenthal Field.

The squadron was reconstituted in the fall of 1944 at [[McChord Field]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and equipped with [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bombers modified to serve as target tugs.<ref name=Maurer14TTS/>  Its personnel moved to [[Camp Stoneman]], [[California]] in November and shipped out to the Pacific Theater of Operations on 12 December.<ref name=14TTS1945>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/042.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 14 Tow Target Squadron Oct 1944-Dec 1945|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>  It arrived on [[Biak]], an island north of [[New Guinea]], on 6 January 1945, then moved to [[Nadzab Airfield]] on the main island,<ref group=note>During World War II, this section of [[New Guinea]] was part of the [[Dutch East Indies]].</ref> where it began towing targets for artillery and air-to-air gunnery training.<ref name=Maurer14TTS/>  The squadron moved to [[Clark Field]] on [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]], where it continued its mission until December 1945.<ref name=14TTS1945/>  It was inactivated on 1 February 1946.<ref name=Maurer14TTS/>

===Cold War===
The '''914th Air Refueling Squadron''' was organized in October 1961 by [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) at [[Blytheville Air Force Base]], Arkansas.  The squadron was equipped with [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]]s and assigned to the [[97th Bombardment Wing]] as part of SAC's plan to disperse its [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] units to make it more difficult for the Soviet Union to destroy the entire fleet with a first strike.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/056/917.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), Vol 1, History of Strategic Air Command, Jan-Jun 1957 (Secret)|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref>    The squadron's mission was to provide [[aerial refueling|air refueling]] to the B-52s of its parent [[wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] and other [[USAF]] units as directed.  One-third of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute [[alert state|alert]], fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike.  This was increased to half the squadron's aircraft in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/001/010/802.xml|last1=|first1=|title=Abstract (Unclassified), History of the Strategic Bomber since 1945 (Top Secret, downgraded to Secret)|date=1 April 1975|publisher=Air Force History Index|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref>  The squadron trained for this mission until inactivation.<ref name=Ravenstein>Ravenstein, pp. 136–138</ref>

The '''14th Tow Target Squadron''' was consolidated with the '''914th Air Refueling Squadron''' in September 1985 but the consolidated squadron has not been active since.<ref name=914EARSfacts>{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18958 |last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 914 Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron (AMC)|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150927180124/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=18958 |archivedate=September 27, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref>

On 27 March 2003 the squadron was converted to provisional status as the '''914th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron''' and assigned to [[Air Mobility Command]] to activate or inactivate as needed for contingency operations.<ref name=914EARSfacts/>
