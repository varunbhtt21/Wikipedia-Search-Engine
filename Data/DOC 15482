Contested PROD. Concern was ''Article about a footballer who fails [[WP:GNG]] and who has not played in a fully pro league.'' PROD was contested by an IP on the grounds that the plays for notable team. While he is signed to [[CSKA Sofia]], he has not played matches for them, meaning the article fails [[WP:NSPORT]].

I am also nominating the following article for the same reason. [[User:Sir Sputnik|Sir Sputnik]] ([[User talk:Sir Sputnik|talk]]) 16:10, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
