Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''speedy keep'''. Closed per [[WP:SK#1]], as the nominator has not put forward a [[WP:DEL-REASON|valid reason for deletion]]. James500 puts it best in his comment below. This nomination is closed with no prejudice against speedy renomination. ([[Wikipedia:non-admin closure|non-admin closure]]) [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 03:14, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
