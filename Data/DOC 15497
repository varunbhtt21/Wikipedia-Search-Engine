'''''Lactobacillus fabifermentans''''' is a member of the genus ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', the most diverse genus among [[lactic acid bacteria]] (LAB), a group of Gram-positive bacteria that produce [[lactic acid]] as their major fermented end product and that are often involved in food fermentation.<ref name="Salminen2004">Salminen S, Von Wright A, Ouwehand A (2004) “Lactic acid bacteria: microbiology and functional aspects”. CRC press.</ref><ref name=" Wood1995">Wood BJ, Holzapfel W (1995) “The genera of lactic acid bacteria”. Springer.</ref> ''L. fabifermentans'' was proposed in 2009 as a new species, after the type strain LMG 24284T (DSM 21115T) has been isolated from Ghanaian [[cocoa fermentation]].<ref name="DeBruyne2009">De Bruyne K, Camu N, De Vuyst L, Vandamme P (2009) “Lactobacillus fabifermentans sp. nov. and Lactobacillus cacaonum sp. nov., isolated from Ghanaian cocoa fermentations”. Int. J Syst Evol Microbiol 59: 7-12. doi:10.1099/ijs.0.001172-0</ref> Analysis of the [[16S rRNA]] gene sequence demonstrated that this species is a member of the ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' species group <ref name=" DeBruyne2009"/> but further analysis demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate it from the nearest neighbors by means of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, pheS sequence analysis, whole-cell protein electrophoresis, fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis and biochemical characterization.<ref name="DeBruyne2009"/>

The high similarity (>98%) among the 16S rRNA gene of ''L. fabifermentans'' with that of other species of the genus ''Lactobacillus'' (i.e. ''L. plantarum'') made its identification difficult and probably led to an underestimation of its true environmental diffusion. Only in 2012-2013 this species was identified in various fermented foods, from Chinese pickle (where it was found together with ''Lactobacillus xiangfangensis''),<ref name=" Gu2012">Gu CT, Wang F, Li CY, Liu F, Huo GC (2012) “Lactobacillus xiangfangensis sp. nov., isolated from Chinese pickle” Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 62(Pt 4):860-3. doi:10.1099/ijs.0.031468-0</ref> in Greek traditional cheeses <ref name=" Florosa2012">Florosa G, Hatzikamaria M, Litopoulou-Tzanetakia E, Tzanetakisa N (2012) "Probiotic and technological properties of facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli from Greek traditional cheeses". Food Biotechnol 26:85-105. doi:10.1080/08905436.2011.645941</ref> and in dolo wort, an analcoholic fermented beverage produced in Burkina Faso.<ref name="Adimpong2013">Adimpong DB, Nielsen DS, Sørensen KI, Vogensen FK, Sawadogo-Lingani H, Derkx PM, Jespersen L (2013) “Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. jakobsenii subsp. nov., isolated from dolo wort, an alcoholic fermented beverage in Burkina Faso”. Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 63(Pt 10):3720-6. doi:10.1099/ijs.0.048769-0</ref> In 2013, 22 isolates belonging to ''L. fabifermentans'' were isolated from grape marcs and clearly separated from other members of the L. plantarum group by means of rep-PCR;<ref name="Maragkoudakis2013">Maragkoudakis PA, Nardi T, Bovo B, D'Andrea M, Howell KS, Giacomini A, Corich V (2013) “Biodiversity, dynamics and ecology of bacterial community during grape marc storage for the production of grappa”. Int J Food Microbiol 162:143-151. doi:10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro</ref> this finding suggested that this is one of the more abundant microbial species surviving during the grape marc fermentation used for the production of [[Grappa]], a traditional Italian alcoholic beverage.

Like for other members of the genus ''Lactobacillus'', the capability of this species to survive during food products fermentation was due to some interesting phenotypic characters like the ability to use a wide range of different carbohydrates. The strain LMG 24284 isolated from cocoa fermentation for example is able to ferment [[cellobiose]], [[galactose]], [[maltose]], [[mannitol]], [[ribose]], [[sucrose]], [[trehalose]], [[D-xylose]],<ref name=" DeBruyne2009"/> while the strain T30PCM01 isolated from fermenting grape marc was able to use [[mannose]], [[fructose]], [[cellobiose]], [[mannitol]], [[glucose]], [[N-acetyl-glucosamine]] and [[L-arabinose]].

The genome sequence of ''L. fabifermentans'' T30PCM01 (isolated from grape marc) was determined in 2014 <ref name="Treu2014">Treu L, Vendramin V, Bovo B, Giacomini A, Corich V, Campanaro S. “Genome Sequence of Lactobacillus fabifermentans Strain T30PCM01, Isolated from Fermenting Grape Marc”. Genome Announc 2(1). doi:10.1128/genomeA.00060-14</ref> and allowed to identify a high number of genes involved in carbohydrate transport and utilization. As for other members of the genus ''Lactobacillus'', in the T30PCM01 strain, these genes are clustered in sugar utilization cassettes <ref name="Campanaro2014">Campanaro S, Treu L, Vendramin V, Bovo B, Giacomini A and Corich V. “Metagenomic analysis of the microbial community in fermented grape marc reveals that Lactobacillus fabifermentans is one of the dominant species: insights into its genome structure”. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. (in press)</ref> of which there are 65 in ''L. fabifermentans'' T30PCM01. This high number of cassettes is strictly linked to the ability of ''L. fabifermentans'' to use a wide range of different carbohydrates.

The 3,580,413 bp of the ''L. fabifermentans'' T30PCM01 genome sequence [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/115881 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/115881)] revealed that it is one of the Lactobacillus species with the larger genome. This was confirmed by the genome sequence of the LMG 24284T (DSM 21115T) strain isolated from cocoa (3,204,420 bp) that was also determined in 2014 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/81501 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/81501)]. The large genome size of ''L. fabifermentans'' suggests that it is a generalist and a very flexible and versatile species such as ''L. plantarum''. This also suggests that its true environmental diffusion has been greatly underestimated.

Another interesting characteristic of this species is the ability to growth adherent to solid surfaces forming [[biofilm]] structures <ref name="Maragkoudakis2013"/><ref name="Campanaro2014"/> which are probably involved in determining the high resistance of this species to the extreme growth conditions present in grape marc fermentation <ref name="Lorenzo2013">Lorenzo F, Viviana C, Alessio G, Marina B, Sergio C (2013) “Grape marcs as unexplored source of new yeasts for future biotechnological applications”. World J Microbiol Biotechnol 29(9):1551-62. doi:10.1007/s11274-013-1319-z</ref> and its ability to produce [[bacteriocins]].<ref name="Maragkoudakis2013"/><ref name="Campanaro2014"/>
