[[User:Lockean One]] was blocked on 6 April 2014.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Lockean_One] On 15 April, [[User:Mabel Velástegui]], created 29 January, comes to the libertarianism article, making the same edits which were the [[WP:SPA|single purpose]] of Lockean One's account. In fact, Lockean One often made contentious claims about the grammar in the lead of the article in service to his anti-left-libertarian agenda, once starting a(nother very long, pointless) discussion thread about "Suggested alternative to equivocation and faulty grammar in lead" [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&diff=prev&oldid=598935864] Now a user speaking in broken English is complaining about the grammar in the lead and removing left-libertarian content from the lead.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Libertarianism&diff=prev&oldid=604336637][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&diff=prev&oldid=604435622] The new user has 16 minor edits made in January on unrelated topics. &mdash; [[User:Goethean|goethean]] 12:33, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

[[User:Lockean Redux]] is a self-proclaimed sock, probably created in order to take the scent off of [[User:Mabel Velástegui]].

Hmmm...perhaps this is a case of meatpuppetry. Accounts exist at Commons and Wikinews also.[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Mabel_Vel%C3%A1stegui&offset=&limit=500&target=Mabel+Vel%C3%A1stegui][https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Mabel_Vel%C3%A1stegui]

Demanding incivility,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Libertarianism&diff=prev&oldid=608363977] right-wing libertarian single-purpose account, demands removal of left-libertarian material from [[Libertarianism]] (exact same agenda as [[User:Lockean One]]).[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Al_Bunker] Account created two days after previous sock was blocked.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Lockean_Redux] &mdash; [[User:Goethean|goethean]] 12:20, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

*{{CURequest}} - Considering that the previous case involved mistaken [[WP:MEAT|MEAT]], requesting CU to verify before taking action. &mdash;[[User:Darkwind|Darkwind]] ([[User talk:Darkwind|talk]]) 10:24, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

*CU result is {{inconclusive}} w/r/t IP addresses used by {{u|Lockean One}} and {{u|Al Bunker}}.  Sorry.  —&nbsp;[[User:Richwales|<u>Rich</u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] <small>''(no&nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''</small> 06:06, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*{{adminnote}} Behavioural evidence suggests Al Bunker is the same individual as Lockean One (and {{checkuser|Lockean Redux}}). Accordingly I have blocked the account indefinitely. I also tagged. This is now {{completed}} and can be archived by the next clerk. [[User:AGK|<font color="black">'''AGK'''</font>]] [[User talk:AGK#top|[•]]] 18:43, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
