'''James B. Hervey''', known as '''Dick Hervey''' (June 2, 1920 - February 19, 2014), was an official of [[Texas A&M University]] and a [[savings and loan]] president who served as the sixth [[mayor]] of his adopted city of [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]]. 

Until his death at the age of ninety three, Hervey had been the oldest living mayor of College Station, the sister city of neighboring [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]], Texas. He won a [[special election]] in 1971 called after a ruling that employees at Texas A&M University could not serve on city councils or school boards. The decree was later reversed. Hervey was instrumental in the development of College Station during the 1960s and 1970s through his presidency of Community Savings and Loan.<ref name=wtaw>{{cite web|url=http://wtaw.com/2014/02/20/remembering-dick-hervey/|title=Remembering Dick Hervey|publisher=[[WTAW (AM)|WTAW]] [[AM radio]]|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>

Hervey was the last surviving of five children of Oney and Elizabeth Hervey. He was born in [[Greenville, Texas|Greenville]] in [[Hunt County, Texas|Hunt County]] some forty-miles east of [[Dallas]]. He graduated in 1942 as the president of the TAMU senior class.

Upon graduation, he was immediately called to serve during [[World War II]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]], the forerunner to the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], in which he attained the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. When the war ended and after a brief period in Dallas, he returned to College Station in 1947 to become the third executive secretary of the [[Association of Former Students]], a position he filled through 1964.<ref name=dhervey/> During Hervey's tenure, the association established its first computerized database, the university archives, and launched the "Distinguished Alumnus Award".<ref name=wtaw/>

Upon leaving the Association of Former Students, he became the president of Community Savings & Loan, where he remained until his retirement in 1982. He was a member and then president of the [[College Station Independent School District]], which oversees [[A&M Consolidated High School]]. For three years he was the mayor of College Station and worked to expand the city.<ref name=dhervey/> He did not seek reelection in 1974.<ref>Ian Whittenton, Records Management Coordinator, City of College Station, "List of Mayors and City Council members since November 13, 1938"</ref> In 1988, he received the "Distinguished Alumnus Award" that he had earlier worked to establish.<ref name=dhervey/>
