===Early political career===

In 1970, Bedolla served in the National Confederation of Organizations, a component of the [[Confederación Nacional de Organizaciones Populares]]. In 1973 and 1974, he served as a founding and special delegate, respectively, in the National Movement of Revolutionary Youth (MNJR).<ref name="sil"/>

1976 marked a turning point in Bedolla's career; he served as a regional youth delegate from the CNOP in northwestern Mexico, and in the same year, he became Chief of the Section of Political Investigations in the local department of government in the municipality of [[Ecatepec de Morelos]], beginning what would become a lengthy political career in the State of Mexico. He became a secretarial advisor in Ecatepec the next year; meanwhile, he became a coordinator in the CNOP in 1976, and the municipal president of the MNJR in 1977.<ref name="sil"/> From 1978 to 1980, he began a short stint in the [[Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (Mexico)|SHCP]], where he worked as an inspector and headed the Center for Identification of Personnel.<ref name="sil"/>

From 1979 to 1980, Bedolla served as a private secretary to the municipal president of Ecatepec, then as a municipal secretary in the early 1980s. During this time, Bedolla also obtained an undergraduate degree in political science and public administration from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]].<ref name="sil"/> After a year as the federal director of Planning of Personal Development in the Secretariat of Programming and Budget (SPP), Bedolla went to work for the [[INEGI]], as an administrative coordinator, federal director of audits, budget controller, and internal comptroller, all between 1985 and 1986.<ref name="sil"/> He left the INEGI to return to the SPP, where he was the federal director of programming and evaluation.

===1990s: First legislative term and return to PRI action===
After two years as a municipal secretary in Ecatepec, voters sent Bedolla López to public office for the first time as he became a local deputy to the LI Legislature of the Congress of the State of Mexico, between 1990 and 1993.<ref name="sil"/> Once his term concluded, Bedolla became more active in PRI politics than he had been in the 1980s: he coordinated municipal committees for the State Front of Organizations and Citizens and served as the FEOC's special delegate to [[Toluca]], [[Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl]] and [[Cocotitlán]], also serving as a district delegate in the state PRI.<ref name="sil"/>

===2000s: San Lázaro and the state government===

When that term ended, he briefly served as the director general of the Technological Center of Higher Studies in [[Chimalhuacán]] and as a regional director general in the state government for the [[Texcoco, State of Mexico|Texcoco]] Region before being tapped as state deputy secretary of government.<ref name="sil"/>
