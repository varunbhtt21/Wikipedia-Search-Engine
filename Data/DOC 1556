[[User:Rahulsinghpinaki]] was created immediately after the [[Colonel Brown Cambridge School]] article was semi-protected due to 117.197.x.x IPs adding unsourced information about the alumni of the school. [[User:Rahulsinghpinaki]] continued to add the same unsourced information as the IP editors to that article[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=604153286&oldid=602586550][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=602533524&oldid=602522962][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=602521477&oldid=602426421][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=602424085&oldid=602417739][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=602415914&oldid=602412085][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=602373924&oldid=602280852][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=602263488&oldid=602228007][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=602223304&oldid=602154795][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=604257063&oldid=604250548][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colonel_Brown_Cambridge_School&diff=604300561&oldid=604295232] and to biographies that this editor claimed were alumni without citing sources[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vir_Bahadur_Singh&diff=604114030&oldid=586821302][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ajit_Singh_%28politician%29&diff=604113456&oldid=603873366][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Satish_Sharma&diff=604110780&oldid=603836118][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Satish_Chandra_Agarwal&diff=604109678&oldid=602844454][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virbhadra_Singh&diff=604108611&oldid=598065642]. [[User:Rahulsinghpinaki]] was blocked several times, ending in an indef block. Rahulsinghpinaki has a habit of not using the preview button, and as a result always makes several edits in a row. Now the IP editor at 117.197.64.222 is making the same unsourced additions to biographies, most with multiple edits, claiming that various people are alumni of the Colonel Brown Cambridge School [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rao_Birender_Singh&diff=604743134&oldid=603872920][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B._D._Sharma&diff=604741190&oldid=602278434][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yahya_Khan&diff=604740218&oldid=604731999][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hardeo_Singh&diff=prev&oldid=604746186].

{{adminnote}} This is [[WP:DUCK|pretty obvious]], I blocked the IP for 2 weeks to dissuade Rahulsinghpinaki from trying to evade blocks any further. I'm not sure how effective this will be, since the IP already stopped editing after their final warning, and this editor was shown to use multiple IPs prior to the Colonel Brown Cambridge School being semi-protected, but this is the best I can do for now. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">щан</span>]] 18:58, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
