Andrewbf is presently blocked for genre warring and his block was extended for another 2 weeks as he was continuing to edit war while logged out.  This new account was created on 19 April. Similarities include genre warring, inserting genres into info boxes on articles. Notably, both accounts like to add genres to the "stylistic origins" field;
*Andrewbf: {{diff|Future garage|prev|601832872|Diff of Future garage}}; {{diff|Electro house|prev|601898583|Diff of Electro house}}; {{diff|Dance-pop|prev|601970449|Diff of Dance-pop}}

Pulum34 is using a mobile device; while Andrewbf did not edit via mobile exclusively, there were a few mobile edits on 29 and 30 March. [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 02:12, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

Andrewbf has often been associated with IPs from the Mexico region a little north of Mexico City. Andresbfarrera is very similar in name and identical in behavior and focus. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 19:30, 15 May 2015 (UTC)

*[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=House_music&type=revision&diff=657139162&oldid=657100830 This edit by the IP] is exactly the same as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=House_music&diff=prev&oldid=662488140 this edit] by Andresbfarrera.

*The problem can be traced to the city of Querétaro in Mexico. If we take a look at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&offset=&limit=500&action=history editing history of the dance-pop article], a Querétaro IP shows up in February 2014, then on March 17 and 21 he [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&type=revision&diff=599943737&oldid=599834980 adds the EDM genre] and also the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&type=revision&diff=600533618&oldid=600086632 techno] genre. Then Andrewbf shows up later on March 21, 2014, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&type=revision&diff=600911730&oldid=600533618 shifting techno and adding trance, electro house, and pop rock]. All of this work is reverted by an IP from Kuching in Malaysia. Through the next week, Andrewbf can be seen edit warring back and forth with the same Malaysia-based person using various IPs. On March 30, Andrewbf was edit warring over and over with {{u|Jim1138}}, {{u|Red Jay}}, {{u|STATicVapor}} and {{u|Diannaa}}. Andrewbf was blocked the next day for abusing multiple accounts. Right after Andrewbf was blocked, Querétaro IP [[Special:Contributions/187.211.26.6|187.211.26.6]] began to edit the same articles, soon coming into conflict again with Malaysian IPs as well as the previous handful of interested editors. At the dance-pop article, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&diff=prev&oldid=603252602 he re-added techno, trance and house] on April 8, 2014. Sockpuppet account {{u|Higo1}} got into the article on April 20, 2014, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&type=revision&diff=605067447&oldid=605030852 re-adding EDM and techno]. So we have established that Andrewbf, and a sock account, and Querétaro IPs have been warring to insert the same material. Jumping ahead to 2015, another Querétaro IP [[Special:Contributions/187.211.45.66|187.211.45.66]] began to edit the article on April 18, 2015, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&diff=prev&oldid=657050691 adding EDM], and again the next day [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&diff=prev&oldid=657197465 re-adding EDM] as well as changing disco to post-disco, because he did not like disco there, with an edit summary of "club beats (EDM) is waht source says". Other people reverted him and worked on the article. Then on May 15, Andresbfarrera [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dance-pop&type=revision&diff=662505825&oldid=662405777 got rid of Disco and changed it to Club], just like the Querétaro IP said in the edit summary of "club beats". [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 01:22, 16 May 2015 (UTC)

*Further connection of the Querétaro location and Andresbfarrera can be found on {{u|Etheldavis}}'s talk page. A Mexican IP posted a new discussion saying [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEtheldavis&type=revision&diff=662509574&oldid=633404962 "I'm not a block evasion of andrew bf..."] Etheldavis replied, then the discussion was continued by Andresbfarrera saying [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AEtheldavis&type=revision&diff=662510783&oldid=662510114 "my intention isn't vandalize wikipedia..."] The full discussion is at [[User_talk:Etheldavis#Block_evasion]].
