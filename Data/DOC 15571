The '''''Slovenský náučný slovník''''' (''Slovak encyclopaedia'') is the first general [[encyclopedia]] in the [[Slovak language]]. It was published in 1932 in three volumes.

==Coverage==
''Slovenský náučný slovník'' focuses mainly on [[Slovakia|Slovak]] topics and less on universal or global topics. According to the editor Pavel Bujnák, "the foreign countries in various educational dictionaries are (…) insufficiently and often tendentiously or maliciously presented about Slovakia. Thus the goal of the first ''Slovenský náučný slovník'' was set and the coverage of the particular headwords was determined."<ref>{{cite book
