Ceylobo was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ceylobo&diff=604627486&oldid=604623965 blocked indefinitely] by [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] for legal threats on April 17.  

Ceylobo had just nominated an article at AfD, and was actively lobbying for deletion at the time of its indef block.  ''See'' [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jean Shafiroff|Afd/Jean Shafiroff]]

After Ceylobo was indef blocked, Jamescur -- who had not edited for 5 months -- appeared at the same AfD.  Jamescur is an SPA with 32 edits to its name.  Jamescur [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jean_Shafiroff&diff=prev&oldid=604937703 !voted] in support of Ceylobo's Jean Shafiroff AfD nomination, on April 19.

Ceylobo and Jamescur have Duck-ish heavy editing of the same quite obscure articles.

Lmatt123, <s>though it has not edited since December</s> who [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Lmatt123 edited just now for the first time since December 2013], also has Duckish editing that aligns with that of the others, for example in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Maryse Selit|Afd/Maryse Selit]].  Lmatt123 last edited in December 2013, until it edited on April 20, 2014, to contest a PROD on an obscure article that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eaton_House_%28Watchung,_New_Jersey%29&diff=567426829&oldid=566730982 Jamescur had also edited] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eaton_House_%28Watchung,_New_Jersey%29&diff=566730982&oldid=533226810 the indef-blocked Ceylobo had also edited].

Furthermore, indef-blocked Ceylobo and Lmatt123 both edited an article to delete the same ref, in each case using a misleading edit summary.  ''See'' [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Grazer&diff=586835860&oldid=586818520 here; Ceylobo: "fixed spelling"] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Grazer&diff=prev&oldid=586818520 here; Lmatt123: "fixed footnote"].

Tania4lv and Robertsjoe also have Duckish editing that aligns with that of the others in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Maryse Selit|Afd/Maryse Selit]] -- but they have not edited since 2012, so their record is cold.

IP [[User:207.237.211.246|207.237.211.246]] seems to be yet another puppet.  Her only three edits consist of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bbb23&diff=prev&oldid=582536545 this] defense of the Maryse Selit (since deleted) article -- which all of these "editors" seem to have a shared interest in, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eaton_House_%28Watchung,_New_Jersey%29&diff=prev&oldid=602732659 this edit inserting Selit's name into] the Eaton House article a number of them edit (which is now at AfD), and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jean_Shafiroff&diff=prev&oldid=605101568 this edit just today] at the ongoing Jean Shafiroff AfD (started by the now-indef-blocked Ceylobo).  And the IP and Jamescur by their edits [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jean_Shafiroff here] essentially admit to being one and the same person.

Given the apparent heavy use of socking in the past, I think a cu is in order to flag any other puppets.

Given that the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jean Shafiroff|Afd/Jean Shafiroff]] is ongoing, and the !vote of one of the apparent puppets currently stands, it would be helpful if this could be addressed expeditiously to avoid an apparent puppet possibly swaying an AfD.
