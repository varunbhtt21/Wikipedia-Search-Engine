I came across these accounts by way of an article that was up for PROD. I seemed to remember that I'd seen a lot of Beyonce themed articles that were either deleted as hoaxes or were as good as hoaxes. I debated about whether or not to submit this, but was encouraged by [[User:Doc9871]] since there did seem to be a recurring theme to the edits. Basically many of these accounts seem to have a similar MO in that they'll make a few edits and then create an article that's a fairly obvious hoax in one way or another. The articles in question are [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour‎]], [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour starring BEYONCÉ LIVE!]], [[The Flawless World Tour]], and [[Beyoncé: Mrs. Carter]]. I initially was going to submit them under [[User:ItsMrAtlass]] as it seemed to be the most recent one, but then I saw that [[User:GagsGagsGags]] had been blocked for making multiple articles along the same lines, under various different names. (I'd deleted one of the articles they'd created.) This looks like it's probably the same user, back with a new range of socks. If I am wrong about any of these users then I really and honestly do apologize, but this is a little too suspicious for my tastes.

*{{Endorse}} - I don't think it's a coincidence that users with a similar username (Mrs Carter) create hoax articles about similar topics. For reviewing admin deleted contribs of GagsGagsGags are telling.

It looks like GagsGagsGags is back at it, as they recently created the article [[Casino Knokke presents: Beyoncé Live!]], which was put up for AfD and ended up getting speedied. Given that they usually end up creating a lot of accounts at the same time, checking for sleepers would be a good idea. I'll look to see if I can find anyone else that looks suspicious that fits GGG's MO.
