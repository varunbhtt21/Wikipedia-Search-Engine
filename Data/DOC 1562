All of these accounts are adding more or less the same text to article [[Kachin conflict]] in this week and reverting with multiple accounts.

*{{CURequest}}  - {{Selfendorse}} - There is definitely some behavioural evidence and the diffs do link them, but there isn't enough there for me to block. Requesting CU to confirm. <b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 13:02, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
*{{Completed}}: Without violating the privacy policy, I can confirm that there is some editing while logged out going on with some of the accounts. That said, the locations that these accounts are editing from make CheckUser more or less useless. Additionally, one of the accounts appears to have edited from a mobile range. I'll call this {{inconclusive}}.

*There's a good chance some of these are socks, but we don't know for sure. Innocent until proven guilty. Closing.
