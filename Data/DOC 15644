Recently deproded by an ip. The rationale of the PROD was "Article of a minor academic & columnist. Non notable. Only sources are self published material from subject's empolyers.", which I agree with the nominator.

* '''Delete''' -  This article caught my attention, when I found it included  subject facebook page [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shiv_Visvanathan&oldid=586971904]]. Then, when I read through the article. found it had been badly written and uses self published source of subject and his employer.  Tried to find independent sources that talks about the the subject and was unable to find anything. If we can get independent sources that talk about this subject, we can keep with a complete rework of this article.[[User:Prodigyhk|Prodigyhk]] ([[User talk:Prodigyhk|talk]]) 10:51, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
