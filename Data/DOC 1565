I have already blocked Royale.heart, primarily as an advertising only account, but I noticed that there is crossover with some of the recently blocked socks. For example Royale.heart added [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyun_Jin_Moon&diff=580662462&oldid=560296482 this] to [[Hyun Jin Moon]] followed a month later by Verdict78 (already blocked) adding [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyun_Jin_Moon&diff=587972306&oldid=587943463 this] to the same article. If you take a look at [[Special:Undelete/Nelson_Nigel]] you'll see that  Happydit edited the article as well as Royale.heart. Amanda Davis2 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=Leesa+Rowland&timestamp=20140305171417 created] [[Leesa Rowland]]. It was deleted as a copyvio but not before Happydit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=Leesa+Rowland&timestamp=20140305174941&diff=prev edited it] and then [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leesa_Rowland&oldid=598303033 recreated it] before Amanda Davis2 edited again [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leesa_Rowland&diff=599183068&oldid=598839992 today]. [[Robert Vinson]] was created by Vishal1811 (who [https://www.elance.com/s/vishal1811/ advertises his WP abilities on elance]) and Happydit '[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Vinson&diff=593723795&oldid=593148143 improved the article]' by removing maintenance tags and also voted !keep [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRobert_Vinson&diff=593468624&oldid=593148547 in the AFD]. It all seems a bit suspicious to me. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 20:28, 11 March 2014 (UTC)

:Happydit has also [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marcelo_Henrique_Almeida&diff=596346729&oldid=590765731 made similar 'improvements'] to [[Marcelo Henrique Almeida]] which was created by {{user|Wikifan115}} who was blocked as a paid editor in December. Would [[User:Coffee|Coffee]] or [[User:Bilby|Bilby]] know of any other crossovers? [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 20:56, 11 March 2014 (UTC)

::It may also be worth checking the socks listed [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Yekhai/Archive|here]], since Vishal1811 [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PictureofDrSalzhauer.jpg uploaded] a photo to commons and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=Michael+Salzhauer&timestamp=20140130025502&diff=prev added it to an article] that {{user|Exactlywhy}} had created (one of those socks listed there). That article also leads us to {{user|Gulatimaaf786}} who recently recreated [[Michael Salzhauer|the same article]] after the previous version was deleted as spam. I also came across {{user|SallyHan}} who's only edit was to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sancy_Suraj&diff=589639968&oldid=589606283 remove a PROD] from an article that Vishal1811 created. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 00:16, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

:::{{user|Sarah1971}} also seems slightly suspect - [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darren_Cullen&diff=594980088&oldid=594951036 adding promotional content] to [[Darren Cullen]] and the related [[Graffiti Kings]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graffiti_Kings&oldid=594347309] (note that this is the account's very first edit). Vishal1811 [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kate_Middleton_%26_baby_painting.jpg uploaded a related image] a week before Sarah1971 started editing and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Catherine%2C_Duchess_of_Cambridge&diff=592975606&oldid=592671361 added it] to [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] - a brazen bit of spamming IMO. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 00:39, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
::::{{User|AlFreshCo}} is another linked to the Graffiti Kings articles - only edits are to those articles including a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Graffiti_Kings&diff=prev&oldid=595570931 !keep] in the AFD on Graffiti Kings. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 12:38, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
:::::Note how all three of these editors made edits to [[Leake Street]] where GK is based. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leake_Street&diff=590549877&oldid=577939470 AlFreshCo] followed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leake_Street&diff=590846361&oldid=590551724 Vishal1811] and then [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leake_Street&diff=594519587&oldid=593150316 Sarah1971]. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 15:35, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

:::Also added {{user|Ali cruse}} based on that account [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Tank&oldid=575662330 creating]  [[Mikhail Tank]] which has been deleted via AFD twice and was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Tank&diff=598508429&oldid=595912894 edited recently] by Vishal1811 and also by Wikifan115 (mentioned earlier as a paid editor) a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Tank&diff=576021856&oldid=575916579 few days] after being created. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 14:04, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

:::Looking at Vishal1811's commons uploads led me to [[Brad Gosse]] created by {{user|Bemanna}} who uses their moves articles to mainspace from userspace, avoiding NPP like Morning277. Also, strange is that the image that Vishal1811 added is a much higher resolution than the source cited at commons, which as I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASockpuppet_investigations%2FTimeQueen32&diff=599308715&oldid=599308264 noted earlier] is also the case for the [[Graffiti Kings]] logo - I've never seen this happen before, so it seems likely that there is some relation. Bemanna [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bugscore&diff=591533073&oldid=582046709 added content] to the repeatedly recreated [[Bugscore]] (of which Gosse is an employee). That article was created by {{user|RadBikken}} who has an [[Special:DeletedContributions/RadBikken|extensive history]] of creating fairly blatant adverts e.g. check Jclemen's PROD of [[Creating Woody Woodward (businessman and author)]]. I've no idea who the sockmaster is, but these are at least tangentially related. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 21:13, 12 March 2014 (UTC)

* Though I can't speak to the sock accusation, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHappydit&diff=588732548&oldid=587685070 warned Happydit] not to delete maintenance templates on January 1, 2014. He deleted my warning, which as we all know means that he is presumed to have read it. As {{u|SmartSE}} points out, the user removed maintenance templates a second time on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Vinson&diff=593723795&oldid=593148143 February 3] with insufficient explanation. This might be indicative of a promotional agenda, particularly when you balance it against other facts. For example, Happydit is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Epicgenius&diff=prev&oldid=586830074 not slick with] English, but [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leesa_Rowland&oldid=598303033 pulls whole articles out of thin air] and for very obscure people, or when he produces coherent content like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hoofnagle&diff=prev&oldid=589461102 in this edit] (questionable content, though...) Who's passing him this content? [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 21:06, 11 March 2014 (UTC)
::You've made a good point - those don't look like edits made the same person. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 00:16, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
:Oh, and lest I forget, I noticed Happydit made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seven_Heavens&diff=prev&oldid=586816591 this edit] which reminded me of an edit I came across a couple of days ago [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earth%27s_rotation&diff=prev&oldid=598866939 here] by Ameen nordeen.

*There's a paid sockfarm at work here and I think it's part of the Morning277 family. I found Royale.heart and [[Johnny Ward]] by perusing a paid editing ad on fiverr. The same ad also leads to [[DJ Brian Dawe]] (a previous Morning277 job), [[Simon Rex]], [[Growth Hacking]], [[Vanna Bonta]], [[James Goolnik]] (this one goes back to 2011) [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Heart Your Smile]] (associated with James Goolnik, created by Ryale.heart), [[Ely Sakhai]] (The subject apparantly wanted this deleted... it's a borderline notable article with a negative bent. We should look into this.), [[Travel website]] (Morning277 was involved with this as well), and [[Tosca (software)]]. Only several of the pages were edited by  Royale.heart, but looking through the edit histories, its easy to see the other promotional accounts, most of which are one-offs that disappear after their work is done. I'm 100% certain this is the work of a promotional sockfarm.

::See [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Aviation geek/Archive#01 October 2013]].

*Hello, firstly I & my partner (Alfeshco) have no connection to artist or the company, I just feel the art form needs more recognition. I must also admit that at first I did not know how Wikipedia worked & I did edit a article by saying I was the artist (I'm not) I said this as I thought it would help with the edit staying up as I was not to clear on how Wikipedia worked, plus I did suport the edit with weblinks. Really sorry for causing any problems & please let street art have a voice.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sarah1971|Sarah1971]] ([[User talk:Sarah1971|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sarah1971|contribs]]) 13:01, 12 March 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
**[[User:Sarah1971|Sarah1971]] - I'm willing to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]], but you appear to be admitting to making [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Darren_Cullen&diff=589885628&oldid=588541365 this edit] as well which is clearly promotional and is not supported by the sources cited in the article. How do you know all these details if you have no connection to the artist? Why would you pretend to be him and even include his email address?! How do you explain getting involved in this at the exact same time as Vishal1811? [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 13:54, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
***Hi SmartSE - I have a interest in this art form & was happy when I found the Darren Cullen page on Wikipedia as any credible information on street art & its artists is hard to find. The main bulk of the info I submitted was taken from the artists personal website, there was already a link to his website so I just added more detail? As I said I was & still really unsure how Wikipedia works & thought it would help it stay on the page by my thinking it was cleaver thinking (it wasn't). With regards to Vishall811, there is no connection, why link me to this user & not the many other users that have edited the pages I'm working on. If it just a case of timing then surly this can happen? even if its 1 in a million/billion, it does happen, people do win lottery's. I do want to edit & start other pages but when the Graffiti Kings page was flagged I was waiting to see what happened as I'm still learning.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sarah1971|Sarah1971]] ([[User talk:Sarah1971|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sarah1971|contribs]]) 14:23, 12 March 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
****I can't find any of that content on his website. The links above demonstrate why I'm suspicious. Let's just wait and see what the checkusers find. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 15:35, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
*****Yes your correct I just checked, the page has since had a bigger update since I last read it, its much better. Is it OK to use this new info taken from the artist personal page? with regards to links above what do you mean by this? what is this page about anyway, I'm lost as to why I'm being attacked. [[User:Sarah1971|Sarah1971]] ([[User talk:Sarah1971|talk]]) 16:43, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
*****Have you not read my comments? I have already said my partner is [[User:AlFreshCo|alfreshco]] before anyone asked or mentioned him, can 2 people that live in the same house not have a Wikipedia account? & share the same interests, is it 1 account per IP address?[[User:Sarah1971|Sarah1971]] ([[User talk:Sarah1971|talk]]) 16:49, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
******[https://web.archive.org/web/20140108163500/http://graffitikings.co.uk/darren-cullen/ The page] has changed but it didn't contain that information before either. Also, where did you get [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Graffiti_Kings_ltd_logo_CopyrightedFreeUse-image.jpg the high resolution] logo from? It's much bigger than [http://graffitikings.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Graffiti-Kings-ltd-logo-CopyrightedFreeUse-image-290x290.jpg the source listed] and [[tineye]] can't find the high resolution version anywhere else on the internet. And yes, I have read your comments, but that still doesn't explain the crossover with Vishal1811 does it? [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 16:57, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
*No you wouldn't of found all the info on that page you noted above as Web Archive has only recorded that Graffiti Kings page 3 times, look [https://web.archive.org/web/20140113191903*/http://graffitikings.co.uk/darren-cullen/ HERE] - the last time it was recorded was the 13th of Jan 2014, my edit on the Wikipedia page was in February. Also I never mentioned that all the info I read on the website was from the only page you have looked at, I took the info from the many pages on hes website, just like reading a book. The page I used mainly was [http://graffitikings.co.uk/radio/ THIS] Some of the images on this page are posts with great story's about the artists that have created the images. Bare in mind that this page does change allot, I know this because I always listen to their radio. Sorry cant help with the image, it is on the company website mind, I remember because it took me ages to find a big version, 90% sure it was on the radio page aswell. No idea about Vishall811 sorry.

Hello :) Can I ask why I'm added to this page? obviously someone thinks I'm a sockpuppet but can I ask why you think this, is there 1 or more persons you think I am or linked to? can you tell me who they are on this list? why do I not have my own sockpuppet page dedicated to me? <span style="text-shadow:0em 0em 1em #003399;">[[User:Sarah1971|'''<span style="color:#00008B;">Sarah</span>''']]</span><span style="text-shadow:0em 0em 1em #FF8C00;">[[User talk:Sarah1971|'''<span style="color:#B7410E;">1971</span>''']]</span> 03:54, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

*'''March 25, 2014''' - New user, SPA, SimoninIceland is taking issue with an article, [[Fescal]] from being AfDed. This is one that Happydit has edited. Their request for help sounds really strange to my ears: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Happydit&oldid=601231533]. However, I am naturally full of suspicion. It might be nothing, but it's curious. [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 19:13, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
**Hmm... that article was created by an editor [[Wikipedia:COIN#User:Flaviohmg_and_possible_COI|reported to COIN today]] and who certainly appears to be a paid editor. Whether SimoninIceland is related to all these socks though is difficult to say. [[User:Smartse|SmartSE]] ([[User talk:Smartse|talk]]) 19:21, 25 March 2014 (UTC)
***Agreed, I'm not 100%, but he's certainly got a lot of fire for someone who's brand new and who's arguing about an article that's less than a month old. [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 19:21, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

*{{Endorse}} - Who knows how much checkuser will be able to tell us. But it's definitely worth a look for confirmation and sleepers. <b>[[User:Callanecc|Callanecc]]</b> ([[User talk:Callanecc|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Callanecc|contribs]] • [[Special:Log/Callanecc|logs]]) 12:52, 12 March 2014 (UTC)
*{{Inprogress}} - Firstly I would welcome another checkuser to take a look, What it comes down to is there is one reasonably sized group, and several smaller groups. Some of them have overlap, and some do not. It looks familiar to what wikipr was (maybe) doing. Oddly enough none of these accounts are related to the original TimeQueen32/that farm. I'll look more into it but this is anything but clear cut. The issue with all these paid editing cases is you realize there are countless individuals, some are freelancers, some telecommute, some use proxies or vpns. All told, it really just makes things difficult to nail down. ''[[User:NativeForeigner|NativeForeigner]]'' <sup>[[User talk:NativeForeigner|Talk]]</sup> 19:26, 13 March 2014 (UTC)
*There appear to be three groups here, all of which are paid editing, and none of which seem to actually be technically related to TimeQueen. Some of these acoutns coule be meat but are technically clean. ''[[User:NativeForeigner|NativeForeigner]]'' <sup>[[User talk:NativeForeigner|Talk]]</sup> 23:42, 28 March 2014 (UTC)
* {{u|AlFreshCo}} has been renamed as {{u|Sarah1971hubby}}. While the account is technically indistinguishable from {{u|Sarah1971}}, they could be sharing the same computer and Internet connection. [[User:PhilKnight|PhilKnight]] ([[User talk:PhilKnight|talk]]) 22:45, 17 April 2014 (UTC)
* Technically {{impossible}} really. Extremely inconclusive. Only editors whoere were definitely {{confirmed}} have stopped editing and there is no more activity on that range. Several editors were froim areas in Asia with such population density, they could be meat, or they could simply be unrelated and unlucky. Some of these editors may (geographically) have been editing themselves in conjunction with other editors (paid, unpaid?) CU evidence is more or less worthless here with accounts on four continents and extremely disparate hardware. It bears stating that the only thing I've concluded is that these editors are all technically exceedingly {{unlikely}} to be TimeQueen32. Something strange happened here but {{crystalball}} ''[[User:NativeForeigner|NativeForeigner]]'' <sup>[[User talk:NativeForeigner|Talk]]</sup> 23:14, 17 April 2014 (UTC)
