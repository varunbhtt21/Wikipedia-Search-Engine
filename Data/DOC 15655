Only four competitors entered, the smallest entry ever for any competition at Wimbledon. Under the system at that time, Rice should then have played the defending champion, [[Blanche Bingley]], in the All Comers Final, but Bingley did not enter, so Rice had a walkover.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wimbledon : The Official History of the Championships|year=2001|publisher=CollinsWillow|location=London|isbn=0007117078|author=John Barrett|page=30}}</ref>

In the same year, Jacks won the inaugural [[Queen's Club Championship]], beating [[Maud Shackle]] 6–2, 6–1. The following year she lost to Shackle 6–2, 4–6, 6–3.
