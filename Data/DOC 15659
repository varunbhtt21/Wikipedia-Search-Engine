The '''Core Infrastructure Initiative''' ('''CII''') is a project of the [[Linux Foundation]] to fund and support [[free and open-source software]] projects that are critical to the functioning of the Internet and other major information systems. The project was announced on {{date|2014-04-24}} in the wake of [[Heartbleed]], a critical [[security bug]] in [[OpenSSL]] that is used on millions of websites.

OpenSSL is among the first software projects to be funded by the initiative after it was deemed underfunded, receiving only about $2,000 per year in donations.<ref name="cii-pr">{{cite press release | url=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2014/04/amazon-web-services-cisco-dell-facebook-fujitsu-google-ibm-intel | title=Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, Rackspace, VMware and The Linux Foundation Form New Initiative to Support Critical Open Source Projects | publisher=The Linux Foundation | date=24 April 2014}}</ref> The initiative will sponsor two full-time OpenSSL core developers.<ref name="cii-faq" />  In September 2014, the Initiative offered assistance to Chet Ramey, the maintainer of [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], after the [[Shellshock (software bug)|Shellshock]] vulnerability was discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Security-experts-expect-Shellshock-software-bug-to-be-significant/articleshow/43657819.cms|title=Security experts expect 'Shellshock' software bug to be significant|work=The Times of India}}</ref>

==Heartbleed bug==
{{main|Heartbleed}}
[[File:Heartbleed.svg|thumb|140px|Logo representing Heartbleed]]

OpenSSL is an [[open-source license|open-source]] implementation of [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS), allowing anyone to inspect its source code.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Gail|title=Heartbleed: What you should know|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/09/heartbleed-what-you-should-know/|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=9 April 2014}}</ref> It is, for example, used by [[smartphone]]s running the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] and some [[Wi-Fi]] routers, and by organizations including [[Amazon.com]], [[Facebook]], [[Netflix]], [[Yahoo!]], the United States of America's [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[Canada Revenue Agency]].<ref name="Perlroth tech">{{cite news|last=Perlroth|first=Nicole|title=Heartbleed Highlights a Contradiction in the Web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/technology/heartbleed-highlights-a-contradiction-in-the-web.html?_r=0|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 April 2014}}</ref>

On 7 April 2014, OpenSSL's Heartbleed bug was publicly disclosed and fixed.<ref name="timeline">{{cite news|last=Grubb|first=Ben|title=Heartbleed disclosure timeline: who knew what and when|url=http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/heartbleed-disclosure-timeline-who-knew-what-and-when-20140415-zqurk.html|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 April 2014}}</ref> The vulnerability, which had been shipped in OpenSSL's current version for more than two years,<ref name=Buzz>{{cite news|last=Stokel-Walker|first=Chris|title=The Internet Is Being Protected By Two Guys Named Steve|newspaper=[[BuzzFeed]]|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisstokelwalker/the-internet-is-being-protected-by-two-guys-named-st|accessdate=15 May 2014|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> made it possible for hackers to retrieve information such as [[username]]s, passwords and credit card numbers from supposedly secure transactions. At that time, roughly 17% (around half a million) of the Internet's secure web servers certified by [[Certificate authority|trusted authorities]] were believed to be vulnerable to the attack.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mutton|first=Paul|title=Half a million widely trusted websites vulnerable to Heartbleed bug|url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/04/08/half-a-million-widely-trusted-websites-vulnerable-to-heartbleed-bug.html|publisher=[[Netcraft]] Ltd.|date=April 8, 2014}}</ref>

==Open-source software==
According to [[Linus's Law#By Eric Raymond|Linus's Law by Eric S. Raymond]], from Raymond's book ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'', "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."<ref>{{cite book|last=Young|first=Eric S. Raymond ; with a foreword by Bob|title=The Cathedral & the Bazaar Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary.|year=2008|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|location=Sebastopol|isbn=059655396X|page=30|edition=2nd}}</ref> In other words, if there are enough people working on the software, a problem will be found quickly and its fix will be obvious to someone. Raymond stated in an interview that "there weren't any eyeballs" for the Heartbleed bug.<ref name="Perlroth tech"/>

Prior to the CII funding, only one person, Stephen Henson, worked full-time on OpenSSL; Henson approved well over half of the updates to more than 450,000 lines of the OpenSSL's source code.<ref>{{cite news|last=Babbage|title=A heartbeat from disaster|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2014/05/difference-engine|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=6 May 2014}}</ref> Besides Henson, there are three core volunteer programmers. The OpenSSL Project existed on a budget of $2,000 per year in donations, which was enough to cover the electrical bill, and Steve Henson was earning around $20,000 per year.<ref name="Buzz" /> To gather more revenue for the project, Steve Marquess, a consultant for the Defense Department, created the OpenSSL Software Foundation. This allowed programmers to make some money by consulting for organizations that used the code. However, the foundation brought in less than $1 million per year,<ref name="Perlroth tech" /> and the contract work tended to focus on adding new features rather than maintaining the old ones.<ref name="Buzz" />

Other open-source software projects have similar difficulties. For example, the maintainers of [[OpenBSD]], a security-conscious operating system, nearly had to shut the project down in early 2014 because it could not pay the electricity bills.<ref>{{cite news|last=Finley|first=Klint|title=Bitcoin Baron Keeps a Secretive Open Source OS Alive|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/01/openbsd/|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=Wired|date=22 January 2014}}</ref>

==The initiative==
Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, conceived the idea of the Core Infrastructure Initiative not long after Heartbleed was announced, and spent the night of April 23 calling firms for support.<ref name="cnet">{{cite news|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=Tech titans join forces to stop the next Heartbleed|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/tech-titans-join-forces-to-stop-the-next-heartbleed/|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=CNET|date=24 April 2014}}</ref> Thirteen companies responded and joined the initiative: [[Amazon Web Services]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Dell]], [[Facebook]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[NetApp]], [[Rackspace]], [[Qualcomm]] and [[VMware]].<ref name="cii-home">{{cite web | url=https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/ | title=Core Infrastructure Initiative | publisher=The Linux Foundation | accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Finley|first=Klint|title=Twitter Facebook RSS Google, Facebook, and Microsoft Team Up to Stop Another Heartbleed|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/cii/|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=Wired|date=24 April 2014}}</ref> The list was mainly determined by who Zemlin knew.<ref name="cnet" /> Each of the thirteen companies has pledged to donate $100,000 a year for the next three years bringing the initial funding pool to almost $4 million.<ref name="nyt">{{cite web | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/companies-back-initiative-to-support-openssl-and-other-open-source-projects/ | title=Companies Back Initiative to Support OpenSSL and Other Open-Source Projects | publisher=The New York Times | work=Bits | date=24 April 2014 | author=Perlroth, Nicole}}</ref><ref name="zdnet">{{cite news | url=http://www.zdnet.com/cisco-microsoft-vmware-and-other-tech-giants-unite-behind-critical-open-source-projects-7000028743/ | title=Cisco, Microsoft, VMware, and other tech giants unite behind critical open-source projects | work=ZDNet | date=24 April 2014 | author=Vaughan-Nichols, Steven J.}}</ref><ref name="mashable">{{cite news | url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/24/facebook-google-microsoft-join-forces-to-prevent-another-heartbleed/ | title=Facebook, Google, Microsoft Join Forces to Prevent Another Heartbleed | work=Mashable | date=24 April 2014 | author=Warren, Christina}}</ref> An additional five companies{{mdashb}}[[Adobe Systems]], [[Bloomberg L.P.]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Huawei]], and [[Salesforce.com]]{{mdashb}}have since joined the initiative.<ref name="cii-2014-may">{{cite press release | url=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2014/05/core-infrastructure-initiative-announces-new-backers | title=The Linux Foundationâ€™s Core Infrastructure Initiative Announces New Backers, First Projects to Receive Support and Advisory Board Members | publisher=The Linux Foundation | accessdate=23 June 2014 | date=29 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711164342/https://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2014/05/core-infrastructure-initiative-announces-new-backers | archive-date=11 July 2017 | dead-url=yes }}</ref>

The money that the CII pools will be used to fund specific tasks such as providing compensation to developers to work full-time on an open-source software project, conducting reviews and [[Information technology security audit|security audits]], deploying [[Test automation|test infrastructure]], and facilitating travel and face-to-face meetings among developers.<ref name="cii-faq">{{cite web | url=https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/faq | title=Core Infrastructure Initiative FAQ | publisher=The Linux Foundation | accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref>

The CII will be composed of two bodies, a steering committee and an advisory board. The steering committee will be made up of representatives from the member companies and other industry stakeholders<ref name="cii-faq" /><ref name="nyt" /> and the committee will be in charge of identifying target software projects and approving specific funding to those projects. The advisory board, composed of developers and other stakeholders, will provide advice to the steering committee.<ref name="cii-faq" />
