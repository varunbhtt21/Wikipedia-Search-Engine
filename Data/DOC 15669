'''''Long Road Home''''' is the second top ten UK [[studio album]] by British singer-songwriter [[Charlie Simpson]].

On 2 February 2013, it was reported that Simpson had finished writing the follow up to his 2011 solo debut ''[[Young Pilgrim]]'' and he would be heading into the studio with producer [[Steve Osborne]] (U2/Placebo) to start recording in early March.

Simpson spent the summer of 2013 playing on the Vans Warped Tour in the US, which was the first time he has played live as a solo artist in America. During October 2013, Charlie went on a tour of the UK supporting rock band, Deaf Havana. He previewed two new tracks from the forthcoming album "Winter Hymns" and "Ten More Days". In 2014, he be undertook a small run of solo shows in the UK in the lead up to the release of his 2nd solo album.

Simpson said when announcing the release: "The making of this album has been an incredible journey for me, it is probably the hardest record I have ever had to make. It took me a while to find what I was looking for and there were points when I nearly had to go back to the drawing board. However, after taking some much needed time out from writing and all things music related, I came back with a completely fresh perspective and wrote in my opinion, some of the best music I have written in my career so far. It’s an album I am hugely proud of and one I had to fight for which makes it all the more special".<ref name="Charlie's words">{{cite web|url=http://www.charliesimpsonmusic.com/long-road-home/|title=What Charlie says about the album.''|publisher=[[Charlie Simpson]] ([[Charlie Simpson]])|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>

Simpson later revealed that the release date for the album had been delayed until 4 August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Simpson |first1=Charlie |title="HAUNTED" AVAILABLE NOW |url=http://www.charliesimpsonmusic.com/haunted-available-now/ |website=www.charliesimpsonmusic.com |accessdate=2 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205807/http://www.charliesimpsonmusic.com/haunted-available-now/ |archivedate=6 June 2014 |df= }}</ref>

===Critical response===
