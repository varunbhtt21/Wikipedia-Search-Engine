User Zeiglereldercare has been blocked for promotions, and it appears that all of these other usernames are engaged in the same purpose. A minor Alabama politician currently running for state office appears to be using his Wikipedia biography for promotional purposes. According to [http://blog.al.com/press-releases/2014/04/alabama_auditor_candidate_crea.html a blog post] attributed to the subject himself, published less than 2 weeks ago, "Jim Zeigler, a candidate for Alabama State Auditor, is using Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, to reach voters. Zeigler registered the domain name ZeiglerStory.com and linked it to the lengthy Wikipedia article detailing his life."

Seems more like a [[WP:COI/N]] case than an SPI case, in fact.  I suspect that the COI/N noticeboard would reach a conclusion that some or all of the accounts have a conflict of interest, but that is not exactly the same as SPI, alas.   Some of the edits are promotional, and some appear quite proper, so I am unsure whether simply telling the folks about the COI rules would be enough in any case.

*Agree with Collect, this would be better handled at COI/N than SPI.
