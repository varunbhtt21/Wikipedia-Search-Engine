Just listed as a candidate for an election-now looking over the way things work-I believe that this does not quite fit NP:Political. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:47, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': Not sure if this is a candidate for a primary or an actual election I should add-not sure how elections work out there. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:49, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete or redirect'''. No evidence of notability. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 22:38, 29 April 2014 (UTC).
*'''Redirect''': Election contestants should be redirected to their constituency, here it being [[Berhampur (Lok Sabha constituency)]], because that is where their statistics would be recorded. [[User:Wgolf]], i suppose you can boldly do that from next time onwards instead of raising AfDs. §§[[User:Dharmadhyaksha|<font color = "red" >Dharmadhyaksha</font>]]§§ {[[User talk:Dharmadhyaksha|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/Dharmadhyaksha|C]]} 05:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
