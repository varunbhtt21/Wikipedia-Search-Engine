This article is about a VoIP client which appears to fail our [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline]] as it hasn't received significant coverage in multiple, reliable sources. The client also fails [[WP:INTERNET]], as it doesn't have the requisite impact on the world to describe it from an encyclopedic standpoint.

*'''Merge''' to [[Acrobits]] per Stuartyeates. I found a few mentions here and there (there was even a review, although I don't know how reliable the source is), but there doesn't seem to be enough coverage about it. It could instead be mentioned at the company's article.

*'''Merge and redirect''' to [[Acrobits]]- this software has marginally better references than the other current acrobits afd, and though it is not enough to establish notability for a stand-alone article, a merge to the company is appropriate.[[User:Dialectric|Dialectric]] ([[User talk:Dialectric|talk]]) 10:30, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
