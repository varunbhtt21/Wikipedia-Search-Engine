Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''speedy keep'''; nomination has been withdrawn by nominator and there are no outstanding delete !votes. I have also moved the article to [[Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 1, Ishapore]] as per capitalization and punctuation standards.

<s>Might not meet school notability on Wikipedia.
Or maybe it just needs a userfy. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:57, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</s> '''Withdrawn by nominator'''-I'm withdrawing this seeing it is a notable school that needs clean up. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 14:30, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. This is a verifiable 1–12 school. You can try to throw [[WP:NSCHOOL]] at it, but such schools are usually kept. [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 18:43, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-I think the thing is the article is poorly written-surprise nobody marked it until now. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:56, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:*I just did a basic clean up of the article. If it survives AfD, a page move to [[Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 1, Ishapore]] is in order. [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 20:07, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Schools are kept whether we like it or not. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 02:45, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Secondary schools are kept per long-standing consensus and precedent. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 12:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
