[[User:Fredin323]] was blocked on April 18 for edit warring. [[User:Chessandcheckers]] was created on April 19 and continues the same edits of removing sourced content on student demographics at [[California State University, Fresno]] against consensus. Based on the timing and the edits, the two users appear to be the same person. [[User:Bahooka|Bahooka]] ([[User talk:Bahooka|talk]]) 04:10, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

[[User:Chessandcheckers]] is now supporting [[User:Fredin323]] by name on the talk page ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:California_State_University,_Fresno#Student_Demographics here is the diff].) [[User:Bahooka|Bahooka]] ([[User talk:Bahooka|talk]]) 17:25, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

* I came here to file the same SPI case for the exact same reasons as Bahooka. [[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] ([[User talk:ElKevbo|talk]]) 16:52, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

* I do not know Fredin3123 and am not him. I am an alumni of Fresno State. I have started editing that page because I seem to see different versions of the page whenever I look at it. Although I do agree with Fredin3123 that race-based graphs and charts do not belong on this page, there are other edits I do not agree with him (or her?) about. I do wonder if Bahooka is a sockpuppet to other users, since Bahooka is accusing me or exactly the same thing that so-called other users are doing. There seems to be different opinions of what belongs and doesn't belong on this page. Bahooka and ElKevbo seem to be the same person to me because their opinions match. Everyone in question should provide IP addresses to prove they are in fact different people.   <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chessandcheckers|Chessandcheckers]] ([[User talk:Chessandcheckers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chessandcheckers|contribs]]) 17:00, 22 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::For the record, you have also accused Bahooka and Contributor321 of being the same person (in your revert on the California State University, Fresno page at 18:02, 21 April 2014). [[User:Contributor321|Contributor321]] ([[User talk:Contributor321|talk]]) 18:39, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

Also, what exactly is a consensus?   <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chessandcheckers|Chessandcheckers]] ([[User talk:Chessandcheckers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chessandcheckers|contribs]]) 17:02, 22 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*It's certainly {{possible}} that {{User|Chessandcheckers}} is a sock of {{User|Fredin323}} as the geolocation matches, though it's equally likely to be some sort of [[WP:MEAT]] situation.  --[[User:Ponyo|<b><font color="Navy">''Jezebel's''</font></b><font color="Navy">Ponyo</font>]]<sup>[[User_talk:Ponyo|<font color="Navy">''bons mots''</font>]]</sup> 21:13, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
*Giving them the benefit of the doubt here. [[User:Fredin323|Fredin323]] and [[User:Chessandcheckers|Chessandcheckers]], please note that under [[WP:SHARE]], you may be considered one person when editing in the same area. (For example, the two of you must make a total of no more than three reverts in a 24-hour period per [[WP:3RR]].)
