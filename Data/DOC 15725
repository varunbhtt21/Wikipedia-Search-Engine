*'''Keep''' - I have added some sources to the article. There is biographical coverage in ''Billboard'' and Allmusic, plus two album reviews (also in ''Billboard'' and Allmusic), plus having a charting album and top-40 single, which taken together establishes that the subject meets [[WP:MUSIC]] #1 and #2. <small><span style="border:1px solid">[[User:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:black">&nbsp;Gongshow&nbsp;</span>''']]</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color:black">[[User_talk:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:#ffffff">talk</span>''']]</span></small> 09:21, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - A Billboard Top 40 hit and numerous film roles (particularly in softcore productions) make her notable enough. [[Special:Contributions/209.90.140.72|209.90.140.72]] ([[User talk:209.90.140.72|talk]]) 23:58, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Gongshow's sources - An artist who has had a recording chart in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Top 40 will satisfy [[WP:MUSICBIO]] #2. [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 03:09, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
