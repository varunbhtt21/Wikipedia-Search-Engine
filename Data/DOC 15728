[[File:Bell Ironworks at Port Clarence Teesside watercolour by John Bell (1814-1886).jpg|none|100px|Watercolour by John Bell of Bell Brothers ironworks under construction at Port Clarence.]]</div>'''Losh, Wilson and Bell''', later '''Bells, Goodman''', then '''Bells, Lightfoot''' and finally '''Bell Brothers''', was a leading [[Northeast England]] manufacturing company, founded in 1809 by the partners [[William Losh]], [[Thomas Wilson (poet)|Thomas Wilson]], and Thomas Bell.

The firm was founded at [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] with an ironworks and an alkali works nearby at Walker. The alkali works was the first in England to make soda using the [[Leblanc process]]; the ironworks was the first to use the [[Early Jurassic]] [[Cleveland Ironstone Formation|Cleveland Ironstone]], presaging the 1850s boom in ironmaking on Teesside.

The so-called discoverer of Cleveland Ironstone, the mining engineer [[John Vaughan (ironmaster)|John Vaughan]], ran a rolling mill for the company before leaving to found the major rival firm [[Bolckow Vaughan]]. The other key figure in the company was [[Lowthian Bell]], son of Thomas Bell; he became perhaps the best known [[ironmaster]] in England.

As Bell Brothers, the firm continued until 1931, when it was taken over by rival [[Dorman Long]]. ('''[[Losh, Wilson and Bell|see more...]]''')
