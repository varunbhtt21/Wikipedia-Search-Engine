'''International Blind Golf Association''' ('''IBGA''') was established in 1998 as a disabled sports entity to organize, acknowledge and support international [[blindness|blind]] golf (visually impaired and blind golf) tournaments.  As of 2014, it has around 500 registered [[golfers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://internationalblindgolf.com/about|title =About|publisher =International Blind Golf Association|accessdate =2014-04-30|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110910035215/http://www.internationalblindgolf.com/about|archivedate =2011-09-10|df =}}</ref>

==History==
In 1996, [[Haruhisa Handa]] who was the founder of [[Japanese Blind Golf Association]] appealed to blind golf associations around the world to set up a governing organization.  In 1997, World Blind Golfers Conference was held in [[Perth]], Australia where representatives from 6 countries participated to propose the [[articles of association]] and [[Handicapping|handicap]] system.  In 1998, the proposal was resolved at a meeting held during the 5th Blind Golf World Championship in Florida, USA, so that a global governing organization could be established.  Handa was elected as the first president, and David Blyth from Australia became the first chairman (responsible in administration).<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.jbga.org/link/ibga3.php|title =Letter from IBGA - JBGA|publisher =JBGA|accessdate =2014-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.jbga.org/2013japanopen/global.html|title =Blind Golf|publisher =JBGA|accessdate =2014-04-30}}</ref>{{sfn|Haruhisa Handa|2006|p=60}}

There were 8 organizations that took part in the World Blind Golfersâ€™ Conference held in 1997 from 6 countries; Japan, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, England, Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]].  {{sfn|Haruhisa Handa|2006|p=60}}

As of 2014, International Blind Golf Association has 18 member organizations from 16 countries including 4 associate organizations from 4 countries.
