<small>5x expanded by [[User:Vensatry|Vensatry]] ([[User talk:Vensatry|talk]]). Self nominated at 18:10, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] Needs overhaul.  The bolded article certainly was not 5x expanded in the latest edits; it has been a large article for a long time.  Might one of the non-bolded articles have been intended as the lede? == [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 00:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:::* The article is good stuff, it just doesn't meet the 5x expansion criterion.  The main content of the article -- the long table of award winners -- has been there since 2013.  The text additions are new but are not the primary article content. -- [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 14:27, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::::*Even with the case of lists, we should only take the prose size into account and not tables. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;[[User:Vensatry|<font color = "indigo" >'''Vensatry'''</font>]] <sub> [[User talk:Vensatry|<font color = "Indigo" >'''(ping)'''</font>]] </sub></span> 18:27, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Needs a complete review. {{tq|DYK criteria: a) Articles must have a minimum of 1,500 characters of prose (ignoring infoboxes, categories, references, lists, and tables etc.) Proposed lists need 1,500+ characters of prose, aside from the listed items themselves.}} Size of April 17 before expansion, the article was only 2 sentences and 273 characters (0 words) "readable prose size" 273 x 5 = 1,365. Vensatry's Apr 29 expansion brought the readable prose to 2,014 characters. That's without counting the tables.  There is no issue with the 5X expansion - it's good. [[User:Maile66|â€” Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) 22:55, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Article was definitely more than 5x expanded. Expansion began on April 29 from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Film_Award_for_Best_Music_Direction&oldid=604625763 this version] and now has 2014 characters. Hook [http://www.sify.com/carnaticmusic/season2003/fullstory.php?id=14861752 checks out] and is interesting (hook fact is in note section of article). Spotchecks reveal no copyvio issues. Looks good!

:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] The hook is well over 200 characters even if "(pictured)" is not counted, and a new, shorter ALT needs to be proposed and approved before this can be promoted. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 07:37, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::*<s>'''ALT1''' ... that [[A. R.

:::*Suggesting a minor variation on the above:
::::*'''ALT2''' ... that [[A. R. Rahman]], who won India's '''[[National Film Award for Best Music Direction]]''' for ''[[Roja]]'', was initially tied with [[Ilaiyaraaja]] ''(pictured)'' before the jury's chairman cast the deciding vote?
::::What fascinated me most was that Mahendra considered the two to be equal in all categories, so his decisive vote was cast for Rahman because he was a newcomer, even though Ilaiyaraaja was a good friend of his. (Unfortunately, there isn't room to include that in a hook.) [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 20:21, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::{{ping|BlueMoonset}} Yeah, there is no room to at least have Mahendra's name in the hook. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;[[User:Vensatry|<font color = "indigo" >'''Vensatry'''</font>]] <sub> [[User talk:Vensatry|<font color = "Indigo" >'''(ping)'''</font>]] </sub></span> 08:24, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::*Vensatry, are you okay with ALT2? If so, I can ask Ruby2010/2013 to come back and check it (I can't approve it myself). Thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 14:35, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::*Great. [[User:Ruby2010|Ruby2010/2013]], can you please take a look at the ALT hooks and finish the review? Many thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 17:48, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Alt2 looks good to me (length, citation, etc). Sorry I forgot to check the original hook's length; it was an oversight I missed.
