Title : Software taggant
Text : {{Computer-security-stub}}

A '''software taggant''' is a cryptographic signature added to software that enables positive origin identification and integrity of programs. Software taggants are using standard PKI techniques (see [[Public key infrastructure]]) and were introduced by the [[Industry Connections Security Group]] of [[IEEE]] in an attempt to control proliferation of [[malware]] obfuscated via [[executable compression]] ([[runtime packer]]).

The concept of a PKI-based system to mitigate [[runtime packer]] abuse was introduced in 2010<ref>{{cite web|title=Virus Bulletin 2010 Abstract|url=http://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2010/abstracts/ModyMuttikFerrie.xml}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Standards and Policies on Packer Use|url=http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/packerstandards.pdf}}</ref> and described in a [[Black Hat Briefings]] presentation<ref>{{cite web|title=IEEE Taggant System|url=https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Kennedy/BH_US_11_KennedyMuttik_IEEE_Slides.pdf}}</ref> by Mark Kennedy and [[Igor Muttik]]. The '''software taggant''' term was proposed by Arun Lakhotia (due to its similarities with chemical [[taggant]]s) who also analyzed the economics of a packer ecosystem.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game-theory Taggant Ecosystem|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6112319/?tp=&arnumber=6112319&url=http:%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6112319}}</ref>

A '''software taggant''' is a form of [[code signing]] somewhat similar to [[Authenticode]] (which is used for programs operating under [[Microsoft Windows]]). The key differences between a '''software taggant''' and Authenticode are:
* the transparent and free addition of a '''software taggant''' for the end user of a [[runtime packer]]
* a '''software taggant''' may cover small critical areas of the program to minimize the cost of software integrity checking (Authenticode always covers nearly the entire file so the cost of checking linearly depends on the file size)

The '''software taggant''' project is run by [[Industry Connections Security Group|IEEE ICSG]] and has open-source nature - it is hosted on [[GitHub]]<ref>{{cite web|title=IEEE Taggant System Source Code Repository|url=https://github.com/IEEEICSG/IEEE_Taggant_System}}</ref> and relies on [[OpenSSL]]. '''Software taggant''' also helps differentiate many legitimate software from malware which also utilize similar and/or the same anti-tamper technology.
