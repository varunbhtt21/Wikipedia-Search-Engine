</div>"'''Archaeoraptor'''" is the [[genus|generic]] name informally assigned in 1999 to a [[fossil]] from [[China]] in an article published in [[National Geographic Magazine|''National Geographic'' magazine]]. The magazine claimed that the fossil was a "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]" between [[bird]]s and terrestrial [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. Even prior to this publication there had been severe doubts about the fossil's authenticity. It led to a scandal when  evidence demonstrated it to be a [[forgery]] through further scientific study. The forgery was constructed from rearranged pieces of real fossils from different species. Zhou ''et al.'' found that the head and upper body actually belong to a specimen of the primitive fossil bird ''[[Yanornis]]''. A 2002 study found that the tail belongs to a small winged [[dromaeosaur]], ''[[Microraptor]]'', named in 2000. The legs and feet belong to an as yet unknown animal.

The "Archaeoraptor" scandal has ongoing ramifications. The scandal brought attention to illegal fossil deals conducted in China. It also highlighted the need for close scientific scrutiny of purported "missing links" published in journals which are not [[peer review|peer-reviewed]]. The fossil scandal has been used by [[creationism|creationist]]s in attempts to cast doubt on [[Neo-Darwinism|evolutionary theory]]. Although "Archaeoraptor" was a forgery,  many true examples of [[feathered dinosaurs]] have been found and demonstrate the evolutionary connection between birds and other theropods.
