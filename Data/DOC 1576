The first two named socks above have recently (within past year) been spamming [[Thunder Beach Motorcycle Rally]].

Suspect a single editor who is a self-proclaimed owner of the resort/tiki bar which has been re-added to the article several times.

Probably also related, but not as certain due to the time elapsed, these following throwaway SPAs that haven't been used for a few years:
*Thunderbeach12
*'''KBThunder'''

The account in bold has been blocked for promotional-only use.

*I feel like it's more likely meatpuppetry by affiliated people; try [[WP:COI/N]] instead. In any case, there is not enough evidence for [[WP:DUCK]], and a check would be stale. Closing.

Same insertion of promotional material (this time including trademarks!) to [[Thunder Beach Motorcycle Rally]] as last 5 reported socks.

{{clerk-note}} The last report closed with no action (insufficient evidence, suspicion of meat puppetry). I'm not sure I completely agree. However, the IP here made two consecutive edits four days ago. I see little point in taking any action. Closing.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 15:06, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
