[[File:BeebeGuiana.png|none|100px|William Beebe on an expedition to Guiana in 1917.]]</div>'''William Beebe''' was an [[United States|American]] [[natural history|naturalist]], [[ornithologist]], [[marine biologist]], [[entomologist]], [[List of explorers|explorer]], and [[author]]. He is remembered for the numerous expeditions he conducted for the [[New York Zoological Society]], his deep dives in the [[Bathysphere]], and his prolific [[scientific writing]] for both academic and popular audiences.

Born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] Beebe left college before obtaining a degree in order to work at the then newly opened [[Bronx Zoo|New York Zoological Park]], where he was given the duty of caring for the zoo's [[birds]]. Beebe participated in a series of research expeditions, including one intended to document the world's [[pheasant]]s. He published an account of his pheasant expedition titled ''A Monograph of the Pheasants''.

During the course of his expeditions Beebe gradually developed an interest in marine biology, ultimately leading to his 1930s dives in the Bathysphere off the coast of [[Bermuda]]. These dives represented the first time a biologist observed deep-sea animals in their native environment. Later, Beebe returned to the tropics and founded a tropical research station which remains in operation as part of the [[Asa Wright Nature Centre]]. Beebe's research there continued until his death in 1962.

He is also remembered for several theories he proposed about [[avian evolution]] which are now regarded as having been ahead of their time, particularly his 1915 hypothesis that the evolution of bird flight passed through a four-winged or "Tetrapteryx" stage, which has been supported by the 2003 discovery of ''[[Microraptor gui]]''.
