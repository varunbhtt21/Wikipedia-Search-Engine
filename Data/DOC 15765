[[File:Iguanodon1.jpg|none|100px|Two ''Iguanodon'' sculptures at the crystal palace.]]</div>The '''Crystal Palace Dinosaurs''', also known as '''Dinosaur Court''',  are a series of sculptures of extinct [[animal]]s (including [[dinosaur]]s) and [[mammal]]s in [[Crystal Palace Park]], now in the [[London]] borough of [[Bromley]]. Commissioned in 1852 to accompany the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] after its move from the [[Great Exhibition]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and unveiled in 1854, they were the first dinosaur sculptures in the world, pre-dating the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' by six years. While to varying degrees inaccurate by modern standards, the models were designed and sculpted by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] under the scientific direction of Sir [[Richard Owen]], representing the latest scientific knowledge at the time. The models were classed as [[Listed building|Grade II listed buildings]] from 1973, extensively restored in 2002, and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007.

The models represent fifteen [[genus|genera]] of extinct animals, not all dinosaurs. They are from a wide range of geological ages, and include true dinosaurs, [[ichthyosaur]]s, and [[plesiosaur]]s mainly from the [[Mesozoic]] era, and some mammals from the more recent [[Cenozoic]] era.
