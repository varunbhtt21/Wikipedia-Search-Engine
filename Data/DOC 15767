The dinosaurs featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media have been used for both education and entertainment. The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television [[documentary film|documentaries]] of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, or the fantastic, as in the [[monster movie]]s of the 1950s and 1960s.

The growth in interest in dinosaurs since the [[Dinosaur Renaissance]] has been accompanied by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the leading edge of dinosaur science, presenting lively dinosaurs and [[feathered dinosaur]]s as these concepts were first being considered. Cultural depictions of dinosaurs have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public.

Cultural depictions have also created or reinforced misconceptions about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, such as inaccurately and anachronistically portraying a sort of "prehistoric world" where many kinds of extinct animals (from the [[Permian]] animal ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' to [[mammoth]]s and [[caveman|cavemen]]) lived together, and dinosaurs living lives of constant combat.

Other misconceptions reinforced by cultural depictions came from a scientific consensus that has now been overturned, such as the alternate usage of ''dinosaur'' to describe something that is maladapted or obsolete, or dinosaurs as slow and unintelligent.
