[[File:Archaeopteryx lithographica (Berlin specimen).jpg|none|100px|The Berlin specimen of ''Archaeopteryx''.]]</div>A '''transitional fossil''' is any [[fossil]]ized remains of a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve as a reminder that taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, we can't assume transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.

In 1859, when [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was first published, the fossil record was poorly known. Indeed, ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was discovered just two years later and represents a classic transitional form between dinosaurs and birds. [[List of transitional fossils|Many more transitional fossils]] have been discovered since then, and there is now abundant evidence of how all [[class (biology)|classes]] of [[vertebrate]]s are related, much of it in the form of transitional fossils. The phrase '''''[[#Missing links|missing link]]''''' has been used extensively in popular writings on human evolution to refer to a perceived gap in the hominid evolutionary record. It is most commonly used to refer to any new transitional fossil finds. Scientists, however, do not use the term, as it refers to a pre-evolutionary view of nature.
