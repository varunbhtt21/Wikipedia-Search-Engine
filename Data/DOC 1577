;Evidence submitted by [[User:Hiberniantears|Hiberniantears]]
For background, this is the most helpful of the previous cases to read through: [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Shuppiluliuma]] last year.

This time through, I blocked Shiham K as an obvious sock, but requesting a CU for all underlying IP ranges. Currently appears to be editing from 85.153.27.4 and the associated range out of Istanbul. I have previously blocked an IP range out of Milan, Italy, and could greatly benefit from a comprehensive look at this editor's IPs. 

Additionally, I blocked [[User:Hekatonesos]] as another obvious sock, and suspect that [[User:Truthspeaks11]] is probably him as well. For a little additional background, Shuppiluliuma edits from dynamic IPs, and has created at least dozens of sleeper accounts over the years. I'm looking for multiple IP ranges that can be blocked, and a list of sleeper accounts. 

In fairness, whoever this guy is, he makes a fair number of helpful contributions. However, every couple of months he goes off the rails and starts antagonizing other editors at pages generally related to [[Turkey]]. This has now been going on for years (in fact, my initial run in with him back in Spring 2007 killed my first attempt at RfA). Lately, I have been giving him space so long as he behaves, and because chasing his socks around is a bit like a dog chasing its tail. In the case of Shiham, I was fairly certain all along that it was Shuppiluliuma from day 1, but let him be until another administrator reached out to me for my opinion on whether it was him or not. When he began an edit war this week over an image of Turkish money, I blocked him, but as you can see from the growing list above, he hasn't really missed a beat. Because of the number of sleeper accounts and IPs from different ranges that Shuppiluliuma uses, it is very difficult to regularly keep an eye out for him as the pages he edits already tend to have many editors of various nationalist POVs. My request for a very thorough CU here is aimed at avoiding mistakenly identifying innocent editors making newbie mistakes, as well as finding a more effective way to create a stable environment around pages like Turkey. Obviously, if we get flagged revisions off the ground, life becomes a lot easier for those of us watching pages that are impacted by editors like Shuppiluliuma... but in the mean time, I would really appreciate a deep look at this by a CU.

======<span style="font-size:150%"> Evidence submitted by [[User:Athenean]] </span>======
[[User:StanStun]] appears to be the latest in a long list of socks by the dreadful [[User:Shuppiluliuma]].  This case screams WP:DUCK pretty loudly.  Specifically:

*Identical interests with previous Shuppiluliuma socks: [[Turkey]], Turkish cities (esp. [[Istanbul]]), [[Economy of Turkey]], [[Turkish Navy]], [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union]].  Compare the contribs for {{userlinks|StanStun}} with those of previous Shupp socks: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&contribs=user&target=Lancaster+Beaufighter] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&contribs=user&target=Pipebag] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ay%C3%A7a_Leovinus] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&target=Shuppiluliuma] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Lortatl%C4%B1s%C4%B1] and many many others.
*Identical editing style, lots of small incremental edits in a row.
*Turkish nationalist agenda, e.g. denial of the [[Armenian genocide]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=358521168], and also promotion of Turkey, particularly it's European credentials [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union&diff=prev&oldid=358764844] and economy [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Turkey&action=historysubmit&diff=351554645&oldid=351066296].
*Stubborn edit-warring accompanied with extreme hostility and trolling, e.g. here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=357926821] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Istanbul&diff=prev&oldid=358688529].  
*Same MO as previous socks, a few edits to random articles at first, before focusing exclusively on Turkey articles with a WP:OWN mentality, as for example with this sock [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&contribs=user&target=Mokoko+24-7].

Standard Shuppiluliuma sock.  

*As soon as the latest Shup sock, {{userlinks|StanStun}} was discovered and blocked, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&page=User:StanStun], this account picks up right where he left off with the maniacal removal of any mention of the [[Armenian Genocide]] from [[Turkey]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=359326908], which i had restored only a few hours previously [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&action=historysubmit&diff=359312967&oldid=359273258].  Note the reverts by StanStun and Iceman are identical.

*Identical interests:  [[Turkey]], [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union]], [[Turkish Armed Forces]], Turkey geography articles [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Iceman_rides_your_tail].  Compare the contribs of the Iceman account and the suspected IPs with the contribs of the StanStun account and previous Shuppiluliuma socks: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&contribs=user&target=Lancaster+Beaufighter] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&contribs=user&target=Pipebag] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ay%C3%A7a_Leovinus] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&target=Shuppiluliuma] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Lortatl%C4%B1s%C4%B1]. 

*Identical editing style, lots of small incremental edits to geography articles, e.g. on [[Heybeliada]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heybeliada&action=historysubmit&diff=363536999&oldid=355886340] (compare with [[Trabzon]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trabzon&offset=20100509014816&action=history]).

*Same level of English, stubborn edit-warring over keeping any mention of the Armenian Genocide out of Turkey:  StanStun: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=358521168]  Iceman: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=359326908] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=363859690] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=363885655] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=364057914] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=364063842].  [[User:Athenean|Athenean]] ([[User talk:Athenean|talk]]) 05:57, 25 May 2010 (UTC)  

A checkuser is necessary, since the evidence shows this was a sleeper account.  He could well have more and uses a wide IP range.  The maniacal tenacity of this individual is not to be underestimated.  He has created something like 100 socks so far.  Something more than a simple block is necessary, otherwise he will be at it again in no time

Latest of the innumerable socks by user:Shuppluliuma.  Primary interests are [[Turkey]] and Turkish military articles [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=50&tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Ben+diyom+Angara&namespace=&tagfilter=&year=&month=-1].  There is a simple, foolproof way to detect his socks:  Because most of the articles he likes to edit (Turkey, Turkish Air Force, etc...) are semi-protected, he needs to rack up a number of edits on non-semiprotected articles.  So the first thing he does after creating the new account is to make a few edits to non-semied articles before editing his favorite articles.  Interestingly, these first few edits are always related to the new sock's name, it's as if each of his socks has a "theme".  I noticed this with his sock {{user|Mokoko 24-7}}, which edited a few Japan related articles, then as soon as he reached 20 edits or so, immediately switched to [[Turkey]] and never looked back [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Mokoko_24-7&dir=prev&target=Mokoko+24-7].  The first edits by Ben diyom Angora are to topics related to the Turkish capital Ankara (of which "Angara" is an alternate spelling and "Ben diyom Angara means "I sent him to Ankara").  Then, after those edits, it's back to the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] and [[Turkey]].  Also, Shuppiluliuma and socks love to make lots of small consecutive edits to articles, endlessly tweaking them, much like Ben dioym Angara.  Ben diyom Angora thus fits the pattern perfectly. [[User:Athenean|Athenean]] ([[User talk:Athenean|talk]]) 20:21, 2 July 2012 (UTC)

Regarding the checkuser, he has at least two socks that were active until a few days/weeks ago, [[User:Namuslu]] and [[User:Türbanistan]], so they can be used for checkuser purposes.  His older accounts are of course stale. [[User:Athenean|Athenean]] ([[User talk:Athenean|talk]]) 21:32, 3 July 2012 (UTC)

Although there has been a long time since the last disruption by the socks of Lord of Rivendell, long enough to render a CU check impossible, I open this SPI based on rather [[WP:DUCK|loud quacking]]. I think there is enough evidence to firmly establish the relation between sock and master. {{duck}} [[User:Dr.K.|Δρ.Κ.]]&nbsp;<small><sup style="position:relative">[[User talk:Dr.K.|λόγος]]<span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-5.5ex;*left:-5.5ex">[[Special:Contributions/Dr.K.|πράξις]]</span></sup></small> 19:27, 24 April 2015 (UTC)
;<big>Evidence</big>
*Heavy edit-concentration on Turkey accompanied by incessant edit-warring
*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Lord_of_Rivendell Master got indeffed due to edit-warring], sock is blocked due to edit-warring on [[Turkey]] even as the 3RRN report was ongoing, a [[special:diff/659005594|fact noted by the blocking admin]]. The sock was finally blocked after he reached 6 reverts. 
;Edit-warring on Turkey about the same sources and victim numbers of the Armenian Genocide
*'''Keywords:''' Encyclopædia Britannica, Tehcir Law, Arnold J. Toynbee and Justin McCarthy
*'''Key number''': 600,000

*[[Istanbul]]
*[[Turkish Armed Forces]]
*[[Turkish Land Forces]]
*[[Turkish Naval Forces]]
*[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]
*[[Galatasaray S.K.]]

;Similar mode of sock insertion

;Similar MO of socks once inserted
* 武士道 started his edits by editing Japanese articles while Лев Я́шин started editing Russia-related articles. Soon after that they started heavily concentrating on Turkey and edit-warring there. By the way Лев Я́шин is [[Lev Yashin]], a legendary Russian goalkeeper.

;Similar layout of user pages
*Superfluous man has a single picture decorating his user page with the caption "Superfluous man" while Lord of Rivendell had a picture of Rivendell with the caption "Rivendell". 

;Edit-warring is the strongest common thread of all the socks
*As mentioned above, Superfluous man was edit-warring while the 3RRN report was open and got blocked at 6R. [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RRArchive254#User:Dr.K. and User:Elmasmelih reported by User:武士道 (Result: Submitter blocked)| Please see also User:Dr.K. and User:Elmasmelih reported by User:武士道 (Result: Submitter blocked)]] where the [[Bushido]] ([[武士道]]) sock was impacted by a [[WP:BOOMERANG]]. The master's edit-warring does not need further mention for obvious reasons.

;Sock has violated 3RR again after release from block
*Hours after release from block and while the previous edit-warring report is still at 3RRN {{Diff|Turkey|659276410|659273046|the sock reinstated his/her edit}} and has performed a total of four reverts so far.

{{userlinks|Shuppiluliuma}} is a banned user and particularly prolific sockmaster, with close to 100 outed socks.  He has a penchant for unstoppable edit-warring and extreme incivility that crosses the line into hate speech, particularly in edit summaries.  One of his innumerable socks, {{userlinks|Pantepoptes}} made the following comment in an edit-summary long ago [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erzurum&diff=prev&oldid=304618008], taunting Armenian users about Armenia's "3 million population" and "11 billion GDP".  The account {{userlinks|Heimdallr of Æsir}}, which I suspected of being a sock due to the similarity in hate speech, was blocked today for 24 hrs for edit-warring.  He was also participating in this talkpage discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Turkey&oldid=680907009#Banning_the_term_.27Turkish_Kurdistan.27_in_this_article].  Immediately after the block, he edited the discussion as an IP, making the following comment [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATurkey&type=revision&diff=680900523&oldid=680900054].  It couldn't quack any louder.  CU is desirable to ferret out sleeper accounts.  Frankly, considering the magnitude and incredible tenacity of this maniac (he has been socking since 2007), it seems a rangeblock is the only way to put an end to the disruption.  All his IP edits are from the 88.251 IP. [[User:Athenean|Athenean]] ([[User talk:Athenean|talk]]) 00:18, 14 September 2015 (UTC)

*An obsessive attention to detail, reflected in the many incremental minor quality control edits, and the lack of spelling mistakes.

See the discussion at WP:ANI section "WP:BATTLEFIELD threats and constant edit-warring at Turkey" as of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=681064764 right now].  The user is aggressively editing on Turkish topics; I blocked him yesterday for edit-warring on [[Turkey]] (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&action=history&year=2015&month=9 recent history]), and an IP that's seemingly him has been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:turkey&action=history&year=2015&month=9 active on the talk page], advocating the position that Heimdallr was trying to force into the article.  Over at WP:ANI, someone adds a note:<blockquote>Heimdallr of Æsir has a name from Norse mythology. (To see the connection to Lord of the Rings, Google for 'Heimdallr Tolkien'). Based on his choice of user name and his interest in Turkey, this editor is most likely the same person as [[WP:Sockpuppet investigations/Lord of Rivendell]]. [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] ([[User talk:EdJohnston|talk]]) 21:06, 14 September 2015 (UTC).</blockquote>This seems like a convincing argument to me.

Actually Lord of Rivendell and Heimdallr are both socks of the original sockmaster, {{userlinks|Shuppiluliuma}}. The aggressive POV is the same, the insults to Greek and Armenian users are the same, the "Ethnically themed sock" is the same, the many consecutive minor grammar edits are the same, the consistent use of wikilinks in edit summaries is the same.  The smoking gun is this edit summary by one of Shuppiluliuma's socks [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erzurum&diff=prev&oldid=304618008], where he taunts Armenian users about "Armenia's 3 million people and 11 billion GDP".  The IP sock of Heimdallr made the same exact taunt at Talk:Turkey a few days ago [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATurkey&type=revision&diff=680900523&oldid=680900054].  They are all the same guy.  I've opened an SPI on Heimdallr here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Shuppiluliuma], I think these should all be merged.

;<big>Introduction</big>
In the tradition of the recent sock incarnations of the {{u|Lord of Rivendell}} this new sock makes a few initial token edits on some articles and then starts the edit-warring on his favourite article: {{la|Turkey}}.

;<big>Evidence</big>
;Name
*The name of this sock is related to the mythology surrounding the saga of [[Harry Potter]]: [[Protego Totalum]]. The other socks also have names inspired by similar magic-related mythologies, as the one of the [[Lord of the Rings]].
;Edit-warring on Turkey
*In the unbroken and time-honoured tradition of all the other socks, Protego T also makes his/her last stand by edit-warring on Turkey.
;Elaborate edit-summaries
*All socks belonging to this sockfarm use up most of the edit-summary field writing elaborate edit-summaries to justify their edit-warring.
*[[special:diff/683474847|Heimdallr of Æsir]] vs. [[special:diff/696197990|Protego T writing a mini Bachelor's thesis inside his/her edit-summary]]

;Comment by [[User:Athenean]]
I also strongly suspect this is a sock of Shuppililiuma/Lord of Rivendell.  The last sock was blocked back in September and this would be right around the time this user would create another sock.  This new account, created a few days ago knows how to edit-wikipedia and is clearly a sock. What made me suspect it was the latest sock of Shuppiluliuma is 
# A few token edits to get past the semiprotection on [[Turkey]], and once that is done, almost exclusive focus on [[Turkey]]
# Incessant edit-warring: this user simple ''cannot'' not edit-war.  Even though all his previous socks have been blocked for edit-warring, he keeps doing it.  He just ''can't'' not edit-war.
# Meticulous attention to detail, lots of small quality control edits to [[Turkey]] in keeping with this individual's obsessive nature.
# Long-winded edit-summaries without any typos or grammatical mistakes
# Frequent use of wikilinks in the edit-summaries, whenever possible.  This is a signature of this user. [[User:Athenean|Athenean]] ([[User talk:Athenean|talk]]) 05:22, 22 December 2015 (UTC)

A typical "themed" Shuppiluliuma sock, this time named after a street in the city of [[Thessaloniki]] (Egnatias avenue). He makes a few edits to Thessaloniki to get around the semi-protection of [[Turkey]], and then edits exclusively [[Turkey]] almost exclusively, pushing Turkish nationalist POV [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&diff=prev&oldid=866582203] and then lots of consecutive small edits to Turkey, as usual.

Identical in behavior to previous socks:
# Makes a few token edits to non-semiprotected articles, to get past the semiprotection at [[Turkey]], and once that is done focuses exclusively on Turkey.
# Many small incremental edits to [[Turkey]] in quick succession. 
#Same Turkish nationalist POV (e.g. against Kurds [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&type=revision&diff=880947017&oldid=880946796]). [[User:Khirurg|Khirurg]] ([[User talk:Khirurg|talk]]) 16:13, 30 January 2019 (UTC)
