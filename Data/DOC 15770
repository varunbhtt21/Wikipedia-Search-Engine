This article is about a VoIP client that fails [[WP:N|our general notability guildeine]] as well as [[WP:WEB]] as it hasn't received significant coverage in multiple, [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], nor has it made a significant impact in its field.

*'''Delete''' - software article of unclear notability, lacking significant coverage in reliable sources.  Page only has 2 refs: Voipmonitor.net is regurgitated press release,  and the OnSip.com on its own is not sufficient to establish notability. Article was created by an [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|SPA]] as possibly promotional.[[User:Dialectric|Dialectric]] ([[User talk:Dialectric|talk]]) 23:04, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge and redirect''' to [[Acrobits]]. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 21:39, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Did not find any independent reliable sources with significant (or any) coverage about the topic, after an admittedly fairly brief search. (I don't consider the currently-cited onsip.com or voipmonitor.net to be reliable sources). I don't agree with merging because the information currently in the article does not cite an independent reliable source, and I don't agree with redirecting the title because I just don't see the purpose of it.
