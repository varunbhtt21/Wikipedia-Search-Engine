'''The Marina affair'''  is a  French judicial and administrative affair connected with the death of   Marina Sabatier in France in August   2009, at the age of 8 years, as a result of the abuse inflicted by her two parents Éric Sabatier and Virginie Darras, and at the end of a life of maltreatment  suffered by the child.

At the end of a trial in June 2012 in the Court of Assizes of the French department  the [[Sarthe (département)|Sarthe]], the parents were sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, without possibility of parole for  a period of  20 years, for acts of torture and barbarity on Marina over a duration of approximately 6 years that led to  their daughter's death. The couple,  moving frequently to complicate investigations, concealed violence on Marina by systematic untrue statements on the origin of the girl's injuries, and were even helped by Marina, who, like many abused children, continued despite everything to love her parents and  never denounced them.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/15/comment-la-petite-marina-a-protege-ses-parents-maltraitants-de-la-justice_1718983_3224.html « Comment la petite Marina a protégé ses parents »], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 15 June 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/26/marina-je-t-ai-negligee-humiliee-jusqu-a-te-torturer-et-toi-tu-nous-as-aimes-jusqu-a-nous-proteger_1724853_3224.html « proces parents Marina »], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 26 June 2012</ref>

Going beyond  the direct responsibility of both parents, major questions were  asked on the efficacy and  responsibility of different public departments in France for child abuse prevention, which, despite  many warning signals transmitted by persons having had direct contact with Marina, did not prevent the little girl's death.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/19/proces-des-parents-de-marina-les-services-sociaux-n-ont-repere-aucun-danger-immediat_1721016_3224.html « Proces des parents de Marina: les services sociaux n'ont repere aucun danger immédiat »], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 19 June 2012</ref><ref>[http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/581943-proces-marina-pour-nous-l-etat-est-un-complice-silencieux.html « Pour nous l'état est un complice silencieux »], ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', 28 June 2012</ref><ref>[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20120618.AFP9792/proces-marina-les-services-sociaux-qui-ont-tarde-a-reagir-attendus-a-la-barre-pour-s-expliquer.html « les services sociaux qui ont tardé à réagir attendus à la barre pour s'expliquer »], ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', 18 June 2012</ref><ref name="Europe 1">[http://www.europe1.fr/Faits-divers/Marina-morte-apres-6-ans-de-tortures-1122273/ « Marina morte après 6 ans de tortures »], ''[[Europe 1]]'', 11 June 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.directmatin.fr/article/39213 « Marina aurait pu être sauvée 1000 fois »], ''[[Direct Matin|Directmatin.fr]]'', 16 June 2012</ref>

== Résumé of Marina's maltreatment ==
Marina Sabatier was the daughter of Éric Sabatier and Virginie Darras. An unwanted child, she was born  on February 27, 2001 and taken onto care, but  retrieved by her mother one month later, who reestabilshed  a relationship with Éric Sabatier after a separation begun during pregnancy.
Virginie Darras already had a son by another union, and, after the birth of Marina, would eventually have a total of  4 other children with Éric Sabatier.

Violence on Marina began probably from her early age. Marina had a  crooked  finger since about 1 year of age, supposedly due to a fall from her high chair. Over several years and until the fateful night of August 2009, Marina was a  [[child abuse|maltreated child]]. Only Marina  underwent cruel and inhuman treatment, and the other children of the family were  spared this abuse.
Parents regularly give Marina kicks, punches, lashings with belts and iron bars, and inflicted numerous other abuses, such as cold showers, holding her head under water in the bathtub, forcing her to eat salt, vinegar and vomit, and starving her for several days at a time.<ref name="details-de-la-maltraitance">[http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2012/06/15/01016-20120615ARTFIG00585-les-details-de-la-maltraitance-de-la-petite-marina-emeuvent.php « Les details de la maltraitance de la petite marina emeuvent »], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 15 June 2012</ref> They imposed punishments such as walking her barefoot over rough ground carrying a heavy bag, and sometimes gagged their daughter with duct tape, or  fastened her to her bed.

In 2006, a sister of Virginia Darras became worried after witnessing the  beatings inflicted on her niece. Marina's grandmother  contacted the  maltreatment hotline but was unable to  convince  that her report was serious.

In 2007, at Marina'a school of [[Parennes]] in the Sarthe region of France, teachers  suspected  maltreatment and informed  the school doctor who after meeting Éric Sabatier detected no problem and believed the father's explanations of   a mysterious genetic disease.

After a move in May 2008, the family arrived in [[:fr:Saint-Denis-d'Orques|Saint-Denis-d'Orques]]. The school headmistress received from Marina's  old school information about  suspicions of abuse. The headmistress,  joined in her efforts by the school doctor,  rapidly  pointed out Marina'a case to the social services of the  public prosecutor's office.

An investigation was opened and in July 2008, during a meeting with a medical examiner who had counted more than 19 injuries on the little girl, Éric Sabatier claimed that all of Marina's lesions were accidents of everyday life.<ref name="médecin legiste">[http://pays-de-la-loire.france3.fr/info/marina--le-temoignage-bouleversant-74447288.html « Marina le temoignage bouleversant »], ''[[France 3 Pays de la Loire]]'', 14 June 2012</ref>

July 23, 2008, the girl was heard alone by two police constables who questioned her about all her scars. The examination, video recorded and which would be screened at the parents' trial in June 2012, showed a girl small for her age, smiling, bright and laughing, who never failed to give an innocent explanation of each and every  mark on her body.<ref name="Gendarme">[http://www.ouest-france.fr/region/normandie_detail_-Marina.-Face-aux-gendarmes-le-mensonge-poignant-pour-proteger-ses-parents_39382-2087041_actu.Htm « face aux gendarmes, le mensonge poignant pour protéger ses parents »], ''[[Ouest-France]]'', 14 June 2012</ref><ref name="Gendarme 2">[http://www.lecourrier-lecho.fr/2012/06/15/proces-marina-rires-larmes-et-tremblements/ « Procès Marina, rires larmes et tremblements »], ''Le petit Courrier, l’écho de la Vallée du Loir'', 15 June 2012</ref>

At the trial in June 2012, Virginie Darras recalled having threatened her daughter that she would never see her parents  again and that they could go to jail if she spoke to the police.

Numerous testimonies showed that Marina had always continued to love her parents and that her  untrue explanations of  her injuries were intended to protect her parents.<ref name="amour">[http://www.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/societe/assises-la-petite-marina-aimait-ses-parents-malgre-les-coups-repetes_1126627.html « La petite Marina aimait ses parents malgré les coups répétés »], ''[[L'Express]]'', 14 June 2012</ref>

The police constable in charge of the investigation never met the officials who originated   the alert,<ref name="ASE accuse">[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20120618.AFP9792/proces-marina-les-services-sociaux-qui-ont-tarde-a-reagir-attendus-a-la-barre-pour-s-expliquer.html « Les services sociaux qui ont tardé à réagir attendus à la barre pour s'expliquer »], ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', 18 June 2012</ref> and on October 10, 2008, the investigation by the public prosecutor's office was terminated without further action.

On its side, the child welfare service  (L'aide sociale à l'enfance (l'[[:fr:Aide sociale à l'enfance|ASE]]))   of the Sarthe enquired on 9 March 2009 of  the outcome of the investigation opened by the public prosecutor's office of the French city [[le Mans]] and in April 2009, called for an evaluative investigation  after a new report of the headmaster of Marina's school. The document sent by the school referred to "repeated and unjustified absenteeism, small unexplained injuries, and a bulimic behaviour".

On April 27, 2009, Marina returned from vacation with serious foot injuries. She was in a new school in  [[:fr:Coulans-sur-Gée|Coulans-sur-Gée]]. The school headmistress and the school doctor urgently sent her  to  hospital for treatment where she stayed for 5 weeks. The hospital vainly sought a medical explanation for  the little girl's state, then reported to social services  suspicions of abuse.
Despite this, on May 28, 2009 the little girl was returned to her family.

The investigation by the child welfare service ([[:fr:Aide sociale à l'enfance|ASE]]) could only begin on May 25, 2009 and in June 2009, the  social worker responsible for the investigation and a nursery nurse visited the Sabatier family. They detected "no element of danger" with children who were "relaxed and smiling".<ref name="danger immediat">[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/19/proces-des-parents-de-marina-les-services-sociaux-n-ont-repere-aucun-danger-immediat_1721016_3224.html « Les services sociaux n'ont repéré aucun danger immédiat »], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 19 June 2012</ref>

Marina died during the night of  the 6 to 7 August 2009 as a result of  a particularly brutal session of abuse that evening by her parents.<ref name="bonne nuit">[http://www.europe1.fr/Faits-divers/Marina-Bonne-nuit-maman-a-demain-1136891/ « Bonne nuit Maman à demain »], ''[[Europe 1]]'', 19 June 2012</ref> Before being left  naked in the cellar before nightfall, she allegedly uttered her last words that she had "mal à la tête" (a headache) and followed by  "bonne nuit maman à demain" (goodnight, Mummy, see you  tomorrow).<ref name="bonne nuit" />

On September 9, 2009 Éric Sabatier alerted the gendarmerie of the disappearance of his daughter. He stated  at the time to investigators that Marina had Down syndrome.<ref name="bbc news">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8253393.stm « Parents "dumped body in concrete" »], ''[[BBC News]]'', 13 September  2009</ref><ref name="daily mail">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1213185/Parents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder.html « Parents who claimed that daughter was kidnapped are charged with her murder »], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 5 June 2012</ref><ref name="Telegraph Verdict">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9357782/French-parents-guilty-of-torturing-8-year-old-daughter-to-death.html « French parents guilty of torturing 8-year-old daughter to death  »], ''[[Daily Telegraph (journal)|Daily Telegraph]]'', 27 June 2012</ref> But this was a ruse to explain his daughter's appearance in some photographs. In reality, Marina  was a normal little girl who after years of head beatings had finally become disfigured. After three days of searching, investigators discovered inconsistencies in the information provided by the parents. Then the parents confessed. The father led investigators to the girl's body, which was enclosed in a plastic crate filled with concrete, wrapped in a sheet  and 10 plastic bags.<ref name="Europe 1"/><ref name="bbc news">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8253393.stm « Parents "dumped body in concrete" »], ''[[BBC News]]'', 13 September  2009</ref>

The pathologist stated  at the parents' trial and after the autopsy  that the causes of death were from an acute subdural haematoma, caused by a shock on the head, accumulated with  asphyxiation by immersing repeatedly the head of the little girl under water and  compounded by hypothermia and inhalation of vomit. During a coma due to the shock on the head and a major pulmonary oedema, Marina died around 4 am  on 7 August 2009.<ref name="pathologiste">[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2012/06/20/97001-20120620FILWWW00525-marina-est-morte-d-un-choc-a-la-tete.php « Marina est morte d'un choc à la tête »], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 20 June 2012</ref>

== The trial of the parents ==
The trial of Marina's two parents  took place from the 11 to 26 June 2012 in the Court of Assizes ([[Cour d'assises (France)|cour d’assises]])   of the Sarthe, France.<ref name="daily mail">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1213185/Parents-claimed-daughter-kidnapped-charged-murder.html « Parents who claimed that daughter was kidnapped are charged with her murder »], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 5 June 2012</ref> Four of the most important childhood protection associations   in France  assisted (more precisely, in French law these associations  at the trial "se sont portées parties civiles"), a first for this type of trial, for, according to one of the counsel for one of them,  this exceptional  trial should be exemplary.<ref name="you tube">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAJ7wVUHCMA « L'interview de Rodolphe Costantino, avocat d'Enfance et Partage »], ''[[YouTube]]'', 5 June 2012</ref>

Many witnesses were interviewed to try to understand the way   Marina's case was pursued by the institutions. Targeted from before the start of trial by the reproaches of the childhood protection associations, the child welfare service  (ASE)  received a note from the president of the General Council (le président du conseil général de la Sarthe, Jean-Marie Geveaux) who supported them and denied any fault of its services

Regarding the parents, even if they had generally acknowledged the facts and expressed regret, the trial did not  really enable comprehension of their motives and the origin of the  treatment suffered by Marina,  singled out from her siblings.
Two particularly poignant trial scenes were  the film viewing   of Marina's examination by two police constables in July 2008 and the testimony of Marina's elder half-brother, 13 years old at the time of the trial, who expressed his resentment towards his parents who had manipulated him  for years in  asking  him to lie to the entourage about things that he did not really know at the time whether they were "normal".<ref name="Emotion">[http://www.lemans.maville.com/actu/actudet_-Proces-Marina.-Les-journalistes-de-la-redaction-repondent-a-vos-questions_52734-2178287_actu.Htm « Les journalistes de la rédaction répondent à vos questions »], ''[[Le Maine libre]]'', 27 June 2012</ref>

The day of the verdict on June 26, both parents were  sentenced to  30 years imprisonment, without possibility of parole for a period of 20 years, for acts of torture and barbarity leading to the death of their 8-year-old daughter in 2009.<ref name="Telegraph Verdict">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9357782/French-parents-guilty-of-torturing-8-year-old-daughter-to-death.html « French parents guilty of torturing 8-year-old daughter to death  »], ''[[Daily Telegraph (journal)|Daily Telegraph]]'', 27 June 2012</ref><ref name="Verdict le Monde">[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/26/assises-de-la-sarthe-les-parents-de-marina-condamnes-a-30-ans-de-reclusion_1724742_3224.html « Les parents de Marina condamnes a 30 ans de prison »], ''[[Le monde (journal)|Le Monde]]'', 26 June 2012</ref><ref name="Verdict">[http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2012/06/26/les-parents-de-marina-condamnes-a-30-ans-de-prison_829200 « Les parents de Marina condamnes a 30 ans de prison »], ''[[Libération (journal)|Libération]]'', 26 June 2012</ref>

The public prosecutor (l'avocat général) Hervé Drevard said that the little girl Marina had not had the  protection she deserved due to the  lack of perspicacity and pugnacity of the professionals responsible for children's protection  including the public prosecutor's office.<ref name="echec parquet">[http://pays-de-la-loire.france3.fr/2012/06/25/30-ans-au-moins-requis-contre-les-parents-de-marina-37945.html « 30 ans au moins requis contre les parents de Marina »], ''[[France 3 Pays de la Loire]]'', 26 June 2012</ref>  The associations for childhood protection, who assisted in the trial, affirmed that Marina could have been saved from her murderous parents if the administrators and institutions responsible for   childhood protection had better played their role.<ref name="echec parquet">[http://pays-de-la-loire.france3.fr/2012/06/25/30-ans-au-moins-requis-contre-les-parents-de-marina-37945.html « 30 ans au moins requis contre les parents de Marina »], ''[[France 3 Pays de la Loire]]'', 26 June 2012</ref>

==  The Marina affair: controversy over institutional failures  ==

In view of the longevity  of Marina's torture, approximately 6  years,  and that this had many times been officially  reported, the  inadequate  action to protect the girl by various state institutions provoked criticism and condemnation by several  childhood  protection associations.<ref name="danger immediat">[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/19/proces-des-parents-de-marina-les-services-sociaux-n-ont-repere-aucun-danger-immediat_1721016_3224.html « Les services sociaux n'ont repéré aucun danger immédiat »], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 19 June 2012</ref><ref name="Telegraph Verdict">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9357782/French-parents-guilty-of-torturing-8-year-old-daughter-to-death.html « French parents guilty of torturing 8-year-old daughter to death  »], ''[[Daily Telegraph (journal)|Daily Telegraph]]'', 27 June 2012</ref><ref name="you tube"/><ref name="Brousse BFM TV">[http://www.bfmtv.com/marina-aurait-pu-etre-sauvee-selon-plusieurs-actu29761.html « Interview de Martine Brousse sur BFM TV »] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817231531/http://www.bfmtv.com/marina-aurait-pu-etre-sauvee-selon-plusieurs-actu29761.html |date=17 August 2012 }}, ''[[BFM TV]]'', 25 June 2012</ref><ref name="Critique service sociaux">[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20120618.AFP9870/proces-des-parents-de-marina-les-services-sociaux-sur-le-gril.html « Les services sociaux sur le grill »], ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', 18 June 2012</ref><ref name="Avocat Innocence en danger">[http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuLocale_-Marina.-Parquet-et-conseil-general-vont-etre-attaques-en-justice_6346-2090957-fils-tous--44109-abd_filDMA.Htm « Parquet et conseil général vont être attaques en justice »], ''[[Ouest-France]]'', 26 June 2012</ref>

During the trial of June 2012, which focused on the responsibility of Marina's parents, four associations that assisted (more precisely, in French law these associations "s’étaient portées parties civiles")   began to point out   malfunctions and failures of the   childhood protection system in France, in particular, that of the social services of the French department of the Sarthe and the public prosecutor's office.

The lack of coordination and follow-up of Marina's case between the different institutions, and the superficiality of the criminal investigation, were particularly implicated. Only the school institutions  escaped criticism, due to the effective communication of information between the various  schools where Marina was educated, and the teaching staff's readiness to report its  suspicions of abuse as well as in one instance on April 27, 2009 when the school headmistress urgently hospitalised the little girl.<ref name="Brousse BFM TV"/>

Following the  parents' trial, several associations  announced their intention to pursue legal action to address  the roles of the state services and  to propose measures to improve childhood protection.<ref name="Brousse BFM TV"/><ref name="Avocat Innocence en danger"/><ref name="eviter maltraitance">[http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/571776-proces-des-parents-de-marina-comment-la-maltraitance-aurait-pu-etre-evitee.html « comment la maltraitance aurait pu être évitée »], ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', 15 July 2012</ref> The objective  is that there should be  a "before" and an "after" Marina.

This movement also took the form of a solemn march for Marina in Paris on 18 November 2012. The message  communicated by this event was the   indictment of a work practice in the   childhood protection services   which  resulted in  the death of Marina  as well as children  unjustifiably taken into care.<ref name="marche blanche">[http://comitecedif.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/marche-blanche-pour-marina/ « marche blanche pour Marina »], CEDIF, 20 November 2012</ref>

On the other hand, voices were raised in defence of  the institutions involved, especially the social services. They  argued that the administration had  simply complied with  the procedures  and general setup for the prevention of child abuse, and that it was  dangerous  to  draw conclusions  on the overall effectiveness of the system  from a single dramatic case.<ref name="défense ASE">[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/06/27/affaire-marina-qui-est-responsable_1724831_3232.html « Affaire Marina qui est responsable"], ''[[Le monde]]'', 27 June 2012</ref><ref name="défense ASE 2">[http://www.anas.fr/Ouverture-du-proces-des-parents-de-Marina-Contre-les-accusations-envers-les-professionnels-mesurer-la-complexite-de-ce_a820.html « Contre les accusations envers les professionnels, mesurer la complexité de ce qu’est la protection de l’enfance »], ''[[Le monde]]'', 7 June 2012</ref><ref name="defense ASE 3">[http://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/telechargements/CommuniquE-ANAS.pdf « Communique ANAS »], ''La Gazette des Communes'', 4 July 2012</ref><ref name="defense ASE 4">[http://www.gazette-sante-social.fr/actualite/actualite-generale-affaire-marina-l-anas-prepare-la-contre-offensive-34276.html?recherche=1 « Affaire Marina l'ANAS prépare la contre-offensive »], ''[[France 3 Pays de la Loire]]'', 26 June 2012</ref>

The risk was also observed that, under the fear of being accused of negligence or failiure to assist a person in danger, the administration and the  personnel would react too quickly and  excessively at the first hint of abuse, without sufficient verification  that the action taken was correct and would benefit the child. Nevertheless,  at the trial of Marina's parents, the public prosecutor explicitly questioned the responsibility of the General Council of Sarthe and that  to decrease the rate of infant mortality by  abuse (10 to 20 deaths per year) (http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Publications/Statistiques/Criminalite/2008) would possibly require  legislative changes, perhaps including some on the definition of  the failiure to assist a person in danger.

One of the points of debate is the new law for childhood protection  of March 2007, which gives a more important role  to social services for the prevention of child abuse, but which is according to some observers misunderstood and misapplied.<ref name="mediapart">[http://blogs.mediapart.fr/blog/anne-tursz/060712/mais-quelle-formation-ont-donc-recu-les-meurtriers-par-omission-de-marin « Mais quelle formation ont donc reçu les meurtriers par omission de Marina »], ''Blog [[Mediapart]]'', 6 July 2012</ref>

Another point to consider is  the capability of the public prosecutor's office to call itself into question while at the same time the legal action of the childhood protection associations    has been  checked by a court decision.<ref name="affaire Marina : circulez y a rien à voir">[http://comitecedif.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/affaire-marina-circulez-y-a-rien-a-voir/ « Affaire Marina : circulez y a rien à voir » CEDIF, 6 June 2013]</ref>
