[[File:Creosaurus.jpg|none|100px|Holotype material of ''Creosaurus atrox'', more recently known as ''Allosaurus atrox''.]]</div>There have been a number of potential '''[[species]]''' assigned to the [[carnosauria]]n [[dinosaur]] [[genus]] '''''[[Allosaurus]]''''' since its description in 1877 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], but only a handful are still regarded as valid. ''Allosaurus'' was originally described from material from the [[Upper Jurassic]] [[Morrison Formation]] of the western [[United States of America]]; the [[type species]] ''A. fragilis'' became one of the best-known species of dinosaur.

The genus ''Allosaurus'' was part of the [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Marsh]]/[[Edward Drinker Cope|Cope]] "[[Bone Wars]]" of the late 19th century, and its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] became increasingly confused due to the competition, with several genera and species named by Cope and Marsh now regarded as synonyms of ''Allosaurus'' or ''A. fragilis''. Since the description of ''Allosaurus'', scientists have proposed additional species from such far-flung locales as [[Portugal]], [[Siberia]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Tanzania]], and unnamed remains from [[Australia]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]] have also been assigned to the genus at one time or another.
