[[File:BryceCanyon-Amphiteatre1.jpg|none|100px|Amphitheatre at Bryce Canyon National Park.]]</div>'''Bryce Canyon National Park''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|s}} is a [[national park]] located in southwestern [[Utah]] in the United States. The major feature of the park is '''Bryce Canyon''', which despite its name, is not a [[canyon]] but a collection of giant natural [[amphitheatre|amphitheaters]] along the eastern side of the [[Paunsaugunt Plateau]]. Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called ''[[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]]'', formed by [[frost weathering]] and stream erosion of the river and lake bed [[sedimentary rock]]s. The red, orange, and white colors of the [[rock (geology)|rocks]] provide spectacular views for park visitors. Bryce sits at a much higher elevation than nearby [[Zion National Park]]. The rim at Bryce varies from {{convert|8000|to|9000|ft}}.

The Bryce Canyon area was settled by [[Mormon pioneers]] in the 1850s and was named after [[Ebenezer Bryce]], who [[homestead Act|homesteaded]] in the area in 1874. The area around Bryce Canyon became a [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]] in 1923 and was designated as a [[National Park Service|National Park]] in 1928. The park covers {{convert|35835|acre|ha sqmi}} and receives relatively few visitors compared to Zion National Park and the Grand Canyon, largely due to its remote location.
