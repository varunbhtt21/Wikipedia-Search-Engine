[[File:Zion angels landing view.jpg|none|100px|Zion Canyon.]]</div>'''Zion National Park''' is located in the [[Southwestern United States]],  near [[Springdale, Utah]].  A prominent feature of the {{convert|229|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} park is Zion Canyon, which is 15&nbsp;miles (24&nbsp;km) long and up to half a mile (800&nbsp;m) deep, cut through the reddish and tan-colored [[Navajo Sandstone]] by the North Fork of the [[Virgin River]]. The lowest elevation is {{convert|3666|ft|m|abbr=on}} at Coalpits Wash and the highest elevation is {{convert|8726|ft|m|abbr=on}} at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the [[Colorado Plateau]], [[Great Basin]], and [[Mojave Desert]] regions, the park's unique [[geography]] and variety of [[life zone]]s allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of [[bat]]), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: [[desert]], [[riparian]], [[woodland]], and [[coniferous forest]]. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, [[monoliths]], rivers, [[slot canyon]]s, and [[natural arch]]es.

The [[geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area]] includes 9 [[formation (geology)|formation]]s that together represent 150 million years of mostly [[Mesozoic]]-aged [[sedimentation]]. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the [[Colorado Plateau]]s lifted the region {{convert|10000|ft}} starting 13 million years ago. ('''[[Zion National Park|see more...]]''')
