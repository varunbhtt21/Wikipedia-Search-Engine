</div>The '''Jeita Grotto''' is a system of two separate, but interconnected, [[Karst topography|karstic]] [[cave]]s in [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]] spanning an overall length of nearly {{convert|9|km|mi}}. The caves are situated in the [[Nahr al-Kalb]] valley within the locality of [[Jeita]], {{convert|18|km|mi}} north of the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] capital [[Beirut]]. Though inhabited in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], the lower cave was not rediscovered until 1836 by Reverend William Thomson; it can only be visited by boat since it channels an [[Subterranean river|underground river]] that provides fresh drinking water to more than a million Lebanese.

In 1958, Lebanese speleologists discovered the upper galleries {{convert|60|m|ft}} above the lower cave which have been accommodated with an access tunnel and a series of walkways to enable tourists safe access without disturbing the [[natural landscape]]. The upper galleries house the world's largest known [[stalactite]].  The galleries are composed of a series of chambers the largest of which peaks at a height of {{convert|120|m|ft}}.

Aside from being a Lebanese [[national symbol]] and a top tourist destination, the Jeita grotto plays an important social, economic and cultural role and is a finalist in the [[New7Wonders of Nature|New 7 Wonders of Nature]] competition, and as of 7:44 pm GMT the provisional New7Wonders of Nature based on the first count of vote results on 11/11/11 Jeita was one of the top 14 Finalists in the New7Wonders of Nature.
