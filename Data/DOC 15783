'''From Indian Lakes''' is an American [[indie rock]] band formed in 2009. Vocalist Joey Vannucchi writes, performs, and produces the music.

== History ==

Joey Vannucchi grew up on forty acres of land near Yosemite National Park in California. Without electricity or common childhood luxuries, Joey spent most of his youth reading books, playing drums, learning new instruments, and exploring the land around his rural home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2015-05-18/new-blood-from-indian-lakes|title=New Blood: From Indian Lakes|date=May 18, 2015|publisher=}}</ref> He received classical jazz drum lessons and played on a borrowed church drumset for hours daily, "I could play my drums for hours," he said. "There was no one to bother. No one around cared about the sound."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordnet.com/article/20120621/A_ENTERTAIN/206210302?template=printart|title=Natural rock formation|work=recordnet.com|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref>

From Indian Lakes digitally released "EFBN Tapes" on December 5, 2016. The release features demos, alternative versions, and initial interpretations of the songs from "Everything Feels Better Now". It was previously released only on cassette with deluxe pre-orders, but Vannucchi decided to put the songs online stating "These were meant to be released as a deluxe digital add on to the record at a time when new promotion was appropriate, but it continues to feel necessary to put into action words of love and positivity." All proceeds are donated to The Southern Poverty Law Center.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/fromindianlakes/posts/1320435998009029</ref>
