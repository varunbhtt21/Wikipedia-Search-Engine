==Reception==
Writing in ''[[complete review]]'', M.A. Orthofer said:
:"[[Habib Ahmadzadeh|Ahmadzadeh]] tries to make connection with the reader in ''A City Under Siege''. Most stories are told in the first person. ''A City Under Siege'' is a solid collection of wartime stories. Ahmadzadeh relies heavily on certain tricks and has a few authorial tics, but he's a talented writer and these are effective, good stories. This collection is certainly a good introduction to frontline Iranian life during this conflict (with which most Western readers will presumably not yet be very familiar."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/iran/ahmadzh1.htm#author |title=A City Under Siege |work=[[complete review]] |author=M.A.Orthofer |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>
