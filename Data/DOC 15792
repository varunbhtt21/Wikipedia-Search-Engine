*'''Strong Keep''' The flag is symbol of the new republic, and it is well known. The deletionist and Ukraine breakup denialist just attempts to change history, but it will not work.

*'''Keep''' - Obvious notability. I have seen it many times in electronic media. Just because it has not yet received coverage in books does not mean its not notable. --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 22:42, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*:You have seen it in the media yes but do they describe the flag or are they talking about the situation? Not everything that has or will ever exist gets a mention on Wikipedia. - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 00:20, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Yes, the media presented this flag and explained that millions of people are ready to die for it, while it may cause a nuclear conflict. I guess it makes it notable.--[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 05:36, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::::I don't think it's actually the specific flag that is likely to start a war, but the tension between Russians and Ukrainians and the action of outside agitators. Unless the specific flag has magic properties to incite belligerence, in which case, it certainly would be notable if that was reliably referenced. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 10:31, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Straw man fallacy. Flags of course do not have magic properties, nor I stated that. If you don't believe this flag is notable you can easily test it. Just wave it in Kiev on Maydan, or try to burn it in the center of Novoazovsk, Krasnoarmeisk,...  --[[User:Antidiskriminator|Antidiskriminator]] ([[User talk:Antidiskriminator|talk]]) 19:54, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::You said You "guess" it makes it notable? Here on Wikipedia we use sources to establish notability, anyone can declare something to be notable, without thirs party sources to back it up however the claim is baseless. - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 23:31, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::::::A simple google search has thousands of hits. I think I gave a fairly clear reason for my position, and I don't really have much to add to that now.

:: Wait, then why is the flag not "notable" enough to be used on its corresponding article? The flag itself is notable in its own right for the flag raisings that have occured: [http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/flag-of-donetsk-peoples-republic-raised-above-executive-committee-in-kostiantynivka-345419.html] [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/ukraine-donetsk-pro-russia-militants] [http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/04/18/on_the_11th_floor_inside_the_council_donetsk_peoples_republic] [http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/flag-of-donetsk-peoples-republic-raised-in-horlivka-mine-344751.html] --'''[[User:Lvivske|Львівське]]''' <small>([[User talk:Lvivske|говорити]])</small> 04:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep and expand''' This article needs to be expanded to standard, yes, but I don't see that it isn't notable. On the contrary. [[User:23 editor|23 editor]] ([[User talk:23 editor|talk]]) 03:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*:There is a saying, actions speak louder than words, can you show how it is notable rather than just saying it is? - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 03:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' my original vote thought this was for the image file in the commons, didn't realize there was an article on the flag. I think this may fall under being not notable enough to warrant an article on the flag itself, if the 4 URLs I posted above don't suffice. The flag should be sufficiently described on the DPR article, since there probably isn't much info to make an article with anyway. --'''[[User:Lvivske|Львівське]]''' <small>([[User talk:Lvivske|говорити]])</small> 05:18, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep and expand''' The subject is notable enough for a wikipedia article, though it should be expanded to explain the history and symbolism of the flag, using relevant sources.

*:What sources? The ones mentioned above tell nothing about the flag other than it was raised. If you were to add to the article right now what would it be with sourced info that relates to the flag? - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 23:27, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*:Can you explain how with reliable sources? - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 20:59, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Strong keep.''' Every flag used that has been seen by more than 10000 people is notable. Can this nonsense nomination be met with sanction to the nominator? [[User:ArmijaDonetsk|ArmijaDonetsk]] ([[User talk:ArmijaDonetsk|talk]]) 02:04, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*:No as no-one has been able to counter the argument made by the nominator. As for flags that have been seen by more than 10,000 people does the [[Flag of Sealand]] count? That has no article you notice and like yours is a [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]] argument. - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 04:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*::Blabla. The flag has been noted as evidenced by multiple articles and videos. Things that have been noted, are note-able. [[User:ArmijaDonetsk|ArmijaDonetsk]] ([[User talk:ArmijaDonetsk|talk]]) 14:27, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak delete''' I'm ultimately leaning towards a delete vote. I honestly believed that this would be more notable, but I have been unable to find articles about the flag itself, only its use in ongoing events. (Just to be thorough, I also ran the names of some recently adopted flags, such as the flags of Libya and South Sudan, through Google. Both searches brought up many reliable sources about the flags themselves).  I would suggest a merge, but the article only states the coloring of the flag and the fact that it resembles the [[Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic]] flag. These facts are uncited and were likely derived from the author looking at the flag. I'm ultimately voting delete, but I'd be more than willing to change my vote if anyone can find any reliable sources on the flag or present a compelling argument for another outcome.

*'''Delete''' I don't think this page is noteable enough for Wikipedia [[User:Dudel250|Dudel250]] ([[User talk:Dudel250|talk]]) 00:27, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' to [[Donetsk People's Republic]]. All&nbsp;the&nbsp;best: ''[[User:Rich Farmbrough|Rich]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Rich Farmbrough|Farmbrough]]'',&nbsp;<small>00:39,&nbsp;9&nbsp;May&nbsp;2014&nbsp;(UTC).</small><br />
*:'''Note''' - even if none of the text in the current article can be saved, there is citable information about where the flag has been used.

*This entity, this "republic", does not exist in the way that other countries exists. What we have is couple of hundred activists who have taken over some buildings--what existence there is as a subject is the material of newspapers, blogs, and tweets, not of an encyclopedia. It's what, a month old, and we already have a flag for which we need an article? What we have here, of course, is wiki-activism. Rich Farmbrough's suggestion is just fine: of course there is information we can cite, but let's not pretend that having such information means that we actually have something tangible, viable, and lasting. So '''merge''' it--and see how long we'll need that redirect. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 01:13, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I honestly don't even see a reason why this should be considered notable, as the there is barely even a republic out there, let alone a need for a flag article. I can see a reason for merging this if people see fit, but there is no need to have this article here as is. [[User:Ktr101|Kevin Rutherford]] ([[User talk:Ktr101|talk]]) 02:27, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' [[WP:NOTE]] yes the organisation that it is a symbol of may be noteable through news and media but the flag itself does not appear to be. being seen by large numbers (10,000) does not lead to it being noteable - for example the sections of scouting throughout the United Kingdowm have specific designs of flags for each section. These are seen by potentially hundreds of thousands of people each year at various events and copied in print and other media at these events, this does not confer notability onto the organisations flags and as such shouldnt confer notability onto this flag in itself.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Amortias|Amortias]] ([[User talk:Amortias|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Amortias|contribs]]) 12:24, 10 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
*'''Keep & Improve''' per above, Not the most perfect article but not something worth deleting neither imho.

*:Again nobody has been able to provide any sources showing how the flag is notable on it's own. To the people who want to improve the article: Why haven't you done so while this AfD is in process? Actions speak louder than words and the burdon lies with those who want to keep this article to provide the sources needed, otherwise it sounds like a [[WP:ILIKEIT]] argument. - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 16:59, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep & Improve''' - especially now after the republic passed a vote and declared independence I think this is indeed notable. And we have flags of entities not even close to the same independence of this republic. And yes otherstuffexists but it would be wrong to delete this article just because of the fact that it is a hot topic right now. Tensions are high.--[[User:BabbaQ|BabbaQ]] ([[User talk:BabbaQ|talk]]) 16:32, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Again no sources have been found to show it's stand alone notability nor has the article seen any improvement for almost 2 weeks now. The fact is that no sources prove this passes [[WP:N]] so your argument saying "I think it is" and "It would be wrong" both sound like [[WP:ILIKEIT]] as well as [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]]. - [[User:Knowledgekid87|Knowledgekid87]] ([[User talk:Knowledgekid87|talk]]) 20:33, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
