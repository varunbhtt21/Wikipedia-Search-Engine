{{Nihongo|'''''Lance N' Masques'''''|ランス・アンド・マスクス|Ransu Ando Masukusu|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[light novel]] series by Hideaki Koyasu with illustrations by Shino, and is edited by the animation studio [[Studio Gokumi]]. [[Pony Canyon]] has published six volumes since 2013 under their Poni Can imprint. An [[anime]] television series adaptation aired from October 1 to December 17, 2015.

==Plot==
The protagonist of the story is Yōtarō Hanabusa, a member of the surviving 21st century Knights, called the "Knights of the world."  Wanting to be a normal person rather than a knight, he leaves everyone behind to set out on his own, but old habits die hard and he finds that like it or not he reflexively acts like a "White Knight" any time someone's in trouble. One day he meets a girl, Kidoin Makio, and learns that she is forced to live completely alone; he takes her under his wing and begins to look after her, all the while hiding his identity as the masked "Knight Lancer" she idolizes.

: The male protagonist. One of the last remaining knights in the twenty-first century, he has been trained to fight for justice and behave in a "chivalrous" manner that is far removed from normal modern behavior, to such an extent that some individuals have called him strange or even "perverse". This behavior even ruined his friendship with a girl years ago, and since then he has wanted nothing more than to be a normal person. However, his "white knight syndrome" has been so deeply ingrained that he can't help reverting to old habits when someone's in danger. Out of embarrassment, he wears a mask to hide his identity whenever he does this. After he learns that Makio lives alone and is not allowed to have any relationships, he decides to stay with her and protect her.

Ever since she has adored her "Knight Lancer", but doesn't realize that "pathetic" Yōtarō is the same person. After some time, she decides that rather than becoming a hero, she will instead become a great "Lady" whom Knight Lancer can be proud to protect.

==Reception==
The anime series' first episode received poor reviews from [[Anime News Network]]'s staff during the Fall 2015 season previews. Rebecca Silverman was optimistic of both the Maiko plotline and world-building involving the knights but found negative qualities in the overall production and introduction of the supporting cast. Other staffers were less than favorable. Lynzee Loveridge was critical of the faulty logic and lack of "normalcy" in the plotting, while Nick Creamer called it "flavorless anime custard" for being an "extremely bland light novel adaptation." Theron Martin compared the plot to ''[[Kure-nai]]'' but with production that's well below its quality level. Hope Chapman criticized the story for playing out like an amalgam of "subpar 4-koma anime" with comedy that comes across more like "pure filler than intentional humor." Zac Bertschy saw the introduction of the premise as "barebones" with characters that offer nothing to get the viewer interested in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2015/fall/lance-n-masques/.93505|title=''Lance 'N Masques'' - The Fall 2015 Anime Preview Guide|last1=Silverman|first1=Rebecca|last2=Loveridge|first2=Lynzee|last3=Creamer|first3=Nick|last4=Martin|first4=Theron|last5=Chapman|first5=Hope|last6=Bertschy|first6=Zac|website=Anime News Network|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=February 11, 2018}}</ref>
