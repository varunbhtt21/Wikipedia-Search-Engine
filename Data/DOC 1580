I believe UseTheCommandLine is a supporter or employee of Gawker.com and is trying to get their article posted and cited as a reliable source on a controversy stemmed from another tabloid, XOJane. But since neither of those website are reliable sources, UseTheCommandLine is using their knowledge of Wikipedia to have this article deleted and apparently is trying to get my account and others who have contributed to this article removed from Wikipedia. The controversy stems from a tabloid blogger who listened to an episode of the podcast and decided that it was 100% factual when there was no evidence and it is known by the listeners that the show is for entertainment. I have edited the article since it was flagged for deletion and reached out to other members of Wikipedia for help on compliance. The external links have been removed from the main article, but UseTheCommandLine suggests the Gawker article should be posted. I have checked the Reliable Sources Noticeboard and Gawker.com nor XOJane.com are not considered reliable sources. UseTheCommandLine has ulterior motives regarding the deletion of this article, promotion of Gawker.com's article and claiming my account and the other editors are sockpuppets. I have never edited an article on Wikipedia before and I will admit I did not understand the guidelines when I started editing this article and will continue to educate myself on Wikipedia's guidelines.[[User:Hashashash|Hashashash]] ([[User talk:Hashashash|talk]]) 18:22, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

*Although geolocation makes it {{possible}} that {{User|Jarsh32}} and {{User|Hashashash}} are related, it could equally likely be a matter of off-wiki canvassing, or simply a cross-over in interest from two separate editors. Behavioural cues will be needed to try to sort that out. {{User|XSpencer}} is technically {{unrelated}}.--[[User:Ponyo|<b><font color="Navy">''Jezebel's''</font></b><font color="Navy">Ponyo</font>]]<sup>[[User_talk:Ponyo|<font color="Navy">''bons mots''</font>]]</sup> 17:50, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
*I don't see any evidence that this is something other than meatpuppetry. Closing, hopefully the AfD closing admin will weigh the SPA !votes accordingly.
