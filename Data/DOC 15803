'''Broad Front UNEN''' ({{lang-es|Frente Amplio UNEN}}) was an Argentine [[political coalition]] that unites the [[Radical Civic Union]], [[Civic Coalition ARI]], [[Proyecto Sur]], [[Freemen of the South Movement]], [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]], [[Authentic Socialist Party (Argentina)|Authentic Socialist Party]], and GEN. The name UNEN is an acronym of "Unión y Encuentro" ({{lang-es|Unity and meeting}}).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://noticias.perfil.com/2014-04-25-47533-unen-la-gran-esperanza-progre/|title= UNEN, la gran esperanza progre|trans-title=UNEN, the great progressist hope|language= Spanish|author= James Neilson|date= |work= |publisher= Noticias|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref> Founded in April 2014, the purpose of the coalition was to unite the parties that oppose [[Peronism]] and [[Kirchnerism]] in a single entity, but the inclusion of the center-right party [[Republican Proposal]] was a controversial topic among the parties.<ref name="mercopress">{{cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2014/04/23/a-centre-left-broad-front-is-born-in-argentina-as-a-government-alternative |title=A centre-left broad front is born in Argentina as "a government alternative"|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=14 May 2014|work=[[MercoPress]]}}</ref>

==History==
The coalition was composed of several parties. The [[Broad Progressive Front (Argentina)|Broad Progressive Front]] was a socialist coalition that placed second in the [[2011 Argentine general election]], with the candidate [[Hermes Binner]]. UNEN was another coalition created in the [[2013 Argentine legislative election]], composed by the Radical Civic Union, Proyecto Sur, and the Civic Coalition ARI. With the candidates [[Pino Solanas]] and [[Elisa Carrió]] running for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, respectively, UNEN placed second in the city of Buenos Aires, forcing [[Daniel Filmus]] (the candidate of the national government) into third place, thus ousting him from Senate.<ref name="mercopress"/>

The Broad Front UNEN coalition had its inauguration at the Argentine Broadway Theatre. Radical politician [[Luis Brandoni]] announced the content of the constitution document, which was then signed by the leaders of the parties.<ref name="mercopress"/>

The coalition includes most Argentine parties that are not Peronist. The likely Peronist candidates for the [[2015 Argentine general election|2015 presidential election]] are [[Daniel Scioli]], governor of the Buenos Aires province; [[Sergio Massa]], elected deputy in 2013; and other candidates sponsored by the national government such as [[Sergio Urribarri]] and [[Florencio Randazzo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2014/04/24/argentine-broad-front-opens-possibility-of-runoff-dispute-in-2015-presidential-election|title= Argentine broad front opens possibility of runoff dispute in 2015 presidential election|author= |date= 24 April 2014 |work= MercoPress|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>

There was some controversy about the inclusion of the Republican Proposal, led by Buenos Aires mayor [[Mauricio Macri]], in the coalition. Macri's support would be needed to counter the powerful Peronist parties, but he is a conservative and most parties in the coalition are left-wing or centre-left.<ref name="mercopress"/> As of April 2014, Solanas, [[Margarita Stolbizer]], and [[Ricardo Alfonsín]] rejected to join forces with Macri, whereas Carrió and other radicals did not reject the idea.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/157531/broad-front-unen-leaders-slam-pro-links|title= Broad Front UNEN leaders slam PRO links|author= |date= April 21, 2014|work= [[Buenos Aires Herald]]|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Macri ruled out an electoral alliance, but proposed instead to find consensus for national policies after the elections.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/157803/macri-rules-out-agreement-with-broad-frontunen|title= Macri rules out agreement with Broad Front-UNEN|author= |date= April 24, 2014|work=Buenos Aires Herald|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

The inauguration of the provincial wing of UNEN for the [[Buenos Aires Province]], the largest province of Argentina, is scheduled for May 22, one month after the general national inauguration. It will take place at the [[National University of Avellaneda]]. The likely candidates for governor of the Buenos Aires province are Facundo Manes, Héctor Gutiérrez, Miguel Bazze, Gerardo Milman, Sergio Buil, Sebastián Cinquerrui and Mario Cafiero.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1688994-lanzaran-el-22-de-mayo-la-version-bonaerense-del-frente-unen|title= Lanzarán el 22 de mayo la versión bonaerense del Frente UNEN|trans-title=The wing of the Broad Front UNEN for the Buenos Aires province will be launched on May 22|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 9, 2014|work= La Nación|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> Elisa Carrió has commented that she may run for governor instead of president, but dismissed the idea later.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/politica/amague-Carrio-dice-competira-Provincia_0_1138086217.html|title= Tras el amague, Carrió dice que no competirá en Provincia|trans-title=After the suggestion, Carrió says that she will not run in the Province|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 14, 2014|work= |publisher= Clarín|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> The coalition also intends to make a meeting on May 24 at the house of the 1852 [[San Nicolás Agreement]], but the place is owned by the ministry of culture of the province, currently under the Kirchnerite rule of Scioli. So far, it has not given authorization for the event.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1691963-los-candidatos-del-frente-amplio-unen-se-vuelven-a-juntar-en-san-nicolas|title= Los precandidatos del Frente Amplio UNEN se vuelven a juntar en San Nicolás|trans-title=The precandidates of the Board Front UNEN meet again at San Nicolás|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 16, 2014|work= La Nación|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

==Policies==
UNEN opposed the nationalization of the [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics]], which is under the jurisdiction of the city of Buenos Aires. A press release from UNEN described the handover as "illegal and arbitrary".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/159026/broad-front-unen-present-constitutional-protection-over-exesma|title= Broad Front UNEN present constitutional protection over ex-ESMA|author= |date= May 9, 2014|work= Buenos Aires Herald|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref> They also proposed a reduction to the [[income tax]], which was not updated according to the high inflation, but the Kirchnerite legislators retired from Congress to prevent the minimum quorum.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1690648-impuesto-ganancias|title= Diputados: la oposición denunció que el oficialismo no dio quórum para debatir el Impuesto a las ganancias|trans-title=Deputies: the opposition denounced that the officialism denied quorum to discuss the income tax|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 14, 2014|work= La Nación|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

==2015 elections==
{{Main|2015 Argentine general election}}
Opinion polls made by Poliarquía on April 2014 revealed that UNEN may be fourth in the electoral preferences, behind Massa, Scioli and Macri. The study shows as well that the four parties may be having very close electoral preferences. Eduardo Fidanza, director of Poliarquía, suggested that UNEN may be fourth in the electoral preferences because, unlike the other candidates, the coalition does not have an obvious political leader, and may increase its chances after the primary elections.<ref name="encuesta">{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1680457-en-un-escenario-muy-fragmentado-massa-lidera-las-preferencias-electorales|title= En un escenario muy fragmentado, Massa lidera las preferencias electorales|trans-title=Massa leads the electoral preferences in a highly fragmented scenario|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 13, 2014|work= La Nación|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

The poll asked as well a preferred candidate of UNEN to those who may vote for the coalition. There was a tie between Hermes Binner and Julio Cobos, followed by Elisa Carrió.<ref name="encuesta" />

== 2013 election and nationwide replication ==
In the October [[2013 Argentine legislative election|2013 legislative election]], alliances of UCR, CC-ARI, PS and other centre-left parties (mainly components of the 2011 [[Broad Progressive Front (Argentina)|Broad Progressive Front]]) ran in most provinces, usually under the name of the Progressive, Civic and Social Front. In the city of Buenos Aires, an analogous alliance was called ''UNEN'', in Chaco ''Union for Chaco'', in Jujuy ''Jujuyan Front'', in Catamarca ''Civic and Social Front'' and in Santa Cruz ''Front Let's Change for Growth''. In Córdoba, Mendoza and Entre Rios, however, the UCR ran separately from the rest of the centre-left opposition.

==Break up==
[[Elisa Carrio]] was the first to leave the coalition, making instead an alliance with Macri and running in the primary elections against him. [[Hermes Binner]] declined his presidential candidacy, to focus on keeping the Santa Fe province for the socialist party. The [[Radical Civic Union]] made a congress to decide the candidacies and alliances, and appointed Sanz as the candidate to run against Macri. Cobos accepted the result of the discussion and declined his candidacy.
