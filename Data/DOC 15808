The bill would declare that a banking entity shall not be considered to have an ownership interest in a collateralized loan obligation because it acquires or retains a debt security in it if the debt security has no indicia of ownership other than the right of the banking entity to participate in the removal for cause, or in the selection of a replacement after removal for cause or resignation, of an investment manager or investment adviser of the collateralized loan obligation.<ref name="4167sum"/>

The bill would define "collateralized loan obligation" as any issuing entity of an asset-backed security composed primarily of commercial loans.<ref name="4167sum"/>

Garland "Andy" Barr (R, KY-6)]].<ref name=4167allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4167 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4167/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]].

==Debate and discussion==
The bill had "strong support from the banking industry," according to one newspaper.<ref name=Cheves1>{{cite news|last=Cheves|first=John|title=Democrats call on Andy Barr to return $42,808 he collected with indicted lawmaker|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2014/04/30/3220338/democrats-call-on-andy-barr-to.html|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=30 April 2014}}</ref> The [[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association]] (SIFMA) supported the bill, applauding House passage.<ref name=SIFMA1>{{cite web|last=Danko|first=Carol|title=SIFMA Statement on House Passage of H.R. 4167, which Adjusts the Volcker Rule to Prevent Disruptions in CLO Market|url=http://www.sifma.org/newsroom/2014/sifma_statement_on_house_passage_of_h_r__4167,_which_adjusts_the_volcker_rule_to_prevent_disruptions_in_clo_market/|publisher=SIFMA|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=29 April 2014}}</ref> According to SIFMA, "the Fed's recently-announced guidance is far too limited in scope and fails to remediate the negative impact of the Volcker Rule on CLOs."<ref name="SIFMA1"/> SIFMA thought that H.R. 4167 was a "more comprehensive approach that makes the Volcker Rule workable while minimizing unnecessary disruptions to the market" that would "diminish the unnecessary losses that will be caused by the Fed's approach."<ref name="SIFMA1"/>

Rep. Barr, who introduced the bill, said that he was "glad that the House has come together to advance this common-sense solution that would ensure American employers are able to obtain affordable financing to expand their businesses and create much-needed jobs for Kentuckians."<ref name="Cheves1"/>

According to the House Republican Conference, the collateralized loan obligation (CLO) divestment required by the Volcker Rule will "disrupt a market for business loans that have provided financing to companies such as Sears, JC Penny, DollarGeneral, Rite Aid, Regal Cinema, JCrew, Michaelâ€™s Craft Stores, Tempurpedic, Delta Airlines, and American Airlines."<ref name=gop4167>{{cite web|title=Legislative Digest on H.R. 4167|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4167-restoring-proven-financing-for-american-employers-act/|publisher=House Republican Conference|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=29 April 2014}}</ref> This rule would not go into effect if this bill passes.<ref name="gop4167"/> The House Republicans also state that "the historic default for CLOs is less than 1%."<ref name="gop4167"/>
