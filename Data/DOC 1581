A '''beer tower''', also known as a '''portable [[beer tap]], a tabletop beer dispenser, a triton dispenser''' or a '''giraffe''', is a [[beer]] dispensing device, usually found in [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[pub]]s and [[Restaurant|restaurants]]. The idea behind beer towers is that several patrons in a group can serve themselves the amount of beer they want without having to order individually.

The device comes in a variety of sizes, most often double to triple the size of standard beer pitchers that hold around {{Convert|48-60|USoz|liter}} of beer.<ref name="boston1">{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/allston_brighton/2011/03/boston_licensing_officials_ban.html | title=Boston licensing officials suspend use of large, portable "beer towers" | publisher=Boston.com | date=29 March 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2014 | author=Rocheleau, Matt}}</ref>

Early versions came in the shape of a four-foot tall plastic cylinder attached to a beer tap at the bottom. Current models sometimes have several dispensing valves, to allow for simultaneous dispense. 

Chilling of the beer is usually achieved with ice chambers or with freezable ice packs, which may be internal (traditional) or external (for increased hygiene when handling). 

The actual dispense mechanism is usually in the form of a simplified [[beer tap]] or a bespoke [https://patents.google.com/patent/US8973787 patented pouring mechanism.].

==History==
[[File:Beer tower.jpg|thumb|A beer tower in Warsaw, Poland]]
The ancestor of the modern beer tower was called a '''portable keg tap''' or a '''picnic tap''', since the device was mostly used at outdoor events, such as picnics. They were significantly larger than modern beer towers. The method involved manually pumping air into the beer container; the resulting pressure within the container would force the beer out the tap. There was also a variant with lager beer barrels that stood upright, allowing [[gravity]] to force the beer out the tap, which is the principle of the modern day system.
