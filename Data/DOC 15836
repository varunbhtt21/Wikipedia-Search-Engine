Title : Thomas Bache (judge)
Text : '''Thomas Bache''' (died 1410) was an [[Anglo-Italian]] cleric and judge who held high office in [[Ireland]] in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries: he served one term as [[Lord High Treasurer of Ireland]] and three terms as [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]].

The Bache family came originally  from [[Genoa]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges  in Ireland 1221–1921''  John Murray  London 1926 Vol. 1 p.164</ref> They had a long-standing connection with the English Court: for   several decades  two "merchants of Genoa", who were  both  named Antonio  Bache, and  were presumably father and son, supplied the Royal Household with [[spices]] and other luxuries, and also loaned the [[English Crown]] substantial sums of money.<ref>Steel, Anthony  ''The Receipt of the Exchequer 1377-148''5  Cambridge University Press 1954 p.146</ref> Thomas was almost certainly a member of  this family although his exact relationship with the two Antonios  is unclear.<ref>Ball p.164</ref>

Thomas entered the Church and served as a Crown official in  England in an unspecified capacity, before coming to Ireland in the  late 1360s.<ref>Ball p.164</ref> He did not reach the upper ranks of the Church, but was  appointed  [[Archdeacon of Dublin]], then [[Archdeacon of Meath]]; he was also given the livings of Kilberry, [[County Meath]], and [[Brington, Northamptonshire]].<ref>Ball p.164</ref>

He achieved  high office  in the political  and judicial spheres, being appointed  [[Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland]] in 1376, and Lord Treasurer 1400–1402.<ref>Ball p.164</ref> He was appointed a Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] in 1380, and  became Chief Baron the following year. He was twice superseded, but then  reappointed, as Chief Baron, before retiring for good in 1405. He also served as Deputy to the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] in 1398. He probably  died in 1410.<ref>Ball p.164</ref>
