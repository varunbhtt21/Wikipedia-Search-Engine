Seems like an obvious duck based on the similarity of names, the creation of the second account the day after the master was indef'ed, the common edit interest of [[Winona Middle School]] by both accounts, and [[Stockton, Minnesota]] and [[Winona Area Public Schools]] by the master (Stockton is in Winona County). Both accounts have repeatedly removed the redirect for a non-notable Winona middle school. 
diff for master: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winona_Middle_School&diff=592239503&oldid=574538000]

diff for sock: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Winona_Middle_School&diff=606839567&oldid=592409097] 

In case that's not enough the sock manually signed the master's name in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Meters&diff=prev&oldid=606841040 this] edit.
