"'''Wedding Day'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] musician [[Courtney Love]]. It is the first [[Single (music)|single]] from her upcoming second studio album ''Died Blonde'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/2749883/courtney-love-preps-blonde-album-says-memoir-wont-be-kissy-telly|title=Courtney Love Preps 'Blonde' Album, Says Memoir Won't Be 'Kissy-Telly'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last=Graff|first=Gary|location=[[Detroit]]|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}</ref> and was released on May 4, 2014, packaged as a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] single with the song "[[You Know My Name (Courtney Love song)|You Know My Name]]".

Originally intended for release as a single backed with the song "California", "Wedding Day"{{'}}s lyrics explore the end of a relationship. It was written by Love and guitarist [[Micko Larkin]] and recorded alongside "You Know My Name" at Atrium Studios in [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], [[California]] in early 2014&nbsp;with producer [[Michael Beinhorn]].

"You Know My Name"/"Wedding Day" was released on Love's [[Independent label|independent record label]] Cherry Forever Records, under license to [[Kobalt Label Services]], and was supported by a well received eight-date tour of the United Kingdom. Critical reception to "Wedding Day" was also largely positive and the single placed in the [[UK Indie Chart|Independent Singles Chart]] in the UK upon its release.

==Origin and recording==
Love first mentioned "Wedding Day" in an interview with ''[[Bust (magazine)|BUST]]'' in May 2013&nbsp;where she described the song as "impeccably great as a slab of really raw rock with an insane hook". Love intended to release the song within two months on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] "like an old-school single" with the recently penned song "California" as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bust.com/courtney-love-discusses-nirvana-rage-and-not-being-crazy.html|title=Courtney Love Discusses Nirvana, Rage, and Not Being Crazy|work=[[Bust (magazine)|BUST]]|last=Stoller|first=Debbie|date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref> the plan was later abandoned. Following a short tour of the United States, Love intended to release the single in December and told ''[[Fashion (magazine)|Fashion]]'' magazine that "Wedding Day" was written after the frustration and anger of a recent break-up, explaining: "I got dumped, and [the lyric] 'Break my neck on my wedding day' just came out of me. I wondered about getting married. I’ve been asked twice before and said no. I just haven’t made that [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie [Kennedy Onassis]]] move yet."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iannacci|first=Elio|title=Courtney Love: Cooler Than Ever|journal=[[Fashion (magazine)|Fashion]]|publisher=[[St. Joseph Communications]]|issue=Winter 2014|date=November 11, 2013}}</ref>
  
"Wedding Day" was written by Love and guitarist [[Micko Larkin]]. It was recorded in early 2014&nbsp;at Atrium Studios in [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], [[California]] and produced by [[Michael Beinhorn]],<ref name="notes">{{cite AV media notes|title=''"[[You Know My Name (Courtney Love song)|You Know My Name]]"/"Wedding Day"''|others=[[Courtney Love]]|year=2014|type=Sleeve notes|publisher=Cherry Forever Records|id=CFR001DS1P}}</ref> who had previously produced ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998) and ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' (2010) by Love's former band [[Hole (band)|Hole]].

Critical response to "Wedding Day" was largely favorable.
