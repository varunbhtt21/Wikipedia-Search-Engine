'''Junction''' is a San Francisco-based online [[investment platform]] that allows [[accredited investors]] to purchase [[limited partnership]] interests in [[Investment fund|funds]] that invest in major motion pictures. It differs from donation-based [[crowdfunding]] for film as members of Junction receive investments indirectly in the film projects rather than gifts, and the projects listed on Junction are already fully financed. Investors become [[limited partners]] in a fund that has economic exposure to the project through an investment agreement with one of the film's financiers.

Junction's business is facilitated by the United States [[Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act]], the passage of which in 2012 created new avenues for companies to solicit investments.<ref>[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/a-start-up-is-offering-an-online-way-to-invest-in-hollywood/ Michael J.
