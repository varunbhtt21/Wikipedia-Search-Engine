The '''Newark by-election''' was a [[by-election]] in the [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Newark constituency]] of the [[British House of Commons]], which was held on 5 June 2014,<ref name = "date set">{{cite news |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Newark-election-place-June-5/story-21042151-detail/story.html |title=Newark by-election to take place on June 5 |first=Alex |last=Britton |work=Nottingham Post |publisher= |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref>Newark and Sherwood District Council: [http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/vote/newarkparliamentaryconstituencyby-election2014/ Newark Parliamentary by-election 2014].

==Background==
Mercer resigned the [[Conservative Party whip]] on 31 May 2013 after an investigation by the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme regarding allegations of paid lobbying without registering the interest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mercer aftermath: Will PM introduce new lobbying laws?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22745070|publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |accessdate=7 August 2013|date=2 June 2013}}</ref> He was paid £4,000 for asking questions in Parliament, and the ''Panorama'' team considered that he asked five parliamentary questions, but declared only £2,000 of the £4,000.<ref>Nicholas Watt [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/29/patrick-mercer-suspended-house-of-commons "MP Patrick Mercer resigns Commons seat in wake of lobbying allegations"], theguardian.com, 29 April 2014</ref> As a consequence, he said at the time that he would not stand in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tory MP Patrick Mercer Quits The Party|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1097754/tory-mp-patrick-mercer-quits-the-party|publisher=BSkyB |work=Sky News|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref>

On 29 April, after being told that the Committee on Standards would recommend that he be suspended from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for six months, Mercer announced that he would resign his seat: he told journalists on College Green that he was standing down from "God's county of Nottinghamshire".<ref name = "mercer resigned">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27208966 |title=Former Tory MP Mercer resigns after Commons suspension |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref>Nicholas Watt, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/30/farage-stand-newark-patrick-mercer "Farage considering standing in Newark"], ''The Guardian website'', 30 April 2014</ref> Mercer was appointed [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham|Steward and Bailiff of the Three Chiltern Hundreds]] on 30 April 2014, a mechanism by which [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|MPs resign]].<ref>UK Parliament website, [http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2014/april/patrick-mercer-appointed-to-the-three-hundreds-of-chiltern/ "Patrick Mercer appointed to the Three Hundreds of Chiltern"], 30 April 2014</ref>
