The '''school building on Castle Street''' ({{lang-pl|Budynek szkolny przy ul. Zamkowej}}) in the Polish town of [[Miloslaw]] was a [[Parochial school|religious school]], built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] style in the 1840s. It became a hospital to treat wounded combatants during the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising]] of 1848, and was again involved in fighting around the time of the [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–07)|revolution of 1905-07]].

== Description ==
The school is a multi-storey building with [[Gothic Revival|neo-Gothic]] roofing, and was probably made by {{ill|Seweryn Mielżyński|pl}}. Its address is 13 Castle Street ({{lang|pl|ul. Zamkowa 13}}).

The rooms contained in the school were as follows:
* 9 [[classroom]]s,
* [[Teacher's lounge]], 
* Secretariat,
* Office of the Director,
* Office of the Deputy Director, 
* Personnel office,
* Two utility rooms, 
* Bathroom.

Close to the school, at 19 Castle Street, is located a [[clergy house]] built during the years 1894-1895, and on the opposite side of the street is a former evangelical church. At the end of 2012 the school building was partially converted into social housing.
