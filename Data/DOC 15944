'''No. 3 (S.A.) Wing''' was a [[South African Air Force]] commanded formation during [[World War II]] that served in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. It was formed on 28 August 1941 and initially consisted of [[Royal Air Force]] and South African Air Force squadrons under South African command, known as No. 261 Medium Bomber Wing but became a fully fledged South African formation on 23 September 1942 when [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]] and [[No. 223 Squadron RAF]] were transferred from 3 (S.A.) Wing to [[No. 232 Wing RAF]] and it became known as No. 3 (South Africa) Wing.<ref>Brown (1974) p. 66-67</ref>  This left [[12 Squadron SAAF|12]], [[21 Squadron SAAF|21]] and [[24 Squadron SAAF|24]] Squadrons SAAF as its assigned units.{{efn|Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Longmore proposed the formation of the first South African Air force Wing and later, perhaps a SAAF Group within the RAF organisational structure. Such a Group however never came into existence and although the SAAF fielded two operational wings in North Africa, they were never deployed as a group or as an independent air force.<ref name="Brown14"/>}}<ref name="Brown14">Brown (1974), pp. 14</ref>
