'''''Destroyer''''' is a  single player 1977 arcade game developed and published by [[Atari, Inc.]]<ref name="Atari Games">[http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf ''AtariGames'']</ref> In this game, the player attempts to sink ships and destroy submarines from the perspective of a naval destroyer.

== Gameplay ==
The playfield displays your ship moving across the surface (displayed as a wavy line) and submarines moving across the screen. The target depth is set using a dial control (displayed as a dashed line).  Depth charges are dropped by pushing the dial control.  The speed of your ship is controlled using a speed lever control. Charges that miss make a low boom.  Charges that hit make a louder boom and trigger an explosion sequence.  Points are awarded for successful hits.  The game is timed, so the goal is to sink or destroy as many submarines as possible before the time expires.<ref name="KLOV">[http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/D/Destroyer.pdf  ''Killer List of Videogames'']</ref>
