Born in 1823 to Irish parents, Flavel relocated to the West coast of the United States in 1849, working as a tugboat operator  between [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[San Francisco]], California. In 1851, he settled in the northern coastal [[port|port city]] of [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Oregon]], where he became one of the first licensed bar pilots in the state.

Flavel would go on to amass a fortune with a business managing [[pilot boat]]s on the [[Columbia River]], making him a prominent local figure, and one of the first millionaires in Oregon.<ref name=org>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2011/04/capt_george_flavel_one_of_asto.html|work=The Oregonian|title=Capt.

At the time of his death in 1893, Flavel had a [[net worth]] of nearly US$2 million ({{Inflation|US|2000000|1893|fmt=eq}}). 

His family estate, known as the [[Captain George Flavel House Museum|Captain George Flavel House]], was donated to the Clatsop County Historical Society by his great-granddaughter after her inheritance of it in 1933, and contemporarily functions as a museum.

==Biography==
===Early life===
George Flavel was born in 1823. Some sources state he was born in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]], while others state his birthplace as [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where he had resided in his early life.{{efn-lr|name=fn1}} Flavel was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.<ref name=org/> As a young man in 1849, Flavel relocated by ship to the West coast.{{Sfn|Miller|1958|p=105}} He sailed around [[Cape Horn]] and also spent time in [[California]] during the state's Gold Rush era<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite web|url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/flavel_george_1824_1893_/#.WO7MqFLMzBI|work=The Oregon Encyclopedia|title=Captain George Flavel (1823–1893)|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> before relocating to [[Astoria, Oregon]], then a settlement based around [[John Jacob Astor]]'s [[American Fur Company]]. Flavel settled in Astoria after a stint as captain of the brig ''John Petty''.<ref name=encyclopedia/>

===Maritime career===
Flavel began his career as a sea captain{{Sfn|Williams|2014|p=162}} managing ship routes from the Pacific Ocean up the [[Columbia River]] and to the [[Willamette River]].{{Sfn|Sims|Kramer|1995|p=78}} In 1850, he was given command of the ''[[Goliah (steam tug 1849)|Goliah]]'', the second [[tug boat]] ever built in the United States, driving the boat between [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[San Francisco, California]].{{Sfn|Lockley|1928|p=550}} The following year, in December 1851, he earned his marine piloting license from the state of Oregon.{{Sfn|Powers|2009|p=104}}

One of the only mariners in the state to possess a captain's license, Flavel and his partners were able to establish a virtual monopoly on bar piloting and ship tours on the Columbia, which amassed him a great deal of wealth.<ref name=encyclopedia/> In January 1852, during a particularly strong gale, the [[SS General Warren|SS ''General Warren'']] lost its fore-topmast and began to leak near Astoria; Flavel was unable to rescue the ship, and forty-two people aboard died with its sinking.<ref name=encyclopedia/> However, Flavel's his efforts to save the ''Warren'' earned him the reputation of a local hero in the city.<ref name=encyclopedia/>

In 1854, Flavel married fourteen-year-old Mary Christina Boelling, whom he met at a hotel in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].{{Sfn|Lockley|1928|p=548}} The couple had three children: George Conrad (1855–1923), Nellie (1858–1933), and Katie (1864–1910). With the continued success of his business enterprise, the family divided their time between Oregon and [[San Francisco, California]],<ref name=encyclopedia/> and Flavel was able to afford his children extensive educations in [[Europe]]; his daughter, Nellie, became a classically-trained pianist, and performed with the Organists' Guild of Portland.{{Sfn|Lockley|1928|p=550}}  In 1869, Flavel and his partners built a steam tug, ''Astoria'', and used it as a pilot boat. In addition to his pilot business, Flavel operated a [[wharf]] and also purchased and sold [[coal]] from [[Australia]] as a side business.{{Sfn|Lockley|1928|p=550}}

===Later life and death===
[[File:Flavel House 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Captain George Flavel House Museum|Flavel residence]] in Astoria operates as a museum]]
Flavel built a {{convert|11600|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] mansion in Astoria in 1886. Built on a lot running an entire city block,{{Sfn|Marschner|2013|p=81}} the rumored cost of the home was $36,000.<ref name=org/> Surrounding the house are nine trees planted by the family's gardener, Louis Schultz, which Flavel had acquired from various locations across the world during his voyages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregon.com/attractions/captain-flavel-trees|work=Oregon.com|title=The Captain Flavel Trees|date=April 9, 2014|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> In his later life, Flavel also helped manage the First National Bank of Astoria beginning in 1886, and served as its president until his death.{{Sfn|Lockley|1928|p=551}}

Flavel died in 1893 with a reported [[net worth]] of $1.9 million ({{Inflation|US|1900000|1893|fmt=eq}}).{{Sfn|Marschner|2013|p=81}} His funeral procession was one of the largest in the history of Astoria.<ref name=orenc>{{cite web|work=[[The Oregon Encyclopedia]]|title=George Flavel|accessdate=November 26, 2017|author=Stack, William|url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/flavel_george_1824_1893_/#.Whsye7aZPu0}}</ref> In 1897, Flavel's body was relocated for interment at Ocean View Cemetery in [[Warrenton, Oregon]].<ref name=historic>{{cite web|url=http://webservices.orcities.org/LinkClick.aspx?link=Agendas%26Minutes%2FHLC_06%2FHistoric+Context+2006.pdf&tabid=1574&mid=6499&language=en-US|title=Astoria's Historic Resources and Heritage|publisher=City of Astoria, Oregon|year=2006|p=24}}</ref> 

In a 1922{{Sfn|Lockley|1928|p=542}} interview with his widow, Mary Christina, she said of her husband's success: "One of the reasons why my husband made a success as a pilot on the Columbia River bar was that he was not only an able navigator, but he was fearless and was willing to put out in any sort of weather to assist vessels in need of help."{{Sfn|Lockley|1928|p=550}} The Flavel mansion, known as the [[Captain George Flavel House Museum|Captain George Flavel House]], now functions as a [[museum]] serving the city of Astoria.<ref>{{cite journal|work=[[The New Yorker]]|title=American Chronicled Family of Astoria|first=Calvin|last=Trillun|volume=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRInAQAAIAAJ&q=captain+george+flavel&dq=captain+george+flavel&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs57KrvqDTAhVE9YMKHfB8BjQQ6AEIQzAG|year=1993|pages=80–91}}</ref> Flavel's eldest great-granddaughter, Patricia Jean Flavel, inherited the home from her aunt Nellie Flavel, and donated the property to the Clatsop County Historical Society around 1934.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kast1370.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3221:oldest-great-grand-daughter-of-captain-george-flavel-has-died-at-the-age-of-101&catid=17:kast-local-news&Itemid=637|work=1370 AM-KAST|title=Oldest Great Grand Daughter of Captain George Flavel has Died at the age of 101|accessdate=November 26, 2017|date=2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/5B4VU|archivedate=November 26, 2017}}</ref> Patricia Jean Flavel died in 2014 at age 101.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Daily Astorian|url=http://www.dailyastorian.com/Local_News/20150715/flavel-descendant-tours-historic-family-home|title=Flavel descendant tours historic family home|author=Smith, McKinley|date=July 15, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718000303/http://www.dailyastorian.com/Local_News/20150715/flavel-descendant-tours-historic-family-home|archivedate=July 18, 2015|location=Astoria, Oregon}}</ref>
