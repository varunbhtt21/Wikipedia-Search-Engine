Title : Sculpture in Scotland
Text : [[File:Kilmartin Sculptured Stones - Poltalloch.jpg|thumb|400px|Sculptured stones from [[Kilmartin Glen]]]]
'''Sculpture in Scotland''' includes all [[visual arts]] operating in three dimensions in the borders of modern Scotland. Durable sculptural processes traditionally include [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material), in stone, metal, clay, wood and other materials. In the modern era these were joined by assembly by [[welding]], [[Physical model|modelling]], [[Molding (process)|moulding]] and [[casting]]. Some [[installation art]] can also be considered to be sculpture. The earliest surviving sculptures from Scotland are standing stones and circles from around 3000 BCE. The oldest portable visual art are carved-stone [[petrosphere]]s and the [[Westray Wife]] is the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are extensive examples of [[rock art]], including [[cup and ring mark]]s and elaborate carved stone [[battle-axe]]s. By the early [[Iron Age]] Scotland had been penetrated by the wider European [[La Tène]] culture, and a few examples of decoration survive from Scotland. There are also decorated [[torc]]s, scabbards, armlets and war trumpets. The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE, leaving a direct sculptural legacy of distance slabs, altars and other sculptures.

Among the most important survivals of Pictish culture are about 250 carved stones. Class I stones are largely unshaped and include incised animals, everyday objects and abstract symbols. Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. Class III stones are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes. Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. [[Dál Riata]] in the west of Scotland was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland. There is evidence for the production of high-status jewellery, hanging bowls and other items that indicate that it was one of the locations where the [[Insular art|Insular style]] was developed, which became common across Great Britain and Ireland. The most significant survivals in sculpture in Insular art are [[high cross]]es, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. [[Viking art]] avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns and later ribbon-interlace and plant motifs became fashionable. In the late Middle Ages examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture and a small number of significant crafted items have also survived. These include highly decorated sacrament houses, carving and monumental effigies. The greatest group of surviving sculptures from this period are from the West Highlands, beginning in the fourteenth century on Iona under the patronage of the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]]. There are also examples of carved chests and chess pieces.

Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation [[iconoclasm]], with the almost total loss of medieval religious sculpture. The tradition of stone and wood carving continued in royal palaces, the great houses of the nobility and even the humbler homes of [[laird]]s and [[burgess (title)|burgesses]]. From the seventeenth century, there was elaborate use of carving in carved pediments, fireplaces, heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs. Many grand tombs for Scottish nobles were situated in [[Westminster Abbey]], rather than in Scottish churches, but there are a few examples as fine as those in England. As in England, sculpture was dominated by foreign professionals. After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. The development of the [[Grand Tour]] led to the buying of artistic works including sculpture and interest in classical and Renaissance styles and Scots became the major figures in the trade in antique sculpture. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.

While opportunities and training for painters had made advances by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of professional sculpture was slower to emerge. There was a movement for the erection of major monuments, representing national sentiments and often focused on national figures. The troubled [[National Monument of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, remained controversial and failed to gain a consensus on its design. The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]]. This trend reached fruition in the next generation and a recognisable national school was established. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. The late nineteenth century saw the beginnings of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in Scotland. The major project of the [[Scottish National War Memorial]] within [[Edinburgh Castle]], provided opportunities for sculptors, many of whom were drawn from [[Edinburgh College of Art]], helping to cement an Arts and Craft ethos. However, a few artists pursued a more [[modernism|modernist]] agenda. After the [[Second World War]] a new generation of artists emerged, often more directly influenced by modernism. The establishment of the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art|National Gallery of Modern Art]] in Edinburgh in 1960 provided new possibilities for the display of sculpture. The 1970s saw the emergence of [[installation art|installation]] and [[environmental art]]. In the late twentieth century, new sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation. Although the first [[sculpture park]] in Scotland was established in 1955, it was in the late 1970s and 1980s that they began to be fully developed. Ideas-based art began to dominate Scottish sculpture from the mid 1980s. A number of women sculptors, public artists and installation artists rose to prominence in what had been a male dominated area. Particularly significant were artists involved with the Transmission Gallery and ''[[Variant (magazine)|Variant]]'' magazine in Glasgow. From the 1990s Scottish sculptural arts began to gain international attention.

The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 CE the occupation was limited to the [[Southern Uplands]] and by the end of the first century the northern extent of Roman occupation was a line drawn between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and [[Solway Firth]].<ref>W.

There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Apollo]]. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house in the shape of a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess [[Fortuna]], both found at [[Bearsden]] Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence.<ref>[http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/collections/permanentdisplays/theantoninewall/theantoninewallslideshow/#d.en.219761 The Antonine Wall: Rome's Final Frontier: Slideshow], ''Glasgow University, The Hunterian'', retrieved 19 April 2014.</ref> Away from the wall Roman sculptures include the marble head of a Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at [[Hawkshaw, Scottish Borders|Hawkshaw]], Peebleshire in the late eighteenth century.

===Picts===

[[File:DunnichenMeffan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Dunnichen Stone]], a Class I incised stone, with [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc and z-rod]], [[Mirror and comb (Pictish symbol)|mirror and comb]] and flower Pictish symbols]]
The Picts were a large tribal confederation of [[Celt]]ic peoples during the [[British Iron Age|Late Iron Age]] and [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Medieval]] periods living in what is now eastern and northern Scotland. Among the most important survivals of Pictish culture are about 250 carved stones. They have been assigned by scholars to three classes.<ref>J. N. G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1991), {{ISBN|0748602917}}, pp. 161–5.</ref> Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals such as fish and the [[Pictish beast]], everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including v-rod, [[Double disc (Pictish symbol)|double disc and z-rod]]. They are found between from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]]. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Examples include the [[Dunrobin Castle|Dunrobin]] (Sutherland) and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]).<ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8>J. [[James Graham-Campbell|Graham-Campbell]] and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, pp. 7–8.</ref>

Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Examples include [[Glamis]] 2, which contains a finely executed [[Celtic cross]] on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow.<ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/> Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones.<ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/> Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.<ref name=Graham-Campbell1998pp.7-8/> Pictish symbols are also found elsewhere, including in the entrance to the Sculptor's Cave, to which they give its name, including the fish, crescent & v-rod, pentacle, triple vesica, step, mirror-case and rectangular symbols.<ref name="canmore.rcahms.gov.uk"/>

Items of metalwork have been found throughout Pictland. The earlier Picts appear to have had a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman [[hacksilver]] found at [[Traprain Law]] may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie's Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down.<ref name=Youngs1989pp26-8>S.

[[Thomas Charles-Edwards]] has suggested that the kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] in the west of Scotland was a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of [[Dunadd]], which combine Pictish and Irish elements.<ref>T. M.

These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.<ref name=Lane2001>A.

Some older Irish [[pseudo-penannular]] brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane Brooch (British Museum).

===Anglo-Saxon and Insular styles===
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon art|Insular art}}
From the sixth century the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Bernicia]], part of [[Northumbria]], stretched into what is now Lowland Scotland. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art from the region include exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone [[Franks Casket]] form the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs.<ref>[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|C. R. Dodwell]], ''Anglo-Saxon Art: A New Perspective'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1982), {{ISBN|071900926X}}, pp. 2–4.</ref> After the Christianisation of Britain from the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.<ref>C. E Karkov, ''The Art of Anglo-Saxon England'' (Boydell Press, 2011), {{ISBN|1843836289}}, p. 5.</ref>

The most significant survivals in sculpture in Insular art are in [[high cross]]es. These are large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition may have begun in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland.<ref name=Koch2006pp915-19>J. T. Koch, ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1–5'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}, pp. 915–19.</ref> They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a [[Celtic cross]], apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at [[Iona]].<ref>D. M.

From the eighth century Scandinavian invaders took territories in the North and West of Scotland, included the [[Northern Isles]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], the [[Hebrides]] and parts of the mainland. Viking art avoided naturalism, favouring stylised animal motifs to create its ornamental patterns. Ribbon-interlace was important and plant motifs became fashionable in the tenth and eleventh centuries.<ref>J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, ''Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0748606416}}, p. 34.</ref> Most Scottish artefacts come from 130 "pagan" burials in the north and west from the mid-ninth to the mid-tenth centuries.<ref>M.

Architectural evidence suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked in much of Europe in the later eleventh century and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland in the second half of the twelfth century<ref>R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth-Century Renaissance'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0719042569}}, p. 155.</ref> and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the [[English Gothic architecture|English perpendicular]] style that had come to dominate.<ref>T.

Two secular small chests with carved whalebone panels and metal fittings illustrate some aspects of the Scottish arts. The Eglington and Fife Caskets are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for valuables such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the caskets follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with "simple decorations of [[fleuron (architectural)|fleuron]]s and debased [[egg and dart]]" while the whalebone panels are carved in [[relief]] with a late form of Insular interwoven [[strapwork]] characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.<ref>V.

===Seventeenth century===
[[File:Edzell Arts Arithmetic.JPG|thumb|upright|left|''Arithmetica'' from the garden of [[Edzell Castle]]]]
From the seventeenth century, as domestic architecture for the nobility was increasingly for comfort, rather than fortification, there was elaborate use of carving in carved pediments, fireplaces, heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs.<ref name="West1985p68">T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), {{ISBN|0-85263-748-9}}, p. 68.</ref> Richly carved decoration on ordinary houses was common in the period. There is also the heraldic carving, such as the royal arms at [[Holyrood Palace]], designed by the Dutch painter [[Jacob de Wet]] in 1677.<ref name="Scott1993p208"/> Elaborate carving was used at [[Huntly Castle]], rebuilt for [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]] (1562–1636) in the early seventeenth century, in wooden panels that focused on heraldic images.

Many grand tombs for Scottish nobles were situated in [[Westminster Abbey]], rather than in Scottish churches.<ref name=Clifford1991p9/> Exceptions include the two tombs designed by the Flemish-born [[Maximilian Colt]] (d. post 1641), the leading sculptor at the English Jacobean court, for [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar]] in [[Dunbar]] parish church (c. 1611) and [[David Murray, 1st Viscount of Stormont]] in the Palace Chapel at [[Scone]] (c. 1618).

[[File:Figures of 'Justice' and 'Mercy', Parliament House, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|right|Justice and Mercy, carved by Alexander Mylne for [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]]]]
Members of the Mylne family dominated royal building and masonry in Scotland in the first half of the seventeenth century. [[John Mylne (d. 1657)|John Mylne]] (c. 1589–1657) completed a statue of James VI begun by [[Benjamin Lambert]] after the latter's death in 1616 and his most famous work was the sundial in Holyrood (1633).

As in England, in the late seventeenth century sculpture was dominated by foreign professionals. Dutch-born [[Grinling Gibbons]] (1648–1721) supplied four large lead statues to [[Glamis Castle]] and in 1701 he supplied seven chimney pieces to [[Dalkeith House]], including one in red and white marble bearing the story of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]].<ref name=Clifford1991pp12-14/> The equestrian statue of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] outside [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] (1684/5) was a lead replica of Gibbon's bronze statue at Windsor, the first in Britain to depict a monarch in classical dress.<ref name=Howarth1991p29/> John Van Ost (fl. 1680–1729) supplied lead garden statuary for [[Hopetoun House]] and [[Drumlanrig Castle]]. Sir [[Sir William Bruce, 1st Baronet, of Balcaskie|William Bruce]] (c. 1630–1710), the leading Scottish architect of the seventeenth century, favoured Dutch carvers for his realisation of [[Kinross House]] in Fife, where there are [[festoon]]s, trophies and [[cornucopia]] around the doorways and gates. This may have included Jan van Sant Voort, a Dutch carver known to have been living in Leith, who supplied Bruce with a carved heraldic [[overdoor]] in 1679 and who worked on Bruce's rebuilding of Holyrood Palace. From 1674 the London plasterers George Funsterfield (fl. 1660–76) and John Houlbert (fl. 1674–79) worked for Bruce at [[Thirlestane]], Berwickshire and at Holyroodhouse. Dunsterfield was also active at [[Balcaskie]], Fife and probably at [[Kellie Castle]], Fife.<ref name=Clifford1991pp12-14>T. Clifford, "Introduction", in F.

After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. The royal family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles followed the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland.<ref name=Clifford1991p9 /> In the late eighteenth century the development of the [[Grand Tour]] took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Stuarts, and led to the buying of artistic works including sculpture and interest in classical and Renaissance styles.<ref name=Cliffordpp14-15/> In the second half of the century Scots became the major figures in the trade in antique sculpture, particularly [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98), Colin Morison (1732–1801) and [[James Byres]] (1734–1817), making them the arbiters of British taste in this area. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of [[James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale]].<ref>B. Skinner, "Scottish Connoisseurship and the Grand Tour" in F. Pearson, ed., ''Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540–1990'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), {{ISBN|0903598140}}, pp. 39–40.</ref>

With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] at the newly founded [[Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh]] in 1753 or the figure of the judge [[Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden|Duncan Forbes]] for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century were being preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.<ref>M. Baker, "'Proper ornaments for a library or Grotto': London sculptors and their Scottish patrons in the eighteenth century" in F. Pearson, ed., ''Virtue and Vision: Sculpture in Scotland 1540–1990'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1991), {{ISBN|0903598140}}, p. 47.</ref> As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of [[John Cheere]]'s yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon]] (1740–99) who produced a monument for [[Robert Dundas, of Arniston, the younger|Robert Dundas]] (d. 1787) at [[Borthwick]] Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at [[Kirk of St Nicholas|West Church, Aberdeen]]. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's ''Artificial Stone Manufactory'' at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, [[Baluster|balustrading]], [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the [[Adam style|Adam brothers]], particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen]], Banff, [[Culzean Castle]], Ayrshire, [[Dunbar Castle]], East Lothian, [[Register House]], Edinburgh, [[Gosford House]], East Lothian and [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]], Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and [[cippi]], the Adam family supplied designs to the [[Carron Company]], founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.<ref name=Cliffordpp14-15>T.

From the late eighteenth century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists. These included statues of druids on the [[portico]] of [[Penicuik House]] carved by one "Willie Jeans" in 1776; the marble bust of [[James Gillespie (philanthropist)|James Gillespie]] by the obscure Robert Burn (fl. 1790–1816) and the bronze figure in Roman armour at the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|City Chambers, Edinburgh]], which may represent [[Charles Edward Stuart]] or [[Louis XV]].<ref name=Clifford1991pp12-14/> [[James Tassie]] (1735–99) was born in Glasgow and trained as a stonemason. He attended the Foulis Academy, founded in Glasgow in 1754 by the printmaking brothers [[Robert Foulis (printer)|Robert]] and [[Andrew Foulis]], before moving to Dublin and then London. He developed a formula for making casts in [[Soft-paste porcelain|vitreous paste]] and manufactured casts of antique [[carved gems]]. He also produced portrait medallions and among his sitters were many leading figures in Scottish intellectual life, such as [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Henry Raeburn]]. His medallions were popular when produced in [[Wedgwood]] [[jasper]] and were used by the Carron Company to be cast in iron.<ref>T. Clifford, "Introduction", in F.

While opportunities and training for painters had made advances by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of professional sculpture was slower to emerge. In the early decades of the century commissions continued to be given to English artists, including [[Samuel Joseph (sculptor)|Samuel Joseph]] (1791–1850), who was working in Edinburgh in 1821–29 and was a founding member of the Scottish Academy. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790–1858) studied in London and settled in Rome, where he received commissions from visiting British subjects before returning to London in 1830. His works in Scotland included the Hopetoun Memorial (1824–34) in Edinburgh. [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) was able to study at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and then Rome. He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life. His most significant works included his busts of [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General David Baird]] and of the [[phrenology|phrenologist]] [[George Combe]] (c. 1830).<ref>M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 90–1.</ref>

There was a movement for the erection of major monuments, representing national sentiments and often focused on national figures. The troubled [[National Monument of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, proposed in 1816 to commemorate the Scottish dead of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], was envisioned as a pillar, arch, church and eventually was modelled on the [[Parthenon]] in Athens by [[Charles Robert Cockerell]] and [[William Henry Playfair]] and moved sites from the Mound to [[Calton Hill]], where the foundation stone was laid in 1822. It remained controversial and failed to gain a consensus on its design. The [[Scott Monument]] in [[Princes Street Gardens]] (1840–48) in Edinburgh was an elaborate structure built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]], designed by carpenter and self-taught architect [[George Meikle Kemp]]. The [[Wallace Monument]], paid for by public subscription and built from 1861 to 1869, is a {{convert|166|ft|m|0}} tower overlooking the site of the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]].<ref>C.

The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). He trained at the Trustee's Academy and in Rome and was elected to the Scottish Academy in 1830 while still in his twenties. The first work of his to gain significant public attention was ''Alexander and Bucephasus''. His 1832 design for a statue of Sir [[Walter Scott]] was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history.<ref name=MacDonald2000pp125-7/> He was created the first [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland]] by Queen Victoria.<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/12/23110750 "No ordinary sculptor"], ''The Scottish Government'', 30 December 2008.</ref>

The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patrick Park (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie (sculptor)|William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] on the exterior of the Wallace Monument and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside, which included [[Robert the Bruce]], [[John Knox]], Walter Scott, [[Robert Burns]], [[James Watt]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced [[Robert Burns (Stevenson)|a statue of the poet]] in Leith. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for Dundee, London and Dunedin. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia and in [[Robert Burns Memorial (Montreal)|Montreal]].<ref name=MacDonald2000pp125-7>M.

The late nineteenth century saw the beginnings of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in Scotland, influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. It began with the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77).<ref>M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 151.</ref> It also influenced the Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement. He produced carpets, ceramics, furniture, glass, graphics, metalwork, including silver and electroplate, including his angular teapot of 1879.<ref>H.

The late nineteenth century and early twentieth century saw the emergence of the [[Glasgow School]], a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The most important grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", included acclaimed architect and artist [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the [[Celtic Revival]], the Arts and Crafts Movement, and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.<ref>S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&nbsp;283–4.</ref> Beside important buildings and paintings, Mackintosh also produced significant and influential objects, including his 1904 designs for an order desk chair for the [[Willow Tea Rooms]] in [[Sauchiehall Street]], Glasgow, based on a highly geometrised version of the willow tree, and his ''Revolving Bookcase for Hous'hill'', which prefigured the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of the next generation.<ref name="MacDonald2000pp144–5">M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 144–5.</ref>

The major project of the [[Scottish National War Memorial]] within [[Edinburgh Castle]], built by [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) to commemorate the dead of the [[First World War]] from 1924 to 1927, provided opportunities for sculptors, many of whom were drawn from [[Edinburgh College of Art]]. These included Percy Portsmouth (1874–1953), [[Alice Meredith Williams]] (1880–1934), and her husband [[Morris Meredith Williams]] (1881–1973), [[Alexander Carrick]] (1882–1966), [[Pilkington Jackson]] (1887–1973) and Phyllis Bone (1894–1972). The project helped cement an Arts and Craft ethos in Scottish sculpture, which was perpetuated Carrick's students Tom Whalen (1903–75) and [[Hew Lorimer]] (1907–93), the son of the architect Robert. Lorimer briefly studied with the leading Arts and Crafts sculptor [[Eric Gill]] and contributed several major works of public sculpture, including the {{convert|27|ft|m|0}} high granite ''[[Our Lady of the Isles]]'' (1957), situated on [[South Uist]].<ref name=MacDonald2000p170/>

In contrast to the prevailing Arts and Crafts ethos in Scotland, influences from contemporary Europe were contributed to sculpture by [[J. D. Fergusson]], best known as one of the [[Scottish Colourists]]. As in his painting, his sculpture, like the bronze bust ''Eastre (Hymn to the Sun)'' (1924), incorporated a [[modernism|modernist]] sensibility.<ref name=MacDonald2000p170>M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 170.</ref> Contemporary developments were also significant in the career of [[Benno Schotz]]. Born in Estonia of Jewish descent, he originally came to Glasgow as an engineer, but changed to sculpture, producing work influenced by [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Jacob Epstein]].<ref name=MacDonald2000p170/> His works included the female figure of ''The Lament'' (1943), which focused on the anguish of the [[Holocaust]]. His influence was extended by his tenure as head of Sculpture at Glasgow School of Art.<ref name="D. Hall 1991 pp. 115">D. Hall, "The twentieth century" in F.

After the [[Second World War]] a new generation of artists emerged, often more directly influenced by modernism. George Innes (1913–70) experimented with [[Pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] and [[Cubism|Cubist]]-influenced [[primitivism]]. Primitivism was also an influence on the early work of [[William Turnbull (artist)|William Turnbull]] (1922–2012) and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] (1924–2005), who met at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] after the war and both later studied in Paris.

The establishment of the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art|National Gallery of Modern Art]] in Edinburgh in 1960 provided new possibilities for the display of sculpture. The grounds were initially dominated by two pieces by [[Henry Moore]] (1898–86), which were late joined by other major works, including those by Scottish artists.<ref name="D.

In the late twentieth century, new sources of direct government arts funding encouraged greater experimentation, which incorporated aspects of modernism. Among the next generation of sculptors such as Jake Harvey (b. 1948), Doug Cocker (b. 1945), Ainslie Yule (b. 1941) and Gavin Scobie (1940–2012).<ref name=Macmillan2011pp153-4/> In contrast to the prevailing trends of modernism and conceptual art [[Sandy Stoddart]] (b. 1959) works primarily on "nationalist" figurative sculpture in clay within the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical tradition]]. He is best known for his civic monuments, including {{convert|10|ft|m}} bronze statues of the philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith (both 1996), on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.<ref name='telegraph'>C.

Ideas-based art began to dominate Scottish sculpture from the mid 1980s.<ref name=MacDonald2000p206/> A number of women sculptors, public artists and installation artists rose to prominence in what had been a male dominated area. These included Kirsty McGhie (b. 1959), Sybille von Halem (b. 1963) and Claire Barclay (b. 1968), all of whom were graduates of Environmental Art at Glasgow.<ref>A.

Although the first [[sculpture park]] in Scotland was established privately at [[Glenkiln Sculpture Park|Glenkiln]], Dumfriesshire in 1955, it was in the late 1970s and 1980s that they began to be fully developed. The Scottish Sculpture Trust founded in 1978 established the Highland Sculpture Park that year. A similar project was soon begun at [[Glenshee]]. The Scottish Sculpture Workshop, begun by sculptor Fred Bushe (1931–2009) in 1979, organised the first [[Scottish Sculpture Open]] at [[Kildrummy Castle]] in 1981 in Aberdeenshire and it became an annual event. The [[Cramond]] Sculpture Park was set up in Edinburgh in 1985 to accommodate the mixed media work emerging from art schools in Scotland. The Highland Sculpture Park, Glenshee and Cramond all closed within a few years, but there are numerous other parks within Scotland.<ref>A.
