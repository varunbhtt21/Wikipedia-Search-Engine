'''Stanley''' is a [[constituency]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] which has been in existence since the first elections in the Falklands in [[1949 Falkland Islands general election|1949]]. The constituency of Stanley consists of the [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|city of the same name]], which is the largest settlement in the Falklands representing almost 75% of the total population of the islands (excluding military personnel). Stanley is one of two constituencies in the Falklands, the other being [[Camp (constituency)|Camp]].

The first elections to the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]] (the predecessor of the Legislative Assembly) took place in [[1949 Falkland Islands general election|1949]] and elected two members from Stanley. The number of members was reduced to one at the [[1977 Falkland Islands general election|1977 election]] with the implementation of the ''Falkland Islands (Legislative Council) (Amendment) Order 1977''. In 1985 the [[Falkland Islands Constitution]] came into force which increased the number of members from Stanley to four, elected through [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]. This was increased to five in [[1997 Falkland Islands general election|1997]] following a constitutional amendment, giving the members from Stanley a majority of the elected seats. In 2009 a new constitution came into force which replaced the Legislative Council with the Legislative Assembly, with all members of the Legislative Council becoming members of the new Legislative Assembly.

In referenda in [[2001 Falkland Islands referendum|2001]] and [[2011 Falkland Islands referendum|2011]], a proposal was put to the [[Falkland Islanders|people of the Falklands]] for the Stanley and Camp constituencies to be abolished and replaced with a single constituency for the entire [[British Overseas Territory|territory]].  The proposal was rejected on both occasions, but in the 2011 referendum a narrow majority of voters in Stanley supported the proposal.<ref name="mercopress-date">{{cite news |title=Falkland Islands voters overwhelmingly reject single constituency proposal |author= |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/11/04/falkland-islands-voters-overwhelmingly-reject-single-constituency-proposal |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |date=4 November 2011|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
