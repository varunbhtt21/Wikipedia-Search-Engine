'''Camp''' is a [[constituency]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] which has been in existence since [[1977 Falkland Islands general election|1977]]. The constituency of Camp consists of the [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|area of the same name]], which is all parts of the [[British Overseas Territory|territory]] outside [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] and [[RAF Mount Pleasant]]. Camp is one of two constituencies in the Falklands, the other being [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley]].

The Camp constituency was created at the [[1977 Falkland Islands general election|1977 election]] with the implementation of the ''Falkland Islands (Legislative Council) (Amendment) Order 1977'', initially electing one member to the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]] (the predecessor of the Legislative Assembly). In 1985 the [[Falkland Islands Constitution]] came into force which increased the number of members from Camp to four, elected through [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]. This was reduced to three in [[1997 Falkland Islands general election|1997]] following a constitutional amendment. In 2009 a new constitution came into force which replaced the Legislative Council with the Legislative Assembly, with all members of the Legislative Council becoming members of the new Legislative Assembly.

In referenda in [[2001 Falkland Islands referendum|2001]] and [[2011 Falkland Islands referendum|2011]], a proposal was put to the [[Falkland Islanders|people of the Falklands]] for the Stanley and Camp constituencies to be abolished and replaced with a single constituency for the entire [[British Overseas Territory|territory]]. The proposal was rejected on both occasions.<ref name="mercopress-date">{{cite news |title=Falkland Islands voters overwhelmingly reject single constituency proposal |author= |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/11/04/falkland-islands-voters-overwhelmingly-reject-single-constituency-proposal |newspaper=[[MercoPress]] |date=4 November 2011|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
