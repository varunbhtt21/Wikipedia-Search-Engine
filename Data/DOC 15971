Title : 1949 Falkland Islands general election
Text : {{Politics of the Falkland Islands}}
The '''Falkland Islands general election of 1949''' was held in February 1949 to elect members to the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]] through [[universal suffrage]]. It was the first election in the history of the [[Falkland Islands]], electing four out of the twelve Councillors (two from [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley]] and one each from [[East Falkland (constituency)|East Falkland]] and [[West Falkland (constituency)|West Falkland]]). Owing to the remoteness of some settlements and the unpredictability of the weather on the Falkland Islands, the election took place over several days.

The [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands]] was founded on 13 November 1845, with its entire membership being appointed by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Governor]]. On 26 November 1948, in a meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] [[George VI]] approved ''Legislative Council (Elections) Ordinance No. 16 of 1948'' which introduced elections to the Falklands for the first time, giving four seats of the Legislative Council to elected members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legislative Council (Elections) Ordinance No. 16 of 1948 |author= |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C3318204 |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=26 November 1948}}</ref>
