He has held the position since 2000.

==Background==

Downs, who has two sisters, is the son of the late [[C. H. "Sammy" Downs]] of Alexandria who served in both houses of the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] and was a confidant of [[governor of Louisiana|Governors]] [[Earl Kemp Long]] and [[John McKeithen]]. His mother, the former Alice Daigre (pronounced 'Dage'), subsequently Alice Downs and then Alice Thomas (1914-1994), was a sister of the Alexandria consulting engineer Louis Jacob Daigre, Jr.<ref name=jamdowns/> Sammy Downs is buried at Greenwood Memorial Park in [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]].<ref>''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Town Talk]]'', May 15, 1985.</ref> Alice Daigre Downs Thomas, who died nine years after her first husband, from whom she was divorced, is interred at the Henderson James Cemetery in rural Hot Wells in Rapides Parish.<ref>''The Town Talk'', August 22, 1994.</ref>

Downs' uncle, J. Earl Downs, was the public safety commissioner in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] prior to 1963, where he served alongside [[List of mayors of Shreveport, Louisiana|Mayors]] [[James C. Gardner]] and [[Clyde Fant]],<ref>[[Elliott Stonecipher]], "Shreveport History: In Support of the Spring Street Museum", February 4, 2012.</ref> He was unseated in the 1962 Democratic primary by [[George W. D'Artois]].

==Legal career==

Like his father and brother, Downs is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and a graduate of the [[Louisiana State University Law Center]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldaa.org/main/roster.php?page=9th|title=Louisiana District Attorneys Association|publisher=ldaa.org|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> Before his election as DA, Jam Downs had been an assistant district attorney. He is known for his interest in [[conservation movement|conservation]], hunting, and enforcement of game laws. He was born in [[Cheneyville, Louisiana|Cheneyville]] but resides with his wife, the former Maureen Stewart, in a restored farmhouse near [[Lecompte, Louisiana|Lecompte]], also in Rapides Parish.<ref name=jamdowns>{{cite web|url=http://www.lwaa.org/pdf/LGW_spring_2005%204.pdf |title=Rick, Markway, "The Prosecutor: District Attorney James Crawford 'Jam' Downs" |publisher=lwaa.org |accessdate=June 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062258/http://www.lwaa.org/pdf/LGW_spring_2005%204.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

"Jam" Downs is not related to the late John Harden Barnett Downs, known as Johnny Downs, a five-term member of the Alexandria City Council and the namesake of the Johnny Downs Sports Complex at 271 Vandenburg Drive in Alexandria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://otbelgard.com/pignut/pages/genealogy/f983.html|title=John Harden Barnett Downs|publisher=otbelgard.com|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/106880624859852578694/about?gl=us&hl=en|title=Johnny Downs Sports Complex|publisher=plus.google.com|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}</ref>

At least three candidates have announced that they will run in the November 4, 2014 [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] to choose a successor to Downs, who customarily ran without an opponent. One was [[Louisiana House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Chris Hazel]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Ball, Louisiana|Ball]] and a former assistant DA under Downs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140429/NEWS01/304290022/Boyce-businessman-Grant-announces-run-Congress-Hazel-won-t-run-seat|title=Jeff Matthews, Boyce businessman Grant announces run for Congress; Hazel won't run for [U.S. House] seat, April 28, 2014|publisher=''Alexandria Town Talk''|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref> Democrat [[Chris Roy, Jr.]], a former state representative and the brother of [[Jacques Roy (mayor)|Jacques Roy]], the mayor of Alexandria, has also announced for the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140219/NEWS01/140219001/Chris-Roy-Jr-run-Rapides-Parish-district-attorney|title=Chris Roy Jr. to run for Rapides Parish district attorney, February 19, 2014|publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk''|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref> Phillip Terrell, a former city judge in Pineville with decades of legal experience, was the third candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140404/NEWS01/140404003/Phillip-Terrell-former-Pineville-judge-enters-race-Rapides-Parish-district-attorney|title=Phillip Terrell, former Pineville judge, enters race for Rapides Parish district attorney, April 4, 2014|publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk''|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref> Ultimately, Terrell defeated Hazel in a close [[runoff election]] on December 6 and will succeed Downs in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/12062014/12062014_40.html|title=Runoff election returns, December 6, 2014|publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]]|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref>
