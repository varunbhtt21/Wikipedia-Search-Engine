Paisley told ''[[The Tennesseean]]'' that the song idea come from his own upbringing near the [[Ohio River]]: "My best memories with my grandfather are on that body of water, and my dad, and learning to ski. It's kind of like a back-to-basics song, which is really an inner tube and a boat and you've got a theme park."<ref name="tenn">{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/04/11/brad-paisley-new-single-river-bank/7602447/|title=Brad Paisley talks about his favorite 'River Bank'|last=Watts|first=Cindy|date=12 April 2014|work=The Tennesseean|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
