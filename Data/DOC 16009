==Background==
{{main|Appropriations bill (United States)}}

An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities.<ref name=CRSappropsIntro>{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=23 January 2014|date=23 February 2012}}</ref> Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The ''fiscal year'' is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year.<ref name=crsBasicBudgetTerms>{{cite web|last=Heniff Jr.|first=Bill|title=Basic Federal Budgeting Terminology|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-410.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=9 January 2014|date=26 November 2012}}</ref> The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill.

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger [[United States budget process|United States budget and spending process]]. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The [[U.S. Constitution]] ([[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], section 9, clause 7) states that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law..." This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.<ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/> 

The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies]]. The bill covers appropriations for military construction and for the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], but not most of the [[United States Department of Defense]] or its operations, which is handled separately. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.<ref name=tollestrupCRSapprops34>{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=24 January 2014|pages=3â€“4|date=23 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/congress-shutdown-debate.html | title=Government Near Broad Shutdown in Budget Impasse | work=The New York Times | date=September 30, 2013 | last1=Weisman | first1=Jonathan | last2=Peters | first2=Jeremy W. | accessdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref> The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the [[Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014]], and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the [[United States debt ceiling|debt limit]] until February 7, 2014.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Cohen | first1=Tom | title=House approves bill to end shutdown | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/16/politics/shutdown-showdown/index.html | publisher=CNN International | accessdate=October 17, 2013 | date=October 17, 2013}}</ref> In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman [[Hal Rogers]] has stated that his goal is to pass all [[2015 United States federal appropriations|twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015]] before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation.<ref name=nextweek25ap>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Next week:Appropriations season begins|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/204424-next-week-appropriations-season-begins|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> This bill is the earliest to be considered since 1974, according to the Chairman.<ref name="nextweek25ap"/><ref name="WedsHouseApprops"/>
