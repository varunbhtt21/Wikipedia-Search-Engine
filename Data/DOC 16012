== Works ==
=== ''The Negotiation of Cultural Identity'' (1999) ===
''The Negotiation of Cultural Identity: Perceptions of European Americans and African Americans'' examines [[African-American]] and [[European-American]] students' identities through [[focus group]]s. Jackson's questions focus on similarities and differences between African Americans' and European Americans' cultural self-definitions, similarities and differences in their negotiations of [[cultural identity]], the long-term consequences of cultural identity negotiation, and the conditions under which cultural identities are reconsidered. Jackson finds that European Americans' lives are largely unexamined in the cultural realm, whereas African Americans believed in the necessity of a strong cultural identity.<ref name="boyd" /> Writing in the ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', Heather Hartwig Boyd praised Jackson's approach and analysis as offering "useful insights about how respondents do or do not define their own cultures", but suggested that the focus group approach may not be "the most effective way to determine whether the respondents have experienced long-term consequences to identity negotiation."<ref name="boyd">{{cite journal |title=Review of Thomas Wartenberg, ''Unlikely Couples: Movie Romance as Social Criticism''; Ronald L.

=== ''African American Communication'' (2003) ===
{{Main|African American Communication}}
''African American Communication: Exploring Identity and Culture'', coauthored with [[Michael Hecht]] and [[Sidney A. Ribeau]], seeks to demonstrate why and how communication in interpersonal interactions between African Americans differs from that between European Americans. The authors argue that African-American identity, [[communicative competence]], language style and relationship formation and maintenance are strategies adopted in order to navigate a dominant European power structure than inhibits cultural authenticity and access to power. The book won the 2003 National Communication Association African American Communication & Culture's Distinguished Scholarship Award.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review of Michael L. Hecht, Ronald L.

=== ''Understanding African American Rhetoric'' (2003) ===
''Understanding African American Rhetoric: Classical Origins to Contemporary Innovations'' is a collection of essays edited by Jackson and [[Elaine B. Richardson]]. Winner of the National Communication Association African American Communication & Culture's 2004 Distinguished Scholarship Award the book seeks to challenge [[Eurocentric]] assumptions in [[communication studies]] and to celebrate the African American rhetorical tradition, and covers topics including conceptions of African rhetoric as a rhetoric of community and resistance, a new orientation toward rhetoric centering oral discourse, and the politics of defining African American rhetoric. Cory L. Young, writing in the ''Southern Communication Journal'', found the strength of the collection in its "broad range of essays that appeals to a wide variety of academic audiences, and its [[dialectical]] perspective and embrace of the "contradictions and tensions inherent in the labels African and American."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review of Ronald L.

Schuman described the book's insights as "disparate but important" and singled out Kali Tal's essay "From Panther to Monster", on the [[Black Power]] movement, for praise.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review of Elaine B.

=== ''Black Pioneers in Communication Research'' (2006) ===
''Black Pioneers in Communication Research'', written by Jackson and Sonja M. Brown Givens, is the 2006 winner of the National Communication Association African American Communication & Culture Division's award for scholarly excellence.  It is a one-of-a-kind collection of biographical and critical snapshots of black scholars in communication studies, including [[Molefi Kete Asante]], [[Donald Bogle]], [[Oscar H. Gandy Jr.]], and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]. The authors argue that mainstream scholarship has failed to acknowledge the contributions of black thinkers. Bryant Keith Alexander, writing in the ''[[European Journal of Cultural Studies]]'', praised the book's biographical sections, which "outline central components and values of African-based cultures" and described the book as a whole as "a much-needed volume for both young black scholars seeking a historical foothold ... as well as scholars seeking to understand the tone and tenure, the breadth and depth of scholarship written by black communication scholars".<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Review of Ronald L. Jackson II and Sonja M.

=== ''Scripting the Black Masculine Body'' (2006) ===
In ''Scripting the Black Masculine Body: Identity, Discourse and Racial Politics in Popular Media'' Jackson uses approaches from intercultural communication and critical identity studies to argue for a "scripting" (see [[Behavioral script]]) of African American identities, especially with regard to the black male body. He focuses on black body politics in the [[Jim Crow]] era and contemporary productions of black masculinity in film, music and news broadcasts. This book won the 2007 National Communication Association International & Intercultural Communication Division award for best scholarly book. Writing for ''Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries'', D. E. Magill described the book as "a significant contribution to the literature on masculinity studies, [[African American studies]], and intercultural communications ... Highly recommended.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review of Jackson, Ronald L., II.

=== ''Encyclopedia of Identity'' (2010) ===
The ''Encyclopedia of Identity'', edited by Jackson won the 2011 American Library Association's Outstanding Reference Source award.  It is an [[encyclopedia]] comprising over 300 entries that approach [[Identity (social science)|identity]] as a [[socially constructed]] phenomenon and address its relevance to everyday life. W. Fontaine, writing for ''Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries'', recommended the encyclopedia "for libraries serving programs focused on issues of identity" but criticised the articles' bibliographies and uneven level of comprehensibility.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Review of Ronald L. Jackson II with Michael A. Hogg (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Identity'' |date=March 2011 |last=Fontaine |first=W. |journal=[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]] |issue=7 |pages=48–3597 |doi=10.5860/CHOICE.48-3597 |volume=48}}</ref>

=== ''Masculinity in the Black Imagination'' (2011) ===
''Masculinity in the Black Imagination: Politics of Communicating Race and Manhood'' is a collection of essays edited by Jackson and Mark C. Hopson. The book employs an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to examine black masculinity, focusing on [[communication studies]], [[ethnography]], history, [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The editors propose that moving beyond the discourse of black masculinity requires an expansion of the imagination. Topics covered include the history of [[racism in the United States]] in comparison with [[racism in Australia]], [[black Greek letter organizations]], black men's performances of gender and masculinity, black masculinity in different forms of media, and personal examinations of black masculinity. Marjorie L. Dorimé-Williams in ''Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men'' described the book as "a worthwhile contribution to the field of [[gender studies]], Black male masculinity, and the general conversation about race and gender relations."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/spe/summary/v001/1.1.dorime-williams.html |title=Review of Ronald L.

Howard, and winner of the 2014 International Comic-Con Will Eisner Award for Best Academic/Scholarly Work. Sheena Howard became the 1st African American woman to receive the coveted Eisner Award.

Topics covered include the political activism of cartoonist [[Jackie Ormes]], cartoon depictions of [[Condoleezza Rice]], and [[Aaron McGruder]]'s ''[[The Boondocks (comic strip)|The Boondocks]]''.

Lent, writing for ''Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries'', recommended the book but warned of "shoddy editing" and noted that the essays "vary in quality and proficiency".<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Review of Sheena C.
