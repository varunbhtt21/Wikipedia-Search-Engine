[[File:Oilshale.jpg|none|100px|Burning oil shale.]]</div>'''Oil shale''', also known as '''kerogen shale''', is an organic-rich [[fine-grained]] [[sedimentary rock]] containing [[kerogen]] (a solid mixture of [[organic chemical compound]]s) from which liquid [[hydrocarbon]]s called [[shale oil]] can be produced.  Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil; however, extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its [[Environmental impact of the oil shale industry|environmental impact]]. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposits]] of oil shale occur around the world. Estimates of global deposits range from {{convert|2.8|to|3.3|Toilbbl|e9m3}} of recoverable oil.

Heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical process of [[pyrolysis]] to [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]] a [[vapor]]. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid [[shale oil]]—an [[unconventional oil]]—is separated from [[Combustibility|combustible]] [[Oil shale gas|oil-shale gas]] (the term ''[[shale gas]]'' can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also be [[combustion|burned]] directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for [[Electricity generation|power generation]] and [[district heating]] or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.

Oil-shale mining and processing raise a number of environmental concerns, such as [[land use]], [[waste management|waste disposal]], [[Water resources|water use]], [[Water pollution|waste-water management]], [[greenhouse gas emissions|greenhouse-gas emission]]s and [[air pollution]]. [[Estonia]] and China have well-established oil shale industries, and [[Brazil]], Germany, and Russia also utilize oil shale. ('''[[Oil shale|see more...]]''')
