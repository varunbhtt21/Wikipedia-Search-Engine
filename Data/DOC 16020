[[File:OilShaleEstonia.jpg|none|100px|Oil shale.]]</div>'''Oil shale geology''' is a branch of [[geology|geologic sciences]] which studies the formation and composition of [[oil shale]]s&ndash;fine-grained [[sedimentary rock]]s containing significant amounts of [[kerogen]], and belonging to the group of [[sapropel]] [[fuel]]s.  Oil shale formation takes place in a number of depositional settings and has considerable compositional variation. Oil shales can be classified by their composition ([[carbonate mineral]]s such as [[calcite]] or [[detrital]] minerals such as [[quartz]] and [[Clay minerals|clays]]) or by their [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] (large [[lake]]s, shallow marine, and [[lagoon]]/small lake settings). Much of the organic matter in oil shale is of [[algae|algal]] origin, but may also include remains of [[Vascular plant|vascular land plants]]. Three major type of organic matter ([[maceral]]s) in oil shale are [[telalginite]], [[lamalginite]], and bituminite. Some oil-shale deposits also contain metals which include [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[uranium]].

Most oil shale deposits were formed during Middle [[Cambrian]], Early and Middle [[Ordovician]], Late [[Devonian]], Late [[Jurassic]], and [[Paleogene]] times through burial by sedimentary loading on top of the algal swamp deposits, resulting in conversion of the organic matter to kerogen by [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] processes. The largest deposits are found in the remains of large lakes such as the deposits of the [[Green River Formation]] of Wyoming and Utah, USA. Oil-shale deposits formed in the shallow seas of continental shelves generally are much thinner than large lake basin deposits. ('''[[Oil shale geology|see more...]]''')
