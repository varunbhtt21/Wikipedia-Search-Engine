==History==
SAFE-BIDCO was established in 1981 to provide loans to small businesses for the purpose of manufacturing or purchasing alternative energy equipment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kolanowski|first=Bernard|title=Small-scale Cogeneration handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Jedakxqh3AC&lpg=PA75&dq=SAFE-BIDCO&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=SAFE-BIDCO&f=false|year=2011|publisher=Fairmont Press|page=75}}</ref>

In 1986 its mandate was expanded to include non-energy-related loans to minority owned small businesses or exporting companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/1989/473_0189_an_evaluation_of_the_states_alternative_energy_finance_program_safe-bidco.pdf|title=An Evaluation of the State's Alternative Energy Finance Progralll (SAFE-BIDeD)|date=January 1989|work=California Legislative Analyst's Office|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref> 

In 1997, the organization expanded its mandate to serve State Loan Guarantees to Northern California. In 2011, SAFE-BIDCO was authorized to use state loan guarantee trust fund capital to help secure farm loans, guaranteed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]].<ref name = napavalley>{{cite web|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/business/columnists/beth-pratt/small-business-lending-local-forum-on-thursday/article_164e26d6-8570-11e3-af04-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Small business lending: local forum on Thursday|publisher=napavalleyregister.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

In April, 2017, the State Auditor released a report warning SAFE-BIDCO was at high risk of insolvency. The report also noted, "Despite its declining financial position, SAFE-BIDCO has imprudently spent its limited funds on questionable items such as continuing with a business development contractor that did not meet his performance milestones for several years. Additionally, during fiscal years 2011–12 through 2015–16, SAFE-BIDCO’s chief executive officer [Mary Jo Dutra] made 16 out-of-state trips and one international trip to Ireland."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsa.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2016-133.pdf|title=At Risk of Insolvency, It Needs Increased Oversight if It Is to Receive State Funding and Continue to Help Small Businesses in California Gain Financing|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>
