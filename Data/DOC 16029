<small>5x expanded by [[User:DPVel|DPVel]] ([[User talk:DPVel|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Mshochet|Mshochet]] ([[User talk:Mshochet|talk]]) at 19:48, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

*[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] The article was expanded starting on April 14, 2014, but not nominated until fifteen days later, on April 29. This is too far beyond the five-day nomination requirement for DYK to qualify. I hope next time the nomination is submitted sooner. Other issues include the failure to format the hook properly—no bolding, etc.—but those would be fixable if the nomination had been submitted in a timely fashion. Note that if the article is eventually listed as a Good Article after the usual nomination and review process, it will be eligible for DYK then provided it is nominated within five days of listing.
