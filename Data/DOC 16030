The '''Campaign for Labour Party Democracy''' ('''CLPD''') is a group of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] activists campaigning for changes to the [[Labour Party Rule Book|constitution of the Labour Party]] to ensure that Labour MPs and Labour governments enacted policies agreeable to the party membership. It was founded by activists in 1973, with support from about ten Labour MPs, and its first President was [[Frank Allaun]].<ref>Jad Adams, ''Tony Benn'' (London: Macmillan, 1992), p. 393.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.freeuk.net/clpd/history.htm |title=c l p d - a potted history |publisher=CLPD |accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref> A leading co-founder was [[Vladimir Derer]], and his house in [[Golders Green]] became CLPD's headquarters for about 25 years.<ref name=guardian-20140612>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/12/vladimir-derer |title=Vladimir Derer obituary |author=Chris Mullin |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=independent-20140726>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/vladimir-derer-campaign-for-labour-party-democracy-cofounder-who-helped-modernise-the-party-and-make-it-more-electable-9630204.html |title=Vladimir Derer: Campaign for Labour Party Democracy co-founder who helped modernise the party and make it more electable |author=Peta Steel |newspaper=The Independent |date=26 July 2014 |accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>

==History==
Amongst the changes desired were mandatory [[reselection]] of MPs, for the party leader to be elected on a franchise wider than MPs and for the party manifesto to be drafted by the [[National Executive Committee]] rather than the parliamentary leadership.<ref>Adams, p. 394.</ref> [[Tony Benn]] was the foremost advocate of CLPD demands.<ref>Adams, p. 393.</ref> In the late 1970s, CLPD had about 450 members and nearly 300 affiliated organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/arc/collection/pressuregrouparchives/clpd.html |title=Pressure Group Archives Subject Guide - Campaign for Labour Party Democracy |publisher=University of Hull |accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>

In the 1980s, the CLPD became the first Labour organisation to call for more representation of women within the Party, which eventually led to [[all-women shortlists]] to select candidates being adopted in the Labour Party.<ref name=guardian-20140612/><ref name=independent-20140726/>

== Recent developments ==
In 2015, CLPD member [[Jeremy Corbyn]] was elected as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]], and took forward the CLPD agenda of increasing democracy in the Labour Party by putting forward reforms to increase the ability of the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Party Conference]] to determine Labour Party policy.<ref name='independent-2015'>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-to-consult-on-plans-to-give-supporters-greater-powers-a6770846.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn makes first move to rein in rebellious Labour MPs|date=13 December 2015|accessdate=13 December 2015|newspaper=The Independent|author=Tom McTague}}</ref> Corbyn has not advocated mandatory reselection for Labour MPs now that he is Labour leader - a demand that he, along with Tony Benn and other members of the CLPD, had made in the 1980s - but because of the Conservative government's [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|constituency boundary redrawing]], all MPs intending to stand again were due to face reselection by October 2018 anyway; to date, this has not happened.<ref name='independent-2015'/>

During the 2016 Labour Party National Executive Committee elections, the CLPD did not support [[Ann Black]], who was backed by the CLGA (the remainder of their slate was backed by the CLPD, after she voted in favour of a ban on members who joined within six months of the election being announced having a vote.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} This caused uncertainty among party members as to whether they should consider another choice of candidate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Black was re-elected.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
