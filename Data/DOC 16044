The '''38th general election''' in [[Yukon]], Canada, took place on November 7, 2016 to return members to the 34th Yukon Legislative Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-territorial-election-call-2016-1.3784292 |title=Carbon tax and First Nations relations: Parties lay out agendas for Yukon election |publisher=CBC News |date=2016-10-07 |accessdate=2016-10-31}}</ref>

The election was fought over issues relating to the economy, the environment, First Nations reconciliation, [[fracking]], and the merits of a territorial carbon tax. The incumbent [[Yukon Party]] government, led by [[Darrell Pasloski]], was defeated by the third party [[Yukon Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] of [[Sandy Silver]], ending 14 years of Yukon Party rule.

Premier Darrell Pasloski lost his own seat.

==2016 Campaign==

During the campaign, the issues of economic diversification, environmental management, and First Nations reconciliation were central themes, as was each party's stance on fracking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/5-things-watch-yukon-election-campaign-1.3800865 | title=5 things to watch during the Yukon election campaign|publisher=[[CBC North]]|date=October 12, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> The announcement that the federal government would impose a national [[carbon tax]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-trudeau-climate-change-1.3788825 | title=Justin Trudeau gives provinces until 2018 to adopt carbon price plan|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=October 3, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> also affected the political direction of the campaign, with the Yukon Party vowing to fight any effort to impose a carbon tax on the Yukon.

The incumbent Yukon Party, led by Darrell Pasloski since 2011, had governed the Yukon since 2002 when it defeated the Yukon Liberal Party. While the Yukon Party had been re-elected in 2011 during a commodity boom, by 2016 the Yukon economy was in a recession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yukon-news.com/news/economic-outlook-bleak-for-yukon/ | title=Economic outlook 'bleak' for Yukon|publisher=[[Yukon News]]|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> Leading into the 2016 campaign, the Yukon Party was drawing criticism over its poor relationship with First Nations, its stance on the environment, access to healthcare, and a perceived mismanagement of the Yukon economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-territorial-election-call-2016-1.3784292 | title=Carbon tax and First Nations relations: Parties lay out agendas for Yukon election |publisher=[[CBC North]]|date=October 7, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

The Yukon Party ran on a campaign of ''True North''. Central to this campaign was prioritizing the creation of jobs, growing the economy, and keeping taxes low. It also adamantly opposed the federal carbon tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-election-yukon-party-platform-1.3825006 | title=Yukon Party touts record, promises jobs in 'True North' platform|publisher=[[CBC North]]|date=October 28, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

The Yukon Party entered the 2016 campaign with ten of its twelve MLAs seeking re-election, albeit it with two running in different ridings ([[Scott Kent]] and [[Doug Graham (Canadian politician)|Doug Graham]]).

The Yukon New Democratic Party, led by Liz Hanson, had been the Official Opposition since 2011. The party had been critical of the Yukon Party's relationship with First Nations, its stewardship of the economy, and its management of government services such as healthcare.

The Yukon New Democratic Party ran on a campaign of ''Building a Better Yukon''. The party emphasized the need for a change in government, and championed causes such as improving the healthcare system, transparent government, First Nations reconciliation, and economic diversification. It supported investing a federal carbon tax in green energy and low income supports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-ndp-election-platform-hanson-1.3827250 | title=NDP election platform promises to 'build a better Yukon'|publisher=[[CBC North]]|date=October 29, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

All six Yukon New Democratic Party MLAs sought re-election.

The Yukon Liberal Party, led by Sandy Silver, held only one seat after [[Darius Elias]] joined the Yukon Party. The Liberal platform, ''Be Heard'', promoted economic diversification, responsible environmental management, and improving First Nations relations. The Liberals promised to return funds raised from a federal carbon tax back to Yukoners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-liberal-election-platform-released-1.3821401 | title=Yukon Liberals promise 'balanced approach,' transparency in government
|publisher=[[CBC North]]|date=October 25, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

Despite having only one seat, the party gained visibility in late 2015 following the election the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] to a majority government; it had also been the Third Party. The Yukon Liberal Party had led in the two opinion polls prior to the election period, despite holding just one seat in the legislature – Sandy Silver's district of [[Klondike (electoral district)|Klondike]]. The Liberals also gained attention due to a series of high-profile contested nominations that helped build the profile of their candidates and party in the lead up to the campaign.

The Yukon Green Party, led by [[Frank De Jong]], running in its second election, championed the issue of climate change and electoral reform. It also opposed the public funding of Catholic schools. The Green Party had no incumbent MLAs leading into the election, but managed to run five candidates during the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-liberal-election-platform-released-1.3821401 |title=De Jong takes over Green Party leadership as candidates step forward |publisher=[[Yukon News]]|date=September 2, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

Controversy arose when the Chief Electoral Officer launched two inquiries during the campaign, citing concerns about proxy voting, special ballots, and purposeful misinformation by all three candidates in the [[Mountainview (electoral district)|Mountainview]] riding, as well as the use of proxy votes by Liberal candidate Tamara Goeppel in the [[Whitehorse Centre (electoral district)|Whitehorse Centre]] riding. The Chief Electoral Officer eventually ruled that there was no wrongdoing in Mountainview,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-election-moutainview-riding-inquiry-outcome-1.3839100 | title=Yukon chief electoral officer dismisses all concerns in Mountainview riding inquiry|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 6, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> but her inquiry into Whitehorse Centre led the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] to press charges in February 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/elections-yukon-proxy-vote-rcmp-1.3830746 | title=Yukon NDP leader calls on Tamara Goeppel to step aside, as RCMP investigates proxy votes

The election also marked a continued trend in the turnout at advance polls, which had doubled in each of the previous two elections.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-advance-poll-turnout-2016-election-1.3829712 Record number of ballots cast in Yukon's advance polls] CBC North.

This represented more than one-in-three votes cast in the election overall (18,787).<ref>[http://results.electionsyk.ca/results/wtResults.htm Unofficial Sum of Votes Cast in the 2016 Election] Elections Yukon.

===Results===

The Yukon Liberal Party was elected to a majority government on November 7, 2016, with 11/19 seats. The 2016 election resulted in one of the single-largest gain of seats for a party in Yukon history (+10), tying for the Yukon Party win of [[2002 Yukon general election|2002]]. It was the Liberals' second time being elected to power in the Yukon.

The Liberals also posted their best ever returns in rural Yukon, winning four of eight rural seats. In Whitehorse, the Liberals posted their second-best returns in party history, taking seven of eleven seats (the party had swept the city in the 2000 election). However, despite winning the popular vote comfortably, many Liberal margins of victory were quite narrow.

A judicial recount was later held to confirm the results in the districts of [[Vuntut Gwitchin (electoral district)|Vuntut Gwitchin]] and Mountainview. It was determined that in both instances, the Liberal candidate won by seven votes.

The Yukon Party saw five of its MLAs re-elected, with one new candidate, [[Geraldine Van Bibber]], elected. However, Premier Pasloski, Deputy Premier Elaine Taylor, and ministers Mike Nixon and Doug Graham were all defeated. The party also failed to retain two of the three seats where incumbents had not sought re-election.

The New Democratic Party lost four of its six seats, with party leader Liz Hanson and incumbent [[Kate White]] the only two re-elected. In two ridings, New Democrat incumbents lost narrowly to Liberal star candidates: [[Kevin Barr]] lost to former Whitehorse City Councillor and environmental scientist [[John Streicker]] by 14 votes in [[Mount Lorne-Southern Lakes]] and [[Jan Stick]] lost to former Ombudsman [[Tracy McPhee]] by 37 votes in [[Riverdale South]]. It was the party's worst electoral showing since 1978.

No Green Party candidate was elected.

Surprisingly, the number of individual votes received by the Yukon Party and the New Democrats was also largely unchanged; each party received only about 200 votes less than it had in 2011. The gain in Liberal support (+3,500 votes) could possibly be attributable in part to the increase in Yukon population between 2011 and 2016. In ridings where the population had increased notably in that time - [[Whitehorse West]], [[Porter Creek Centre]], [[Mount Lorne-Southern Lakes]], [[Whitehorse Centre]], [[Porter Creek North]], [[Takhini-Kopper King]], and [[Copperbelt South]] - Liberal support rose substantially over the [[2011 Yukon general election|last campaign]].{{Original research inline|date=May 2018}} Despite this increase in votes, however, the Yukon Liberal Party still received a smaller share of the popular vote than the Yukon Party did in the [[2011 Yukon general election|2011 election]]. In some of these larger ridings too, the Liberals saw a significant increase in votes, only to lose still.

Turnout was 79.9% (18,787 votes), the highest in Yukon history and the highest since 1996.<ref>[http://results.electionsyk.ca/results/wtResults.htm Unofficial Sum of Votes Cast] Elections Yukon, November 7, 2016. Retrieved February 2, 2017.</ref>

===Campaign Donations===

The election marked the highest-ever levels of expenditures and revenue (cash and in-kind) by the Yukon political parties in an election year. In 2016, Elections Yukon reported that the Yukon Party raised $236,015, the Yukon Liberal Party raised $233,243, the Yukon New Democrats raised $165,817, and the Yukon Green Party raised $5,948.<ref>[http://electionsyk.ca/en/docs/Annual%20Return%20Report%202016-ENG%20WEBSITE.pdf Contributions to Candidates and Political Parties in the 2016 Calendar Year] Elections Yukon (May 30, 2017).</ref> Compared to the 2011 election, this was a drastic increase. In that campaign, the Yukon Party raised $153,892.90, the Yukon Liberal Party raised $71,159.53, the Yukon New Democrats raised $75,616.35, and the Yukon Green Party raised $575. The then-active [[Yukon First Nations Party]] raised $1,104.<ref>[http://www.electionsyukon.gov.yk.ca/docs/report_contributions11.pdf Report of the Chief Electoral Officer on Election Financing and Political Contributions, 2011] Elections Yukon (April 1, 2012).</ref> Nonetheless, despite a significant increase in fundraising revenue, all three major parties reported significant campaign deficits in 2016.

Overall, the Yukon Liberals benefited from the largest single contribution, while the Yukon Party benefited from the most corporate donations and the New Democrats from the most individual donations. Of particular interest was that the Yukon Liberal Party in 2016 raised more than five times what it raised collectively between 2011 and 2015. Nearly a quarter of the Liberals' donations came from large donations from mining companies.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-wild-west-of-campaign-funding-1.4163208 Corporate, mining and out of territory donations fill Yukon campaign coffers] ''CBC North'' (Walter Strong), June 15, 2017.</ref>

===Whitehorse Centre Investigation===

During the 2016 campaign, Liberal candidate for Whitehorse Centre, Tamara Goeppel, was accused of soliciting proxy ballots from ten homeless people in her riding. Proxy votes, a form of franchise in which voters surrender their vote to another in their stead, are intended for use only by voters who have reason to believe they will be absent from the territory on voting day and advanced polling days.

The Chief Electoral Officer opened an investigation into Goeppel during the campaign, and despite calls to drop Goeppel as a candidate, Liberal Leader Sandy Silver continued to support her candidacy. Goeppel was defeated by New Democrat Leader Liz Hanson on election night.<ref>[http://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/ex-candidate-enters-pleas-of-not-guilty Ex-candidate enters pleas of not guilty] ''Whitehorse Star'' (June 12, 2017).</ref>

In February 2017, the Chief Electoral Officer's investigation led to the RCMP charging Goeppel with two counts of "aiding or abetting persons in making proxy applications that were not in accordance with Section 106 of the (Yukon Elections) Act," and one count of "inducing persons to falsely declare on proxy application that they would be absent from the Yukon during the hours fixed for voting." If convicted, Goeppel faces a $5,000 fine, up to a year in jail, or both.<ref>[http://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/goeppel-to-rigorously-defend-herself-lawyer Goeppel to ‘rigorously’ defend herself: lawyer] ''Whitehorse Star'' (Sidney Cohen), February 16, 2017.</ref>

Goeppel entered a plea of not guilty in June 2017. Her trial date is not yet determined.<ref>[http://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/ex-candidate-enters-pleas-of-not-guilty Ex-candidate enters pleas of not guilty] ''Whitehorse Star'' (June 12, 2017).</ref> She is the first person to be charged under the ''Yukon Elections Act''.<ref>[http://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/ex-candidate-enters-pleas-of-not-guilty Ex-candidate enters pleas of not guilty] ''Whitehorse Star'' (June 12, 2017).</ref>
