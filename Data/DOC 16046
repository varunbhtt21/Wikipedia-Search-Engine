'''''Champagne or Guinness''''' is an [[extended play]]  released by Irish girl group [[B*Witched]] in 2014. After reuniting as part of the TV series ''[[The Big Reunion]]'' in 2012 and the success of the [[The Big Reunion (concerts)|subsequent tour]], B*Witched began recording new music. ''Champagne or Guinness'' was their first EP in over a decade,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.closeronline.co.uk/2014/08/closer-online-exclusive-keavy-lynch-edele-will-win-celebrity-big-brother-i-m-putting-money-on-it |title=Closer Online Exclusive: Keavy Lynch: 'Edele will win Celebrity Big Brother – I'm putting money on it' |last=Hooper |first=Ellie |date=22 August 2014 |work=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref> following "Across America 2000" in 2000.

==Background and composition==
B*Witched released their second album, ''[[Awake and Breathe]]'', in 1999. Though it was certified platinum in the UK, it was less successful than their [[B*Witched (album)|debut self-titled album]]. Just before they were to begin recording their third album in 2002, they were told that their record label, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], had dropped them.<ref name=bustle/> A discussion took place amongst the members of the group in relation to finding another record label, however, the group officially split later that year when [[Sinéad O'Carroll]] decided to leave the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2278886/Edele-Lynch-reveals-fears-reuniting-Sin-ad-OCarroll-left-Big-Reunion.html |title='I'm nervous': B*Witched's Edele Lynch reveals fears about reuniting with Sinéad O'Carroll for first time since she left on Big Reunion |last=Strang |first=Fay |date=15 February 2013 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |access-date=10 October 2015}}</ref>

On 18 October 2012, it was announced that B*Witched would reunite for an [[ITV2]] series entitled ''[[The Big Reunion]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a431534/atomic-kitten-5ive-bwitched-911-more-to-reunite-for-itv2-show.html|title=Atomic Kitten, 5ive, B*Witched, 911, more to reunite for ITV2 show|last=Goodacre|first=Kate|date=26 April 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=8 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-18/atomic-kitten-5ive-and-bwitched-to-reform-for-itv2s-the-big-reunion|title=Atomic Kitten, 5ive and B*Witched to reform for ITV2's The Big Reunion|last=Lazarus|first=Susanna|date=18 October 2012|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=8 October 2015}}</ref> Due to the success of ''The Big Reunion'', the band embarked on an [[The Big Reunion (concerts)|arena tour around the UK and Ireland]] in May 2013<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a457835/5ive-atomic-kitten-bwitched-liberty-x-911-for-big-reunion-arena-tour.html|title=5ive, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, Liberty X, 911 for Big Reunion arena tour|last=Nissam|first=Mayer|date=11 February 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=8 October 2015}}</ref> and [[Lindsay Armaou]] said that they may record new material.<ref name="new material">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a478745/bwitched-tease-music-comeback-its-possible.html|title=B*Witched tease music comeback: 'It's possible'|last=Copsey|first=Robert|date=3 May 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> In December 2013 B*Witched announced the EP on [[PledgeMusic]].<ref name=ew/>

In July 2014 Armaou said of the upcoming EP "It’s the current, up-to-date version of B*Witched. We’ve kept the pop element, the Irish element, there’s a ballad on there as well that is quite emotional. We’ve really poured our hearts and souls into this EP and it reflects who we are and where we are today."<ref name=lindsay/> They released the single "Love & Money" in July 2013<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.josepvinaixa.com/blog/bwitched-love-and-money-single-premiere/|title=B*Witched "Love and Money" (Single Premiere)|date=4 May 2013|work=Ultimate Music|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=8 October 2015}}</ref> and "The Stars Are Ours" on 21 September 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/music/news/a591326/bwitched-confirm-new-single-listen-to-the-stars-are-ours.html |title=B*Witched confirm new single: Listen to 'The Stars Are Ours' |last=Corner |first=Lewis |date=19 August 2014 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref> The EP was released on 28 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/08/20/celebrity-big-brother-2014-contestant-edele-lynchs-girlband-bwitched-are-back-again-with-new-music-4839472/ |title=Celebrity Big Brother 2014 contestant Edele Lynch’s girlband B*Witched are back (again) with new music |last=Campbell |first=Tina |date=20 August 2014 |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref> It was funded by fans and released directly by B*Witched, rather than through a record company.

In September 2014 [[Keavy Lynch]] said of the EP "We took out time to write the EP and try different styles to find the right avenue for B*Witched as we are now. It’s still pop music and still influenced by our Irish roots but it has matured as we have", adding her ambition for the album was "to give something current to our fans who have fantastically supported our journey since The Big Reunion as a way of saying thank you. And it felt like the right thing to so for us as a band too.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sosogay.co.uk/2014/much-open-understanding-keavy-lynch-talks-gay/ |title=We are much more open and understanding’: Keavy Lynch talks to So So Gay |last=Williams-Chalmers |first=Jeremy |date=26 September 2014 |work=So So Gay |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref>

==Reception==
Marc Snetiker from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a favourable review, calling the EP "glorious", adding "It’s certainly rocking more of a modern vibe than the group’s old stuff, as if all four members turned into little [[Kelly Clarkson]]s in the interim."<ref name=ew>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/08/19/bwitched-new-album |title=Listen to the B*Witched comeback album you didn't know existed |last=Snetiker |first=Marc |date=17 September 2014 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref> Commenting on the track "Champagne or Guinness" Arielle Dachille from ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' said "I must admit, it's no '[[Rollercoaster (B*Witched song)|Rollercoaster]],' but it will make you smile."<ref name=bustle>{{cite web |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/32822-what-has-bwitched-been-up-to-believe-it-or-not-theyre-still-making-music |title=What Has B*Witched Been Up to?

The title track in particular sounds like vintage B*Witched – which is to say you can link arms and skip in a circle to it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxtv.com.au/news/90s.aspx |title='90S News: Bachelor Girl, S Club 7, B*Witched, Alanis and More |last=Jolly |first=Nathan |work=[[MAX (Australian TV channel)|MAX]] |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref>

Brendon Veevers form ''[[Renowned for Sound]]'' gave the EP five out of five stars, concluding that it was "a fantastic comeback collection from the Irish sweethearts that will definitely thrill fans who have remained patient for the long overdue return of the group and their modernised style will appeal to a brand new audience as the quartet prepares to take over the pop world once again. Champagne or Guinness is definitely one of the finest releases to come out of pop music in 2014."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://renownedforsound.com/index.php/ep-review-bwitched-champagne-or-guinness/ |title=EP Review: B*witched – Champagne or Guinness |last=Veevers |first=Brendon |date=17 September 2014 |work=Renowned for Sound |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref> Emilie Devillet from ''Music-news.com'' gave the EP three of five stars, saying it was "definitely more mature and shows that the girls have evolved and can meet today’s pop music’s standards. It is still fun, light, catchy but in a grown-up way. If you were a fan of theirs 15 years ago, you should feel like they have never left your side. If you are a newbie, just get up and start Irish dancing!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music-news.com/review/UK/10526/Read |title=B*Witched: Champagne or Guinness |last=Devillet |first=Emilie |date=16 September 2014 |work=Music-news.com |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref>
