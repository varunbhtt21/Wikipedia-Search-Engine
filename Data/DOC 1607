Fails [[WP:NCORP]]. Of the three references, one is about the founder's criminal charges with only a passing reference to the company, one is a clear press release, and the third is a dead link.

*'''Keep'''. I think you've undersold the first source in the article. It's not about the criminal charges with a passing reference to the company, it's about the company with a passing reference to the criminal charges. I agree that the second (and actually, if you archive.org it, the third) is a press release. Some other sources that aren't about the criminal charges: [http://adage.com/article/digital/radiumone-taps-ad-exec-eric-bader-cmo/242830/ AdAge], [http://www.cmo.com.au/article/540068/radiumone_brings_programmatic_advertising_tech_platform_australia/ CMO], [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-10/radiumone-said-to-be-preparing-ipo-to-expand-overseas.html Bloomberg], [http://www.bandt.com.au/news/digital/radiumone-enters-the-australian-programmatic-scene B&T], [http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/11/30/radiumone-integrates-with-facebook-exchanges-eyes-ipo/ The Next Web].

*'''Keep''' The article has now been comprehensively edited by {{u|Tokyogirl79}} and as a result is significantly improved. You may wish to withdraw this Afd as it looks as if notability has been established.

*'''Keep'''. I've removed the mentions of the charges entirely and found a lot of sources. What helps it is that it's listed in a few books as being one of the earliest/first examples of its type. The TechCrunch links are pretty suspect, although I did keep one of them, but they're sort of notorious for just re-writing press releases for some of their articles.
