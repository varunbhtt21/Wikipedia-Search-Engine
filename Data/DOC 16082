[[WP:NEO]].  That a word has been made up by and used by some junior doctors does not make that word a notable topic for an encyclopedia.  For info: There currently isn't a Wiktionary article about this word. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 20:21, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''.  Maybe it could be redirected to [[Health care in the United Kingdom]]?  Or is that a bad idea? [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 20:52, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::[[Devolution in the United Kingdom]] might be a better redirect target. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 21:08, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' No useful sources. A bunch of junior doctors having some fun. Ignore them. [[User:Dingo1729|Dingo1729]] ([[User talk:Dingo1729|talk]]) 02:17, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
