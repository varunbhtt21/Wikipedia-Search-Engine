'''Ammeris''' was a governor of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]] attributed to the so-called "[[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Proto-Saite Dynasty]]" of [[ancient Egypt]].<ref name=T4/>

==Biography==
His name is only attested on [[Eusebius]]' epithome of [[Manetho]]'s ''Aegyptiaca''. Eusebius gave him 12 or 18 years depending on the versions, and calls him Ammeris (or Ameres) "the [[Nubia]]n", placing him as the first king of the [[26th Dynasty]].<ref name=K>Kitchen, op. cit., § 116-8</ref>

A reconstructed account of events is as follows: when, around 720 – 716&nbsp;BCE (or 715 – 712&nbsp;BCE, since dates are disputed) [[Shebitqo]] of the [[25th Dynasty]] defeated [[Bakenranef]] of the [[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|24th Dynasty]], the former chose a faithful commander and placed him to the government of Sais. The original name of this ruler is lost, but it was evidently [[hellenization|hellenized]] to Ammeris or Ameres, with the nickname "the Nubian" on account  of his place of origin. He probably ruled the city until c. 695&nbsp;BCE, when he was succeeded by Stephinates ([[Tefnakht II]]).<ref name=K/>
