* ... that '''[[John C. Bowers]]''' ''(pictured)'' was a founder of the first African-American [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Grand United Order of Odd Fellows]] in Pennsylvania?
:* ''Reviewed'': created by new Wikipedia editor (who is not required to do DYK QPQ); nominator has reviewed [[Carling Campus]]
:* ''Comment'': created for the Colored Conventions Edit-a-thon at the University of Delaware
<small>Created by [[User:Miro2be|Miro2be]] ([[User talk:Miro2be|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Mary Mark Ockerbloom|Mary Mark Ockerbloom]] ([[User talk:Mary Mark Ockerbloom|talk]]) at 20:42, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] I've gone ahead and linked "Grand United Order of Odd Fellows", as it certainly isn't something that is common knowledge. Otherwise, long enough, new enough, no paraphrasing, etc. Good to go!

::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] There are quite a few paragraphs without any cites. Also, Ancestry.com and wordpress.com are not [[WP:RS|reliable refs]]; [[WP:N|notability]] has not been proved. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 20:44, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*I went ahead and looked up refs on Google, expanding the article by 50% with [[WP:RS|reliable refs]]. I removed one term paper and strongly suggest removing the other, replacing it with a reliable ref. There are still some "citation needed" tags on the page. If this article passes DYK, I'd like to be listed as one of the page creators.
:::*The hook is a bit misleading; from what I read, he was a founding member, not '''the''' founder of the Odd Fellows. But perhaps you can find a source in an old book or newspaper.
:::*I'd like to note that besides the bare-bones biography of John C. Bowers, the article says nothing about the fact that he was a charismatic and outspoken figure in [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] society who wrote speeches and actively campaigned on behalf of Negros' civil rights. A full biography can probably be found in footnote 78 in ''The Elite of Our People'', but the page in question is not available online &ndash; perhaps you have access to that book or others?

::::* Thanks so much for all the great work you've done improving this! Truly an excellent example of Wikipedia in action. I was able to find a copy of Joseph Willson's book under its original title: "Sketches of the higher classes of colored society in Philadelphia. By a southerner." It lacks the footnotes, but mention a John Bowers as president of the First Convention and as one of those starting the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons AND the Gilbert Lyceum for scientific and literary pursuits. However, some of the text I'm seeing may relate to the father, not the son, so I need to make sure I've dealing with the right John Bowers. http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008585241  I will see if I can get the newer edited-version-with-notes to add more info from that.

:Been bold and suggested a pic that is derived from the pic in the article. Joy to see DYK nomination process working well. (Full review required? :-) ) [[User:Victuallers|Victuallers]] ([[User talk:Victuallers|talk]]) 08:53, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::The picture is great, thanks! The article is still undergoing expansion, so I'm waiting to complete the review. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 20:11, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Thank you for all your hard work on this, Mary! I'm adding you to the page creation credits, too. Article is new enough, long enough, well-referenced, no close paraphrasing seen. Hook ref verified and cited inline. No QPQ necessary. Image is pd. Good to go.
