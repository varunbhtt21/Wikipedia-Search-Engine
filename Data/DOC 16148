'''John Woody Papworth''' (4 March 1820 – 6 July 1870) was an English architect, designer and antiquary. He is chiefly remembered for "Papworth's ''[[Ordinary of arms|Ordinary]]''" (1874), a reference guide to British and Irish [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] arranged systematically according to their design. [[George Drewry Squibb|G. D. Squibb]] commented in 1961 that "his memory rests more securely upon his ''Ordinary of British Armorials'' than upon any building for which he was responsible, though it is but fair to add that his professional achievements were not lightly regarded by his contemporaries".<ref>{{cite book |first=G.D. |last=Squibb |authorlink=George Drewry Squibb |chapter=Papworth's Ordinary |title=Papworth's Ordinary of British Armorials |publisher=Tabard Publications |place=London |year=1961 }}</ref>

==Life==
Papworth was born in London on 4 March 1820,<ref>http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=4767522&id=I17752</ref> the elder son of the architect [[John Buonarotti Papworth]]: his younger brother, [[Wyatt Angelicus van Sandau Papworth]], also became a well known architect. Trained in his father's office, he remained there till 1846, when his father retired. In 1837 he became, on its formation, secretary to the council of the [[Royal College of Art|Government School of Design]] at [[Somerset House]], and assisted his father, the director, in its organisation. In 1838 he was awarded the silver Isis medal, in 1840 the gold Isis medal, and in 1845 the Stock medallion at the [[Society of Arts]], in 1842 the Soane medallion, in 1843 the medal of merit, and in 1847 the silver medal of the Institute of British Architects.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Papworth, John Woody|volume=43}}</ref>

In 1841 Papworth was elected an associate, and in 1846 a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|Institute of British Architects]].

Papworth never married. He died, aged 50, on 6 July 1870, from a [[gangrene]] which had developed in an injured foot: his death appears to have been hastened by his determination to continue work on his ''Ordinary''.<ref name="Collins 1942, p. 6">Collins 1942, p. 6.</ref> He was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]].<ref name="DNB"/>

==Architecture and design==

It comprises infant, ragged and Sunday schools, a reading room, a library, baths, washhouses, and cheap dormitories."<ref>{{cite book|title=The New American Cyclopædia |editor1-first=G. |editor1-last=Ripley |editor2-first=C.A. |editor2-last=Dana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GMIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA630|year=1860|pages=630–1}}</ref>]]

Although Papworth published widely on architectural matters, and exhibited many architectural designs at the [[Royal Academy]], few of his works were executed. One project that did come to completion was his design for the Albert Institution, opened in 1869 in Gravel Lane, [[Southwark]].<ref name="DNB"/> Papworth also designed the monument to the radical political reformer [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]] in [[Bunhill Fields]] burial ground.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1396521 |desc=Monument to Thomas Hardy, East Enclosure |accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>

He produced designs for glass, pottery, [[terracotta]], paperhangings, and other art manufactures; and was responsible for the carpet presented by 150 ladies to [[Queen Victoria]], which was exhibited at the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] of 1851.

==Papworth's ''Ordinary''==
[[File:Papworth Ordinary 3.jpg|thumb|right|Extract from Papworth's ''Ordinary'' (1874)]]
Papworth's major publication was his ''Ordinary'', or in full ''An Alphabetical Dictionary of Coats of Arms belonging to Families in Great Britain and Ireland, forming an extensive Ordinary of British Armorials upon an entirely new plan''. [[Ordinary of arms|Ordinaries of arms]] ([[Roll of arms|rolls of coats of arms]] arranged by design) had existed since the Middle Ages, but most had been relatively limited in scope. Papworth devised a scheme for a much more comprehensive ordinary, based on his own systematic arrangement of arms by [[blazon]]. He began work in 1847, making extensive use of [[Bernard Burke|Burke]]'s ''General Armory'', copying its entries onto slips of paper and rearranging them.<ref>Collins 1942, pp. 4–5.</ref> (The ''General Armory'' was a collection of arms arranged alphabetically by surname: first published in 1842, the third edition with supplement had appeared in 1847.) Papworth published a prospectus in 1857, and began to issue his work in [[Serial (literature)|instalment]]s: nine parts had appeared by 1863, and fourteen by the time of his death in 1870. By this point the work had proceeded as far as p.&nbsp;696: the remaining 429 pages were edited and brought to completion from his materials by Alfred William Morant (1828–1881). The ''Ordinary'' was seen through the press by Wyatt Papworth, and published as a complete volume in 1874: it contained about 50,000 entries.<ref>Collins 1942, pp. 6–7.</ref> It rapidly established itself as a standard work of heraldic reference, and was reprinted in 1961, 1977 and 1985.

The greatest strength of Papworth's ''Ordinary'' was the rigorousness of its system of classification by blazon, which (with minor modifications) has remained the basis for all ordinaries published since.<ref>Collins 1942, pp. 8–10.</ref> Its weakness was its dependence for its contents on Burke's ''General Armory'' and other [[secondary source]]s, which meant that it inherited many of their errors and omissions. One of the book's oddities is that (partly because of the decision to classify all animal [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] under the primary heading "Beast", and all birds under "Bird") the alphabetical distribution of entries is highly unbalanced: the headings A–F account for roughly 80% of the book, a point on which Papworth had to reassure anxious subscribers while the work was still in progress.<ref name="Collins 1942, p. 6"/>

In 1926 [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]] George Babington Croft Lyons left a substantial bequest to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] to prepare a new edition. After many delays, and a decision to restrict the work's scope to England and to the period before 1530, the first volume of what was now entitled the ''Dictionary of British Arms'' appeared in 1992.<ref>{{cite book |first=D.

==Other publications==
Papworth also published ''The Ladies' Carpet, designed by J. W. P., presented to, and exhibited by, Her Majesty in the Great Exhibition, 1851'' (1852); and he was a frequent contributor to ''[[Building (magazine)|The Builder]]'', and to the ''Proceedings'' and ''Transactions'' of the Institute of British Architects. He contributed articles to the works of the Architectural Publication Society, founded in 1848, on subjects including [[Balthazar Gerbier]], [[Frederic Louis Norden]], [[Mathes Roriczer]] and [[Aqueduct (water supply)|Aqueduct]]s. He also assisted in the first years of the production of the ''Dictionary of Architecture'', which his brother Wyatt edited from 1852 to 1892.<ref name="DNB"/>

With Wyatt, and with plates engraved by the authors, Papworth published ''Specimens of Decoration in the Italian Style selected from the Designs of Raffaello in the Vatican'' (1844), and ''Museums, Libraries, and Picture Galleries, Public and Private, their Establishment, Formation, Arrangement, and Architectural Construction, to which is appended the Public Libraries Act, 1850, and Remarks on its adoption by Mechanics and other Scientific Institutions, with Illustrations'' (1853).<ref name="DNB"/>
