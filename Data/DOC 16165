== History ==
Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust was founded in 1998 by Jeff White, who was previously involved in the leadership of another anti-abortion group, [[Operation Rescue (Kansas)|Operation Rescue]]. It was co-founded by Cheryl Conrad, who reports that she became active in pro-life ministry in the 1980s, after she "faced the truth" of her own abortion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Team|url=http://www.survivors.la/our-team/|work=Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref> The group considers anyone born after January 22, 1973, the date ''[[Roe vs Wade]]'' legalized abortion in the United States, as survivors of the "American abortion holocaust". The group name is sometimes shortened to "Survivors".<ref>{{cite news|last=Wyler|first=Grace|title=The New Face of the Anti-Abortion Movement|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-face-of-the-anti-abortion-movement|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Vice|date=26 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Crosby|first=Rachel|title=Anti-abortion group backs methods with First Amendment|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_91f41466-6d8b-11e1-bae4-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=story|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent Florida Alligator|date=14 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Our Team|url=http://www.survivors.la/our-team/|work=Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Why you should never engage with an abortion protester|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/14/why_you_should_never_engage_with_an_abortion_protester/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Salon|date=14 March 2014}}</ref>

== Activities ==
Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust is primarily a youth organization, which regularly hosts training sessions aimed at high school and college aged young men and women. After training, the young activists often target college or university campuses as demonstration locations, in hopes of dissuading the college aged individuals, whom they view as a demographic "at risk for abortion", from having abortions. Demonstrations involve displaying large signs with pictures of aborted fetuses, attempting to engage passers by in conversation about abortion, and the distribution of anti-abortion literature. Because of the use of young activists, the group has been called "the new face of the anti-abortion movement".<ref>{{cite news|last=Wyler|first=Grace|title=The New Face of the Anti-Abortion Movement|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-face-of-the-anti-abortion-movement|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Vice|date=26 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Crosby|first=Rachel|title=Anti-abortion group backs methods with First Amendment|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_91f41466-6d8b-11e1-bae4-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=story|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent Florida Alligator|date=14 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Survivors ProLife Training Camps|url=http://www.survivors.la/survivors-prolife-training-camps/|work=Suvivors of the Abortion Holocaust|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sandford|first=Jason|title=Abortion protesters found guilty of trespassing|url=http://mountainx.com/news/community-news/abortion_protesters_found_guilty_of_trespassing/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Mountain Xpress|date=17 October 2008}}</ref>

== Controversy regarding name ==
Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust has received criticism regarding the use of the word "holocaust" in their name.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zucc|first=Erica|title=Local Jewish leaders speak out about abortion protestors|url=http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s3125460.shtml|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=KOB Eyewitness News|date=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Why you should never engage with an abortion protester|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/14/why_you_should_never_engage_with_an_abortion_protester/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Salon|date=14 March 2014}}</ref>  Although ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' defines "holocaust" as "a mass slaughter of people: a genocide",<ref>{{cite web|title=holocaust|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/holocaust|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}</ref> since the 1940s "[[the Holocaust]]" usually refers to the mass slaughter of [[Jews]] by [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Zucc|first=Erica|title=Local Jewish leaders speak out about abortion protestors|url=http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s3125460.shtml|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=KOB Eyewitness News|date=9 August 2013}}</ref> Fueling the controversy over their name, in 2013, Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust held an anti-abortion demonstration at the [[New Mexico Holocaust & Intolerance Museum]], and they demanded the museum include exhibits on abortion, offending local Jewish leaders. Rabbi Harry Ronsenfeld said, "It is offensive when someone co-opts what's yours". In defense of their use of the term, the Survivors said the number of abortions that take place in the United States qualifies it as a genocide.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zucc|first=Erica|title=Local Jewish leaders speak out about abortion protestors|url=http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s3125460.shtml|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=KOB Eyewitness News|date=9 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wyler|first=Grace|title=The New Face of the Anti-Abortion Movement|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-face-of-the-anti-abortion-movement|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Vice|date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

== Controversy over graphic imagery ==
Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust has received criticism regarding their use of graphic abortion imagery.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Why you should never engage with an abortion protester|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/14/why_you_should_never_engage_with_an_abortion_protester/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Salon|date=14 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mayers|first=Delyla|title=Selfishly Abusing Our of Freedom of Speech|url=http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/selfishly-abusing-our-of-freedom-of-speech/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Nexus|date=6 March 2014}}</ref>   The pictures of blood covered fetuses have been described as "overwhelmingly bloody and gory" and "grotesque".<ref>{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=The liberal professor who stepped right into an anti-abortion trap|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-the-liberal-professor-antiabortion-trap-20140331,0,5627786.story#ixzz30JJagBGn|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Crosby|first=Rachel|title=Anti-abortion group backs methods with First Amendment|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_91f41466-6d8b-11e1-bae4-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=story|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent Florida Alligator|date=14 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Why you should never engage with an abortion protester|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/14/why_you_should_never_engage_with_an_abortion_protester/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Salon|date=14 March 2014}}</ref> In the anti-abortion movement, displaying images of aborted fetuses is referred to as a "truth display", and the use of such imagery is considered controversial, even among those who oppose abortion. Concerns regarding exposing young children to these images have been raised, and the use of this imagery has been called insensitive.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mayers|first=Delyla|title=Selfishly Abusing Our of Freedom of Speech|url=http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/selfishly-abusing-our-of-freedom-of-speech/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Nexus|date=6 March 2014}}</ref> However, anti-abortion advocates defend the use of these pictures by comparing graphic abortion imagery, to other accepted graphic imagery. A comparison has been drawn between pictures of aborted fetuses and the "[[Napalm Girl]]" photograph, which graphically depicted a civilian attack during the [[Vietnam War]]. While the images used by the Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust have been described as  "pushing the boundaries of decency", a group member defended the use of such imagery by saying, "yes, the pictures show the violence after it happened, but what is so much worse than the pictures is the actual violence, and if we have to show what is happening to stop it, then we have to go there and show it."<ref>{{cite news|title=California sisters fighting back after professor steals graphic pro-life sign|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/14/california-sisters-fighting-back-after-professor-steals-graphic-pro-life-sign/|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=14 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=The liberal professor who stepped right into an anti-abortion trap|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-the-liberal-professor-antiabortion-trap-20140331,0,5627786.story#ixzz30JJagBGn|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=31 March 2014}}</ref>

== Legal battles ==

===Colorado School of Mines===
In 2005, two Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust members sued the [[Colorado School of Mines]], claiming a violation of their [[First Amendment]], freedom of speech rights, after they were arrested while protesting on a campus sidewalk. A group member said he "believes the protest was broken up because someone complained about the content of the posters, which featured photos of fetuses and abortion". The group member stated, "clearly we have the right to be on the sidewalk and express ourselves".  In 2006, the lawsuit was settled in favor of the Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust group members for $25,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abortion protesters sue School of Mines|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_2848015|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=9 July 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Anti-abortion activists sue Colo. college over demonstration policies|url=http://www.splc.org/news/newsflash.asp?id=1052|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Student Press Law Center|date=19 July 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Anti-abortion protestors close to settlement with Colorado school|url=http://www.splc.org/news/newsflash.asp?id=1289|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Student Press Law Center|date=22 June 2006}}</ref>

===Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College===
In 2007, an anti-abortion protest at [[Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College]], in which approximately 15 group members displayed signs depicting images of aborted fetuses was deemed "unruly" and resulted in trespass arrests when the group members refused to leave campus when told to do so by police.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sandford|first=Jason|title=Abortion protesters found guilty of trespassing|url=http://mountainx.com/news/community-news/abortion_protesters_found_guilty_of_trespassing/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Mountain Xpress|date=17 October 2008}}</ref>  Video of the incident shows group members saying the college is federally funded, and is therefore public property, so they have the right to protest there. In response, the arresting officer informed the group members that AB-Tech's vice president of student services, Dennis King, had the authority to ask them to leave. Dennis King said he asked the protesters to leave after three faculty members  "approached me in a highly agitated fashion and demanded that the protesters be removed." In 2008, two group members involved in the incident were found guilty of trespassing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sandford|first=Jason|title=Abortion protesters found guilty of trespassing|url=http://mountainx.com/news/community-news/abortion_protesters_found_guilty_of_trespassing/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Mountain Xpress|date=17 October 2008}}</ref>

===University of California Santa Barbara===
In March 2014, two Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust members pressed charges against a [[University of California Santa Barbara]] professor, after the professor stole their sign and pushed and scratched a group member who tried to retrieve the sign. The sign depicted an image of an aborted fetus. Police later found the sign destroyed. The theft occurred in an area of the UCSB campus designated as the "free speech zone".<ref>{{cite news|title=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/03/26/ucsb-professor-faces-charges-after-scuffle-with-anti-abortion-protestors/|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/03/26/ucsb-professor-faces-charges-after-scuffle-with-anti-abortion-protestors/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=CBS Los Angeles|date=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hayden|first=Tyler|title=UCSB Professor Accused of Assaulting Anti-Abortion Activist|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/mar/11/ucsb-professor-accused-assaulting-pro-life-activis/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Santa Barbara Independent|date=11 March 2014}}</ref>  The incident has prompted debate about free speech protections and limits, and has raised concerns regarding suppression of free speech on college campuses.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=The liberal professor who stepped right into an anti-abortion trap|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-the-liberal-professor-antiabortion-trap-20140331,0,5627786.story#ixzz30JJagBGn|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wakeman|first=Jessica|title=Professor Mireille Miller-Young Charged With Theft, Battery, Vandalism After Stealing Anti-Abortion Protestors Sign|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2014-03-24/professor-mireille-miller-young-charged-with-theft-battery-vandalism-after-stealing-anti-abortion-protestors-sign/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Frisky|date=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Calif. school 'apologizes' for feminism prof's alleged attack on teenage pro-lifer|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/27/calif-school-apologizes-for-feminism-profs-alleged-attack-on-teenage-pro-lifer/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=27 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|title=UC Santa Barbara Vice Chancellor issues statement supporting free speech|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/03/26/uc-santa-barbara-vice-chancellor-issues-statement-supporting-free-speech/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mayers|first=Delyla|title=Selfishly Abusing Our of Freedom of Speech|url=http://dailynexus.com/2014-03-06/selfishly-abusing-our-of-freedom-of-speech/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Nexus|date=6 March 2014}}</ref> The professor, later identified as Mireille Miller-Young, a [[feminist studies]] professor, was quoted in her police report saying she believed she had a "moral right" to take the sign, and referred to the demonstration as "hate speech".<ref>{{cite news|last=Hayden|first=Tyler|title=UCSB Professor Charged with Theft and Battery|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/mar/21/ucsb-professor-charged-theft-and-battery-after-con/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Santa Barbara Independent|date=21 March 2014}}</ref>  In March 2014, the district attorney charged Miller-Young with theft, battery and vandalism.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hayden|first=Tyler|title=UCSB Professor Charged with Theft and Battery|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/mar/21/ucsb-professor-charged-theft-and-battery-after-con/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Santa Barbara Independent|date=21 March 2014}}</ref>  Miller-Young originally entered a plea "not guilty" but In July 2014, she pleaded "no contest" to three misdemeanor charges.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Lyz|title=UCSB Professor Pleads Not Guilty to Theft and Battery|url=http://independent.com/news/2014/apr/04/ucsb-professor-pleads-not-guilty-theft-and-battery/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Santa Barbara Independent|date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Joshua|title=California professor pleads no contest to assault on pro-life students|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/25/university-california-santa-barbara-professor-pleads-no-contest-to-assault-on/|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=Fox News|date=25 July 2014}}</ref> Miller-Young was sentenced to three years of probation, 100 hours of community service, 10 hours of anger-management courses and $493 in restitution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Lara|title=UCSB Professor Sentenced to Probation, Anger Management in Abortion Confrontation|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/article/ucsb_professor_sentenced_to_probation_anger_management|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Noozhawk|date=15 August 2014}}</ref> In November 2014, the Life Legal Defense Foundation filed a civil lawsuit on behalf of the Survivors against Miller-Young and University of California Santa Barbara.

===Newport Beach "chalk and awe"===
In 2013 and 2014, group members from Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust protested and wrote chalk messages on the street and sidewalk of the [[Newport Beach, California]] neighborhood of Dr. Richard Agnew, a Hoag Hospital-affiliated [[obstetrician]]
The Survivors targeted Dr. Agnew's neighborhood because he signed a letter objecting to the hospital's decision to ban elective abortions.  Messages scrawled in Agnew's neighborhood in chalk included: "abortion is murder", "Stop Killing American Children," and "your neighbor is a monster".  In response to the group's 2013 protests, the local city council passed an ordinance that bars protesters from picketing within 300 feet of a home.  In 2014, The Survivors returned to Agnew's Newport Beach neighborhood to "test the ordinance" and were careful to remain within legal limits. The 2014 protests angered neighbors. One neighbor told a reporter from the ''[[Daily Pilot]]'',  "These people are threatening".  A scuffle reportedly broke out between protesters and residents, with both sides making [[citizen's arrests]], but the cases were dismissed due to lack of evidence. Neighbors complained the Survivor's sidewalk chalking constituted vandalism, but law enforcement officials said they would not be filing charges.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dobruck|first1=Jeremiah|title=Abortion protests return to Dover Shores|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/news/tn-dpt-me-0703-doctor-protestors-20140702,0,67876.story|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=Daily Pilot|date=2 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Shine|first1=Nicole|title=Anti-abortion protesters in Newport use 'chalk and awe' campaign|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/newport-628342-white-beach.html|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=Orange County Register|date=8 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dobruck|first1=Jeremiah|title=Anti-abortion activists won't face charges over chalk writing near Newport doctor's home|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/news/tn-dpt-me-0807-dover-protest-no-charges-20140806,0,7832138.story|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=Daily Pilot|date=6 August 2014}}</ref>
