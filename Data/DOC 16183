'''Club Pop House''' (called '''The Pop House''') was a private teenage social and dance club located near downtown [[Beloit, Wisconsin]] at the intersection of Portland Avenue and 5th Street. The Pop House was a popular gathering spot for local high school and college students from 1946 until it closed in 1973.  It was owned and operated by George Stankewitz, son of Lithuanian immigrants and a decorated World War II veteran.<ref>Behling, William D.

For dancing, the Pop House scheduled record hops and live music on weekends.  It was host to many regional bands and a number of major musical acts including [[Conway Twitty]], [[Bobby Vinton]], [[Tommy Roe]], Jimmy Gilmer and [[The Fireballs]], [[Freddy Cannon]], [[Johnny Tillotson]], [[Paul and Paula]], [[The Kingsmen]], [[Bobby Goldsboro]], and [[Del Shannon]] among others.<ref>"Stankewitz, George", Interview with Bill Guelzow, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mBPYKmWFWg "Builders of Beloit - George Stankewitz (Excerpt)"], Produced by the Beloit Historical Society and the Beloit Foundation for Beloit Access Television, 1984.</ref>  A jukebox stocked with the latest hit records also was available.<ref>Behling, William D.

The Pop House offered a lunch counter with hamburgers, French fries, pizza and soft drinks.  It was noted for its specialty sandwiches with such names as the Snead, 12:01, and Smiley Special.<ref>Jensen-De Hart, Debra.

Club Pop House was governed by an adult board of directors with established by-laws and rules of conduct. Prospective members had to be white, in the tenth grade or above and undergo a review process that included an interview with owner George Stankewitz before receiving a membership card and a key. The first African-American to receive a membership card and key was LaMont Weaver after winning the state championship with a half court shot with only seconds left for Beloit Memorial. In its heyday there were more than 600 active high school age members in a given year, a waiting list of about 100 more, and numerous "alumni." The "club" status of the Pop House was challenged in August 1965 when charges of racial bias resulted in a discrimination suit after five African-American citizens were denied service at the lunch counter.<ref>"Pleads innocent to discrimination", ''Janesville Daily Gazette'', Janesville, WI, August 31, 1965</ref>  The case went to trial in November of that year and a jury cleared Mr. Stankewitz of bias charges, finding that the Pop House operated as a private club and could select its own membership.<ref>"Found innocent in rights case", ''Janesville Daily Gazette'', Janesville, WI, November 26, 1965.</ref>

In 1972 a new eighteen-year-old drinking age law was enacted in Wisconsin. Owner Stankewitz began serving alcohol at the Pop House in November of that year, thus excluding the under-eighteen crowd.<ref>Greiling, David. "Beloit's high school hangout--- Pop House going 'adult'", ''Rockford Morning Star'', Rockford, IL, November 25, 1972.</ref>  With a subsequent decline in business, Stankewitz announced his retirement and closed the Club Pop House in April 1973 after 27 years of continuous operation.<ref>Greiling, Dave.
