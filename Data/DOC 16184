== History ==
LAByrinth Theater Company was founded in 1992 by 13 actors looking for "a home where the group, for three hours each week, could engage in a variety of theatrical exercises designed to push each others’ limits and bind together into a tightly knit, uninhibited and impassioned ensemble – one in which each member is given the opportunity and support not only to act, but to write, direct, produce, sweep, paint, hang lights, etcetera."<ref>[http://www.labtheater.org/about/history.html LAByrinth Theater Company – About Labyrinth<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206133604/http://www.labtheater.org/about/history.html |date=February 6, 2007 }}</ref> This expansion of artists into the exploration of new aspects of theater remains one of the primary goals of Labyrinth, and the company is fostering a new generation of writers and directors who come from acting backgrounds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cram|first=Cusi|title=Into the LAByrinth: The Life of an Acting Writer|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=June 2008|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2008/06/theater/into-the-labyrinth-the-life-of-an-acting-writer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/21/theater/upscale-march-of-theater-row-a-centerpiece-of-redevelopment.html|title=Labyrinth at Theatre Row NYTimes 2002 Upscale March|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>
