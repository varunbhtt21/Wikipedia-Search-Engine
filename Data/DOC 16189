The '''Biwa-bokuboku''' (jap. 琵琶牧々; meaning "Biwa goblin") is a [[Fiction|fictitious]] being from [[Japan]]ese [[folklore]]. It belongs to a group of [[yokai]] and is said to have an ambivalent character.

== Description ==
The Biwa-bokuboku is described as an [[anthropomorphic]] being with the head of a [[tradition]]al [[biwa]]. He is also said to wear precious [[kimono]]. The Biwa-bokuboku comes to life at night and sits calmly in a [[tatami]] room, singing and plinking while lamenting the neglect of his former owner. Other stories report of Biwa-bokuboku dancing through inhabited houses while making lots of noise.<ref name=STM>Sekien Toriyama, Mamoru Takada, Atsunobu Inada u.a.: 画図百鬼夜行, Kokusho Kankōkai, Tōkyō 1992, {{ISBN|9784336033864}}, p. 295.</ref><ref name=KTS>Katsumi Tada: 幻想世界の住人たち. 4, 日本編.

== Background ==
The Biwa-bokuboku was modeled after the ''biwa'' (琵琶), a short-necked, wooden [[lute]]. Toryama Sekien reports in his work ''Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro'' (百器徒然袋), that the biwa was designed after [[China|Chinese]] instruments such as the ''bokuma'' and the ''genjō''.<ref name=STM/><ref name=KTS/><ref name=MTB/>

The Biwa-bokuboku belongs to a special group of yōkai: the ''[[Tsukumogami]]'' (jap. 付喪神; lit. "artifact ghosts"). This special group is believed to comprise nearly all kinds of man-made household artifacts, such as kitchenware, tools and every-day accessories, when 100 years have passed and the artifact was as good as if it had never been used.<ref>Michaela Haustein: ''Mythologien der Welt: Japan, Ainu, Korea.'' ePubli, Berlin 2011, {{ISBN|3844214070}}, S. 53.</ref> The Biwa-bokuboku will come to life when feeling ignored or useless. As some kind of revenge (and out of frustration), they wander through the rooms of inhabited houses at night and lament loudly over their neglect. Alternatively, they meet with other Tsukumogami and throw noisy parties or they leave home and stroll around in search of others with whom to commiserate.<ref name=STM/><ref name=KTS/><ref name=MTB/>
