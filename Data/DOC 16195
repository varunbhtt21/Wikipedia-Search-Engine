The '''Vettersfelde Treasure''' or '''Witaszkowo Treasure''' is a treasure trove, which was found by chance in what was then Vettersfelde in the [[Province of Brandenburg]] (modern [[Witaszkowo]], near [[Gubin, Poland|Gubin]], [[Poland]]) in 1882, and is now in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]]. The objects in the trove are connected to the animal-themed art of the [[Scythians]]. The origin of the trove remains mysterious.

Among the most significant items in the trove are:
* an [[electrum]] plaque (41 x 15&nbsp;cm, 608 g) in the shape of a fish,<ref>Petre Alexandrescu, « Zum goldenen Fisch von Witaszkowo, ehem. Vettersfelde », in ''L'aigle et le dauphin : études d'archéologie pontique'', Editura enciclopedică, 1999.</ref> which probably dates to the end of the 6th century BC. According to Furtwängler, it was originally an ornament (''sema'') on a shield. The body of the fish is covered by little animals in relief, including a [[Black panther|panther]] catching a [[boar]], and a [[lion]] catching a [[deer]], and the tail is made up of two rams' heads. It is believed to have been made by the artisans of an [[Ionians|Ionian]] colony on the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]], such as [[Olbia]] or [[Panticapaeum]], to cater to the tastes of a Scythian prince. 
* a golden plaque intended to cover the upper part of a sheath for an [[Acinaces]] (a type of dagger used by Scythians) and decorated with animals (fish, vultures, deer, boar). Length: 19&nbsp;cm. 6th century BC.
* a golden object made up of four disks, each decorated with animals around a central boss, and a smaller central disk. It might have been part of a breast plate or a harness. Height: 17&nbsp;cm. 6th century BC.
Other highlights include pendants of braided wire, a massive [[torc]]. Part of the find went to Berlin and was kept with a suit of [[Scythian]] armour, which dated from around 500 BC. Other, smaller objects from the trove were sold or melted down.

The discovery began a long scholarly debate. The presence of these objects so far into northern Europe was explained by a Scythian expedition into central Europe, with the trove forming the grave-offerings of a Scythian prince, who had made it to [[Brandenburg]]. One such expedition is attested at the end of the sixth century BC as a result of [[Darius I|Darius]]' Scythian expedition (513 BC). Newer research on the find location argues that it might have been deposited as a sacrifice after being taken as booty from a Scythian prince. The presence of Scythians in this area is otherwise only suggested by the discover of three-fluted arrowheads, but these were regularly used by other [[Eurasian nomads]].
