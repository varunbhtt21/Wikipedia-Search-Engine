'''Sullair''' is a major manufacturer of portable and stationary rotary screw air compressors designed for commercial and industrial use. Founded in 1965 in the town of [[Michigan City, Indiana]] U.S.A., Sullair has manufacturing facilities in Michigan City that distribute and service air compressor packages and systems worldwide. Sullair also has manufacturing facilities in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] and [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]] [[China]] that service the Asian and [[Australasia]]n markets. Sullair also has offices in Dandenong South, [[Australia]] near [[Melbourne]], and in Sunderland, United Kingdom that services markets in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Russia.

In April 2017, [[Hitachi]] acquired Sullair for 1,245 million USD.<ref>[http://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=ind&k=2017042501005 Hitachi to Acquire U.S. Industrial Machinery Maker Sullair]</ref>

==Sullair and Rotary Screw Technology==
'''[[Rotary screw compressor|The Rotary Screw Compressor]]'''<br />
Although the first commercial application of a fluid injected rotary screw compressor was accomplished by Swedish industrial manufacturer [[Atlas Copco]] in 1957, it was Sullair's founding president, Don Hoode, that introduced the technology to the U.S. domestic market in 1966. And by 1969, Sullair had developed an entire line of portable and stationary asymmetric rotary screw air compressors.<ref>[Royce N. Brown. "Compressors: Selection & Sizing"], p.p. 127-128. Elsevier Inc, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-7506-7545-4}}.</ref>  Hoode purchased the use of the technology from Swedish firm Svenska Rotor Maskiner, whose retired chief engineer, Alf Lysholm, invented the twin-screw compressor in 1934 while developing gas turbines. The Lysholm design is also used in vehicles to force air induction into engine cylinders, supercharging both gas and diesel powered engines to boost engine performance.<ref>Sandhyarani, Ningthoujam. [http://www.whipplesuperchargers.com/content.asp?PageID=80 "The History of Screw Compressors"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620155502/http://www.whipplesuperchargers.com/content.asp?PageID=80 |date=2014-06-20 }}, www.whipplesuperchargers.com, Retrieved on 1 May 2014.</ref> Today, rotary screw compressors are the most popular type of air compressor in operation worldwide. Sullair's leadership decision to stay exclusively with the rotary screw technology when others still relied on piston driven technology, proved to be a valuable decision for the company, and was significant in its growth within the industry.

==Sullair Products==
Today, Sullair has three primary product families -
*Portable Air Power - For markets where mobility of the compressor equipment is critical. Compressors are designed with on-board diesel engines as the power source, and most models made are towable or can be placed on work vehicles. These compressor packages are designed for ruggedness and reliability in order to withstand the physical burden of portability.
*Stationary Air Power - Compressor systems that are designed to be placed in a fixed position. Because compressed air is such a high demand ″utility″ among a large variety of markets, most stationary compressor installations are highly customized to fit each application. For this reason stationary air compressors and their associated aftertreatment products are part of a whole system design and are often configured into a facility's architecture.
*Original Equipment Manufactured (OEM) Components - Highly customized Sullair compressor units and portable air compressors are built to customer supplied requirements and specifications for inclusion in larger assemblies. OEM products serve the Drill, Process Gas, and Offshore Platform markets.

==Sullair History==
*1965: Donald C. Hoodes departed the Joy Manufacturing Company, a Pittsburgh-based manufacturer of mining and reciprocal compressor equipment, and founded a privately held company under the name of the Sullivan Machinery Company in Michigan City Indiana.<ref>[Roger A. Stafford. "Sullair Major Force in Compressor Marketplace"], Milwaukee Sentinel, 5 September 1977.</ref> Hoodes as President brings with him from Joy Manufacturing Roger Gustafson, Borje Vagenius, and C.J. Joseph as Vice Presidents. Hoodes acquires a license to market the rotary screw technology from Svenska Rotor Maskiner AB (SRC) of Sweden. 
*1966: The Sullivan Machinery Company ships its first 150 CFM portable air compressor in April 1966. The company was the first in the domestic market to completely rely on rotary screw technology.
*1968: The first stationary compressor rolls off the line. The Sullivan Machinery Company changes its business name to Sullair Corporation.
