I see no evidence that this person is notable. The majority of the "references" are links to allmusic, which in this case doesn't verify more than that the person was an engineer on a number of albums. Some engineers are notable, some are not--but being an engineer on a certain number of projects of a certain size (or however we'd go) does not yet make a person notable by our standards, and in this case the GNG is clearly not passed. In addition, this sad article is little more than a kind of resume, at best. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 21:23, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''. I don't see how this person is notable from the sources listed. They're mostly from Allmusic, and a google search mostly just showed his social media accounts. I agree that this is pretty much a resume. --[[User:Kbabej|Kbabej]] ([[User talk:Kbabej|talk]]) 18:00, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

[[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker| It is ridiculous that this page was deleted. This page was created as a reference for people interested to look up said producer's work. It may be no different than any other search engine, but there are many examples of producers that have very similar pages with similar levels of notoriety. Please restore page to original state as it is the public's right to have referenced information.
