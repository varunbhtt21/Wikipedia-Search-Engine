Each metabolite host properties like CAS name, IUPAC name, structure diagram, formula, and biofluid location. It fills the lack of the information in bovine field. This project is supported by Genome Alberta & Genome Canada, a not-for-profit organization that is leading Canada's national genomics strategy with $600 million in funding from the federal government.
