The '''Mancotal Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Tuma River]] near [[Asturias, Nicaragua|Asturias]] in [[Jinotega Department]], [[Nicaragua]]. It forms [[Lake Apanás]], the largest reservoir in the country. The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and it supports the 50 MW '''Centro América Plant'''. The dam was completed and its first generator commissioned in 1964. The second generator was commissioned a year later on 18 March 1965. To generate power, water from the southwestern end of the Lake Apanás flows along a {{Convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}} long channel before it enters a series of headrace pipes and a [[penstock]]. About {{Convert|3.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south west the penstock meets Centro América Plant where it turns two 25 MW [[Francis turbine]]s. After generating power the water is then discharged into the Viejo River.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.enel.gob.ni/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=20 | title=Hydro | publisher=Empresa Nicaragüense de Electricidad (ENEL) | accessdate=29 April 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref> To supplement levels in the Lake Apanás, the [[El Dorado Dam]] was completed in 1985 and forms Lake Asturias just downstream of the Mancotal Dam. Water from Lake Asturias can be pumped into Lake Apanás. In 1998 heavy rains from [[Hurricane Mitch]] severely damaged the Mancotal and El Dorado Dams, over-topping their [[spillway]]s and nearly destroying the dams. The [[Virgen Dam]] downstream on the Viejo River was destroyed but later rebuilt.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08pg2ukTWcEC&pg=PT373&lpg=PT373&dq=Apan%C3%A1s+dam+meters&source=bl&ots=jRxFp2Dn4s&sig=kRSsB9yOly8duca-A6wjFKKT868&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ABBgU66NFbjfsATR9oLQBw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Apan%C3%A1s%20dam%20meters&f=false | title=Moon Nicaragua | publisher=Avalon Travel | date=5 October 2010 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Wood, Randall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/dams/index.stm | title=Aquastat - Dams in Nicaragua | publisher=UNFAO | accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
