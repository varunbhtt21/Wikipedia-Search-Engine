'''''A.K.A.''''' (an acronym for ''Also Known As'')<ref name="Title Contenders" /> is the eighth [[studio album]] by American entertainer [[Jennifer Lopez]]. It was released on June 13, 2014, by [[Capitol Records]].<!-- The first known release date was in Germany on June 13. The first release is the only one that should be listed. --> Lopez started working on the album in February 2013, after the end of her first worldwide tour, the [[Dance Again World Tour]]. Originally scheduled to be released in November 2013, Lopez postponed the album release to 2014. Undecided between ''Same Girl'' and ''A.K.A.'' as the album's title, Lopez eventually chose the latter as the title.

Initially, ''A.K.A.'' was to be executively produced by [[RedOne]], with the producer claiming the album was going to mix many styles, having a blend of her previous musical background: [[urban pop]], [[dance-pop]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]. However, [[Cory Rooney]] and [[Benny Medina]], her longtime collaborators, later became the album's executive producers, along with herself, bringing a more [[pop music|pop]], [[electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound to the album.<ref name="idolator">{{cite web|last=Wass|first=Mike|title=Jennifer Lopez's 'A.K.A.': Track-By-Track Album Review|url=http://www.idolator.com/7520707/jennifer-lopez-aka-album-review|website=Idolator|accessdate=June 13, 2014|date=June 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=theobserver/> In early 2014, Lopez released two urban-infused tracks as the album's promotional singles: "[[Girls (Jennifer Lopez song)|Girls]]" and "[[Same Girl (Jennifer Lopez song)|Same Girl]]". Besides frequent contributor and personal friend [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], the album also features collaborations with [[French Montana]], [[T.I.]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Nas]], Jack Mizrahi and [[Tyga]].

Upon its release, ''A.K.A.'' received generally mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], who spoke unfavorably of the album's mixed styles, although some songs were singled out for praise. Commercially, ''A.K.A.'' made minor impact on the charts, peaking outside the top-forty in Ireland and the United Kingdom, whilst elsewhere it became her lowest-charting studio album. ''A.K.A.'' was preceded by the release of two singles, "[[I Luh Ya Papi]]" and "[[First Love (Jennifer Lopez song)|First Love]]", which both experienced underwhelming performance on the charts.

== Background ==
Following the release of Lopez's single "[[Dance Again]]" in April 2012, she stated that she was unsure whether or not it was the [[lead single]] of a [[greatest hits]] album, or a new studio album. That May, she released the track "[[Goin' In]]" which was featured on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Step Up Revolution]]''; she still was unsure. She said that she had to release a greatest hits album to fulfill her contractual agreement with [[Epic Records]], her former label: "I owe a greatest hits [album] to the record company...or I can go ahead and start a new album. I just haven't decided yet."<ref>{{cite web|last=Celani|first=Andrew|title=Jennifer Lopez Talks About Her New Single "Goin' In"|url=http://925maxima.cbslocal.com/2012/05/28/jennifer-lopez-interview-new-single-goin-in/|work=925maxima|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=November 19, 2012|date=May 28, 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, she released her first greatest hits album ''[[Dance Again... the Hits]]'' on July 24, 2012.<ref name="Digital Spy July">{{cite web|last=Corner|first=Lewis|title=Jennifer Lopez to release 'Dance Again: The Hits' next month?|url=http://www.digitalspy.com.au/music/news/a388349/jennifer-lopez-to-release-dance-again-the-hits-next-month.html|work=[[Digital Spy]].

Speaking of the album's sound and lyricism, Lopez stated, "It's gonna be a different sound, I think a lot has happened to me in the past year or two, I've changed a little bit, my ideas about love has changed...you grow", referring to her divorce from singer Marc Anthony, which inspired lyrics for the album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jennifer Lopez Talks Upcoming Album, Working With Mary J.

I've always sung about love. It was always love in a certain way: A fairytale type of way; I was hoping, praying, and wishing for that."<ref name="BB Listening" /> Describing her approach for this album, Lopez stated that "there was just a lot that I had to say", claiming: "My goal was to just be as honest as I could.

== Songs ==
The album starts with "A.K.A.", the [[RoccStar]]-produced [[hip-hop]] track features rapper [[T.I.]] and was considered a "bass heavy banger."<ref name=billboard/> Lyrically, "A.K.A." is a declaration of self-identity and a presumed ex's inability to realize what they had before it was too late. "It took too long to find out what you want right now/ I'm too gone to stay around/ switching up my style," she sings.<ref name=billboard/> The second track and second single "[[First Love (Jennifer Lopez song)|First Love]]" was produced by [[Max Martin]] and it's an upbeat, bass heavy track, in which Lopez sings: "I wish you were my first love, cuz if you were first, baby there would have been no second, third, or fourth love."<ref name=billboard/> Of the producer, she said: "Max Martin [is a] genius, man. He's a super producer, maker of great pop hits. I've always wanted to work with him but our paths [hadn't] crossed. I sought him out."<ref name="BB Listening"/> The mid-tempo "Never Satisfied" was first premiered at a concert in [[Dubai]] being considered a "guitar-driven" track.

"Don't let the tables turn/ don't let the bridges burn/ been down for you don't get it confused/ boy you could lose your turn," she sings.<ref name=billboard/> The song features Australian rapper [[Iggy Azalea]], which raps about "everything from [[Mary J.

Regarding the lackluster sales of ''A.K.A'',  Jason Lipshutz of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] commented on the fact that the album proved that Lopez was "trapped in a different era." He claimed that "the 33,000-copy sales debut of 'A.K.A.' represents a crossroads moment for a superstar who's about to turn 45. Lopez is right when she says that she doesn't have anything more to prove, but her sound needs to develop alongside the rest of her professional life." He did however note that the abundance of powerful ballads on the album, most notably "Let It Be Me", could be Lopez saving grace for her flailing recording career. "A song like 'Let It Be Me' on "A.K.A." proves that, if Lopez finds the right production partners, she can serve up slower material that can measure up to the best balladeers' work. Throughout her career, Lopez's greatest strengths have been dancing and churning out dance music. However, the ballads on 'A.K.A.' hint at a sweeping musical direction that Lopez has typically relegated to the back of her albums, as a supplement to her uptempo spectacles. Perhaps it's time to move it front and center."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lipshut|first1=Jason|title=Jennifer Lopez's 'A.K.A.'
