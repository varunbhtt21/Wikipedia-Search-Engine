The '''International Society for Extracellular Vesicles''' (ISEV) is an international [[scientific organization]] that focuses on the study of [[extracellular vesicle]]s (EV),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-08-mitochondrial-derived-vesicles.html |title=Better living through mitochondrial derived vesicles |website=MedicalXpress}}</ref> including [[Exosome (vesicle)|exosomes]], [[microvesicle]]s, [[Extracellular vesicle#Large oncosomes, exophers, and other very large EVs|oncosomes]], and other membrane-bound particles that are released from [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Established in 2011, the society is a [[nonprofit organization]]. It is governed by an executive committee. The current president is [[Andrew Hill (scientist)|Andrew Hill]] (2016-2018), the founding president was [[Jan Lötvall]] (2011-2016). The society publishes the ''[[Journal of Extracellular Vesicles]]''.

==Meetings==
As part of its mission to promote scientific research and education, the society hosts an annual meeting and educational event as well as numerous workshops on defined EV-related topics. The society also co-sponsors or endorses related events.

===Workshops and scientific seminars===
ISEV workshops began with a meeting on [[extracellular RNA]] ([[New York City]], 2012),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.isev.org/isev-events/isev-2012-nyc-rna-workshop/ |title=RNA Workshop}}</ref><ref name=Witwer>{{Cite journal |pmid=24009894 |pmc=3760646 |year=2013 |last1=Witwer |first1=K.

===Endorsed or co-sponsored events===
The society has directly or indirectly supported EV-related events around the world. These include meetings of the UK, French, and Spanish and Portuguese EV Societies (GEIVEX), a course the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]], a Keystone Symposium (2016 and 2018),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.keystonesymposia.org/16E4 |title=Scientific Conferences on Biomedical and Life Science Topics |website=Keystone Symposia}}</ref> [[Gordon Research Conferences]] (2016 and 2018),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.grc.org/extracellular-vesicles-conference/2016/ |title=2016 Extracellular Vesicles Conference GRC |website=Gordon Research Conferences}}</ref> a Cold Spring Harbor Asia Meeting (2016),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.csh-asia.org/2016meetings/extra.html |title=CSH Asia 2016 Conference on Biology & Function of Extracellular Vesicles: Exosomes, Microvesicles & Beyond |website=Cold Spring Harbor Asia}}</ref> and others.

==''Journal of Extracellular Vesicles'' and standardization initiatives==
To disseminate research in the field, the society established the [[peer-reviewed]] [[open access]] ''[[Journal of Extracellular Vesicles]]'' in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=zjev20 |title=Journal information |website=Journal of Extracellular Vesicles}}</ref> The journal was initially published by Co-Action Publishing, but has been published by [[Taylor & Francis]] since 2016. In addition to research and review articles, the journal periodically publishes position papers of the society that are meant to advance standardization efforts.<ref name=Witwer/><ref name="auto"/>
In 2014, the Executive Board of Directors published a set of minimal information guidelines for publication of EV studies.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=25536934 |pmc=4275645 |year=2014 |last1=Lötvall |first1=J. |title=Minimal experimental requirements for definition of extracellular vesicles and their functions: A position statement from the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles |journal=Journal of Extracellular Vesicles |volume=3 |pages=26913 |last2=Hill |first2=A.F. |last3=Hochberg |first3=F. |last4=Buzás |first4=E.I. |last5=Di Vizio |first5=D. |last6=Gardiner |first6=C. |last7=Gho |first7=Y.S. |last8=Kurochkin |first8=I.V. |last9=Mathivanan |first9=S. |last10=Quesenberry |first10=P. |last11=Sahoo |first11=S. |last12=Tahara |first12=H. |last13=Wauben |first13=M.H. |last14=Witwer |first14=K.W. |last15=Théry |first15=C. |doi=10.3402/jev.v3.26913}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biosciencetechnology.com/articles/2015/05/enhanced-analysis-extracellular-vesicles-imaging-flow-cytometry |title=Enhanced Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles with Imaging Flow Cytometry}}</ref>{{dead link|date=July 2019}} These requirements, known as "MISEV" or "MISEV2014," mirrored similar initiatives in the fields of microarray ([[MIAME]]) and proteomics ([[MIAPE]]) analysis, among others. In 2017, the society's board announced its intent to update these requirements with community involvement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Witwer |first1=Kenneth W. |last2=Soekmadji |first2=Carolina |last3=Hill |first3=Andrew F. |last4=Wauben |first4=Marca H. |last5=Buzás |first5=Edit I. |last6=Di Vizio |first6=Dolores |last7=Falcon-Perez |first7=Juan M. |last8=Gardiner |first8=Chris |last9=Hochberg |first9=Fred |last10=Kurochkin |first10=Igor V. |last11=Lötvall |first11=Jan |last12=Mathivanan |first12=Suresh |last13=Nieuwland |first13=Rienk |last14=Sahoo |first14=Susmita |last15=Tahara |first15=Hidetoshi |last16=Torrecilhas |first16=Ana Claudia |last17=Weaver |first17=Alissa M. |last18=Yin |first18=Hang |last19=Zheng |first19=Lei |last20=Gho |first20=Yong Song |last21=Quesenberry |first21=Peter |last22=Théry |first22=Clotilde |title=Updating the MISEV minimal requirements for extracellular vesicle studies: building bridges to reproducibility |journal=Journal of Extracellular Vesicles |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=1396823 |issn=2001-3078 |doi=10.1080/20013078.2017.1396823 |pmid=29184626|pmc=5698937 }}</ref> The "MISEV2018" requirements were published in 2018 with input from 382 authors.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid =30637094 |pmc =6322352 |year=2018 |last1=Théry |first1=C. |title=Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles 2018 (MISEV2018): a position statement of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and update of the MISEV2014 guidelines |journal=Journal of Extracellular Vesicles |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1535750 |doi=10.1080/20013078.2018.1535750}}</ref>
==Education==
Among the educational initiatives of the society is a [[massive open online course]] (MOOC), launched in 2016 and available through [[Coursera]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/extracellular-vesicles |title=Basics of Extracellular Vesicles |website=Coursera}}</ref> and co-sponsored by the [[University of Gothenburg]], [[Pohang University of Science and Technology]], and the [[University of California, Irvine]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bioquicknews.com/node/3442 |title=Well-Attended Two-Track Education Day Precedes Opening of International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV 2016) Annual Meeting in Rotterdam May 4-7 |website=BioQuick News.com |type=Press release}}</ref>
