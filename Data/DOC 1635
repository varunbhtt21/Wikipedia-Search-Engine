The '''''Achimota''-class''' are a class of two [[fast attack craft]]/[[missile boat]]s in service in the [[Ghana Navy|Ghanaian Navy]].  They are based on the same [[Lürssen]] design as the Turkish [[Yildiz class fast attack craft|''Yildiz''-class fast attack craft]].  The two ships of the class include the GNS ''Achimota'' (the [[flagship]] of the Ghana Navy) and the GNS ''Yogaga''.

The ships were acquired by Ghana in the late 1970s and early 1980s respectively. The basic ship is equipped with an OTO Melara 76mm dual-purpose gun, a 40mm anti-aircraft gun and two 7,62mm machine guns. The propulsion system consists of four diesel engines developing 10,800-shp a top speed of 30 knots. The Ghana boats are lighter than their Turkish counterparts, displacing 410 tons versus 430-440 tons for the ''Yildiz''-class. The two boats ordered by Ghana were commissioned in 1981.
