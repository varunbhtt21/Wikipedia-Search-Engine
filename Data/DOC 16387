==History==
On Tuesday, October 4, 1977 (Tishrei 22, 5738), during the annual hakafot celebration of [[Shemini Atzeret]], the Jewish holiday following the festival of [[Sukkot]], Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] suddenly turned pale and sat down. Realizing that something was not right, chassidim began vacating the synagogue and doctors were summoned. When a medic who was at the synagogue offered Schneerson a drink of water, he refused saying that he first wanted to complete the [[hakafot]] ceremony and make kiddush. Once the ceremony was completed, Schneerson walked to the [[Sukka]] where he made [[kidush]] on a cup of wine. It was only when the doctors began checking his pulse and vitals that they realized he had suffered a major heart attack. Per his request, Rabbi Menachem Mendel was treated at his office over the course of the next several weeks. On Friday, November 11, 1977 (Kislev 1, 5738), Rabbi Schneerson returned home; the day was celebrated by the Chabad community as a holiday.<ref name=chabad1977/><ref>[http://www.jewishbrandon.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/1511903/jewish/Rosh-Chodesh-Kislev-Nigun.htm "Rosh Chodesh Kislev Nigun."] ''JewishBrandon.com''.
