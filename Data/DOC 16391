'''Hereditary gingival fibromatosis''' (HGF), also known as '''idiopathic gingival hyperplasia''', is a rare condition of [[gingival overgrowth]].<ref name=Poulami>Poulami Majumder, Vineet Nair, Malancha Mukherjee, Sujoy Ghosh, and Subrata Kumar Dey, “The Autosomal Recessive Inheritance of Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis,” Case Reports in Dentistry, vol. 2013, Article ID 432864, 4 pages, 2013. doi:10.1155/2013/432864</ref> HGF is characterized as a [[benign]], slowly progressive, nonhemorrhagic, fibrous enlargement of keratinized [[gingiva]]. It can cover teeth in various degrees, and can lead to [[aesthetic]] disfigurement.<ref name=Hart>Thomas C. Hart, Yingze Zhang, Michael C. Gorry, P. Suzanne Hart, Margaret Cooper, Mary L. Marazita, Jared M. Marks, Jose R. Cortelli, Debora Pallos Am J Hum Genet. 2002 April; 70(4): 943–954. Published online 2002 February 26.</ref> Fibrous enlargement is most common in areas of [[maxilla]]ry and [[mandibular]] tissues of both arches in the [[mouth]].<ref name=Poulami /> [[Phenotype]] and [[genotype]] frequency of HGF is 1:175,000 where males and females are equally affected but the cause is not entirely known.<ref name=Hart/><ref name=Butchi>K.

Arora, “Hereditary gingival fibromatosis—a case report and management using a novel surgical technique,” Revista Sul-Brasileira de Odontologia, vol. 8, no. 4, pp. 453–458, 2011.</ref> It mainly exists as an isolated abnormality but can also be associated with a multi-system syndrome.<ref name=Poulami/>

==Signs and symptoms==
There may or may not be any evidence of history of HGF in the family nor any usage of taking long-term medicines for any particular disease when it comes to diagnosing HGF. There also may or may not be any signs of medical and/or family history of [[mental retardation]], [[hypertrichosis]], nor clinical symptoms that can be associated with gingival enlargement. Although, enlargement of gingiva, [[interdental papilla]], hindered speech, and secondary inflammatory changes taking place in the mouth commonly at the marginal gingiva are all very indicative of this condition. Commonly the patient will have mandiblular and maxilliary [[inflammation]] and overgrowth as opposed to the traditional pink, firm, and fleshy consistency of healthy gingiva. The patient's jaw may also appear distorted because of the gingiva englargements. Overgrowth of the gingiva can range from slightly covering the surface of teeth or it can even completely cover the surrounding teeth. The patient can also experience damage or loss of teeth.<ref name=Poulami/><ref name=Hart/><ref name=Butchi/><ref name=DeAngelo/><ref name=Jorgenson/><ref name=Poulopoulos/><ref name=Khan/><ref name=Ramakrishnan/><ref name=Smith>Smith RG (1997) Gingival recession: reappraisal of an enigmatic condition and a new index for monitoring.

===Obvious signs===
* Most obvious sign is gingival overgrowth (overgrowth of the gums)<ref name=Poulami/><ref name=Hart/><ref name=Butchi/><ref name=DeAngelo/><ref name=Jorgenson/><ref name=Poulopoulos/><ref name=Khan/><ref name=Ramakrishnan/><ref name=Smith/><ref name=Scannapieco/><ref name=Coletta/><ref name=Singer/>
* Hindered chewing efficiency and difficulties eating<ref name=Poulami/>
* Increasing [[periodontal disease|mobility]] of teeth<ref name=Poulami/>
* Abnormally shaped teeth and abnormal movement of teeth<ref name=DeAngelo/>
* Inflammation and/or swelling of the gums/gingiva<ref name=Butchi/><ref name=Khan/>
* Not necessarily any signs of pain but experiencing pain is possible<ref name=Poulami/>
* Difficulties in speaking, oftentimes can lead to [[speech disorders]]<ref name=Poulami/>
* Other dental and oral problems<ref name=DeAngelo/>
* In some cases, Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis may cause bleeding from the gums, or gum ulcerations.

==Cause==
Though much more research needs to be done, researchers have mostly agreed that a [[mutation]] in [[SOS1]], son-of-sevenless gene, is responsible for this disease.<ref name=Poulami/><ref name=DeAngelo>S. DeAngelo, J. Murphy, L. Claman, J. Kalmar, and B. Leblebicioglu, “Hereditary gingival fibromatosis—a review,” Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 138–143, 2007.

Poulopoulos, D. Kittas, and A. Sarigelou, “Current concepts on gingival fibromatosis-related syndromes,” Journal of Investigative and Clinical Dentistry, vol. 2, no. 3, pp. 156–161, 2011. View at Publisher • View at Google Scholar</ref> [[SOS1]] is a [[guanine]] nucleotide-exchange factor that functions in the [[Signal transduction|transduction]] of signals that control [[cell growth]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. A mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene results in a single [[nucleotide]] [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]].<ref name=Poulopoulos/> Specific [[linkage studies]] have localized the [[mutation]] for isolated, nonsyndromic [[autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] forms of gingival [[fibromatosis]] to [[chromosomes]] 2 and 5, more specifically 2p21-p22 and 5q13-q22.<ref name=Poulami/>

===Genetic===

HGF1 - Caused by a mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene localized on chromosome 2p21-p22<ref name=Poulami/>

HGF2 - Caused by a mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene localized on chromosome 5q13-q22<ref name=Poulami/>{{Contradict-inline|article = SOS1|date=July 2016}}

Mutations in the [[RE1-silencing transcription factor]] (REST) gene can also cause this syndrome.<ref name=Bayram2017>Bayram Y, White JJ, Elcioglu N, Cho MT, Zadeh N, Gedikbasi A, Palanduz S, Ozturk S, Cefle K, Kasapcopur O, Coban Akdemir Z, Pehlivan D, Begtrup A, Carvalho CMB, Paine IS, Mentes A, Bektas-Kayhan K, Karaca E, Jhangiani SN, Muzny DM, Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics, Gibbs RA, Lupski JR (2017) REST Final-Exon-Truncating Mutations Cause Hereditary Gingival Fibromatosis. Am J Hum Genet 101(1):149-156 </ref>  

===Non genetic===

HGF may also be caused by unwanted side effects of pharmacological agents like [[phenytoin]], [[ciclosporin]], and some calcium-channel blockers, meaning HGF is a disease that can be [[drug-induced]].<ref name=Poulami/> However, there is little next to no research done in this area to support the claim.

* Some unknown causes<ref name=Butchi/><ref name=Khan/>

==Mechanism==
Genetic linkage studies are among the most popular methods of study to look at the mechanism of this HGF. Genetic linkage studies have found to localize genetic loci for autosomal dominant forms of HGF to chromosome 2p21-p22 (indicative of HGF1) and chromosome 5q13-q22 (indicative of HGF2). Chromosome 2p21-p22 has been refined to an interval of ∼2.3 Mb to construct an integrated physical and genetic map of the 16 genes interval. Here, a mutation is found in sequencing these 16 genes.<ref name=Hart/>

There is an insertion of a cytosine between nucleotides 126,142 and 126,143 in codon 1083 of the [[SOS1]] gene, meaning there is a mutation in [[SOS1]]. This causes a problem because [[SOS1]] introduces a [[frameshift mutation]] and creates a premature stop codon. Also, it can segregate over generations, most commonly four. Once it causes a premature stop codon, the chromosome loses four important [[proline]]-rich SH-3 binding domains in the carboxyl-terminal region of the [[SOS1]] [[protein]]. As a result, the N-terminal [[amino acids]] for [[SOS1]] is fused into a 22–amino acid carboxyl terminus.<ref name=Hart/> Researchers claim that this mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene is a probable primary cause of this disease but limited information supports the mechanism of this claim.

==Diagnosis==

There are very few ways to test a patient for HGF. Currently, the most common way to diagnose a patient is by means of a physical evaluation. The physician can make a physical evaluation of the patient and send them to a dentist or better yet a specialist like a periodontist to evaluate signs of gingival overgrowth, quality of gingiva, inflammation, mechanical difficulties of the mouth, tooth conditions, and any sort of discomfort.<ref name=Butchi/>

Aside from obvious physical symptoms seen in a physical evaluation, molecular tests can be run to check if there is a mutation in the [[SOS1]] gene to confirm the diagnosis. If there is indeed a mutation in this gene coupled with the typical physical symptoms, then it is quite probable that a patient suffers from this disease. Also, looking at family history is also becoming more prominent in aiding to diagnose the patient. Otherwise, researchers are working to find new and better ways to test for the presence of HGF.<ref name=Poulami/><ref name=Hart/><ref name=Smith/>

==Prevention==
Since this condition is generally agreed upon to be [[hereditary]], nothing can be done to prevent HGF. However, in some cases where it can develop as a result of rare multi-system syndromes, such as: Zimmerman-Laband, Jones, Ramon Syndrome, Rutherford Syndrome, Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis, Systemic Infantile Hyalinosis, and [[Mannosidosis]], it is best for one to simply monitors the possible progression for HGF with regular dental check-ups.<ref name=Ramakrishnan/>

If the patient's disease is treated by means of surgery, it is recommended that the patient undergoes post-surgical therapies for maintenance and periodic monitoring of gums for the sake of the possibility of re-occurrence of HGF.<ref name=Ramakrishnan/>

==Treatment ==
This disease has not been shown to be life-threatening or the cause of death in patients. However, treatment is necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

===If left untreated===

The following can occur if left untreated:
* Too much gingiva exposure
*  
* Oral [[morbidity]] 
* 
* [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] [[infection]] of areas between the gums and teeth, or at the [[gum line]]
*
* various degrees of [[Periodontitis]] - most likely due to the inability and difficulty of keeping the gingival margin and surrounding tissue clean due to the overgrowth
*
* Improper [[tooth eruption]] and/or complete prevention of tooth eruption as a result of too much gingiva exposure
*
* Systemic every-day troubles including functional and aesthetic problems of the mouth
*
* [[Malocclusion]]

<ref name=Hart/><ref name=Smith/><ref name=Scannapieco/>

===Treatment===
Most recent methods of treatment take the form of surgeries such as oral [[prophylaxis]], followed by post-surgical therapies to monitor, provide proper oral hygiene, and correct the deformity. Although, the nature of recurrence post-treatment is virtually unknown, let alone what type of treatment is most effective for HGF. (SOURCE 2) In some cases, there is re-growth after surgical removal of the excess gingival tissues, in others there is minimal. No cases yet have shown any particular treatment or form of medicine to permanently remove HGF.<ref name=Poulami/><ref name=Hart/>

One type of procedure that can be executed is as follows: Removal of excess tissue under [[anesthesia]] through an internal bevel [[gingivectomy]] or undisplaced [[pocket reduction surgery|flap]] followed by [[gingivoplasty]] and continuous sling [[Surgical suture|suture]] placements and periodontal dressing; after about a week of recovery after the surgery, remove sutures and periodically do observational evaluations to look for any signs of re-occurrence.<ref name=Poulami/>

==Recent research==
Some researchers suggest that HGF is transmitted as a [[Mendelian trait]] since both [[autosomal dominant]] and [[autosomal recessive]] transmission has been reported since the early 1970s. (SOURCE 1) In more recent scientific literature, there is evidence in which [[pedigree chart|pedigree]] analyses confirm autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or even as [[X-linked]] inherited cases of the HGF trait.<ref name=Coletta/><ref name=Singer/>

In 2002, researchers described the [[SOS1]] gene and proved for the first time that a single-nucleotide–insertion mutation of the [[SOS1]] gene on codon 1083 is the preliminary cause of HGF1 in humans. (Source 1) Later on in 2010, there was a case study done on a 16-year-old male with severe gingival overgrowth, almost covering all teeth. Researchers approached this issue with [[periodontics]] - a partial [[gingivectomy]] and [[flap surgery]]. This case study concluded that surgery followed by regular follow-ups is a good way to treat HGF despite the fact that the risks of re-occurrence of the condition remain high.<ref name=Ramakrishnan/>

Even more recently, a study was done in 2013 on a family that showed history of autosomal recessive inheritance of HGF. The study did not dismiss the return of HGF after treatment but did claim that general surgical intervention after scaling and [[root]] planning of teeth supplemented with good [[oral hygiene]] is good enough to prevent the re-occurrence of HGF. This case study also acknowledged how HGF can be part of a multi-system syndrome associated with disorders such as [[Zimmermann Laband syndrome]] (ear, nose, bone, and nail defects with hepatosplenomegaly), [[Rutherford syndrome]]  (microphthalmia, mental retardation, athetosis, and hypopigmentation), [[Murray-Puretic Drescher syndrome]] and [[Ramon syndrome]].<ref name=Poulami/>
