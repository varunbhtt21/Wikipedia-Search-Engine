}}'''True Volunteer Foundation''' ('''TVF''') is a [[non-governmental organisation]] which aims to empower people through education. It is headquartered in [[London, England]] and was established in 2004. Though its aims to eliminate [[poverty]] are similar to many charities, it differs through its operating model, which emphasises a low cost base and works to link together the [[corporate sector]], small charity partners and [[Volunteering|volunteers]]. Its core principle and trademark is ''Pay to Work'', and its volunteering ethos is based on the vision that everyone should have a ''social career'' which is run in parallel with their paid jobs or studies.

== Overview ==
True Volunteer Foundation is dedicated to alleviating poverty globally through education. It does this through various means, including the building of schools and the provision of [[microfinance]], [[capacity building]] and employment training. It is headquartered in London, England and was established in 2004 by a group of like-minded individuals who wanted to give something back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/achievements/|title=Achievements - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

The organisation hosted its first fundraising event in [[Kempton Park Racecourse|Kempton Park]], raising funds to build three schools in [[Sri Lanka]]; it expanded this to a network of 18 schools across Asia and Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DarlingMag-2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Darling magazine|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Today, True Volunteer Foundation spans across 33 countries, reporting that its projects directly impacted 325,009 people in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/who-is-tvf/|title=Who is TVF - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Its core principle and trademark, ''Pay to Work'', enables the organisation to operate within a low cost base<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/true-volunteer/pay-to-work/|title=Pay to Work - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> and helps ensure no less than 90 per cent of project donations go direct to end [[beneficiaries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/financial-model/|title=Financial model - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> True Volunteer Foundation is reported to be funded through corporate donors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/how-we-work/corporate-partners/|title=Corporate partners - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> and events,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/get-involved/events/|title=Events - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> and utilises [[pro bono]] services from corporate partners and members of the public to operate within what it terms as a pioneering [[financial model]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/supporters/|title=Supporters - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

== Guiding principles ==

=== Pay to Work ===
True Volunteer Foundation works with over 100 volunteers who donate between 5 and 35 hours per week to run projects for the organisation. True Volunteers do not get paid and do not claim general expenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/who-is-tvf/|title=Who is TVF - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> The organisation calls this principle ''Pay to Work'', which is a registered trademark of the charity. The ''Pay to Work'' principle is central to its model and is embedded into every aspect of the charity's work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/true-volunteer/pay-to-work/|title=Pay to Work - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

''Pay to Work'' enables the organisation to work within a low cost base. According to Michael Padmanathan, founder of True Volunteer Foundation, “this approach is highly appealing for volunteers and corporate sponsors, who are often put off by the high running costs of traditional charities”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.blackberry.com/company/success/detail.trueVolunteer.html|title=Customer Success|publisher=Uk.blackberry.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Volunteers are vital to the financial model: by not claiming a charge for their services or expenses they are effectively meeting a significant proportion of the organisations’ cost base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Fundraising.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fundraising magazine|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Social career ===
True Volunteer Foundation's volunteering ethos is based on the vision that everyone should have a social career which is run in parallel with their paid jobs or studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/true-volunteer/true-volunteer-uk/|title=True Volunteer UK - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> People volunteer for the organisation on their own terms, specifying how much time they want to dedicate; and they can volunteer either from home, the office, in the field or commuting to and from their day jobs or studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/The-Big-Issue.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Big Issue|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Called ‘True Volunteers’, each person is given a functional or project role within the organisation which matches their interests, skills and availability. Roles range from Head of Department to Country Manager, and from [[Accountant]]s to [[Fundraiser]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/true-volunteer/true-volunteer-uk/|title=True Volunteer UK - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> The organisation's goal is to provide a platform for individuals to give back to society so they can empower those less fortunate than themselves.

=== Corporate social responsibility ===
The corporate sector is the major source of funding for True Volunteer Foundation, either through project-based funding as part of a company's [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) program, or the provision of ''[[pro bono]]'' professional products and services. The charity offers bespoke charity projects, allowing sponsors to input into the projects in a way that aligns with the company's own goals and priorities: its proposition to the corporate sector is "let us do the work you want to see done".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Fundraising.pdf|format=PDF|title=Fundraising magazine|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> To date the organisation states it works with 50 corporate partners offering tailored CSR programmes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/how-we-work/corporate-partners/|title=Corporate partners - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Its funding model is set up to enable corporate partners to support its work across three areas: funders and pro bono partners who meet core costs (e.g. office costs, [[marketing]] and [[Office administration|administration]]); partners to fund charitable projects; and pro bono event partners to meet costs in running the charity's event programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/supporters/|title=Supporters - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

===Partnership approach===
True Volunteer Foundation states that its model of working with three parties makes it unique within the charity sector: the charity works to link together the corporate sector, small charity partners and True Volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/True-Volunteer-Case-Study-for-The-Independent.pdf|format=PDF|title=True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> The organisation uses this approach to overcome three issues it identified in the sector, which are corporates needing support with charitable giving; small charities needing support with securing funding and delivering projects; and volunteers wanting to give back on their own terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnRlZ0kTQTQ|title=Michael Padmanathan, Trustee and Founder|work=YouTube|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

The organisation works to provide approximately 92 small charities with the resources to become successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/achievements/|title=Achievements - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> This may include access to funding, volunteer resources or [[project management]] support, so that True Volunteer Foundation and its charity partners can jointly deliver projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/how-we-work/our-approach/|title=Our approach - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> To date it states that it has jointly delivered over 100 International and UK Projects with its small charity partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/how-we-work/charity-partners/|title=Charity partners - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

The charity also partners with over 30 universities in the UK and Europe, providing student work placements across different study disciplines. Its aim is to offer volunteer roles which educate the next generation in [[social responsibility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/how-we-work/university-partners/|title=University partners - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

== Main projects ==

=== Computing for One Million people, Madagascar  ===
In 2010, True Volunteer Foundation partnered with the [[Madagascar|Madagascan Government]], [[Microsoft]] and the [[Christina Dodwell|Dodwell Trust]] to roll out a country wide program bringing essential computing resources and skills to one million people by 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/about-tvf/achievements/|title=Achievements - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> The partnership provided 480 computers in 40 training rooms to teach [[computer literacy]] in schools and regional resource centres across Madagascar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/portfolio-type/madagascar-it-programme/|title=Madagascar I.T Programme - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Wimbledon Sporting Project, UK  ===
Launched in 2012 to coincide with the [[London 2012 Olympic Games]], the [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] Sporting Project is a five-year educational programme, which includes films, books and sporting activities provided to schools in the London Borough of Merton at no cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/portfolio-type/wimbledon-sporting-project/|title=Wimbledon Sporting Project - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Through a mixture of sport history, stories from sporting champions and practical sports packages, the aim of the project is to inspire the next generation of sporting champions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/WSP.pdf|format=PDF|title=Welcome to Wimbledon magazine|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

In May 2012, the Common Ground film premièred at the [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] in Wimbledon, bringing together celebrities, corporate donors and schools to provide sustainable [[Physical education|sports education]] to schools across [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. 21 sporting celebrities, 18 young sporting hopefuls, 39 sponsors and partners, 27 True Volunteers and over 60 individuals from different walks of life all donated their time, expertise and resources to produce an inspirational film and book for young people. It is estimated the film would have cost over £90,000 to produce, but due to its partner ecosystem, only cost £400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/WSP.pdf|format=PDF|title=Welcome to Wimbledon magazine|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Celebrities starring in the film and book include [[Jacquie Beltrao]], [[Greg Rusedski]], [[Will Greenwood]], [[Steve Cram]], [[Daley Thompson]], [[Alec Stewart]], [[Sean Kerly]] and [[John Scales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/portfolio-type/wimbledon-sporting-project/|title=Wimbledon Sporting Project - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

The project aims to provide free sporting opportunities to 27,000 school children across the London Borough of Merton.

=== Nuffield School, Sri Lanka ===
Nuffield School for deaf and blind children is located in Kaithady, which is in the Jaffna District situated in the Northern Province of [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Sri Lankan Civil War|Civil War]] fought for three decades in Sri Lanka had a disastrous impact on the entire country, leaving most of the buildings at the Nuffield School badly damaged. To significantly improve the future for the school children, True Volunteer Foundation raised funds for a complete refurbishment of the facilities. Completed in September 2012, the renovated facilities now provide accommodation and schooling for up to 300 deaf and/or blind children per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/portfolio-type/nuffield-school/|title=Nuffield Special School - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Vinh Quang Primary School, Vietnam  ===
Vinh Quang Primary School educated approximately 100 children in Kien Giang province within [[Vietnam]]. To enable the school to support more local children, in 2012 True Volunteer Foundation funded a two-storey extension, doubling the school's size and adding classroom space and resources to allow Vinh Quang Primary School to accommodate up to 300 school children.

All funds for the project were raised by a group of cyclists who took part in True Volunteer Foundation's Cycle Vietnam event in November 2011. The team cycled 400&nbsp;km across Vietnam and [[Cambodia]], raising thousands of pounds to build the school in Vietnam and support an Orphanage in Cambodia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/portfolio-type/vinh-quang-primary-school/|title=Vinh Quang Primary School - True Volunteer Foundation|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

To promote the challenge within the UK, True Volunteer Foundation managed two events in the run up to the trip to increase visibility. This included entering a team of cyclists in Cyclothon UK 2011 and hosting a celebrity tennis tournament day at [[David Lloyd Leisure|David Lloyd Leisure Centre]] in Raynes Park. Special guests attending the celebrity tennis tournament included [[Mike Read]], [[Victor Ubogu]] and Sue Mappin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truevolunteer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/TVF-Press-Pack.pdf|format=PDF|title=Press Pack|publisher=Truevolunteer.org|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>
