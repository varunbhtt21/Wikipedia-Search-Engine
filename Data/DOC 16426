:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/National Film Award for Best Music Direction|National Film Award for Best Music Direction]]
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]), [[User:BashBrannigan|BashBrannigan]] ([[User talk:BashBrannigan|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) at 22:37, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* Hi, thanks a lot for working on this. Why what measure did you arrive at 5x expansion? I can merely see a 3x expansion in prose. [[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] ([[User talk:Hekerui|talk]]) 17:19, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] To be more precise, the article had 1013 prose characters before its recent expansion, and has 3075 prose characters now. It will need to grow to 5065 prose characters to qualify as a 5x expansion, or another 1990 prose characters. [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]], do you believe that's possible? [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 19:17, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:::* That's doable, if it isn't too long after the nomination. -- [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 22:28, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

::::*Not at all. We've just started the review, and we always allow nominators a chance to fix whatever issues are found with it in a reasonable period of time (usually a week or so). How long do you think it might take? [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 22:36, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::* Should have it by Wednesday, I think.  I'll dig out my copy of his memoirs, which will include links to non-primary sources galore.  -- [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 22:39, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::* Update: Now significantly expanded, including a long but highly topical quote from the report on cold fusion prepared by the ERAB panel he co-chaired. -- [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 02:17, 13 May 2014 (UTC) 
:::::::*It's good that the article is being further extended, but block quotes do not count towards the expansion per the rules. I strongly feel, in any case, that a block quote like this is overkill, too much unjustified usage of copyrighted content, and a prime target for summary style. [[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] ([[User talk:Hekerui|talk]]) 11:24, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*The block quote isn't copyrighted content, it's from a report prepared for and funded by the US government.  It is also entirely topical considering that [[cold fusion]] is the thing that is (incorrectly, IMO) cited in Huizenga's obituaries as what brought him to prominence in the public eye.  This rather cautious and measured quote contrasts strongly with Huizenga's personal "scientific fiasco of the century" view, which I am attempting to further document.  I believe the expansion suffices without including the block quote, but in any event, am continuing to expand the article now that I have better sources to work with. -- [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 13:16, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::*Okay, I'm wrong about the copyright issue. [[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] ([[User talk:Hekerui|talk]]) 17:22, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::::*So it's now around 5900 prose characters, not including the (abridged) block quote.  Does anything else need to be addressed? -- [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 18:05, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::*Yes, the hook should be concise, 200 characters is the outside limit. [[User:Hekerui|Hekerui]] ([[User talk:Hekerui|talk]]) 16:50, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::::::*Easy enough, just drop the non-essential NAS stuff at the beginning:  ... that '''[[John R. Huizenga]]''' discovered the new elements [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]] in debris from a [[nuclear test]] of a [[Ivy Mike|fusion]] device, but considered [[cold fusion]] "the scientific fiasco of the century"? -- [[User:Bill-on-the-Hill|Bill-on-the-Hill]] ([[User talk:Bill-on-the-Hill|talk]]) 18:26, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::::*Alright, at your suggestion I shortened the hook so it is just within bounds.
:::::::::::::*[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] In conclusion: the article prose was sufficiently expanded and is long enough and follows policy, the hook is sufficiently formatted and short, and QPQ happened.
