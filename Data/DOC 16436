Title : File:High resolution gamma spectrum vs. TAS gamma spectrum.png
Text : ==Summary==
{{Information
|Description = Hypothetical beta decay seen by high resolution (germanium mainly) and TAS detectors. With a germanium
detector, (Ge) the energy peaks corresponding to individual nuclear gamma transitions are seen, but the TAS detector gives a spectrum of the nuclear levels populated in the beta decay (ideal TAS). The TAS detector has less resolution compared to a Ge detector, but higher efficiency, (close to 100% versus 1-5% in Ge detectors).
