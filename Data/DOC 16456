Too soon? seems like it is not yet started filming, none of the cast or crew even have a page on here. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 22:52, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Note''' to [[User:Wgolf|nominator]]:  [[WP:NONENG|Non-English]] sources are perfectly acceptable for building articles on [[WP:CSB|non-English]] films. Please take a gander at [[WP:INDAFD]]. And in expanding and building an encyclopedia, it is to be expected that not all Malayalam film stars will have articles in the English Wikipedia. See [[WP:DELREASON]]. That lack is a valid reason to build new articles, not delete existing ones because those other topics have not yer been included.

:*'''Comment'''-well yes that is true-but from what I could tell it didn't look like anything was that much known about it-and I really hope we can get some input from there. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:19, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::* I have not been able to find a decent online Malayalam > English translator. Folks with access to hard-copy Malayalam news sources or translation skills for what's online would be a boon.

Yeah when it comes to translating languages and then translating them back to English-they almost seem better for comical purposes then any reliable purposes. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 19:39, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
