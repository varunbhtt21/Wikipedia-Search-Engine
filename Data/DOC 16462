'''Mustard Seed Faith''' was an American [[Jesus music]] group from [[Costa Mesa, California]].

Mustard Seed Faith was one of several groups formed by members of [[Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s; others included [[Daniel Amos]] and [[Sweet Comfort Band]]. Mustard Seed Faith's first releases were songs on [[Maranatha! Music]] compilations: "Happy in Jesus", released in 1973 on ''Maranatha Three'', "All I Know" in 1974 on ''Maranatha Four'' and "Sidney the Pirate" in 1976 on ''Maranatha Five''.<ref>Don Cusic, ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music''. Greenwood Press, 2010, p. 307.</ref> The group's only album for Maranatha, ''Sail On Sailor'', was released in 1975 and featured album art by [[Rick Griffin]].<ref name=powell>Mark Allan Powell, ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music''. Hendrickson Publishers, 2002, pp. 616-617.</ref>

The group toured extensively from 1970 to 1977. They disbanded in 1977 partly due to "road touring fatigue." <ref name=powell/> They reunited in 1980 to independently issue a second full-length album. Members [[Oden Fong]] and Lewis McVay went on to pursue solo careers.
