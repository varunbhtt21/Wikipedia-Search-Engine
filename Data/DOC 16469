==History==

===Early years===
WARM has its origins in the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|feminist art movement]] of the early 1970s. Gatherings in the studios and homes of [[women artists]] in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] led to the beginning of the Women's Art Registry of Minnesota in the winter of 1973 with the establishment of a slide registry of women artists from Minnesota by Lynn Lockie Warkov and Susan Fiene.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=13}} The group organized their own exhibitions and gathered statistics on the representation of women in the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]] and the [[Walker Art Center]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Meredith A.|title="The Enemies of Women’s Liberation in the Arts Will be Crushed": A.I.R. Gallery’s Role in the American Feminist Art Movement|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/essay/meredith-brown|publisher=Archives of American Art}}</ref> That year artist [[Judy Chicago]] spoke at the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[College of St. Catherine]] about her [[Feminist Art Program]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]]. The next year Chicago, [[Miriam Shapiro]], and educators from the College of St. Catherine laid the foundations for WARM.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Jennie|title=Doin' It in Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman's Building|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|page=132|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0129}}</ref> At the Mid-west Women's Artists' Conference in Michigan in 1975, attendees from Minneapolis learned about the practicalities of maintaining a cooperatively run gallery.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moravec|first1=Michelle|title=Toward a History of Feminism, Art, and Social Movements in the United States|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|page=30|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022}}</ref>

The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota was founded as a [[artist cooperative|cooperative]] by 37 [[women artists]] in 1976. It was the first feminist art cooperative in Minnesota.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=3}} The group was non-hierarchical, with all members serving on the organization's governing body.<ref name="Jordan"/> They registered as a non-profit on January 28, 1976. They limited the membership to 40 people, who were required to pay dues, attend monthly meetings, and spend at least 300 hours annually on activities related to the organization and gallery.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=27–28}}

===WARM Gallery (1976–1991)===
In 1976 the WARM collective established WARM: A Women's Collective Artspace (also known as the WARM Gallery) in a former millinery store in Minneapolis' [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] in the Wyman Building at 414 First Avenue North.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=21}} In 1972 New York City's [[A.I.R. Gallery]] had become the first women's cooperative gallery in the United States. WARM Gallery was one of number of cooperative artist galleries established by women using A.I.R. as a model. The WARM Gallery hosted solo and group exhibitions by invited women artists and from its membership. Visiting artists at the gallery included the painters [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Joan Semmel]] and [[Joan Snyder]].{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=38–39}}

WARM began offering the Feminist Perspectives monthly lecture series in 1980. The program was directed by Joyce Lyon and succeeded in bringing art critics and historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Lucy Lippard]], and [[Germaine Greer]] through the group's visiting artists program. The series continued until 1984.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=51–52}}<ref name="Jordan"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Lyon|first1=Joyce|last2=Erickson|first2=Elizabeth|title='The House We Built: Feminist Art Then and Now'|url=http://www.womenspress.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&SubSectionID=22&ArticleID=4243|work=Minnesota Women's Press|date=2013}}</ref>

In 1980 the WARM newsletter expanded to the quarterly ''WARM Journal''. Designed by [[Patricia Olson]], the periodical featured fiction and poetry from Minnesota women in addition to articles on art. The journal's editorial committee was chaired by Susan McDonald, Alice Towle, Marty Nash and Elizabeth Erickson until 1985 when Phyllis Wiener took over. By 1985 the journal's circulation had risen to nearly 5000.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=58–59}} Informed by [[cultural feminism]], ''WARM Journal'' was one of the few interdisciplinary publications in the area and for a time it was the only art magazine published regularly in the Twin Cities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chiarmonte|first1=Paula L.|title=Women Artists: A Resource and Research Guide|journal=Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America|date=October 1982|volume=1|issue=5|page=A-15|jstor=27947012}}</ref> The ''WARM Journal'' ceased publication in 1987.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=58}}

Catherine Jordan was hired as the gallery's coordinator in 1981. She became executive director of WARM the following year.<ref name="Jordan">{{cite web|last1=Umolu|first1=Yesomi|title=WARM in the ’80s Then & Now: Catherine Jordan on Art, AIDS, and Feminism in the Twin Cities|url=http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2012/catherine-jordan-minneapolis-feminist-art-aid|publisher=Walker Art Center|date=July 17, 2012}}</ref> The collective established the WARM Mentor Program in 1982. Emerging artists are paired with professionals for the two-year program. A more intensive program, the WARM Mentor Intensive Program, lasts one to three months.<ref name="History of WARM"/>

In October 1986, WARM hosted a national conference at the Minneapolis Plaza Hotel called "The Contemporary Women in the Visual Arts". The conference featured speakers such as [[Wilhelmina Holladay]], artist [[June Wayne]], and Janet Wolff. WARM Gallery and other galleries in the Twin Cities featured women artists during the conference. WARM also sponsored a traveling exhibition featuring artist [[Harmony Hammond]].<ref>{{cite journal|editor1-last=Crowe|editor1-first=Edith L.|title=WOMEN AND ART DOCUMENTATION GROUP: The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota|journal=Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America|date=Spring 1987|volume=6|issue=1|page=36|jstor=27947720|doi=10.1086/adx.6.1.27947720}}</ref>

Following the conference, WARM found itself in significant debt.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=67}} Shortly after the opening of the nearby [[Target Center]] sports complex in October 1990, parking and traffic problems worsened and the gallery experienced a decline in visitors. Unable to keep up with rising rents, the board made a decision to close WARM Gallery in January 1991. They retained the non-profit and the Mentor Program, moving to an office on University Avenue in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] before relocating to the Women's Building on Rice Street.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=74–75}}

==Post-gallery era==
The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota continues to hold exhibitions for its members. In addition to its educational and professional programs, WARM maintains an online art registry of local and regional artists and publishes an e-newsletter.<ref name="History of WARM">{{cite web|last1=Olsen|first1=Alis|title=About WARM: History of WARM|url=http://www.thewarm.org/about-warm/|publisher=Women's Art Resources of Minnesota|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> WARM changed its name to Women's Art Resources of Minnesota in 2010.<ref name="Abbe"/>

==Legacy==
The WARM Gallery provided an important exhibition space outside of mainstream venues for Minnesota women artists. It was a catalyst for economic renewal in the Warehouse District and played an important role in the development of [[arts in Minneapolis]]. WARM served as a key Midwestern node in the early [[feminist art movement in the United States]].{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=2}}

The University of Minnesota's [[Weisman Art Museum]] held an exhibition of work from 12 of WARM's long-term members in 2006. The exhibition was documented in Joanna Inglot's 2007 book ''WARM: A Feminist Art Collective in Minnesota''. The book includes a history of WARM and entries for each of the 12 artists featured in the exhibition.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner-Huggett|first1=Joanna|title=Review: WARM: A Feminist Art Collective in Minnesota by Joanna Inglot|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=64–66|jstor=20358154}}</ref> On WARM's 40-year anniversary in 2013, exhibitions were held at both the University of Minnesota's [[Katherine E. Nash Gallery]] and Robbin Gallery.<ref name="Abbe">{{cite news|last=Abbe|first=Mary|title=Women's work, and proud of it|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/187324971.html|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=January 17, 2013}}</ref>
