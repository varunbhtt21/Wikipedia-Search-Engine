:{{Tfd links|Sportspeople from Portland, Oregon}}
Arbitrary list of ill-defined sportspeople to happen to come from a particular city. The [[:Category:Sportspeople from Portland, Oregon|Sportspeople from Portland, Oregon category]] already exists and is a much better avenue to group these subjects together. Furthermore, this template fails the following [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates#Navigation templates|template guidelines]]: 
# All articles within a template relate to a single, coherent subject. → Toss-up; merely being from a particular city isn't a subject in itself, it's a qualifier.
# The subject of the template should be mentioned in every article. → {{nay}} Nope.
# The articles should refer to each other, to a reasonable extent. → {{nay}} Nope.
# There should be a Wikipedia article on the subject of the template. → {{nay}} The link on top of the template actually leads back to the category! This navbox is wholly redundant and can never possibly accommodate the growing number of articles that the category is much better suited for.
# You would want to list many of these articles in the [[WP:SEEALSO|See also]] sections of the articles. → {{nay}} Nope. The only connection any of these sportspeople have to one another is they were either born in or raised in Portland, Oregon, which does not satisfy being included in "see also" sections.

*'''Comment''' – The user who created this also created [[Template:Portland Open Invitational winners]] (which was independently brought to a TfD right below this one), and additionally had his category "[[:Category:Basketball players from Portland, Oregon]]" (and other sports-specific players from Portland categories) deleted and upmerged back to Category:Sportspeople from Portland, Oregon. What is it about this city, seriously. [[User:Jrcla2|Jrcla2]] ([[User talk:Jrcla2|talk]]) 17:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' I don't really care about the template one way or the other, but could you try to keep the discourse [[WP:CIVIL|civil]], please? Cheers, [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] ([[User talk:Valfontis|talk]]) 19:35, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' Please be civil and [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] in my edits. The topics I edit are my choice. As what you edit is your choice. —[[User:Halvorsen brian|Brian Halvorsen]] ([[User talk:Halvorsen brian|talk]]) 04:55, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - a template trying to do the job of an existing category. [[User:Tewapack|Tewapack]] ([[User talk:Tewapack|talk]]) 17:39, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - seems better served as a category.  The template will never be close to complete and it has the potential to include an unwieldy number of items.  And what is the criteria for who goes on the template vs. not?  I truly don't think users need both a category and a template on this subject and the category seems the better way to go.

:{{Tfd links|Portland Open Invitational winners}}
This type of navbox should be reserved for the most notable golf tournaments, such as the [[Men's major golf championships|majors]] and [[World Golf Championships]]. This defunct tournament hardly qualifies. [[User:Tewapack|Tewapack]] ([[User talk:Tewapack|talk]]) 15:40, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per User:Tewapack. A defunct, short-lived non-major golf tournament does not warrant navbox cruft. [[User:Jrcla2|Jrcla2]] ([[User talk:Jrcla2|talk]]) 17:18, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
