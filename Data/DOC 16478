:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] This is a substantial, more than five-fold expansion, article and is new enough and long enough and the image is in the public domain. The several facts in the hook are well-sourced, and I have added one extra citation to cover the necessary inline citation for "being highly localized in its distribution". By the way, I don't see much of a contribution to the article by [[User:Totodu74|Totodu74]] (1 trivial edit). [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 13:10, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

Totodu74 is the main writer of the French featured article which I translated (see the copyright attribution notes in the English article's history). My work relies substantially on his, and therefore, I think it only appropriate that he receive credit as well.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 15:54, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
