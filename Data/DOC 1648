[[WP:SCHOLAR|Non-notable scholar]].  A PhD candidate, with some published articles, but no real indications of notability.  Article was nominated once before and deleted in July 2013.  I would almost consider a [[WP:CSD#G4|G4 speedy deletion]], but enough time has passed that a re-review may be in order. <font color="green">[[User:WikiDan61|WikiDan61]]</font><font color="green" size="5px"></font><sup>[[User talk:WikiDan61|ChatMe!]]</sup><sub>[[Special:Contributions/WikiDan61|ReadMe!!]]</sub> 12:49, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - No indication that he meets [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:SCHOLAR]]. Of the three references currently in the article, 2 are primary sources and the third came up as untrusted for me but the URL suggests that it is primary as well. A quick search doesn't show any reliable independent sources. [[User:Sarahj2107|Sarahj2107]] ([[User talk:Sarahj2107|talk]]) 13:18, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': A non-notable academic and writer. I couldn't find any good independent sources, and there is nothing in the article to suggest I will. Maybe later in his career, but not now. '''''[[User:Moswento|Moswento]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Moswento|talky]]</sup> 13:40, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
