'''Ahatanhel Yukhymovych Krymsky''' ({{lang-uk|Агатангел Юхимович Кримський}}, {{lang-ru|Агафангел Ефимович Крымский}}; {{OldStyleDate|15 January|1871|3 January}} – 25 January 1942) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], linguist and polyglot (knowing up to 35 languages), literary scholar, folklorist, writer, and translator. He was one of the founders of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] (VUAN) in 1918 and a full member of it and of the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from 1903.

== Life and career ==
Krymsky was born in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] to a [[Lipka Tatars|Lipka Tatar]] father and an ethnic [[Poles|Polish]] mother.<ref name="gazeta.ua">[http://gazeta.ua/articles/istoriya-movi/_shodoznavec-agatangel-krimskij-znav-do-sotni-mov/477261 Сходознавець Агатангел Кримський знав до сотні мов]{{ref-uk}}</ref> His family moved soon to [[Zvenyhorodka]] in Central Ukraine. His surname "Krymsky" ({{lang-uk|Кримський}}) means "Crimean" and was received by an ancestor in the 17th century who was a [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] [[mullah]] from [[Bakhchysaray]].<ref name="history.org.ua" >[http://www.history.org.ua/?termin=Krimskii_A Енциклопедія історії України: Т. 5: Кон - Кю / Редкол.: В. А. Смолій (голова) та ін. НАН України. Інститут історії України. - К.: В-во «Наукова думка», 2008. - 568 с.: іл.]{{ref-uk}}</ref> He was baptized into [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].<ref name="history.org.ua" /> Although Ahatanhel had no Ukrainian origin he described himself as "[[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile]]".<ref name="gazeta.ua" /><ref name="history.org.ua" />

Krymsky graduated from Galagan College in [[Kiev]] in 1889, from the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages]] in [[Moscow]] in 1891, and subsequently from [[Moscow University]] in 1896. After graduation, he worked in the [[Middle East]] from 1896 to 1898, and subsequently returned to Moscow, where he became a lecturer at the Lazarev Institute, and, in 1900, a professor. Krymsky taught [[Arabic literature]] and Oriental history. In Moscow, he was active in the Ukrainian pro-independence movement and was a member of Moscow's Ukrainian [[Hromada]].<ref name="history.org.ua" /><ref name="ieu">[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\K\R\KrymskyAhatanhel.htm Krymsky, Ahatanhel. Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine]</ref>

In July 1918 Krymsky returned to Kiev and took part in the foundation of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] (VUAN). Eventually, he became the director of the Academy.<ref name="ieu"/> He edited 20 of the 25 volumes of ''Записки Історично-філологічного відділу'' ("Notes of the History and Philology Department") of the Academy (1920–29) and was a professor at [[Kiev University]] as well as the vice-president of the [[Ukrainian Science Society]] in Kiev from 1918.

Although Krymsky survived the [[Great Purge]] of the 1930s, he was removed from scholarly and teaching activity for about 10 years. In 1939 he was rehabilitated,<ref name="ieu"/> but in July 1941 after the [[German-Soviet War|German-Soviet war]] began, the [[NKVD]] arrested him as "especially unreliable",<ref name="history.org.ua" /> and deported him to [[Kostanay]] in [[Kazakhstan]], where he died at the age of 71. He was finally rehabilitated in 1957.

== Activity ==
Krymsky was an expert in up to 34 languages;<ref name="ieu"/> some sources report that he had at least an average knowledge of 56 languages.<ref name="parafia.org.ua">[http://www.parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/kultura/shenderovskyj-nehaj-ne-hasne-persha/vydatnyj-orijentalist-ukrajiny-ahyatanhel-krymskyj/ Видатний орієнталіст України — Агатангел Кримський] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053412/http://www.parafia.org.ua/biblioteka/kultura/shenderovskyj-nehaj-ne-hasne-persha/vydatnyj-orijentalist-ukrajiny-ahyatanhel-krymskyj/ |date=2014-04-30 }}{{ref-uk}}</ref> Krymsky contributed few hundred entries to the Brockhaus, Efron, and Granat Russian encyclopedias and wrote many other works on Arabic, Turkish, Turkic, Crimean Tatar, and Iranian history and literature, some of which were pioneering textbooks in Russian Oriental studies.

In particular he wrote, in Russian, histories of [[Islam]] (1904–12); of the Arabs, Turkey, Persia and their literatures, Dervish theosophy, and a study of the Semitic languages and peoples.<ref name="ieu"/> In the 1920s and 1930s he also wrote in Ukrainian histories of Turkey and Persia and their literatures; monographs on Hafiz and his songs and on the Turkic peoples, their languages, and literatures; and edited a collection of articles on the Crimean Tatars. With O. Boholiubsky he wrote a study of Arab higher education and the Arabian Academy of Sciences. During the last years of his life he wrote a six-volume history of the [[Khazar]]s, which was never published.<ref name="ieu"/>

Krymsky researched the history of the [[Ukrainian language]]. As he was an opponent of Aleksei Sobolevsky's claim that the language of the ancient [[Kyivan Rus’]] was more [[Russian language|Russian]], than Ukrainian,<ref name="history.org.ua" /> he wrote three polemical studies in 1904-07 on this question, later his views on the language of the Kyivan Rus were summarized in ''Українська мова, звідкіля вона взялася і як розвивалася'' ("The Ukrainian Language: Whence It Came and How It Developed"). Krymsky researched [[Ukrainian dialects]] and was actively involved in the work of standardizing the vocabulary and orthography of literary Ukrainian in the 1920s. In this activity he rejected the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galician]] orthographic tradition. He was the editor of the first two vols of the four-volume Russian-Ukrainian dictionary (1924–33) and of the Russian-Ukrainian dictionary of legal language (1926).<ref name="ieu"/>

Krymsky wrote three books of lyrical poetry and some [[novella]]s, and translated many Arabic and Persian literary works into Ukrainian, including [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|The Rubáiyát]] of [[Omar Khayyam]], [[One Thousand and One Nights]], and [[Hafez]]'s songs. He also translated the poetry of European writers such as [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Byron]], [[Sappho]], [[Friedrich Rückert]]. He published articles and reviews on Ukrainian writers, their works and on Ukrainian theater.<ref name="ieu"/>

As an ethnographer, Krymsky was an adherent of migration theory. He translated into Ukrainian and annotated [[William Alexander Clouston|W.A. Clouston]]'s ''Popular Tales and Fictions'' (1896) and also wrote many [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] works and articles about Ukrainian ethnographers.
