'''Lê Dũng Tráng''', (born 1947 in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]]) is a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]]-[[French people|French]] [[mathematician]].

== Life and work  ==
In the 1950s, Lê Dũng Tráng came to [[France]], where he attended the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in [[Paris]]. He obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. degree]] in 1969 and 1971 under the supervision of [[Claude Chevalley]] and [[Pierre Deligne]].<ref>{{MathGenealogyProject|id=23816}}</ref> From 1975 to 1999, he was professor at the [[University of Paris VII]] and research director of the [[CNRS]]. From 1983 to 1995 he was also a professor at the [[École Polytechnique]]. From 2002 to 2009 he headed the department of mathematics at the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]](ICTP), in [[Trieste]], Italy.

He was a frequent guest scientist at [[Harvard University]] (with [[Phillip Griffiths]]) and [[Northeastern University]] (with [[Terence Gaffney]], [[David B. Massey]]).

He is particularly concerned with singularity theory in the complex domain ([[Milnor map|Milnor fibrations]], [[Perverse sheaf|perverse sheaves]]).

In 2000 he was involved in promoting scientific exchange between the [[United States]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref>[http://users.ictp.it/~sci_info/News_from_ICTP/News_106/features_Vietnam.html ICTP News]</ref> For this, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology]] in 2004.<ref>[http://www.ictp.it/about-ictp/media-centre/news/news-archive/2004/11/le-dung-trang-awarded-honorary-degree.aspx ICTP release 2004]</ref> He is a Fellow of the [[Third World Academy of Sciences]].

His students include [[Hélène Esnault]] and [[Claude Sabbah]].
