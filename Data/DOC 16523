Title : Axel de Reuterskiöld
Text : Baron '''Axel de Reuterskiöld''' (Stockholm, 1860 – 7 March 1937, Lausanne), known as de Reuter to his friends, was a Swedish [[philatelist]] who signed the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] in 1921. He was an expert in the stamps of Switzerland. Together with the french banker and philatelist Paul Mirabaud he wrote the standard reference work: "Les Timbres Postes de la Suisse 1843-1860" which was published in 1899. The book is considered very well researched and the first published deep study of Swiss philately. In some fields the book is still considered a standard reference and has been the basis for many more modern or more particular enquiries into the field of the swiss classical issues. <ref>''[http://www.abps.org.uk/Awards/Roll_of_Distinguished_Philatelists/RDP_Background_20111231_LR.pdf Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011]'', Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011.
