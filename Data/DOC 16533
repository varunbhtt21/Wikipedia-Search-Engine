'''Inspiration Point Shelter House''' is an open-air [[pavilion]] located at Marion Samson Park in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].  Built in 1927, the pavilion stands on a limestone bluff facing south-southwest overlooking [[Lake Worth (Texas)|Lake Worth]] dam, an old [[fish hatchery]] and the [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth|Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base]].  The structure was designed in a style sometimes referred to as [[National Park Service Rustic]] or Parkitecture.  It was built primarily of [[limestone]].  On December 22, 1973 a fire destroyed the original roof.  The pavilion was restored in 2011.  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 31, 2014.
