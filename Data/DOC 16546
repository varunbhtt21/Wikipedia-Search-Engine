<s>Only played 1 game-and it was not even a complete game. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:28, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</s> '''Withdrawn by nominator'''-I'm withdrawing this as I misunderstood this thinking they needed to have a full game.

*'''Keep''' - the article clearly meets [[WP:NSPORT]], since he has played in a fully pro league and is far too young to qualify for the standard exception. [[User:Sir Sputnik|Sir Sputnik]] ([[User talk:Sir Sputnik|talk]]) 02:35, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''':For some reason I was thinking that they had to have played at least 1 full game. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 02:46, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Player has played in [[WP:FPL|fully professional league]], so passes [[WP:NFOOTY|NFOOTY]]. Needs improving to achieve [[WP:GNG|GNG]]. [[User:Fenix down|Fenix down]] ([[User talk:Fenix down|talk]]) 12:10, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
