'''Wilhelm Franz Karl Ludwig Dill''' (2 February 1848, [[Gernsbach]] - 24 October 1940, [[Karlsruhe]]) was a German ship and landscape painter who was a founding member of the [[Munich Secession]].

== Life and work ==
He was the only son of the Tax Assessor (later a Magistrate) for the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. The family moved several times, finally settling in [[Stuttgart]] in 1862.

Beginning in 1872, he studied architecture at the Polytechnic Institute (now the [[University of Stuttgart]]), then moved to the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], in 1874, where he studied under [[Karl Theodor von Piloty]] and [[Otto Seitz]]. He was, however, more influenced by the landscapes of [[Adolf Heinrich Lier]] and decided to pursue that speciality himself.

He did a great deal of travelling and the area around Venice (especially [[Chioggia]]) became one of his favorites for [[plein air]] painting. The [[impressionistic]] nature of the land and seascapes eventually led him to a sort of ornamental stylization, approaching [[Art Nouveau]].<ref>''Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen: Die Münchner Schule 1850-1914'', Munich (1979)</ref> He later became a founding member of the [[Munich Secession]] and served as its President from 1894 to 1899.

Of particular importance to his career was his friendship with [[Adolf Hölzel]], who ran an art school in [[Dachau (district)|Dachau]], the site of an [[Dachau art colony|artists' colony]]. The area, with its many moors and watercourses, was instantly attractive to Dill.<ref>Matthias Hamann: ''Ludwig Dill. Lebenserinnerungen'', Munich (2010)</ref> In 1896, he bought a small house there on a street which has since been named after him. Together with Hölzel and [[Arthur Langhammer]], he founded a group called "New Dachau".<ref name="CT">[[Carl Thiemann]]: ''Erinnerungen eises Dachauer Malers'', Dachau</ref>

In 1899, he accepted a teaching position at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe]], and remained there until 1919, spending his summers in Dachau.<ref name="CT" /> He also served on one of the committees that selected artists to provide designs for the [[Stollwerck]] chocolate company of [[Cologne]].<ref>Lorenz, Detlef: ''Reklamekunst um 1900. Künstlerlexikon für Sammelbilder'', Reimer-Verlag (2000) {{ISBN|3-496-01220-X}}</ref> His first wife died in 1905. Four years later, he married the painter [[Johanna Dill-Malburg|Johanna Malburg]], who had recently been widowed. In 1936, he became an [[Honorary citizen]] of Dachau.
