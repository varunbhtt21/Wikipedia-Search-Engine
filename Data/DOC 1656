The '''Eli Morse Farm''' is a historic farm on Lake Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  It is one of the earliest settlements in the town, settled by Eli Morse in 1764.  Morse served as a clerk of the community and left an invaluable record of Dublin's early history.  The main house of his {{convert|225|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm is a large Federal style brick structure built c. 1822 by Eli Morse's son Thaddeus.  Additions were made to the house in 1886, including a porch and front portico.  The farmstead includes several outbuildings, including a barn, grist mill, and several cottages.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83001135}}|title=NRHP nomination for Eli Morse Farm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>

The farm is also notable as the summer estate of [[New York City]] lawyer and diplomat [[Grenville Clark]], who acquired the property through his wife's family in 1914.  Clark organized a peace conference in 1945, held at this site, at which attendees drafted the [[Dublin Declaration]], calling for the [[United Nations]] to be created as a world government.  The Clark family continues to own the property, maintaining for agricultural and conservation purposes.<ref name=NRHP/>
