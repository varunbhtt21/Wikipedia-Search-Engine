'''Perang pandan''' (lit. pandan battle) is a [[Bali]]nese tradition of ritual combat with clubs made of pandan ([[Pandanus amaryllifolius]]). It is known in the [[Balinese language]] as ''mageret pandan'' or ''makare-kare''. Perang pandan is practiced by the [[Bali Aga]] population of [[Tenganan]] village in [[Karangasem Regency]], [[Indonesia]]. The people of Tenganan are devotees of the deity [[Indra]]. To honour [[Indra]] as a warrior god, many major religious festivals in Tenganan involve a ritualistic battle.<ref name="DM-McCann">{{cite news | newspaper = DailyMail | title = Fight club - Balinese style: Villagers beat each other with thorny leaves to pay respects to Hindu god of war | author = Jaymi McCann | date = 25 June 2013 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2348295/Fight-club--Balinese-style-Villagers-beat-thorny-leaves-pay-respects-Hindu-god-war.html}}</ref> 

==Legend==
The tradition of mageret pandan is said to have originated from [[Hindu mythology]] about King Maya Denawa and [[Indra]]. King Maya Denawa claimed himself a god greater than the entire Hindu pantheon. He forbade the people from performing their religious ceremonies, which angered the gods. Indra himself fought and defeated Maya Denawa for his blasphemy, and their battle was commemorated through mageret pandan ritual.<ref>{{cite web | title = Melihat Aneka Ritual Kesadaran Lingkungan di Desa Sosialis Tenganan Pegringsingan | date = 13 July 2016 | author = Luh De Suriyan | work = Mongabay indonesia | url = http://www.mongabay.co.id/2016/07/13/melihat-aneka-ritual-kesadaran-lingkungan-di-desa-sosialis-tenganan-pegringsingan/ | language = Indonesian}}</ref>

Among Tenganan people, mageret pandan is part of a month-full ceremony called 'Usabha Sambah', a ritual to honour the gods, especially Indra, and also to honor the ancestors, held every ''sasih Kalima'' â€” the fifth month on the Balinese calendar around June.<ref name="DM-McCann"/> The weapon used is a 15cm club made by tying 10-15 leaves of pandan together. Each of the leaves is edged with small sharp thorns. The shield is a [[rattan]] buckler. Techniques are mostly swinging strikes, but the competitors resort to scratching each other when in-fighting. Participants compete shirtless, wearing only a sarong (''kamen'') and traditional headdress (''udeng''). According to tradition, perang pandan is compulsory for Tenganan males. For the young, it serves as a rite of passage into manhood; children as young as seven have participated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ritualistic battle honors the ancestors |author=Anton Muhajir|location=Tenganan |date=18 June 2009|newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/06/18/ritualistic-battle-honors-ancestors.html}}</ref>

The blood shed during this ritual was meant as an offering to appease the gods.<ref name="Kompas-Perang Pandan">{{cite news | title = Menonton Perang Pandan di Desa Tenganan | work = Kompas.com | date = 17 July 2014 | author = Saiful Rohim | url = http://travel.kompas.com/read/2014/07/17/140800227/Menonton.Perang.Pandan.di.Desa.Tenganan | language = Indonesian}}</ref> The wounds suffered by participants were healed using traditional [[ointment]], made from a mixture of [[arrack]], [[turmeric]], [[galangal]] and other spices.<ref name="Kompas-Perang Pandan"/>
