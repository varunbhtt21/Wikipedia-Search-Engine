Wong was born in [[British Hong Kong]] to Ngan Kan and Fat Wong. His future wife, Carol Lu, introduced him to the LDS Church and he became a member in 1982. In 1983, Wong married Lu and they moved to [[Oahu]], where Wong attended [[Brigham Young University–Hawaii]] and obtained degrees in accounting and computer science.

The Wongs then returned to Hong Kong, where he founded a business and quality consulting company. He later received an [[MBA]] from the [[Open University of Hong Kong]].

In the LDS Church, Wong has also served as a [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]], [[stake president]] and [[area seventy]].
