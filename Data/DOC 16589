Time to flip back from Sci-fi lists to video game lists, and for once it's not [[Square Enix]]-related! If you thought ''[[Mass Effect]]'' was just a trilogy of AAA games that couldn't possibly support a list, think again- it's actually 6 games + expansions, 4 books, 2 art books, 11 comic books/book series, a movie, and 10 albums. More than enough to deserve its own list! I've pulled the formatting from other video game media featured lists I've done - mainly a mix of [[List of Final Fantasy video games|List of ''Final Fantasy'' video games]] and [[List of Dragon Quest media|List of ''Dragon Quest'' media]]. Thanks for reviewing! --'''[[User:PresN|<span style="color:green">Pres</span>]][[User talk:PresN|<span style="color:blue">N</span>]]''' 23:50, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support'''. I've made some edits in the intro to help it flow better, which you can remove if you'd like, but otherwise this list looks good to go. I will note that you may want to elaborate a little on the expansion packs - perhaps a sentence on each - but you aren't obligated to, and I'm also not sure "anime" is the proper term for ''Paragon Lost'' since its production was tainted by the unholy non-Japanese world (and the film's status as anime/regular animation is inconsistently used in its article).

*[[science fiction]] [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]]s - per [[WP:SEAOFBLUE]], this is a bit much. Nixing the link to video game would help, but 3 in a row is still a bit too much

'''<s>Comments</s> Support from Taylor Trescott'''
Not a whole lot to complain about here. Some minor nitpicky comments.
*"Minigame companion app to Mass Effect 3" - citation would be nice since there's no article
:*Added
*Would some Wikilinks be helpful? I'm not familiar with this series, so I don't know what a "hanar Spectre" is
:*Linked all characters to their section of the character article, and changed that bit to be "a fictional character featured in media inside the Mass Effect games" since there's no good article for hanar or Spectre.
*"July 24, 2013—July 23, 2014 (Ongoing)" - any reason why the date's backward?
:*It's not- 2013 is before 2014.

'''Comments by Favre1fan93'''
* '''Lead''': Second paragraph, repeated "such as" in the second sentence. Also, "was derided as inconsistent with the games, and the comics," change the 'and' to 'while'.
:*Fixed
* Any particular reason the printed material tables have small blue rows? I don't really feel they are necessary or are doing anything.
:*Removed
::*You left the ones right at the top of those tables, though I notice that presents a coloring if it is removed, as the header seems to flow to the first row. Aesthetically, having the blue rows do not look good in my opinion.
:::*Removed the blue- is that fine or would you want the little gap removed altogether?
::::*I think it is better. It would be ''ideal'' to remove it. But because of your formatting, you  would have a block of the light grey from the header into the first row, so it is not that big of an issue for me.
:::::*Alright, removed.
* Ongoing should not be used for ''Mass Effect Foundation''. That can have multiple meanings as a comic series. Ongoing generally means it is a series without a specified end, or (as it seems you are using it) that it is currently being published. I think you could possibly just remove that, as seeing the end date of July 24, 2014 would imply that it is still being published.
:*Removed
* Could the film section be changed to prose, as it is just one item? It might work better for that, though would be inconsistent with the rest of the content.
:*I'd rather keep it consistent with the rest of the article.
::*Sure.
* Any free media you could add to the article? 
:*There isn't, really, since it's a list of copyrighted media. There's a photo of the writer for the last two games and the comic books, but it just looks strange hanging out on its own, bumping one of the tables over. I usually don't use decorative images in my FLs.
::*That's fine. Just wondering.

;Review by JimmyBlackwing
Saw that you needed reviews, so here you go.
*First off, your lead sentence contradicts the article title. This is a list of Mass Effect media. Mass Effect is therefore a ''media franchise''; not a "series of [[science fiction]] [[video game]]s". 
*I also don't understand the "Microsoft Windows and a variety of consoles" line. Why single out Windows and give the others the "and the rest" treatment? It wasn't developed specifically for Windows, nor did it sell the best on Windows, nor was it known primarily as a Windows game. As I see it, you should either list every system or none of them. What you have now just makes no sense.
*The lead's second sentence is quite a snake, and it features a lot of unnecessary and/or vague words. Perhaps this rewrite?
:*"The core of the <s>series</s> ''franchise'' is <s>the</s> ''an'' eponymous trilogy of [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[third-person shooter]] video games <s>released on multiple platforms</s>, <s>starring</s> ''which follow'' <s>the character</s> [[Commander Shepard]]<s>, who is on mission</s> ''on his or her mission'' to save the galaxy from a race of mechanical beings known as the Reapers." (italics signify an addition)
*And sentence three is one of the biggest snakes I've ever seen. Another rewrite:
:*"<s>In addition to the main trilogy, the media of</s> The ''Mass Effect'' <s>series</s> ''franchise also'' includes three mobile games, each with a different gameplay style; four <s>books</s> ''novels'', written by [[Drew Karpyshyn]] and [[William C. Dietz]]; two art books; ten comic book<s>s</s> series or mini-comics and their anthologies, published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] <s>and all written wholly or in part by Mac Walters, the lead writer for ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''</s>; an animated film<s>, released in selected theaters in 2012 and through download</s>; and eleven soundtrack albums or singles."
*"The video games have sold very well" — The informality of this wording makes it feel like a violation of NPOV, even though I know it isn't one.
*Rewrite three:
:*"<s>The non-game</s> ''Reception of other'' media ''in the franchise'' <s>have</s> ''has'' <s>received a</s> ''been'' mixed <s>reception;</s>'':'' <s>some novels,</s> ''the comics, such as [[Mass Effect: Redemption]], have been praised for their writing, and novels such as'' <s>like</s> ''[[Mass Effect: Revelation]]''<s>,</s> have been recommended to fans of the game''s''<s>,</s>'';'' but ''[[Mass Effect: Deception]]'' was derided as inconsistent with the ''main trilogy''<s>games, while the comics, such as ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'', have been praised for their writing</s>."
::*Rewrote all of the above points following your guides; yeah, the writing on this one seems significantly worse than usual for me. --'''[[User:PresN|<span style="color:green">Pres</span>]][[User talk:PresN|<span style="color:blue">N</span>]]''' 18:01, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
:::*Looks pretty good, but there's a new problem. The first and second sentences now repeat that the Mass Effect franchise is based on BioWare's games. Even though they're blatantly redundant, both sentences offer different takes on the same information, so they can't be merged. It needs to be fixed, but I can't figure out how to do it without losing good content. Any ideas? [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 18:31, 1 July 2014 (UTC) 
*I'm not super comfortable with the way you've formatted the print media lists. You've bulleted standard stuff like the writers and publishers right next to your own summaries of the works. In my opinion, this makes it kind of unintuitive. It feels like spine-of-the-book stats should be listed in a more official-seeming way, like you did with the book ISBNs. However, you're the list expert here; I'm just throwing in my two cents.
::*I was trying to keep it the same as the video game boxes, which go "developed by A, published by B, Third-person shooter side story to ''Mass Effect 3''"; so the books go "written by A, published by B, A prequel story to ''Mass Effect''". There isn't really a standard format to these kind of things, since few people work in this area; pretty sure it's done differently in every FL, and I like this better than the way it's done at [[List of Final Fantasy media#Companion books]] or [[List of Dragon Quest media#Books and manga]]. I left writer/publisher in the bullet points primarily because if I pulled them up into the header there would just be one bullet left usually, and if I pulled that up it makes the whole thing really dense, especially on small screens. --'''[[User:PresN|<span style="color:green">Pres</span>]][[User talk:PresN|<span style="color:blue">N</span>]]''' 18:01, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
:::*I'm convinced. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 18:31, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
*Finally, is there anything more to be said about the soundtracks? They're sort of tossed in at the end, without any descriptions or fanfare.
::*Much like the soundtracks themselves, amusingly. I just followed the same format I used in [[List of Dragon Quest media]] and [[List of Chocobo media]]. What information do you think should be added? Composer(s), number of tracks, number of discs? --'''[[User:PresN|<span style="color:green">Pres</span>]][[User talk:PresN|<span style="color:blue">N</span>]]''' 18:01, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
:::*All of those sound good. Perhaps even collapsible track listings, if that's feasible and not considered cruft. The format as it stands feels a bit incomprehensive. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 18:31, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
A few things to fix, but nothing earth-shattering. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 07:37, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|JimmyBlackwing}} - I love this ping thing. Replied. --'''[[User:PresN|<span style="color:green">Pres</span>]][[User talk:PresN|<span style="color:blue">N</span>]]''' 18:01, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
::Nearly there; responded above. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 18:31, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
::: {{ping|JimmyBlackwing}} - Played with the first two sentences, and reworked the music table in the style of the other sections. --'''[[User:PresN|<span style="color:green">Pres</span>]][[User talk:PresN|<span style="color:blue">N</span>]]''' 22:13, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
::::I made a few further tweaks to the lead sentence. Looks fine to me now. I also like the new soundtrack setup, although there seems to be some kind of technical problem with it: the references jut out strangely. Since I assume you'll fix that, I'll go ahead and '''support''' now. Good work. [[User:JimmyBlackwing|JimmyBlackwing]] ([[User talk:JimmyBlackwing|talk]]) 23:13, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
