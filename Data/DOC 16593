The '''Virgen Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Viejo River]] near the town of El Hato de La Virgen in [[Matagalpa Department]], [[Nicaragua]]. The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and it supports the {{convert|50|MW|abbr=on}} [[run-of-the-river]] '''Carlos Fonesca (Santa Barbara) Plant'''. The dam and power station were completed in 1972. Water from the dam is diverted along the left bank of the river through a {{Convert|2.7|km|adj=on}} long channel before being piped underground over {{Convert|4.8|km|abbr=on}} to the power plant near Santa Barbara on the Viejo River. The plant contains two {{convert|25|MW}} [[Francis turbine]]-generators.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.enel.gob.ni/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=20 | title=Hydro | publisher=Empresa Nicaragüense de Electricidad (ENEL) | accessdate=29 April 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref> The difference in elevation between the dam and power station affords a [[hydraulic head]] (water drop) of {{Convert|187|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.esmap.org/sites/esmap.org/files/Nicaragua_Policy%20Strategy%20for%20the%20Promotion%20of%20RE_Yoo.pdf | title=Nicaragua: Policy Strategy for the Promotion  of Renewable Energy: Situation and  Perspective of Hydroelectric Generation | publisher=National Energy Commission, Energy Sector Management Assistance Program | date=January 2006 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | pages=75}}</ref>  In 1998 heavy rains and flooding from [[Hurricane Mitch]] severely damaged the [[Mancotal Dam|Mancotal]] and El Dorado Dams, over-topping their [[spillway]]s and nearly destroying the dams.
