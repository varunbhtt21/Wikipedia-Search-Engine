'''Comment'''. BDD, you seem a little equivocal on this. On the one hand you say there is no point tracking minor league players, on the other hand in a previous RfD recently (you know I am hopeless at finding these things) you have said it is usual to direct players to the teams they are playing in if there is no more information on them. Now I may have you confused with someone else saying that, in which case I put my apologies in advance! But you can't have it both ways. I appreciate that the player no longer plays for that team, but the implication of redirecting players to the teams they play in is this constant maintenance to which you object.

To make an analogy: Do we redirect minor actors to the plays they are currently playing in? I don't think they do: as you said they are either notable and should have an article (or redlink) or they are not, and so not. But you can't have it both ways. I apologise again if it wasn't you who made the opinion of directing players to teams, I shall try to find it but others are much better than me at it. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 12:34, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

If I recall correctly it was an American ice-hockey player who played in college league and was deemed not notable, but the closing comments (probably not by BDD) were that it is common to direct  the players to the league. He was the brother of someone else, presumably a more notable player. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 12:36, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:If a person is only discussed on one page, it's logical for their name to redirect there in many cases. Once there are two potential targets, which do you choose? It often makes more sense to delete at that point. I probably wouldn't create redirects like this at all, but once they're created, that's how I approach them. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 17:06, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' not a stable redirect, and should be replaced with an article (if notable) or deleted. There's no more than a mention in the article, and if still mentioned there (or in another article), a search will find it.

This doesn't seem to me like a good candidate for a [[WP:CNR]]. I recommend retargeting to the essay [[Wikipedia:Ignore all precedent]], a more logical target. [[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 16:42, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Delete''' per BDD. It's not a rather useful [[WP:CNR]].

*'''Keep as is''' - This is commonly used by [[WP:AUSTRALIA]] and has been for over 7 years. I note the project hasn't been notified of this discussion. [[Wikipedia:Ignore all precedent]] is a little known essay created and edited almost exclusively by a single editor only 7 months ago.

Nonsense, and likely WP:RFD#8. Not a term used to refer to [[The Flintstones]] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=flintstone-like&oq=flintstone-like&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j0l2j69i60j0.2239j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8 Google search] produces no evidence of usage outside of referring to architecture that resembles the house of the Flintstones.

With both [[Scott Nearing]] and [[Helen Nearing]] having articles, it makes no sense to have a redirect from a title mentioning both to one. (This has significant history that is likely needed for attribution. I don't know what should happen to this- in a similar case, someone recommended to move the history to a talk subpage.)

*deletion may be an option, we dont have a [[Bill and Hillary Clinton]]. we certainly will not maintain three articles about the same topic.

:*'''Comment'''. While we're at it, isn't category "Married Couple" somewhat a redun name: I should suggest renaming to "Married people" but have no idea how to do that.
