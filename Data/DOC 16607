*'''Delete'''. Created on 24 July 2011 by [[User:Kenny Strawn]], it is only linked on that user's page (not any pages in article space). The user last edited on 31 July 2012 and the account is indefinitely blocked, presumably (looking through the user's edit history) for continual vandalism. This is not vandalism as such, but the user is unlikely to respond here, and I don't see the point of this; presumably the URI scheme is only applicable to Google Chrome.

:It could be [[considered harmful]] by setting a precedent that it is acceptable to have URIs/URLs as article titles. Also, in theory it could interfere with WP's own namespace scheme that we have namespace prefix + colon + resource, this is not true for [[Chrome:]] right now but would be true e.g. for [[File:]] (which I note is not treated as a Wikilink if it has nothing after the colon, as you see: I've written both in the source as open bracket, open bracket, namespace, colon, close bracket, close bracket &mdash; no tricks). I can't find a policy for this, neither [[WP:Page name]] nor [[WP:Linking]] seem to cover it; if not careful it can be difficult to link to since it might be parsed as an external URL: [[http://bert.fegg.com]] is, for example. (again no tricks there, the source says <nowiki>[[http://bert.fegg.com]]).</nowiki> [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 12:53, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:On the other hand, [[about:blank]] exists as a redirect to [[about URI scheme]], presumably if MediaWiki/EN:WP came up with an "about" namespace then one or other would be broken. For that reason I suppose '''<nowiki>{{fullurl:}}</nowiki>''' is not a real template but a special case to the MediaWiki software.  To throw in a nonexistent one on purpose [[SimonTrew:wonderful]] is treated as a redlink and so is [[SimonTrew:]] and [[SimonTrew://wonderful]]; I guess the WikiMedia parser ''first'' does the namespace prefix by finding a colon and then backtracking among the alphanumerics as somewhat indeterminate LR(n) parser, and then decides what to do with it, and if it is an unrecognised namespace treats it as a normal link, but that is just my guessing since I have no knowledge of what parsing strategy is used and I imagine over the years it has acquired lots of edge/corner cases for backwards compatibility. e.g. I can imagine (and this is just guessing, I am keen to stress), the parser says "if it is a two-letter namespace prefix treat it as an Interwiki link".

Pickle used to have two entries for pickling, but I've gotten rid of them and just put a hatnote in [[Pickling]] instead. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 13:18, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

: OK for me, [[User:Cacycle|Cacycle]] ([[User talk:Cacycle|talk]]) 19:12, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. The redirect doesn't link to a disambiguation page that specifically refers to the term "Pickling". Also, there are currently only two articles on the English Wikipedia that are specifically known as "Pickling", and the hatnote currently on [[Pickling]] prevents confusion. Deletion seems like the best answer for this redirect, for the time being.

*'''Keep''' Just add a subheader in the see also section called "Pickling" and target that section. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.206|65.94.171.206]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.206|talk]]) 08:44, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete <s>and reinstate</s>'''. It's a bit of a [[fait accompli]], though. We should just reinstate the [[Pickling]] and [[Pickling (metal)]] at the [[Pickle]] DAB. In English there is no noun that cannot be verbed. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 12:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' those entries were already added to the [[see also]] at the DAB [[Pickle]], with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pickle&diff=prev&oldid=606933272 this edit by 65.94 on 3 May]. I don't understand why to bring something to discussion then just [[ploughman's pickle]] on regardless; and I know I am not the only one.

:::{{ping|65.94.171.206}} You're right. The point stands but I shouldn't have attributed it to you: I checked up and cocked up. Sorry. The point stands, though, of things moving under one's feet. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 16:21, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
