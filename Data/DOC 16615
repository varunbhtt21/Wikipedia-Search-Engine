Title : Karen Lafferty
Text : '''Karen Lafferty''' (born February 29, 1948) is an American [[Contemporary Christian music]]ian from [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]].

Lafferty graduated from [[Eastern New Mexico University]] and unsuccessfully attempted to join a [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] musical ensemble shortly after.<ref name=powell>Mark Allan Powell, ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music''. Hendrickson Publishers, 2002, pp. 507-508.</ref> Intending to pursue a career in secular music, she moved to southern California, soon beginning to perform at [[Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa]]. She toured the Netherlands as an opener for [[Children of the Day]] in 1973 and released her debut album on [[Maranatha! Music]] two years later. Following the release of her second album, ''Sweet Communion'', she toured Europe as a headlining act.<ref name=powell/>

While on tour, Lafferty noted how popular American music was, even though, for most professional American musicians, touring Europe was not financially viable. In response she founded Musicians for Missions in 1981, under the ministry of Youth With A Mission (YWAM) Holland. This organization sought to train young Christian musicians for mission tours where they could perform live shows.<ref name=powell/> She later moved to [[Amsterdam]] to direct the organization.

Lafferty is the author of the [[Contemporary worship music|praise and worship]] song "[[Seek Ye First]]", first released on a 1974 Maranatha compilation.
