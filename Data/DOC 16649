'''[[New Jersey Route 41|Route 41]]''' is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. It runs {{convert|14.08|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from the five-way intersection of [[New Jersey Route 47|Route 47]] (Delsea Drive), County Route 603 (Fairview-Sewell Road/Blackswood-Barnsboro Road), and County Route 630 (Egg Harbor Road), also known as Five Points, in [[Deptford Township, New Jersey|Deptford Township]], [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester County]] to the southern terminus of County Route 611 in [[Maple Shade, New Jersey|Maple Shade]], [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]], just north of the Route 41's interchanges with [[New Jersey Route 38|Route 38]] and [[New Jersey Route 73|Route 73]]. The route is a two- to four-lane suburban road that passes through several communities, including [[Runnemede, New Jersey|Runnemede]], [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]], and [[Cherry Hill Township, New Jersey|Cherry Hill Township]]. Between the intersection with [[New Jersey Route 168|Route 168]] in Runnemede and [[New Jersey Route 154|Route 154]] in Cherry Hill Township, Route 41 is maintained by [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] and is also signed as '''County Route 573'''.

Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to run from Route 47 in [[Fairview, Gloucester County, New Jersey|Fairview]], Deptford Township to Route 38 in [[Moorestown, New Jersey|Moorestown]]. Originally, the route was intended to bypass [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]], however this bypass was never fully completed and Route 41 was signed along a temporary county-maintained alignment that also became County Route 573. The northern part of this bypass was completed and became [[New Jersey Route 154|Route 154]] in 1953. The road has seen many changes including the replacement of the [[traffic circle]] with Routes 38 and 73 with an interchange that involved realigning Route 41 around the original circle in 1960 and the replacement of the [[Ellisburg Circle]] at [[New Jersey Route 70|Routes 70]] and 154 with a signalized intersection in the early 1990s. The temporary alignment of Route 41 along County Route 573 was made permanent in the early 2000s.
