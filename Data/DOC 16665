Rewriting would be preferable, but if no one volunteers to do this then the whole biography could be deleted.

:*[[File:Pictogram voting keep.svg|20px]] '''Article cleaned''' by investigator or others. No remaining infringement. I'm going to try not rev-deleting this one, especially since it's semi-protected. We'd be talking about many hundreds of edits. This means I need to keep an eye on it for a while for reversion. Watchlisted. [[User:Psychonaut]], I'd guess you're probably watching it, too. If the summaries are put back, and I miss it, I'd be really grateful if you drop a note at my talk page. :) --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 12:02, 2 June 2014 (UTC)<br>

*:Has Wikipedia changed so much that no one thought to ''rewrite'' the summaries to as to not infringe on copyright? Was reverting them out with a blanket template the right answer here? Templating seems less like a solution and more like asking the problem to crop up again and again, here and elsewhere. - [[User:Jack Sebastian|Jack Sebastian]] ([[User talk:Jack Sebastian|talk]]) 20:47, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*::Yes, prompting editors to rewrite the summaries is exactly what the template is for.  The template hides the infringing material, but preserves it in the page history for a few days, so that interested and knowledgeable editors can refer to it to perform the rewrite.  If you are such an editor, perhaps you could volunteer to do so?  As you might have seen, we have quite a backlog of copyright problems to sort out.  —[[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] ([[User talk:Psychonaut|talk]]) 20:50, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
