'''[[Interstate 476]]''' ('''I-476''') is a {{convert|132.10|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary]] [[Interstate Highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]] designated between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] near [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] and [[Interstate 81]] near [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], serving as the primary northâ€“south Interstate corridor through eastern Pennsylvania. It consists of both the {{convert|20|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the "'''Blue Route'''" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban [[Philadelphia]]-area counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the {{convert|110.6|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] (the [[Schuylkill Expressway]]) in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|West Conshohocken]], Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] near [[Hickory Run State Park]].

While proposed as early as 1929, the construction of the Mid-County Expressway through did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1991 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it "the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history." In order to get the route through Delaware County, it was built with many environmental compromises such as a [[parkway]] design and four lanes south of the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange. The Mid-County Expressway received its "Blue Route" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.

Following the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States. In fact, it is longer than some main-line interstates such as [[Interstate 83]] in [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 12]] in [[Louisiana]], [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]] and [[Interstate 97]] in Maryland. Additionally, its numbering is unusual since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs.
