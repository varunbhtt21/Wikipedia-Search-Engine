The '''Fort Tryon Jewish Center''' is a synagogue located at 524 [[Fort Washington Avenue]] between [[183rd Street (Manhattan)|West 183rd]] and [[184th Street (Manhattan)|184th]] Streets, across from [[Bennett Park (New York City)|Bennett Park]] in the [[Hudson Heights, Manhattan|Hudson Heights]] neighborhood of [[Upper Manhattan]], [[New York City]].<ref name=tablet/>

The congregation was founded in 1938 by long-time residents of the city and refugees from Nazi Germany. It first occupied leased space, building a modest facility in 1950, and then a spacious sanctuary that opened in 1960,<ref name=ftjc/> designed by N. J. Sapienza in the [[Modernist architecture|Modernist style]].<ref>{{cite fromatoz}}, p.59</ref> The [[Torah Ark]] in the  building has been described as "a gem of midcentury design."<ref name=chaban/>

From 2002 on, the congregation grew as young families moved into the neighborhood.<ref name=jewishweek/>

==Failed real estate deal==
In an April 2014 article, the ''[[New York Times]]'' described a failed real estate transaction involving the Fort Tryon Jewish Center.<ref name=chaban/> The congregation signed an agreement with Rutherford Thompson of Thompson Development, which planned to build a 23-story condominium building to be called "One Bennett Park".<ref name=chaban/> Under the agreement, the developer would pay to completely renovate the synagogue in exchange for [[air rights]] and the right to situate a [[Fort Washington Avenue (Manhattan)|Fort Washington Avenue]] entrance to the residential tower on the congregation's property.<ref name=chaban/> According to ''The Real Deal'' magazine, a lawsuit filed in 2010 alleged that Thompson defaulted on the loan in February 2008.<ref name=realdeal/> The synagogue was left in an unusable state, resulting in ongoing litigation, during which time the congregation met at [[Mother Cabrini High School]],<ref name=chaban/> and its successor since September 2014, [[Success Academy Charter Schools|Success Academy Washington Heights]]. Since July 2015, the congregation has met in the Social Hall of the Hebrew Tabernacle at 551 Fort Washington Ave.<ref>[http://ftjc.org/ Fort Tryon Jewish Center website] Accessed: May 11, 2016</ref>
