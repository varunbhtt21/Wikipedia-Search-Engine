The '''Tumarín Dam''' is a 60 meter tall, concrete [[gravity dam]] planned for construction on the [[Río Grande de Matagalpa]] just upstream of the town of Tumarín in the [[South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]], [[Nicaragua]]. It is located about {{Convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of San Pedro del Norte, where the Río Grande de Matagalpa meets the [[Tuma River]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mem.gob.ni/media/file/ELECTRICIDAD%20Y%20RECURSOS/Perfil%20Hidroelectrico%20Tumarin.pdf | title=Perfil Central Hidroeléctrica Tumarín | publisher=Ministerio deEnergía y Minas | accessdate=29 April 2014 | language=Spanish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430054044/http://www.mem.gob.ni/media/file/ELECTRICIDAD%20Y%20RECURSOS/Perfil%20Hidroelectrico%20Tumarin.pdf | archivedate=30 April 2014 | df= }}</ref> First announced in March 2010, construction was expected to take four years, but there have been many delays.
