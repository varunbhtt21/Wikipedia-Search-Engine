'''[[Maryland Route 151|Maryland&nbsp;Route&nbsp;151]]''' (MD&nbsp;151) is a [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Maryland]]. Known for most of its length as North Point Boulevard, the state highway runs {{convert|10.80|mi|km}} from 7th Street in [[Sparrows Point, Maryland|Sparrows Point]] north to [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;1]] (US&nbsp;1) in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. MD&nbsp;151 is a four- to six-lane divided highway that connects the communities of [[Edgemere, Maryland|Edgemere]] and [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] on the Patapsco River Neck peninsula of southeastern [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]] with industrial areas in Sparrows Point and East Baltimore. MD&nbsp;151 was originally constructed in the early 1920s from Sparrows Point to Edgemere. The highway was connected to Baltimore by the Baltimore County portion of [[Maryland Route 20|MD&nbsp;20]], a number also assigned to the highway from [[Rock Hall, Maryland|Rock Hall]] to [[Chestertown, Maryland|Chestertown]] in [[Kent County, Maryland|Kent County]]. During World War II, MD&nbsp;151 was extended north through Dundalk on a new divided highway parallel to MD&nbsp;20 and through East Baltimore on an expanded Erdman Avenue to connect the [[Bethlehem Steel]] complex at Sparrows Point with [[Maryland Route 150|MD&nbsp;150]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US&nbsp;40]]. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Interstate&nbsp;695]] (I-695) was constructed parallel to MD&nbsp;151 between Edgemere and [[Maryland Route 157|MD 157]] in Dundalk.
