|Article = NTERA-2
|Purpose = I want to provide a visual explanation of the differentiation of NTERA-2 cells into neuronal precursor cells, which is the primary characteristic of NTERA-2 cells and their main purpose in research. In order to provide the most comprehensive explanation of this subject to the average Wikipedia reader, an image is necessary to avoid using scientific jargon.
|Replaceability = No free media of this subject exists.
|Minimality = Image is cropped from the original image and at a much lower resolution.
