== Musical career ==

His interest in music and percussion started at a very young age, when growing up in [[Bedford Stuyvesant]], Brooklyn, during the 1960s. According to his mother, his talents in percussion started as early as pre-school with drumming on desks and furniture, occasionally to the extent of disrupting class.<ref name="Spectrasonics"/>

Growing up in the 1960s and 70s, he pulled musical influence from a number of popular movements, musicians and percussionists of the time. Those include Sly, Hendrix, Cream, The Panthers, and artists such as Airto, Big Black, Tito Puente, Ralph McDonald, Bill Summers, Paulinho DaCosta, Miles, James Brown and Bootsy were also strong influences on the young Bashiri Johnson.<ref name=Drummerszone>{{cite web|title=Drummerszone.com Bashiri Johnson Biography|url=http://www.drummerszone.com/artists/profile/1687/bashiri-johnson#biography-tab|work=Drummerszone|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="The Last Miles">{{cite web|last=Cole|first=George|title=Interview: Bashiri Johnson|url=http://www.thelastmiles.com/interviews-bashiri-johnson.php|work=TheLastMiles.com|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref><br />
 
Formal percussion education took a number of forms for Johnson, including high school bands, lessons at Jazzmobile, lessons at the Dance Theater of Harlem, and with Olatunji.<ref name="The Last Miles"/> A three-year mentorship with Mtume also served as a hallmark of his early education and career. The time spent with Mtume during the 1970s taught Johnson not only the art of percussion, but the world of the music business and session recording. It led to his first professional session on “Watcha Gonna Do With My Lovin’” by Stephanie Mills, which went gold.<ref name="Drummerszone"/><ref name="The Last Miles"/>

His career grew rapidly in the 1970s and 80s, and Johnson was able to contribute to other gold records by artists such as Luther Vandross, and Madonna. Since then, Johnson has been recorded on hundreds of records, worked with some of the most well-known artists, and performed for some major political figures. Notably, he performed in Whitney Houston’s band for 20 years, was a percussionist for Michael Jackson in the "This Is It" band. He has performed for Nelson Mandela in South Africa, as well as at the 2013 Presidential Inauguration.<ref name=LP>{{cite web|title=Bashiri Johnson Biography|url=http://www.lpmusic.com/artists/artist/BashiriJohnson/|work=LPmusic.com|accessdate=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430073821/http://www.lpmusic.com/artists/artist/BashiriJohnson/|archive-date=30 April 2014|dead-url=yes}}</ref><ref name=DrumMagazine>{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Matt|title=Bashiri Johnson: Session Specialist|url=http://www.drummagazine.com/hand-drum/post/bashiri-johnson-nyc-session-specialist/|work=Drum!
