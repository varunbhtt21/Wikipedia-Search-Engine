== Distribution and habitat==
The species is native to the northwest [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]], with a range extending from [[Belle Isle (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Belle Isle]] and the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] to [[New Jersey]].<ref name=FB>{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.us/summary/4117 |title=''Myoxocephalus aenaeus'' (Mitchill, 1814) Grubby |author=Froese, Rainer |website=FishBase |accessdate=29 April 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1656/1092-6194(2001)008%5B0207:AAPHOT%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |title=APPEARANCE AND POSSIBLE HOMING OF TWO SPECIES OF SCULPINS IN MAINE TIDEPOOLS |author=John R.

==Reproduction and development==
Spawning season for the grubby begins in winter and extends into spring. Spawning begins in coastal waters and later occurs in offshore oceanic waters. The spawning in coastal waters has been reported to occur only in winter and early spring. Parts of the central Atlantic only allow for spawning times between February and May, but judging by larval presence in the Middle Atlantic Blight, spawning occurs there from March until June.<ref>Roseman, Edward.
