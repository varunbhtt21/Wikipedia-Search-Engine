'''Ying-Cheng Lai''' is a Chinese theoretical physicist who works in the area of chaos theory. He  is one among the pioneers in the nonlinear and complex systems and chaos theory. Currently he works in Arizona State University holding an ISS Chair Professorship.

==Research areas==

Ying-Cheng Lai has worked in the fields of dynamics of nonlinear and complex systems including [[Chaos Theory|chaotic dynamics]], [[Quantum chaos|relativistic quantum chaotic dynamics]], [[complex networks]], [[computational biology]] and  [[graphene]] physics. He has coauthored several scientific articles with  [[Celso Grebogi]], [[Edward Ott]], [[James A. Yorke]] and [[Miguel Angel Fernández Sanjuán|Miguel A. F. Sanjuán]]. He has directed 19 Ph.D. and 20 master theses and supported 14 post-doctoral fellows.

==Awards==
In 1997, From the White House, he had received  the Air Force Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) . 
Also in the same year  the National Science Foundation honored  him  with a Faculty Career Award. In 2008, he received the Outstanding Referee Award from the American Physical Society.
In 2016, he was chosen as the 2016 class of National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellows, Pentagon officials announced. This program awards grants to top-tier researchers from U.S. universities to conduct long-term, unclassified, basic research of strategic importance to the Defense Department.<ref>http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/704082/dod-announces-national-security-science-and-engineering-faculty-fellows</ref>
