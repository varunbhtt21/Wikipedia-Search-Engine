The '''Eli Morse Sawmill Foundations''' are the surviving remnant of the first industrial site in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  The site is located astride a stream, near an old logging road, south of Old Marlborough Road, not far from the [[Eli Morse Farm]].  It consists of four foundation walls made of dry laid granite boulders.  The northern wall measures about {{convert|10|ft|m}}, and the others measure about {{convert|23|ft|m}}.  To the west of the main mill's foundations are smaller foundations of extensions  or outbuildings.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004056}}|title=NRHP nomination for Eli Morse Sawmill Foundations|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>

The foundations are the only surviving elements of a sawmill erected c. 1765 by Eli Morse, one of Dublin's first settlers and a prominent civic participant in the town's affairs.  The proprietors of the town offered Morse financial incentives to build the mill in 1764.  The mill was operated by Morse and later his son Peter, who died in an accident at the site.  The mill is known to have ceased operation by 1886.<ref name=NRHP/>

The mill site was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.<ref name="nris"/>
