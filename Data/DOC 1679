'''Agency''' (also '''Choctaw Agency''') is a [[ghost town]] located in [[Oktibbeha County, Mississippi]], United States.

Established in the early 1800s as a trading post with the [[Choctaw]] people, the community today is a rural crossroads.

==History==
Agency began as a government trading post established to maintain contact with the Choctaw people.<ref name="Jacobson">{{cite book | last = Jacobson | first = Judy | title = Alabama and Mississippi Connections: Historical and Biographical Sketches of Families who Settled on Both Sides of the Tombigbee River | publisher = Genealogical Publishing Company | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QLAdK0_myJwC&lpg=PR1&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 25, 38, 39}}</ref>  The post was located on Robinson Road, about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the [[Noxubee River]].<ref name="Halbert">{{cite web | last = Halbert | first = H.S. | title = The Last Indian Council on Noxubee River | publisher = Mississippi Historical Society | year = 1901 | url = http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook_text/Publications_of_the_Mississippi_Historical_Society_v4_1000473765/273 | access-date = 2014-04-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140424161459/http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook_text/Publications_of_the_Mississippi_Historical_Society_v4_1000473765/273 | archive-date = 2014-04-24 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}</ref>  Robinson Road connected the cities of [[Columbus, Mississippi|Columbus]], [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], and is the second oldest road in Mississippi.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cole | first = James S. | title = Oktibbeha County | publisher = Arcadia | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UbIyYb2sN0kC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 111}}</ref>

Government workers were employed at Agency as early as 1813,<ref name="Jacobson"/> and Colonel Ward was in charge.  Ward's house fronted the north side of Robinson Road, and consisted of two large rooms made of hewn logs.  The cellar was made of brick, and was described as a "dungeon" used to confine fugitive slaves.  Slaves who fled plantations in Mississippi and Alabama would seek asylum with the Choctaw people.  The Choctaw, themselves slave owners, would deliver the fugitives to Colonel Ward, who would lock them in stocks in his cellar.  The early settlement also had a storehouse, blacksmith shop, and stables.<ref name="Halbert"/>

The agency house was abandoned in 1832, and the building was demolished in the 1840s.<ref name="Halbert"/>

The Choctaw council house was situated on the east bank of Noxubee river, about {{convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Agency, just north of the county line.  The place later became known as "Council Bluff".<ref name="Halbert"/>

By the 1850s, Agency had flourished as a stagecoach stop, and had exceeded nearby [[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville]] in trade.  [[Jefferson Davis]] spoke at the community center in Agency in the 1850s.<ref name="Jacobson"/>

Agency had a school,<ref>{{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Joy | title = Oktibbeha County MsArchives Biographies: Carroll, Thomas Battle 1860 - 1923 | publisher = USGenWeb | date = February 29, 2012 | url = http://files.usgwarchives.net/ms/oktibbeha/bios/carroll17gbs.txt}}</ref> a post office by 1854,<ref>{{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Thomas | title = A New and Complete Gazetteer of the United States | publisher = Lippincott, Grambo & Company | year = 1854 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_5s6AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 286}}</ref> a Masonic [[Grand Lodge]] from 1861 to 1872,<ref>{{cite web | title = Lodges Under the Jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Mississippi | publisher = Grand Lodges | url = http://www.icrr.net/lodgelist2.htm | accessdate = 30 October 2016}}</ref> and one of Oktibbeha County's three "dens" of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Brown | first = F.Z. | title = Reconstruction in  Oktibbeha County | publisher = Mississippi Historical Society | year = 1913 | url = https://archive.org/stream/reconstructionin00brow/reconstructionin00brow_djvu.txt}}</ref>

John J. Walker and his wife Marie lived in Agency during the mid-1800s.  A letter addressed to "Mrs. John J. Walker, Choctaw Agency, Oktibbeha County, Mississippi" has been preserved in the archive at Mississippi State University Library.  The stamped envelope, however, was made public and sold for $21,000.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Peter Sharrer Collection of Confederate Postmasters' Provisionals | publisher = StampAuctionCentral | url = http://stampauctionnetwork.com/y/y10358.cfm | accessdate = 30 October 2016}}</ref>

By 1870, Agency had a population of 4,170 people.  Around that time, the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] completed a line {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} east of Agency.  Without railway access, the town's prosperity was undermined, and by 1887, Agency's last store closed.  In 1894, its last doctor moved to Starkville.<ref name="Jacobson"/>  By 1900, Agency had a population of 30,<ref name="Rowland">{{cite book | last = Rowland | first = Dunbar | title = Mississippi: Comprising Sketches of Counties, Towns, Events, Institutions, and Persons, Arranged in Cyclopedic Form | publisher = Southern Historical Publishing Association | year = 1907 | url = https://www.familysearch.org/library/books/records/item/548960-redirection | volume = 1 | page = 40}}</ref> and in 1905, its post office closed.<ref>{{gnis|712288|Agency Post Office (historical)}}</ref>

Agency today is covered by forest, and there are some homes on Robinson Road.
