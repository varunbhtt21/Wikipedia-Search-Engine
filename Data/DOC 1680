:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The only (minor) issue here is that the "Cities and towns" section has no references - there should be at least one inline citation. Otherwise, everything is okay: recently fivefold expanded, within policy, interesting hooks with citations. [[User:97198|97198]] ([[User talk:97198|talk]]) 10:53, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I have removed the statistics, it is now a simple list of names, which doesn't require a citation per [[WP:CITE]].
