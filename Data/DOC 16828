I had this as a deletion-but upon searching for any info-all I could find was a link to a list of books, nothing for the author either. All I can figure out that its a non fictional book with mythology.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 00:56, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' neither the book nor the author seem to have anything written about them.  There is no claim of notability in the article (stub). It's a pity that the original author of the article has not edited since April, as it would be nice to know the full name of the author and around when the original was published. The book does not seem to be held in many libraries. [http://indcat.inflibnet.ac.in/bookdetailview.jsp?infControlId=4802910&field=ix_author&term=Chandra_Shekhar&TotRec=15/22&scode=1 This bibliographic record] shows the author as: Chandra Shekhar and the title as: Surjan Charit mahakavyam with commentary and translation into English by Chander Dhar Sarma Sastriyana. There was a Chandra Shekhar, 1927-2007, who wrote about politics and social change, but it does not look like the same Chandra Shekhar. The title seems to also appear as ''Surjan Charit Mahakavya'' and it is [http://www.uok.ac.in/Userfiles/Documents/syllabus-13-14/pg/01/M.Phil.History.pdf mentioned] as a non-Persian source for medieval Indian history. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 09:18, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak Delete''', I wasn't able to find anything but the usual routine listings for this book.  "Weak" because there may be sources in Indian languages that I can't read, but otherwise I largely agree with [[User:Bejnar]] above.
