== Can't get my password ==

I have forgotten my password.  When I click on the forgot password link and type in my email address, it appears to work, but I never receive the reset email.  So I can't get logged in any more.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.184.156.59|76.184.156.59]] ([[User talk:76.184.156.59|talk]]) 00:50, 24 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::Aspro, our queriant hasn't got access to his/her account, at present, so is posting anonymously. I take it, OP, that you didn't create a [[Template:User_committed_identity|confirmed identity]]? [[User:Csmiller|CS Miller]] ([[User talk:Csmiller|talk]]) 12:31, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

::*? The OP has been editing anon since 23 February 2014. Is it not reasonable to assume that they did not create and account in the first place? The anonymous OP 76.184.156.59  now appears to be up and running again, only as this time,  he is  anonymous 76.184.156.59 (do I hear an echo?). ''(Never mind. I created a new account.)''

Maybe an admin with more diplomatic skill than I can muster, may like to take him undertake their wing to guide him on how to create a proper account – should he so wish to. --[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] ([[User talk:Aspro|talk]]) 16:57, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

== Google custom date range disappears ==

Forgive me if this has been covered before. In the last day or so I appear to have lost the ability to customize dates when searching for content on Google using Opera. The menus have changed too, with a sidebar appearing on the left of the page, and some of the options, such as customise range (allowing a date specific search, eg, 2012) disappearing. Strangely though it hasn't changed on  through Chrome or Internet Explorer. Is there any way to tweak Opera so I can switch back to the previous version of Google, or am I stuck with it? Thanks.
