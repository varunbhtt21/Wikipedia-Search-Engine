== Nonhuman vocal flexibility (or, what does the fox NOT say?) ==

According to [http://www.redfoxes.org/upclose/voicescarry.shtml these] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6NuhlibHsM sources], foxes produce an extraordinarily wide variety of calls, and can imitate the calls of a wide variety of prey species. Maybe it's no coincidence that humans also have this ability, and that humans and foxes are among the least-endangered species of [[apex predator]]? Have studies tested whether the diversity of sounds a species can articulate is correlated with its position on the food chain or its modern conservation status? [[User:NeonMerlin|<span style="background:#000;color:red;border:#0f0 solid;border-width:1px 0">Neon</span>]][[User talk:NeonMerlin|<span style="background:#0f0;color:#000;border:red solid;border-width:1px 0">Merlin</span>]] 03:50, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:[[Mimicry]] can be an important survival skill, but sound mimicry is only one type, and there are many other survival skills besides mimicry. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 12:52, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:When you consider the survival of foxes in an increasingly hostile world, there are many aspects to their lifestyle that make them well suited - for example, they are omnivores - this allows them to easily switch food sources be highly adaptable to environmental changes.   They also have a reputation for high intelligence.   Mostly though, their ability to survive in places where humans dominate means that they are less inclined to suffer when we encroach on their territory.  So why would you imagine that (of all things) vocal range has anything to do with it?   There are many more things that are by far more likely to be the dominant reason for their continued success.  [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] ([[User talk:SteveBaker|talk]]) 13:33, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::Agreed, vocalization is not likely to be a big factor. Usually, [[Animal_communication#Auditory]] is more inflected and complex in [[social]] species, e.g. [[cetacean]]s, [[birds]], [[simian]]s, [[canid]]s, etc. I just searched google scholar for any article that seemed to mention complexity of vocalization and [[trophic]] status, to no avail... 
::By far, most endangered species have that status because of humans mucking up the animals native habitats. Foxes, racoons, sparrows, rats, groundhogs, deer... these are all simply animals that deal well with [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[habitat destruction]] by humans. Sometimes called human [[commensalism|commensal]] species, they have readily adapted to the environments that humans have [[ecosystem engineer|created]]. Things like rats and sparrows reach far higher populations in human cities than in their historical wild ranges. Interestingly, both foxes and [[beaver]]s were recently much scarcer, but are on the rebound throughout much of the USA, indicating to me ([[WP:OR]]) that it took a little time for them to sort out how to live in our world. [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 15:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Agreed.  Foxes are renowned for their intelligence, as in [[Aesop's fables]].  I saw one fox actually using cars to feed itself.  It waited off the shoulder of a road for a car to drive by, which seemed to scare rodents in the brush, who then moved, and the fox pounced on them when he spotted the weeds moving.  Also, I've never seen a fox dead on the road, so they apparently are smart enough and fast enough to avoid that fate, while cats seemingly are not.

==The question of rules and mains of conductoring inserting==

Why on the page about electric conductor is not been contain about the all ways of including a conductors in a electric which always been setting up the all electrical rules? I seen, that a parallel or a simple insertings of all conductors in a electric is been most interested than a material structure of all conductors.

::Yes, I’m about of a series and a parallel including in a electric.

:::You're welcome.  In English, at least, an "electrical conductor" has a wider meaning than just a device in an electric circuit.  For example, saltwater is an electrical conductor.

:::::::Very thanks, it seems me that must be explain in page about a superconductivity thats, the fact of a superconductivity always is been a science electro-technical effect in a applied physics which effect, always has been a simple science base of all electronics and all microelectronics as why that a superconductivity was been scientifically discovered at first in a electro-technical engineering, and someone alls could be explain that a superconductivity always is been effect of colder of all metals, but someone science always wanted a science as a superconductivity always had been a science of very colder melting of all metals. It always seems me that a superconductivity always been good as electro-technical effect in a applied physics but not it been as a colder effect, lets I always think it is been always science.--[[User:Alex Sazonov|Alex Sazonov]] ([[User talk:Alex Sazonov|talk]]) 18:26, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

== Spider that looks (and kind of acts like) a fire ant? ==

Sitting on the porch I encountered what I thought was a fire ant - it looked exactly like one but with unusually large mandibles, and it's movements were certainly characteristic of one too. But when I went to relocate it, to my surprise it dropped down on a silky thread! So just out of curiosity, I decided to place it in a large fire ant hill on the edge of the property. In fact, it just meandered about on the hill for a while without so much as raising suspicion from the normally-aggressive residents. Any ideas what kind of spider it was? I didn't have a chance to get a photo, unfortunately. [[Special:Contributions/70.117.71.28|70.117.71.28]] ([[User talk:70.117.71.28|talk]]) 15:59, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:Cool find! I could be mistaken, but I didn't see any spiders on Rhodo's link. [[Ant_mimicry#Spiders]] discusses that ant mimicry by spiders is very common, but is not very helpful for our purposes here. Also, many things other than spiders can make silk, and some of them are ants. E.g. [[weaver ant]]s use silk to make nests. So, unless you clearly counted eight legs, and are sure there was no [[pedicel]], you may have just found some other, silk-making ant.
:With a little further searching, though mistaking this [[salticid]] for a fire ant seems totally reasonable [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pgs_-Lckno], and they ''do'' often perform a classic rappelling escape maneuver, just as you describe. That youtube video suggests it might be a member of the genus [[Peckhamia]], more pics on Bug Guide here [http://bugguide.net/node/view/413833/bgpage]. Also, salticids have a habit of waving their mandibles about, and that might also fit with your description.

::Gah! You're right. This is the link I should've copied, which linked me to the one above: [https://6legs2many.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/may-taxonomy-fail/ morphology fail].

== Slow neutrons ==

Why are slow neutrons better at inducing nuclear fission than fast neutrons? [[Special:Contributions/65.92.5.76|65.92.5.76]] ([[User talk:65.92.5.76|talk]]) 17:49, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:Per our [[neutron temperature]] article, which is the first search result Google returns for "slow neutron":
::''Thermal'' [i.e. "slow"] ''neutrons have a different and often much larger effective [[neutron absorption]] [[neutron cross-section|cross-section]] for a given nuclide than fast neutrons, and can therefore often be absorbed more easily by an atomic nucleus.''
:It happens that that cross-section is more relevant for readily-fissile materials; note elsewhere in the article, though, that fast neutrons serve their own purposes in fission-based applications (such as [[breeder reactor]]s). &mdash; [[User talk:Lomn|Lomn]] 18:00, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:::May be a slowing neutrons are much of a inductionary and much of a magnetism that’s it is be faster?--[[User:Alex Sazonov|Alex Sazonov]] ([[User talk:Alex Sazonov|talk]]) 19:14, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

References to the cross-section are not an answer; that concept is just a way of expressing how likely the reaction is.  It's like saying that the star Canopus is brighter than Alcor because its magnitude is a lower number, when the [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] is just a way of expressing the brightness.

I suspect that there is no simple answer. --[[Special:Contributions/50.100.193.30|50.100.193.30]] ([[User talk:50.100.193.30|talk]]) 23:00, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

== Bird with a red patch on the back of it's head ? ==

I saw this small bird in [[Detroit]].  It occurred to me that it could be a female [[cardinal (bird)|cardinal]], as females often have less color, but the pics I found didn't much look like it.  Same for a female [[American robin]], and they tend to be more orange than red, in any case.  I did get a cell phone pic, but it's of such low resolution it may not be of much use here. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 17:58, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::What color was the rest of the bird? Could it have been a [[Red-winged Blackbird]]? The red patch is on the wing, but maybe from an angle it could look like it was on behind the head. - [[User:EronMain|Eron]]<sup>[[User Talk:EronMain|Talk]]</sup> 18:05, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Nope, I've seen those before, this patch was definitely on the back of it's head.  The rest was rather drab, a mix of browns and grays. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 19:17, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::::[[Northern Flicker]]? Many woodpeckers have red bits on the back of their heads, but the flicker is the only one I can think of off-hand that's also brownish. --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 19:29, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::Could be it.  We do have a woodpecker around here somewhere, I've heard the pecking.  This one was on the sidewalk look for bugs in the grass, though.  Do woodpeckers ever do that ?  It was also with another bird, that was black and looked like a crow.  Not sure if that means anything. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 19:37, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::Flickers are sort of less specialized woodpeckers. I often see them around brush piles and weedy areas. From our article: "According to the Audubon guide, "flickers are the only woodpeckers that frequently feed on the ground", probing with their beak, also sometimes catching insects in flight." I would call flickers and robins more "medium", not "small." If it was actually small (e.g. sparrow-sized,) Jayron's suggestions below are also good. Also, most north american woodpeckers have some red on their heads. The smallest is the [[downy woodpecker]] (~large sparrow), medium is [[red-bellied woodpecker]] (~robin to jay sized, along with the flicker), and the largest, the [[pileated woodpecker]]. It is probably not the pileated, they are large, striking, and obviously a wood pecker. [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 20:37, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::::Everything except the size seems to fit with it being a Northern Flicker, and in particular the male Yellow-shafted Flicker.  The article lists a length of 11-14 inches, which seems at least twice as long as my bird, but I'm not sure which Northern Flickers that applies to, and if male juveniles have the same appearance.

::::Yes, that could be it, too, and the size matches more closely with the bird I saw.

== Color-changing eyes ==

My sister's eyes change color. From birth until about 3 months old they changed between gray, green, blue and gold, like the girl's contact lenses here: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ctwEOwlzmYc/UGnUCTNnciI/AAAAAAAAAD4/WKZwNT_Ibe8/s1600/girl2.jpg By 4 months old she had hazel eyes and they stayed hazel until she was 12 years old. When she was 12 they turned light green for about one whole day and she didn't even notice until her friends started asking her about her contact lenses. But she wasn't wearing contacts! The next day her eyes were still green but you could see the hazel coming back. When she turned 14 her eyes started turning almost black during the winter and in the summer they turn light brown, not hazel but light brown. Now its spring and she has one light brown eye and one dark brown eye. This might sound crazy but its true. Her eye color changes were noticed not only by her but by her friends and family, sometimes even before she had noticed it herself! So what does this mean? She also wants to know if they'll ever change back to blue or green.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.8.106.52|68.8.106.52]] ([[User talk:68.8.106.52|talk]]) 18:34, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== How does nuclear fusion generate energy? ==

It seems to me that a nuclear fusion reaction like deuterium + tritium --> helium + neutron should result in an energy loss rather than an energy gain. The nuclear binding energy in a nucleus should be approximately proportional to the number of pairs of nucleons. Well, deuterium has one pair of nucleons, tritium has three pairs, while helium has six. So it seems that there should be an increase in nuclear binding energy, rather than a decrease.

:Very blurry photo. Possibly a [[mayfly]], possibly of the family [[Ephemeridae]], which can grow to 35 mm. If you feel like wading through the detailed entomology, here's a science article about mayflies of Israel [http://www.ephemeroptera-galactica.com/pubs/pub_m/pubmalzacherp1992p385.pdf], hosted on this site about all things Ephemeroptera [http://www.ephemeroptera-galactica.com/]. If you still have the specimen or have access to another, it should be fairly easy to confirm or deny membership to the Ephemeroptera order. Getting to family, let alone species, will be much more difficult. [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 21:35, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:As far as I can tell it's a male ''Dorylus fulvus'', also known as [[sausage fly]]. It's a male of an army ant. --[[User:Dr Dima|Dr Dima]] ([[User talk:Dr Dima|talk]]) 22:35, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::Good call! I was puzzled by the lack of "tails" for a mayfly, but (wrongly) ruled out [[hymenoptera]] due to lack of a visible "waist"/[[Petiole_(insect)]]. [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 22:42, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Dr Dima, that looks pretty much like it. I'll try and get a better picture of another one and ask again, the photo is indeed blurry - the guy kept on moving. Thanks! [[User:Gil mo|Gil_mo]] ([[User talk:Gil mo|talk]]) 21:41, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
