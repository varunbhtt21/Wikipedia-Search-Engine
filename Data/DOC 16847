== Football waivers ==

How do [[Waivers (American football)]] work as far as player pay?  Imagine that I'm an NFL player under a two-year contract with Team A, but after the first year, I get waived, and then Team B picks me up halfway through the next season and retains me until the end of the contract.  Does this basically mean that Team B can sign a new contract with me before the two-year contract is expired, or do they have to work with me on the same terms as my original Team A contract (including paying me the same), since waivers involve a team making "an American football player contract or NFL rights available to all other teams"?  Meanwhile, am I still under contract to Team A during the first half of the second season (and if so, are they paying me), or are waivers basically a way of dumping the contract entirely?  I've never understood this process one bit; sorry if the answers should be obvious.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 13:10, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:When you are put on "Waivers", you're contract is being offered to other teams to pick up for the remainder of the contract term.  If another team picks you up during the waiver window, they take over your contract under the exact same terms as the original team.  That team stops writing checks for you.  Team B, of course, can negotiate new terms if they wish, as they can with all of their players.  If a player clears waivers, they are then a free agent, the old contract is void, and they are free to sign with any team.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 13:15, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
::Still somewhat confused; will Team A keep paying me for the first half of the season, since Team B hasn't picked me up yet?  I'm also confused about why the contract can be ended early without my consent.  Do typical team-and-player contracts say something like "This contract may be ended early through the waivers process", making unnecessary any consent by me when the waivers process is used?  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 13:28, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Why do you use the future tense?  Let's say someone is put on waivers during Week 8?  That player already has paychecks from weeks 1-7 in their bank account.  That's in the past.  If Team B picks up the player off waivers, they start paying him from Week 8 forward.  So team B will pay the rest of his checks, Team A has no future obligations.  But it already paid that player.  I don't know why you say "will Team A keep paying me for the first half of the season" if the waiver is done at the midpoint of the season, those weeks have already been paid by Team A.  For the second part, players in the NFL do NOT have guaranteed contracts.  A player may be cut by a team at any time, and when they are cut, the team stops paying checks to the player from that point forward.  Any remaining obligations to that player simply evaporate.  That's why "[[Signing bonus]]"es exist in the NFL.  It gives the player some up-front guaranteed money.  But when a team cuts a player, the salary left to be paid just... doesn't have to be paid.  The signing bonus has already been paid (it's already in the player's bank account) but paychecks for yet-to-be-played weeks are not.  So if a player is placed on waivers, and another team claims him, the remaining time on his contract from the day he's picked up is assumed by the new team.  If no team picks up the player, the remaining time on his contract is paid by nobody.  It just, you know, goes away.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 13:42, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Just for reference [http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2009/9/5/1016903/how-does-the-nfl-waiver-wire This article] does a pretty good job of describing how pre-season waivers work (the system changes somewhat for in-season waivers) but usefully, it also has a copy of the NFL waiver policy, directly from the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 14:06, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::And, for some light reading, [http://images.nflplayers.com/mediaResources/files/PDFs/General/2011_Final_CBA_Searchable_Bookmarked.pdf Here] is a PDF of the complete Collective Bargaining Agreement.  Article 30 deals with terminating players (cutting them from the roster).  Players who are terminated are given a severance package that has some rather complex calculations, but looks to be roughly 25% of their remaining unpaid salary for the season in which they are cut.  But that can still void many years (and a lot of dollars) remaining on contracts.  So it isn't true that players get ''nothing'' when they are cut, but they don't get the balance of their contract.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 14:14, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

== Top 40 hit from 1984 ==

I no longer have ''The [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Book of Top 40 Hits'' and need to know this question for a personal project.  A 1984 song made the Top 40 and came from a [[television film]].  I think it was by an [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] artist. [[User:Theskinnytypist|Theskinnytypist]] ([[User talk:Theskinnytypist|talk]]) 17:04, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:There are all sorts of actual ''film'' theme songs that were in the charts in 1984, but for TV I only found: "[[The Yellow Rose (song)|The Yellow Rose]]" (for the series ''[[The Yellow Rose]]''), or possibly the "[[Miami Vice Theme]]"; the series, with its theme song, was first broadcast in 1984, but the single wasn't released until 1985 (it's also interesting for being the last instrumental song to top the [[Billboard Hot 100]] for almost three decades, until "[[Harlem Shake (song)|Harlem Shake]]" came along in 2013 :-| ). ---[[User:Sluzzelin|Sluzzelin]] [[User talk:Sluzzelin|<small>talk</small>]] 18:09, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

: I listened to Casey Kasem pretty religiously in the 80's and this isn't ringing any bells. Unless it's a song that made the top 40 and then was subsequently used in a TV movie, is that possible? The pilot TV movie for Miami Vice included [[In the Air Tonight]] by Phil Collins. Other near possibilities are songs that made the top 40 after being played in TV series (around, but not quite in, 1984). There's [[Think of Laura]] by Christopher Cross, late 83/early 84, featured in General Hospital as Luke & Laura's love theme; [[At This Moment]] by Billy Vera and the Beaters, Family Ties, 85/86 season; [[Hill Street Blues]] theme made the top 40 in 1981; the theme song for the TV series Fame originated with the theatrical film.

::Don't forget the theme for ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'', "[[Believe It or Not (song)|Believe It or Not]]", though that was a few years earlier than 1984.  If it were a theatrical film song, rather than a TV film, there was "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]" from 1984, from the film of the same name.  The article titled [[1984 in music]] may also help the OP.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 22:07, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
