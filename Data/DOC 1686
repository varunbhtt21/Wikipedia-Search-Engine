'''Mountain View Farm''' is a historic farmhouse on Close Road, off Upper Jaffrey Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]]. The house consists of two parts. The older portion is a two-story wood frame structure built about 1780 by Nathan Bixby, a major landowner and prominent citizen of the town. In the late 19th century the house was acquired by George and Alice Upton, who in 1903 commissioned [[John Lawrence Mauran]], a prominent [[Chicago]] architect, to design a Georgian Revival summer house, to which the older house was attached as a wing. The best-known occupant of the house was [[Mark Twain]], who rented it for his second visit to Dublin in 1906.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004057}}|title=NRHP nomination for Mountain View Farm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>
