== WW1 Military Cross Recipients ==

My grandfather Harold Methven Musson was awarded the Military Cross and gazetted in the London Gazette on 18 July 1917, yet he is not included in the list of recipients within Wikipedia. I have tried to edit the page but have been unable to do so. How do I get his name added to the list of recipients?

== When multiple P41 values exist, how to retrieve the correct one ==

When using <nowiki>{{#property:p41}}</nowiki> in a template or on a page, it returns the name of the flag image of a country/state/..., but in the case of country United States it returns:<br />
Flag of the United States.svg, US flag 49 stars.svg, US flag 48 stars.svg<br />
Three file names! In this case <nowiki>{{#ifexist:media:{{#property:p41}}|[[File:{{#property:p41}}{{!}}35px{{!}}]]}}</nowiki> has a false condition and does not show a flag image. A difference with other countries (and other geographicals) is the presence of a start date and an end date. So to solve my problem, I need to access the one with the highest start date or the one witout an end date in case of multiple values for P41. But I also need to get the ones that have no start/end date in case of a single value for p41. What can I do?

== Suitable reference source ==

Hi. I'm currently working on the [[Scientology in Australia]] page. Is [http://www.suburbia.com.au/~fun/scn/press/820802me.htm this] a suitable url for the following reference?

{{cite news |title=Scientology makes its move for an 'all-clear' |first=Wayne |last=Crawford |work=The Mercury |location=Hobart |date=2 August 1982 |page=7}}

I quite often come across copies of new articles in strange places, but I tend to ignore them as potentially suspect.  Should I not be?

(The archive on the paper's website only goes back a few years.  There's the [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-title10 Australian National Archive] but that stops in 1954 for this paper.)

Is this the right place to ask this, or should I post it somewhere else - I've not worked out what to ask where yet? Thanks for your help. —[[User:Otus scops|Otus scops]] ([[User talk:Otus scops|talk]]) 15:27, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

== A ten dollar donation to Wikipedia ==
Hi.
A while ago I donate $10 to wikipedia because I used it frequently. 
However, over the last 4-5 years I have seen an increasingly vitriolic slant against anything alternative under the guise of "objectivity".
I no longer find wikipedia useful.
I would also like to suggest, based on the increase in popularity of natural medicine and alternative modalities among people of all education levels, that moderators either revert to true objectivity (i.e. impartial respect for major viewpoints) or cease the use of the tag line "The Free Encyclopedia."
While it is not reasonable to expect a refund of my $10, wikipedia has likely seen it's last donation from me.

I agree with the commenter, and my comment is about Jimmy Wales's apparent line on views like his which you quote above.  There has '''always''' been bias against alternative and so-called "natural" medicine for that very reason, the perceived lack of scientific evidence underpinning it, i.e. evidence produced through replicable scientific experiment, but lack of formal proof does not mean that all alternative medicine must necessarily be suspect, much of it is very effective and has been for centuries, and who are Wikipedia to judge when the promoter of a particular type of alternative medicine is a lunatic charlatan?  It is a very difficult judgment for non-medical people to make.  Even expert pracititioners of some alternative treatment modalities are not sure how they work, they only know that they do.  I think Wikipedia are playing safe by following the line taken by conventional medicine that there must be always be scientific underpinning, and who can blame them, for how can non-experts possibly judge these matters? But playing safe will inevitably lead to discrimination against alternative medicine, without good enough reason in my view.  (I would never go so far as to say that Wikipedia are bowing to pressure from Big Pharma on this, though I can imagine some might say it.) I think Wikipedia should be completely impartial in its treatment of alternative medicine and cover all alternative therapies on its pages.  If there are any doubts about a particular therapy being described in an article, there is nothing to stop the article expressing the reservations that may be held about it by those who are known to have doubts about it.  That would be true impartiality, and would not leave gaps in Wikipedia that might lead some to question Wikipedia's impartiality and reputation as a good encyclopaedia.  Could this perhaps be put to Jimmy Wales? --[[User:P123cat1|P123cat1]] ([[User talk:P123cat1|talk]]) 20:13, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

Yes, rather stupid of me to post them on the Help Desk!  Is there any way of getting the message across to someone in Wikipedia who has control over which articles are and are not accepted?
