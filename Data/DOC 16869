== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Groovey.TV]] ==

I could use some guidance on what needs to be changed for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Groovey.TV
to be accepted.  Thank you very much!

:{{replyto|Zuluflipper}} As has been pointed out already, the subject has no claim to [[WP:GNG|notability]] and most of the sources listed are not [[WP:RS|reliable]]. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 00:01, 24 April 2014 (UTC)


== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Solana Networks]] ==


In the 1st round of the article the reviewer mentioned there were insufficient
citations. As a result, I spent a lot of time on the web searching 
for citations and put up whatever I found that was relevant.

In the latest review of this article (Solana Networks), LukeSurl has indicated that
there are too many citations and some of the citations are not needed.

It would be helpful to find out exactly which citations to delete. Can someone
let me know? This would probably shorten the back and forth cycle.


thanks

:{{replyto|Sdoya}} What LukeSurl is referring to is that you have a lot of citations but many of them don't link to [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. You want to stick to [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', etc.  One of your URLs is [[Reuters]], but they're re-posting a PR release from [[Market Wire]].  When you take out all those non-reliable sources you have very little left to make a case for [[WP:GNG]].  You don't have to delete all of them but I would recommend restructuring the article around your few solid sources. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 06:35, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Carrousel Club]] ==

Looking for feedback in regards to neutrality and if referencing is sufficient?

Thanks

[[User:Swillats|Swillats]] ([[User talk:Swillats|talk]]) 05:24, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{to|Swillats}} Referencing is <em    >definitely</em> not sufficient. One source is not enough to demonstrate [[WP:N|notability]]. On neutrality, Rankersbo has already left a comment on your submission. I advise you to read that as well as information about so-called [[WP:PEACOCK|peacock terms]].

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Sean Rush (artist)]] ==

I don't understand why my articles keep getting denied for Sean Rush (artist). The first time I was told to add my references and I did but was still denied. Can someone please help with this? SeanRushAtelier

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Sandy Stimpson]]

Hello,
I submitted my article 20 days ago and am curious to find out if there is anything we are able to do in order to get our submission reviewed more quickly. The submission is for Sandy Stimpson, the Mayor of Mobile, Alabama and there has been a high demand for his Wikipedia page. If we should add more information or sources, please let us know or if there is anything else we can do to get our article processed more quickly.
Thank you for your time!

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Turkish Philanthropy Funds]] ==

Hi,
I have sumbitted an article three weeks ago and it has not yet been approved. I want to learn if there is missing elements to it that needs to be corrected and that is the reason why it has not been approved yet. Is there a way that I can learn about it?
Thanks,
Ipek Basaran
[[User:Ib598|Ib598]] ([[User talk:Ib598|talk]]) 17:50, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{to|Ib598}} There are over two thousand submissions currently, so reviews take time for all of them. However, I've just declined yours. It needs [[WP:VRS|references to independent, reliable sources of information]]. You can also learn more about [[WP:PSCOI|editing articles about subjects with which you are affiliated]].

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Dr. Salvatore Pacella]] ==

Hello! 

I was wondering if somebody could tell me exactly what links I need to remove in order for my Wikipedia page to be approved. It has been declined twice and I would really appreciate a clear outline of what is wrong with it so that I can fix them and resubmit. The article is [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Dr. Salvatore Pacella]]. Thank you so much for your help!

[[User:DrPacella|DrPacella]] ([[User talk:DrPacella|talk]]) 21:49, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{replyto|InnoWikipedia}} I cut out the long list of publications.  While I know how important that is to academics, it means nothing here. Second, I started reformatting the references.  That's not a required step but it helps me see at a glance what the sources really are.  [[WP:REFLINKS|Reflinks]] is great for that.  My concern is that the subject lacks [[WP:GNG|general notability]] and most of the URLs provided are for organizations of which Pacella is a member, so they're not independent.  He also fails [[WP:ACADEMIC]] as the Worden award itself isn't notable and there's no evidence he did any groundbreaking research. I'd also like to point out that this submission looks very [[WP:TONE|promotional]]. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 05:29, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
