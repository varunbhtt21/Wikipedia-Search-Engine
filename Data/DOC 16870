==When is a subject non-religious and when is it religious?==
I am sincerely confused when a subject is religious and when it is not. See e.g. [[Talk:Arthur_Ford#Your_defense_of_skeptic_sources_e.g._at_talk:Arthur_Ford]]. Years ago I went thru mediation regarding [[Sathya Sai Baba]] with the outcome that skeptical sources, like the [[Indian Skeptic]] were not okay to use as a source for his miracles. See [[User:BostonMA/Mediation/Sathya_Sai_Baba/Premanand_as_a_Source]] In contrast the parapsychologist [[Erlendur Haraldsson]] was fine. 

It seems to me that different policies apply when a subject is religious and when it is not, so the classification of the subject and article does matter. I think [[WP:fringe]] does not apply for religious subjects, like [[Arthur Ford]].

Thanks in advance for ur comments. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 14:52, 6 April 2014 (UTC)

What I am asking for is rules and guidelines and consistency among a range of articles, including [[Sathya Sai Baba]], [[Miracles of Jesus]] and [[Arthur Ford]]. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 16:24, 6 April 2014 (UTC)

:Hi Andries. The answer to your query lies in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fringe_theories#Evaluating_claims this section] of WP:FRINGE, although I'm guessing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Fringe_theories/Noticeboard/Archive_1#Is_this_notice_board_for_discussing_each_and_every_minor_religious_group.3F from your previous inquiries] you already know the difference between Christian's religious belief in the [[Miracles of Jesus]] and, say, [[Arthur Ford]] appearing on a TV program claiming that he's making contact with someone's dead son. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 16:48, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
: What miracles? There is absolutely no credible evidence that anything he did was miraculous, every "miracle" can be accounted for by the entirely prosaic mechanisms of stage conjuring. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 16:51, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
::JzG, [[Erlendur Haraldsson]]'s book "Miracles are my visiting cards" which is considered a reliable source in mediation in 2006 described many alleged miracles attributed to Sathya Sai Baba that cannot be explained by sleight of hand. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 17:04, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
::: Alleged. Meanwhile, back in the real world, it remains the case that not one single miracle has been proven to performed by any supernatural mechanism. Given that in his dotage Sai Baba was getting clumsier and the sleight of hand more obvious, it's hard to see the claims of believers as anything other than credulous. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 18:13, 6 April 2014 (UTC)o 
::::This is a veering toward an off-topic discussion. I hope that I will find time to write on this subject on my now nearly empty  blog. If so, I will alert you on ur talk page. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 18:18, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
::LuckyLouie, no I do not see differences that warrant  different sourcing guidelines or policies between [[Arthur Ford]] and [[Miracles of Jesus]]. Both Ford and Jesus had followers and both are treated by religious scholars. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 17:17, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
::From [[Wikipedia:Fringe_theories#Evaluating_claims this section]] "Perspectives which advocate non-scientific or pseudoscientific religious claims ''intended'' (my emphasis) to directly confront scientific discoveries should be evaluated on both a scientific and a theological basis,"
::No, I do not think that any of the three example articles that I mentioned ''intended'' to directly confront scientific discoveries and hence fall into the religious category, so [[WP:fringe]] does not apply and scientific skeptical sources are unsuitable for these three articles. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 17:25, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
:Pretty much any subject can be religious:  The category of "religious subjects" is pretty much just a nominal one:  Whatever is widely named as religious is religious.  For example [[creation science]]—on that article it rightly says, "The overwhelming consensus of the scientific community is that creation science is a religious, not a scientific view".  Well, WP:FRINGE clearly applies to [[creation science]]. In fact, that's the judgement of the Arbitrators: [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience#Final decision]].  So I think you should reconsider your view that WP:FRINGE does not apply to religious subjects.  Obviously, other people disagree with me. --<font face="georgia">[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&nbsp;</font><font face="georgia" size="1">([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])</font> 19:49, 6 April 2014 (UTC)

:::So rather than being that WP:FRINGE should not apply to religious subjects ''simpliciter'', is your proposal that WP:FRINGE should not apply to religious subjects that don't involve directly confronting scientific discoveries?   A counter-example in that case would be e.g., theories of [[Allah as Moon-god]].  These are fringe theories, and they are not intended to confront scientific discoveries. At most they are intended to confront discoveries in the [[humanities]], particularly [[comparative mythology]]. More often than not though they are just intended to serve apologetic purposes. --<font face="georgia">[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&nbsp;</font><font face="georgia" size="1">([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])</font> 22:51, 6 April 2014 (UTC) <small>Added a missing word for readability. --<font face="georgia">[[User:Atethnekos|Atethnekos]]&nbsp;</font><font face="georgia" size="1">([[User talk:Atethnekos|Discussion]],&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Atethnekos|Contributions]])</font> 23:04, 6 April 2014 (UTC)</small>
May be a statement should be added to [[WP:Fringe]] that religious subjects i.e. subjects treated in [[religious studies]], [[psychology of religion]], [[sociology of religion]], [[theology]] and not treated in other fields of science, fall outside the scope of fringe even if they contain some paranormal claims. What do you think? [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 21:31, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
::That surely can't be the criteria. Rather, it should be that one may talk about beliefs - clearly labelled as such - without need to contrast with more skeptical sources, but the moment be talks of proof or tries to claim something cannot be explained, then bring on the skepticism. There have been innumerable cults and fraudsters. We shouldn't tae the position that Wikipedia should be defined solely by the believers. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])</sup></span> 21:50, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
:I think this is a clearly bad idea. There is a difference between "in-universe" discussions about religious articles of faith and claims to secular truth. [[WP:FRINGE]] likely applies in ''both'' cases, but in different ways. In discussing items of religious dogma, you're talking about what people believe, not what is true, so the fringe sources you're avoiding are fringe believers (e.g. you wouldn't want to prominently include the [[Westboro Baptist Church]]'s views in an article about Christianity). In discussing whether or not someone actually had magic powers or miraculous abilities, then you use a wider scientific standard. There is no reason to analyze whether something's religious or not.

::Indeed. Appropriate framing can mean that there is little need for much counterargument - if the article makes it very clear it's talking about the beliefs of a religion, and does not stray into advocating for their truth, then fine. If it's on a religious text, and simply neutrally describes it, sure. But first of all - I do firmly believe the meditation listed at the start of this was likely wrong, at least in part, if - as I understand it - it ended by saying religious figures are protected from criticism of their claimed abilities. They are not, and cannot be. There are, however, arguments to be had about uses of sources, and how best to present the evidence, but that's not the same as saying evidence that contradicts religious figures should be rejected out of hand: that is '''never''' the case. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])</sup></span> 22:04, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Adam, I think that you misunderstand this thorough mediation. The mediation only said that hardline skeptic sources, like [[Indian Skeptic]] and Robert Todd Carroll skeptic dictionaries are not suitable for the article [[Sathya Sai Baba]] because they are not peer reviewed, and too partisan. Criticisms from other sources was allowed. However the problem that I have is that this kind of reasoning is not applied consistently over Wikipedia. Why is the use of hardline skeptic sources okay for [[Arthur Ford]]? Can I use the skeptic dictionary as a source at [[Miracles of Jesus]]. If yes, then why not at [[Sathya Sai Baba]]? If not, then why don't people try this? (I think that there will be too much opposition.) [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 22:30, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
::::One ''could'' use them at Miracles of Jesus - were there not better, more notable sources. We have criticism by extremely notable critics such as [[David Hume]], we don't really need lesser lights. At [[Sathya Sai Baba]], we also have much more prominent, notable criticism, so need not go down that far. [[Arthur Ford]] was never as prominent as Jesus or Sathya Sai Baba, and, as such, the notability of the sources that cover him is less - and the sources used there are thus appropriately notable for the article.

I also announced this discussion here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Religion&diff=prev&oldid=603064314 here], because this is discussion about the scope of different policies and editing styles. [[User:Andries|Andries]] ([[User talk:Andries|talk]]) 22:12, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
: Oh good, the [[WP:FORUMSHOP]] is open. For the record, I think it would be a violation of policy to allow the in-universe characterisation of Sai Baba's conjuring to pass as fact. Bear in mind that Sai Baba's followers are not infrequently referred to as a cult and there's significant evidence that the guru was abusing his power and influence over the faithful, it would be entirely wrong to adopt the usual uncritical tone of articles on historical religious mysteries, most of which have no contemporaneous skeptical sources. Your long-term and very determined advocacy of Sai baba is a matter of record. Your desire for parity between the claims of Sai Baba and those of the historical religions fails because the claimed miracles of Sai Baba were already debunked during his lifetime, whereas the claimed miracles of Christianity, for example, have a clear context as allegory. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 09:07, 7 April 2014 (UTC)

::: Your edit history tells a different story. (clarification: I chose the wrong word; what I mean is that you have very little apparent interest in Wikipedia other than to discuss this one subject). And yes, there is a difference between old religious movements and modern ones. Do you think the first century Christians would have got away with the miracle claims in today's climate? These myths are generally understood to be just that, whereas the claims of Sai Baba are pretty clearly simple conjuring. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 19:30, 7 April 2014 (UTC)
{{outdent}}@Andries: OK you've initiated a general discussion around the premise "fringe does not apply for religious subjects" and you've made a specific proposal to change [[WP:FRINGE]] to reflect that, but you haven't gotten any support for your ideas here, and it's unlikely any will be forthcoming. At this point, it's probably best that you move your proposal to an appropriate place, i.e. [[Talk:Fringe theories]]. Do you have specific text changes you'd like to see at [[Sathya Sai Baba]] and [[Arthur Ford]]? If so, the Talk pages of those articles are your best bet to pursuing those. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 19:38, 7 April 2014 (UTC)
:Wait a bit. If a subject is religious then it is likely treated by religious scholars etc which tend to be reliable source. This includes [[Arthur Ford]] who is treated by [[J. Gordon Melton]] and then according to [[WP:parity]] hard line skeptic sources have no place in this article. (I am not very motivated to improve [[Arthur Ford]], except to make a point regarding the proper use of sources.)

Religious topics are '''not''' immune from WP:FRINGE... however, WP:FRINGE has to be applied within the ''context'' of religion.

:::::::This is not the issue. The issue is whether when and to  what extent hard line skeptic sources are okay to use for religious subjects. I admit that omission of hard line skeptic sources will make some religious articles including Sathya Sai Baba somewhat less critical, but certainly not without criticisms. Some peer reviewed articles by religious scholars summarize  hard line skeptic sources, but generally they tend be silent about the veracity of truth claims by religious movements. However it would be strange to mix peer reviewed sources that already summarize hard line skeptic sources with the hard line skeptic sources. That would cause a balance issue.

== Claims of medieval Muslim decipherment of hieroglyphs ==

A related subject: According to {{diff2|493789712|this edit by Bill Poser}}, claims that Muslim scholars had partly deciphered the Egyptian hieroglyphs a full millennium before Champollion are not taken seriously in Egyptology. Nevertheless, [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] cites El Daly, apparently the main proponent of this idea, as a reliable source. --[[User:Florian Blaschke|Florian Blaschke]] ([[User talk:Florian Blaschke|talk]]) 13:38, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:El Daly is an [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/experts/expert/view/?id=356&fromSearch=1 archaeologist at University College London], so he is an RS, and it's an issue of due weight. I've found a few reviews of El Daly's book, and most of them agree that El Daly performs a valuable function by discussing Arab study of ancient Egypt, but that his conclusions can be excessively boosterish. [http://www.palarch.nl/wp-content/duinmaijer_cp_2006_review_of_eldaly_o_2005_egyptology_the_missing_millennium_ucl_press.pdf This review] and [http://www.egyptologyforum.org/reviews/Missing1000.html this one] are the only ones I can find that address the hieroglyph issue in any depth, and they both say that El Daly exaggerates the Arab scholars' success in identifying the glyphs. A more reliable review, by Robert Schick in ''Near Eastern Archaeology'' [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25754031], doesn't say El Daly exaggerates but does say "some authors attempted to decipher ancient Egyptian, which they recognized was similar to Coptic, but their attempts were not successful and their understanding did not develop past a general sense that hieroglyphics had a phonetic value along with their symbolic value". So it is safe to say that these Arab scholars recognized those two points. But it seems to be questionable whether they correctly identified any specific phonetic values. [[User:A. Parrot|A. Parrot]] ([[User talk:A. Parrot|talk]]) 21:29, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

::I'd second that. [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] footnote #9 links to a translation of the book wherein he purportedly deciphered hieroglyphs, and the tables therein basically don't line up at all with what I learned in school. Even when he's close he's wrong - he alleges that the character for N means water, which is its derivation, but not its meaning, and he seems to think the glyph for the god Horus is simply the glyph for God. These are his least wrong associations, and they're only just barely in the same ball park. To call this decipherment is a stretch.

== Do we have to qualify scientific results as "known to scientists"? ==

Given that this was important enough to Til Eulenspiegel for him to edit war (2 week block), I'm thinking that what I've raised at  [[WP:NPOVN#Attribution issue at Ethiopia - do we need to say "known to scientists"?]] is a fringe issue - he seems to think it needs to be attributed to scientists - one of his edit summaries said "Uh oh, seems Doug Weller prefers to flare this into a dispute, says "attribution isn't necessary" for what European regime-paid scientists say, published views of Ethiopian scholars he deems irrelevant but theirs is the more prominent voice in that nation" - although I can't figure out from [[Ethiopia]] what he is talking about. At the moment the lead still has Til's version attributing it to scientists (and is vaguer than the relevant section in the article). I didn't bring it here earlier to avoid accusations from Til, but as he is now blocked and as I see it as a fringe issue relevant to other articles, I'm mentioning it here. Comments should go there, not here. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 14:07, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:If something's reliably sourced and not seriously contested it can generally be asserted as a fact. Attributing it can have the unwarranted effect of making it seem contested. There are circumstances however where it can be useful use attribution to emphasize that a view is firmly held in (say) the scientific community. So I guess it depends - for topics covered by this noticeboard I always want to look at the end result of the text and ask if it is making any implications of a pro-fringe nature.

::::This is the diff [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethiopia&diff=605145412&oldid=605144684]. The context is that Til is a biblical literalist. His creationism is also combined with various Garveyite and Rastafarian-influenced ideas about the biblical history and world significance of Ethiopia and African races. So there's often a combination of standard creationism with accusations of racism and Eurocentrism. However, he does try to stick to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines most of the time. Part of the problem here is that scientific accounts of the early history of humanity ''are'' in some ways uncertain, so it may well be legitimate to say something like "scientists believe ...". It depends on the specific claim being made. The convoluted wording used by Til is a characteristic masterpiece of circumlocution: "Ethiopia is one of the oldest locations of human life known to scientists"; that's transparently designed to evade referring to evolution, by implying humans just appeared at a "location", Ethiopia being "one of" the places where the oldest evidence of their presence has been found by scientists.

:::::Thanks for enlarging my understanding of where Til comes from. Your explanation, that he is trying to evade referring to evolution, makes a lot of sense. However, I'm not in full agreement with you over his adherence to our policies and guidelines - it's my impression that he dislikes our NPOV policy, presumably because it conflicts with biblical literalism, etc, and although many of his edits are good, his personal beliefs intrude too often. And of course he ignores [[WP:AGF]] and [[WP:NPA]] completely - he barely escaped a ban or block over his attack on me and Dab which was rev/del'd and that was only one of many personal attacks he's made. And of course this is his 7th block for edit-warring. In this specific case the main text in the article didn't say scientists believe, and was more specific than the lead which as you noted didn't have any suggestion of the evolution of humanity.

==[[Russell Targ]] (again)==

As mentioned before, Targ (on an IP address) and on an account "Torgownik" was editing his article adding in personal commentary and deleting references that were critical of his work in parapsychology. He was told to add reliable references for his claims when editing the article, but he did not listen. He has since complained on his facebook that users with a "hatred" for ESP are editing his Wikipedia article to remove his science career. Of course this is not true, neither is his other claim that Wikipedia banned him from editing his article. This is obviously a case of meat puppetry as he is telling people to come over and edit his article, [https://www.facebook.com/russtarg/posts/848996551792641?fref=nf], his rant has now been spammed around on various conspiracy theory/crank paranormal websites [http://2012thebigpicture.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/whats-your-go-to-research-site-wikipedia-exposed/] [https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10152148242628218&id=295503008217], [http://theeyelessowl.net/2014/04/22/reflections-on-wikipedia-from-russell-targ/] etc. There is now a single purpose account adding in some fringe sources (obviously a friend of Targ), he was reverted but others will probably join in. The issue here though is that users such as myself have found it hard to find any reliable sources for his work in lasers. For example Targ claims to have been a "pioneer" in the earliest development of the laser but it has been hard to find any references for this, I also can't find any sources for his claims about working with NASA, if he did what did he work on? He claims to have worked on airborne laser wind measurements. Any help please appreciated with looking for these sources.

== Asserting facts about fringe topics, again ==

Prompted by a recent thread at [[WT:MED#Asserting "facts"]] and by discussions on the Talk page of [[Reiki]], I want to ask a general question to check the consensus on neutral presentation of "facts" about claimed pseudoscientific phenomena. I'm using "fact" in the Wikipedia sense of being information about which there is no serious dispute.
So, taking [[Qi]] as an example, and having [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18410352 a good source] which states "The existence of Ki (or Qi, life energy) has not been proven scientifically", and assuming there are no reliable countering sources, should Wikipedia state:
# In 2008, Lee and colleagues said that qi had not yet been proven to exist by Western science<sup>[ref]</sup>
# In 2008, Lee and colleagues said that qi had not been proven to exist<sup>[ref]</sup>
# {{Asof|2008}} no evidence had emerged that qi exists<sup>[ref]</sup>
# There is no scientific evidence that qi exists<sup>[ref]</sup>
# Qi does not exist<sup>[ref]</sup>
In my view 4 & 5 are the only neutral variants and either is good (depending on context). Attributing this information gives an unwarranted implication that it is in serious dispute or is just opinion. I certainly don't think what is currently in our [[Qi]] article is good:
* Some studies claim to have been able to measure qi, or the effects of manipulating qi (such as through acupuncture),<sup>[citation needed]</sup> but the proposed existence of qi has also been questioned within the scientific community.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

Based on an outright lie (not out of character) by Nixon, they [[National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse|'temporarily' permanently banned]] medical use of marijuana, then doggedly ensured that [[NIDA]] refused to study the mechanism for two decades, insisting that a drug with specific and reproducible effects on the brain ''literally had no receptor'', then used bureaucracy to hold back all practical research for ''another'' decade.

Kelly" who claims to have once worked for the police department in Baltimore, doesn't seem the least bit familiar with the law. Finally, these two examples prove what [[Will Potter]] has been saying for years about the [[Green Scare]] and directly links to what other authors and journalists have alleged about how the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI worked with local law enforcement to use violent methods to crackdown on peaceful Occupy protests.  And where the Occupy protests were not peaceful, other journalists claim to have uncovered evidence of agent provocateurs from law enforcement who deliberately incited violent acts to justify a brutal crackdown in the first place.  At the end of the day, Wikinews is nothing but an organ of the establishment.  It needs to stop pretending to be open to citizen participation, because it most assuredly is not.  It has a proven track record of selectively citing sources that make extreme, unverifiable claims while ignoring easy to verify claims that are widely published.  In this latest incident report, we have a "reporter" claiming that a protester said cannabis cured his cancer, but did the protester really say that?  It's hard to believe because Wikinews cannot be trusted to report news in an accurate manner. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 02:33, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::I'm not sure what to do with this.  First, the Lundberg v. article says pepper spray was sprayed as well as applied by swab, but I'm not quite sure the point - I gave it as an example of what is unusual and I don't see you disagreeing with that.  The point is, if the outlier is there, simply using pepper spray doesn't seem like such an extraordinary claim.  Then as for Green Scare, are you saying Wikinews is suppressing mention of that?  Or what?  Also you sound as if you can't participate there - if there are arbitrary ways in which you're excluded from doing so, ''that'' would be a criticism I would be moved by.

:::::I don't go by or depend on what Wikipedia articles say, I go by the actual sources.  In this particular case, ''Lundberg v. County of Humboldt'' completely refutes the nonsense spread by "Charles J. Kelly" in the Associated Press.  It was not standard procedure to spray peaceful protesters, as that case had been declared an example of excessive force six years before the UC Davis incident occurred. I suggest you perform actual research on the UC Davis incident.  The majority of reliable law enforcement sources cited on the case explicitly refute and contradict  "Charles J. Kelly".  Wikinews should never rely on one single source to write an article, yet that's what they did because there was no critical thought put into it, just a rehash and regurgitation of what the AP said without question and without looking at what other sources said.  And this is exactly what they did with the cannabis protester.  A science journalist would at least illustrate the alleged quote with a brief sentence or two on the scientific consensus regarding cannabis and cancer.  Again, Wikinews is Wiki-worthless. As for my participation there, that has ''nothing'' to do with this discussion, just as your tangent about the history of cannabis controversy has nothing to do with this thread.

==[[Jean-Émile Charon]]==

A French physicist who has written some new age books. Some strange stuff on his article:

"There are microscopic individualities inside every human. They think, they know, and (they) carry Spirit in the Universe.”[2] Charon chooses to call these individual beings of intelligence, “eons.” They are otherwise known as electrons. Each electron or “eon” is an enclosed space, a thinking entity, intelligence, and even a micro-universe. But this is an inaccurate way of speaking about them, because as Michael Talbot (1991/1992) warns us in The Holographic Universe, “the only time quanta ever manifest as particles is when we are looking at them.” [3] Thus, it would be more accurate to think of these beings in terms of wave interference patterns."

"The goal of the electron is developing the order of its Spirit. There are four psychic forces that organize living forms into entities of increasing energy or order: reflection, knowledge, love, and action. As the order grows, so do the psychic properties."

== Fringe at [[Subartu]], [[Sabir people]] ==

There's been a good amount of material added to these pages recently pushing the fringe belief that the Bronze Age Subartu are the same people as the 7th century CE Sabir, and are thus an example of continuous Turkish presence in the Near East. There are a great deal of inline cites provided, but following these I find at least one blatant fabrication - the claim that H. Mark Hubey contributed to ''The Cambridge Ancient History'' series and that the book supports the Sabir/Subartu connection {{Diff|Sabir people|prev|605812831}} (also added to Subartu but removed by another editor) - several fringe sources sometimes connected with the Hungarian or Turkish right-wing {{Diff|Subartu|prev|605888701}} {{Diff|Subartu|prev|605890876}} (in the last the Christian is reliable, but being misrepresented), and a number of scholarly sources that are being misrepresented, such as Dhorme, {{Diff|Subartu|prev|606462973}}, the Christian linked before, and a group of sources concerning etymology that may be taken out of context, such as {{Diff|Subartu|prev|606333117}} {{Diff|Subartu|prev|606357157}}. The use of Old Turkic to provide an etymology for a people that preceded Old Turkic by over a thousand years is a sign of sloppiness at best, and illustrates what seems to be the thought process behind the sourcing: Google for anything that looks like Subartu, Sabir, Subar, etc., and assume that it must be making a Subartu-Tukish connection and present it as such. As the editor has a definite [[WP:IDHT]] problem, and I would rather not be in an edit war, some more eyes on this would be good.

:First of all, the article was not created in 2009.  It was created about a month ago, by me.  Second, I greatly dispute Guy's interpretation of the dispute.  ONUS does not give him unlimited rights to delete whatever he wants and make me prove it is worth including.  It means he can challenge specific facts that are uncited, not ignore BRD because he feels some details aren't worth covering.   He has cut 2/3rds of the article, including tons of material sourced to sources normally considered reliable (Fox News, Washington Post, etc.)  Additionally, his edits have introduced factual inaccuracies that I carefully avoided because he insists the details are mere "trivia", but are actually crucial to understanding certain points.  We are attempting resolve the issue on talk (while he insists his version must stay in the mean time, ignoring BRD), but I certainly welcome more opinions. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 22:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

More generally though, an article about a pseudo-science should give all the space needed to explain its thinking to the reader.  I mean, I don't believe a word about astrology, but if I had a reason to draw up someone's natal chart for fiction or comedy, I'd want to be able to find out how to do it right here.

We're here to free the data, to listen to it as we can, to try to see where it is leading.

That article, by the way, needs work, it described the subject as a "science writer" and "Founding Director of CANHELP, a cancer help and referral service" - CANHELP is actually an ''alternative'' cancer misinformation provider. He's also a contributor to {{la|Nathan Pritikin}}, with whom Patrick McGrady also worked.

Actually, CANHELP as it was run by my Dad was a cancer information and referral service which spoke of conventional therapies in addition to naturopathic and non-toxic, non-invasive therapies. I don't know what it is today as I don't live in the home office any more and have no contact or interest in it.  PMM was indeed a science writer who wrote the critically acclaimed "The Youth Doctors" in addition to the best-selling "The Pritikin Program for Diet and Exercise", both of which are concerned with scientific subject matter (health/longevity/nutrition).

I agree that that particular edit of Null was CV-ish, which included a long list of the accomplishments - I thought I'd go find the references after getting the map laid out. Next time I'll sandbox it or something.  But I reversed your total, blind reversion because there was otherwise good edits in there that were warranted.  I'd also suggest, as an editor, trying to see what was being accomplished and attempt to assist realizing the same goal of a fair, balanced, accurate, objective article rather than rip/revert which is essentially needlessly and completely destructive. The null article stood biased for a long time -- where was your mighty pen then?  Had you visited it before? Were you aware of how biased it was and how unrepresentative of the total picture it presented?

I apologize for the misuse of the "minor" edit tag.  

As to whether CANHELP provides misinformation today I do not know, but that is a libelous statement if untrue. 

It appears you yourself have your own biases.

[[Phenomenon]] usually means an empirical event for which there is evidence beyond anecdote.

However, were there other "phenomena" during the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]? Eclipses? Tearing of the Temple Curtain? Perhaps.... they were reported, though there is no corroborating evidence. The term is probably not properly used in our article, and the article also seems to delve into rather tenuous territory with guesses as to what actually occurred and what didn't.

Some users, including {{user|Ἀλήθεια}} and {{user|HokieRNB}}, seem convinced that these are well-documented phenomena. This reminds me a lot of the "UFOs as phenomena" wars of some years past.

Help?

Not sure where else to turn. This is a word usage issue and seems vaguely pedantic.

"Symbols" tends to ring alarms because historically the word has been used to dismiss without consideration the reality of the events/phenomena/whatever. But I wouldn't object to "phenomena". The naturalistic explanations need to be segregated into a "some have tried to explain" section following an explanation of what the signs signify.

[[User:Al Khazar|Khazar]] ([[User talk:Al Khazar|talk]]) 01:18, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::These are still guesstimates, necessarily so since after the fall of the Soviet Union, ethnic definitions in census surveys began to be dropped, and the infobox whatever the figures, should add 'guesstimates vary:...' or something of that sort. The reason is that, as usual, you have several overlapping categories (a) self-descriptors (complicated by political motivations: a Jewish identity can give you aliyah rights); (b) rabbinic calculations which however confuse (c) religious Jews (d) people of Jewish descent on either sides (which in orthodox rabbinical thinking is problematical, but is used because it tries to guess the numbers by descent that, with appropriate measures, can re-enter the fold. There was an old premise, [http://www.worldpopulationstatistics.com/russia-population-2013/  used by statisticians as a rule-of-thumb, that Moscow's Jewish population represents roughly 10% of the Federation's Jewish population]. Moscow was one of the great capitals of Eastern Jewry; and there is a distinct Moscow Jewish dialect often used, among Jews, but also by non-Jewish Muscovites, as a marker of identity. In 2002, that population was 79,359, according to the full table for that year by Jews in all of the Federation can be found [http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/English/4-2.xls here]. In 2010, due to emigration that went down to about 50,000 ([[Ethnic groups in Moscow]]). But [[YIVO]] cites the same census for 2002 as indicating [http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Moscow  148,000 Jews lived in Moscow]. One must again assume a conflict between self-descriptors (the lower figure). The rule of thumb would then give us anything from a half million to 1,500,000 for the whole Federation, depending on what classification is used (self-description/ ascription by descent). All this is [[WP:OR]] however, useful to indicate the order of confusion. The rule-of-thumb, given the patterns of internal immigration post 1989 and external emigration (aliyah etc) is no longer valid, since Mark Kupovetsky, a demographer, says Moscow's figure equals half of the Federation's population these days, and St Petersburg's 20%. His guestimate based on the 2010 census should probably be used because he is director of biblical and Judaic studies at the Russian State University. According to his preliminary estimate in October 2010 [http://www.jta.org/2010/10/24/news-opinion/world/russian-census-to-find-large-jewish-drop-expert-predicts#ixzz he believes the current census will show 40,000 to 60,000 fewer Jews than the 233,000 Jews from the most recent Russian census, in 2002. The first post-World War II census, in 1959, revealed 875,000 Jews.]  From this one can see that figures vary from the Rabbi's 900,000 to Kupovetsky's 233,000 a vast difference that requires wikipedia editors to adopt a span of figures of the kind given in these and other sources.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 10:25, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:: Throughout Soviet times, it was optional to list your nationality as 'Jewish'  as opposed to 'Russian' on official documents (e.g. birth certificates), so a large proportion of the population opted for 'Russian' as their nationality (and doing so was lightly encouraged by the Soviet authorities, and became increasingly common as the years progressed). The same voluntary choice is available in the census up to today, and people of Jewish descent will regularly give their nationality as 'Russian'.  (Just as a large proportion of American Jews would describe their nationality as 'American').  It's not even asked as a religious question, but rather one of choosing between mutually exclusive  'nationalities'.  [[User:Avaya1|Avaya1]] ([[User talk:Avaya1|talk]]) 15:45, 15 May 2014 (UTC)

It's the estimate of the community itself - he says in the second source that 'we estimate the community is over a million'. This is the head of community, the Chief Rabbi of Russia, and the head of the FJCR. And it has been repeated many times. Objecting to it on the basis that it is a 'fringe theory' is bizarre. How is the official position of the community conceivably counted as a 'fringe theory'?  The ~ in front shows that it is a rough estimate. The variety of different estimates can be listed in the infobox (prefaced by the statement: 'different estimates have been given'), but removing the estimate of the community's own officials makes no sense. The reason for the discrepancy is partly that the census asked only nationality, but also depends on whether they are including first or second or third generation Jews (the larger figure is referring to the number of people with Jewish grandparents).  [[User:Avaya1|Avaya1]] ([[User talk:Avaya1|talk]]) 15:03, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::'Community'(here, the head of a community's personal opinion) estimates are not considered to be reliable by wikipedia. There are statistics from research groups or the states involved, and we use these. You did not apparently, in any case, note that the estimate by Mark Kupovetsky cited for the 200,000 figure comes from the director of biblical and Judaic studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities. Secondly, Israel does not classify as 'Jews' 240,000 who made aliyah (26%) of the 979,000 who emigrated after 1990. Rabbis in Israel invoke halakha for this distinction: what does our rabbi here invoke to include everyone with a Jewish ancestor as a Jew? If his definition is not the one current in Israeli rabbinical circles, it does look very much as though it is a '''fringe''' estimate, since it has no basis in the statistics of official censuses, and diverges strongly from Kupovetsky's estimate (the rabbi's figure almost doubles the official figure given in [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=uQzfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA150 the Russian census for 1989, 551,047,] on the eve of an emigration that then reduced the community by 40%-50%.

::::Looking further, the situation of that infox box (what does 'enlarged' mean? All the figures are at variance). The 2010 census counted (according to M. Wesley Shoemaker, [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=xaCaAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110 'Russia and The Commonwealth of Independent States 2013,''] Rowman and Littlefield, 2013 p.110) 150,000 Jews, or 265,000 (according to the European Jewish Conference figure [http://www.eurojewcong.org/communities/136-russian-federation.html  here]), which however is oddly higher than the [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/140268 2002 figure of 233,000], of 8 years earlier (oddly because emigration continued). One Jewish source said 3 million. In another the Muscovite population was put 5 times higher than the latest official estimate because someone local Jewish organization had calculated it (a quarter of a million) by consulting 'Jewish-sounding names' in the Moscow directory, which is bizarrely stupid! You can't have a gap of that size and be credible. So the whole thing should be reorganized with official statistics, and Jewish demographer results, with no material cited from sources that fail one of those two criteria. The 'private figures' or personal guesses bby people like Berel Lazar are also influenced by donor prospects: the higher the estimation, the more funds (so many sources report), and must, in lieu of acceptable data, be dismissed as fringe speculation, esp. since it seems to be based on surveys of names and highly subjective, certainly not halakhic, ideas of who is Jewish.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 19:14, 15 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::The estimate of the Catholic Church for the number of Catholics would hardly come under [[WP:Fringe]] - their estimate wouldn't necessarily be correct, but certainly it would count as a notable and interesting estimate.

E.g. http://www.jewish.ru/news/cis/2008/02/news994259285.php

::::::In such a case as Russia, the census data is known to be completely misleading, since, unlike censuses in other countries, it asks people to choose between the mutually exclusive 'nationalities' of either 'Jewish' or 'Russian'. Across the Soviet period, a large proportion of Jews counted their nationality as 'Russian' in censuses and official documents, as they were encouraged to do so.  The distinction between core and enlarged is used by DellaPergola for his estimates (I agree applying it to the rabbinate's estimate is not essential).  As for Nishidani's comments. The rabbinate's estimate is referring to Halakhic Jews only, so it's not a definition in anyway at odds with the Israeli rabbinate. The speculation about donor funds and telephone directories and so on is just that - speculation. [[User:Avaya1|Avaya1]] ([[User talk:Avaya1|talk]]) 21:19, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::To repeat, how governments and various interested parties interpret who is a Jew and not a Jew is completely subjective since (a) geneticists (b) halakhic lawyers (c) various reform sects (b) states view it differently. The Russian statistics reflect self-descriptors, all others represent exo-descriptors. The former is accurate as to how people perceive their identity, the latter suffes wild swings depending on who wants to push the numbers up or down. We are obliged to stick to official statistics because the rabbis can't make up their minds between 500,000, 1 million and 3 millions, and their arguments are, at that, completely non-halakhic and therefore self-contradictory. People consult info boxes for basic facts, not speculative guesses that vary wildly.

Mass material being added by a user who has become friendly with Russell Targ to this article, but unfortunately most of it is being sourced to paranormal fringe book by a remote viewer Paul Smith (2005). ''Reading the Enemy's Mind: Inside Star Gate: America's Psychic Espionage Program'' - and page numbers are not even given. Paul Smith is a psychic remote viewer and is the owner of a remote viewing company but does not appear to be that notable [http://www.rviewer.com/]. I am not opposing that this source cannot be used at all it can but not undue weight, but please see the latest section at the bottom of the article which was added entitled "methodology". There is some extreme fringe claims here all sourced to only Paul's book without any page numbers. I could not find any reliable sources for most of this information either. Lot's of other fringe material has been inserted into the article which seems impossible to verify with reliable sources. Perhaps someone who is well researched in this subject can take a look.

Please cite this essay as part of explanations to support [[WP:FRINGE]].

If anyone has any questions comments or editing suggestions, let me know.  There are other similar topics that I may also write essays on when I get round to it, so I don't want the essay wandering off topic too much if that topic can be covered elsewhere.

This is partly inspired by {{user|QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV}}'s magnificently succinct [[WP:MAINSTREAM]].  But this covers primarily what MAINSTREAM means, rather than as a general point.

== Fallout from deletion of [[:Category:Pseudoscientists]] ==

Given the conversion into [[:Category:Advocates of pseudoscience]], we now have a probably abortive proliferation of subcategories which are now the subject of [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2014 May 22#Pseudoscientific fooers|a deletion discussion]]. In my opinion, the decision to restrict the new category was ill-advised, because it cut loose anyone who wasn't already in one of the extant subcats. I don't see these new subcats as a solution that's going to survive review, because they create the same problem as existed before, only a level down the tree. In the spirit of the rename, I would suggest something like [[:Category:Advocates of fringe physics]], and so forth.

But the other problem is that a lot of articles got cut loose and now have no categorization under fringe advocacy at all. Ideas about solving these problems? [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 01:28, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

:That accusation is flatly false.  I added to the article nearly ''all'' of the criticism, including harsh criticism.  I think that the greater problem is shown to be that I also added, in keeping with [[WP:UNDUE]], significant minority viewpoints that offer some support.  There were no problems until I added that, and you show no concern when someone else edits while violating [[WP:TE]] to remove all of the support, but leave all of the harsh criticism that I added [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer#Severely_biased_editing relevant talkpage section]].

:The closing allegation is absurd, alleging, "Talk page loaded with walls of philosophical rhetoric arguing for only the gentlest of criticism".  My very first long post on a Fetzer talkpage was my only great "wall"—my only talkpage post so long as nearly unendurable by anyone but a talkpage devotee—and it was to ''keep''  criticism in the Fetzer article [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer/Archive_2#reverted_COI_edits talkpage section]].  That talkpage section began when someone—who later became my most ardent opponent on the talkage—reverted  all of my edits by solely alleging [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] via the sole evidence that I had recently used two different IP addresses.  I reverted the reversion and ''briefly'' explained on the talkpage the absurdity of that reasoning.  Then someone posted in that same talkpage section to cast support for my edits.  But soon I added the article's two most authoritative, reliable, secondary sources: [[ABC-CLIO]] indicating the Fetzer lost mainstream credibility; [[Palgrave Macmillan]] posing Fetzer as antisemitic via comments similar to [[David Duke]]'s.  Then the supporter of my edits began persistently, cunningly editing away the criticism.  Fed up, I posted in that same talkpage section a great "wall" of "philosophical rhetoric"—actually, of ''critical analysis''—exposing the sly, subtle machinations of argumentation and editing to remove criticism of Fetzer and then even make the article say the very opposite of what the Palgrave Macmillan citation said.  But, you see, I am the sole editor who sincerely ''tries'' to keep a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point of view]] and who made the article look ''respectable''.  So the editors who blindly oppose Fetzer scapegoat me for whatever the article's alleged faults: actually just that it no longer resembles a conspiracy theorists' fanzine incidentally making Fetzer appear respected by only the ''crazy''.

If I am the one who first used the word ''found'', please forgive me.  I usually read scholarly sources, where we do not confuse opinions for gospel.

Yet here I show the absurdity of this situation.   Fetzer's opponents at the Fetzer article had taken me down, while LuckyLouie dragged me here, in late October 2013, whereupon I left the article saying, "Fetzer has complained that alleging anti-Semitism is a handy ploy to neutralize 9/11 dissent, rather" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&oldid=578841006#Alleged_anti-Semitism here]].  I returned on 12 March 2014 to revise the lead, and then revised the antisemitic section where, I admit, I used ''found'' instead of ''complained'' in a largescale rewording to make the criticism, too, more trenchant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&diff=prev&oldid=599244896 difference]].  Yet [[User:Csp0316|Csp0316]] reverted some of my edit, restored the sentence with ''complained'', somehow also kept the sentence with ''found'', and in the edit note directed me to the talkpage [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&diff=next&oldid=599245356 difference]].  Already underway, the section titled [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer/Archive_2#Problems_with_anti-semitism_paragraph "Problems_with_anti-semitism_paragraph"] alleged that the antisemitic section, whose most authoritative secondary source was the one that I added via Palgrave Macmillan and was critical, was biased ''against'' Fetzer.

::On 14 March 2014, on the talkpage, I sought to address all concerns, and presented for criticism my proposed redo of the whole antisemitic section.  Awaiting responses, I found none respond.  So on March 16, I edited while deleting the redundant sentence and stated, "Fetzer has asserted that antisemitism 'has been used as a political club to attack research on 9/11 whenever consideration has been given to the possibility of Israeli involvement in the crime' " [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&direction=prev&oldid=599939760#Jewish_controversies here]].  But LuckyLouie—who now dragged me to the Fringe noticeboard again—wholly reverted my edit while in the edit note wholly declaring, "Silence doesn't mean consent.  Reads like a whitewash" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&diff=next&oldid=599911718 here]].  (Thus, LuckyLouie kept ''me'' from replacing ''found'' with ''asserted''.)  After that, I avoided editing that section, how [[User:Paul Barlow|Paul B]] found in it ''found'', which [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] found upon scanning the article as seemingly the sole problem via [[WP:POV]]: "Found? That's having Wikipedia say he's right". Will someone have the decency to protect me from this inane abuse not by Dougweller, but by Fetzer opponents? Dougweller, I apologize for responding sharply.

When I pointed out that you were saying that he wants more government conspiracies, your only defense was that I should have known you didn't mean to say that.

Physicists knew better, but, busy developing the Standard Model, were so steeped in QFT—quantum field theory—that their talk, largely metaphorical, perhaps even metaphysical, was intelligible to the public, while the mathematics, variously sloppy and steep, warded off even philosophers of physics."

:::::::Actually, the current version lacks comma after ''usually'', which was a typo that I already corrected.  The irony is that even with the comma, it is ''grammatically'' correct, just speaks somewhat differently.  That you cannot understand it suggests that perhaps the shortcoming is not in someone's ''writing'' ability.  Also, why did you not quote the current article version to make your case?  Anyway, the other typo that you quote is ''intelligible'', which ought to have been ''unintelligible''. And, no, it is not original research.  Had you checked the sources, perhaps you would have learned that that's what the sources indicate.  Why are you trying to argue with someone whose main interests in life are theoretical science and philosophy of science and who is studying to become a theoretical biophysicist?

::::::::As usual, your response is narcissistic posturing. The problem is OR. It's essentially just a stream of assertions. "Roughly two" is nonsensical. The division between "populist" and "professional" is unsourced and highly dubious. The distinction is, in any case, a false dichotomy.... The last sentence is simply absurd.

:::::::::I think you're narcissistic and bombastic, since you're contradicting mainstream physics, philosophy, and claiming that I added bogus citations, and posing yourself as the master of grammar.  I did not open the accusations—you did.  Who are you?  What makes you the expert to know what is bogus in physics and philosophy? [[User:Occurring|Occurring]] ([[User talk:Occurring|talk]]) 18:39, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::::You allege, "The division between 'populist' and 'professional' is unsourced and highly dubious. The distinction is, in any case, a false dichotomy".  Yet you yourself quoted that I said "roughly two", not ''exactly two''.  Anyone familiar with [[philosophy of science]] knows until the 1960s, [[logical empiricism]] dominated the discipline and took as its paradigmatic science [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—what they identified as the [[fundamental science]]—which by then was predominantly instrumentalist.  [[Instrumentalism]] is a type of ''antirealism''.  [[Scientific realism]] is ''realism''.  It is indeed a rough dichotomy well recognized by philosophers of science [1].  Why did a popular science writer pose that "many scientists came to see common sense as an impediment to progress not only in physics but also in other fields" [2]?  Will you come down from the populist cloud?

:::::::::Kreutzberg clarifies, "Science and the general public often have differing views on what makes a statement or a theory relevant and credible. For scientists, relevance and credibility are the result of a logical chain of arguments that are supported by experimental proof. By contrast, plausibility and general agreement play central roles in public debates. It is possible that a plausible public statement contains no truth whatsoever, whereas a scientific theory backed by a wealth of research data is not credible to a nonscientific audience. Anyone who wants to communicate science to the general public needs to be aware of this conflict and must learn how to deal with it in public debates. This involves knowing and following certain rules that are often contrary to the general beliefs of the scientific community" [3].  In the "Instrumentalism" article, I already cited on physics [[Roberto Torretti|Toretti]] in [[Cambridge University Press]], Stanford in [[Oxford University Press]], and Kuhlmann in ''[[Scientific American]]''.  Who are you to declare my citations "fake"?

Well, you can see the [[WP:OWN]] the Fetzer article's up against. One of the hazards when you get out on the fringe is that most people who've ever even heard of Conspiracy Guy X have done so because they're already on the bwahaha bandwagon, and you get articles like the current state of this one. That Fetzer himself keeps coming back to edit it doesn't help much either. [[User:Fleenier|Fleenier]] ([[User talk:Fleenier|talk]]) 19:06, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

:Yes, you're up against someone who finds that the article is owned by Wikipedia, not by its bargain basement of democracy, which [[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not]]. As to what "Fetzer" is doing to the article, how in the world do you even know that that is really James H Fetzer: the fact that the Wikieditor has ''Fetzer'' in his or her Wikipedia ID?  The suggestion that I have edited the Fetzer article as I have since I was "already on the bwahaha bandwagon" is sheer speculation and biased presumption that suggests that the accuser is the one fixated on conspiracy theories.

:As I have already stated in the archived talkpages of the Fetzer article, I did not even know that Fetzer was a conspiracy theorist until I Wikilinked to the Fetzer article, and then went to look at it—whereupon I was shocked—while I was authoring the article "[[DN model]]" and included Fetzer among the sources and citations.  Until October 2013, I knew Fetzer solely as the preeminent authority on the master [[logical empiricist]], [[Carl Hempel]].  Once I made the shocking discovery, I added nearly every reliable, secondary source and added nearly all of the criticism of Fetzer's conspiracy claims.  Until I did that, it was indeed just a board of his various claims.  I think your gripe is that I added also what support exists, not only criticism.

{{outdent}}@Occurring. Well, the [[WP:BATTLEGROUND]] stuff is a problem. And it starts on your own [[User:Occurring|user page]] where you rail against [[User:Frizzmaz]] and the witchhunting mob" at [[WP:FTN]]. I don't have to tell you, [[WP:UP#POLEMIC| that's not a good use of your user page]], and it's very off-putting to others. I also think you can see there is agreement among editors that your English language writing skills, as applied to the article text, are less than ideal. There are problems with the article, particularly the Conspiracy theories section. Some of this may be due to confusing grammar. Some of it may be due to undue weight on primary sources. Forget the personal Talk page conflicts for the moment. Are you willing to work with other editors to remedy the problems at the [[James H. Fetzer]] article? When I have a free block of time, I had planned to help do the cleanup work needed. But if you're going to simply revert changes, then I'd rather not waste my time. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 23:21, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

::The irony is that your citation to reveal what I allegedly did wrong on my userpage says, "Users should generally not maintain in public view negative information related to others without very good reason. Negative evidence, laundry lists of wrongs, collations of diffs and criticisms related to problems, etc., should be removed, blanked, or kept privately (i.e., not on the wiki) if they will not be imminently used, and the same once no longer needed".  But your dragging me here to the Fringe noticeboard where you air and incite delusional, paranoid, grandiose, abusive fabrications, confabulations, and lies about my edits evidences that I actually had a very good reason to place it on my userpage.  My only seeming transgression is that I failed to remove it.  Indeed, I always suspected that you would drag me here again to try to rally a lynching of me with your lying about me.  I affirm that you are, indeed, a leader of withchunt mob.  I ought to report your abuse of the Fringe noticeboard. [[User:Occurring|Occurring]] ([[User talk:Occurring|talk]]) 02:18, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

:Please, stop ''making'' this a battleground, which you now even extend to my userpage.  My userpage explains why I at last ''made'' a userpage: someone alleged that I was using two different IP address, reasoned that that conflict of interest, and therefore reverted all of my edits.  My userpage does not even mention ''Frizzmaz''.  That identity is revealed only if one vets by clicking a hyperlink in my userpage's note #1, which verifies Frizzmaz's deed.  Frizzmaz started a talkpage section to claim credit for it.  My note #1 neutrally, briefly summarizes that and how I rebutted.  (The hyperlink on my userpage no longer works, as the talkpage got archived [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer/Archive_2#reverted_COI_edits elsewhere]].  That you alleged I "rail against Frizzmaz" shows the problem: you confabulate via paranoia and delusion when you read what I wrote.  Thus, I characterized ''you''—but without ''identifying'' you—as the leader of the witchhunting mob since you had dragged me to this ''fringe'' tribunal via your paranoid, delusion.  It was your allegation that I had problem with the Fetzer article's lead calling him a "leading conspiracy theorist".  No, ''I'' am the one who called him that in the lead, and obviously you had no problem with it.  Yet you stripped me of credit for it, and then tried to use it against me here by absurdly inverting reality against me.

:I had opposed your deleting from the lead that Fetzer had been an ''investigator'' of alleged government conspiracies.  You insisted the lead to term him a ''proponent'' of government conspiracies, your argument of how he could not be an investigator of them.  I pointed out that you were saying he wanted more government conspiracies.  Yet as a proponent of ''conspiracy theories'', and an investigator of alleged government conspiracies, Fetzer is an opponent—not proponent—of government conspiracies.  You had conflated  conspiracy theories (types of ''explanations'') with government conspiracies (types of ''crimes'').  Ever since, you have been on vendetta to show me illiterate.  Each time, I have shown you with your foot in your mouth.  Thus, apparently, via ''escalation of commitment'', your allegations have reached absurd paranoia and delusion to scapegoat me for anything you can think to criticize about the article, despite admitting that you not quite read it.  In the meantime, you go looking at my userpage, perhaps vet it by checking the notes, and then airing more lies about me here.  And yet you do not think that you dragged me here so that you can recruit a witchunting mob against me?  If you felt embarrassed by our earlier interaction, I apologize for leaving you to feel embarrassed.  Perhaps, indeed, I could have explained it clearer and more gently.  Given my personality type, INXP—half INFP but half [[INTP]]—I often cannot see how others cannot see distinctions that seem clear to me.

:As to my writing at Wikipedia being unclear ''in some places'' to a number of readers, I have no problem with that criticism.  Yet as I once first thought that I would become an essayist, and have had my writing perennially praised as exceptionally expressive, succinct, and lucid, I know very well that I write very well, including through grammar, despite some typos.  One of my college professors asked to copy one of my papers as an exemplar to show other students the ideal way to answer the essay question.  It was that professor's class whereby I learned of essays by [[James Baldwin]], my inspiration as essayist.  And as it happens, I did have trouble at first reading his writing, since his style is intricate, using many commas to craft a portrait with words.  Thus, I developed a similar intricate style, but certainly one grammatically correct to advanced readers.  And it was my English instructor from whom I learned of ''[[The Elements of Style]]''.  Thus, I began from basics.  Merely, my writing can be too advanced for many readers.  As to the Feter article, I never once tried to prevent rewording of my writing.  I dispute, rather, that my writing is incoherent, illegible, and aggrandizing fringe theories out of proportion to their regard by society's persons whose role it is to assess theories.

:Reading my writing at Wikipedia, one simply faces the startling reality that scientists, scholars, judges, politicians, and so on do not even nearly all believe what ''you'' apparently believe and want others to believe.  Wikipedia is not a soapbox for you to promulgate your own worldview, regardless of how popular it is among laypersons.  If there continues further large deletions of material cited to secondary sources—far more reliable than your mere opinion by Wikieditor mob—and especially if it deletes nearly only ''support'' of some Fetzer's views or accomplishments, but leaves all the harsh ''criticism'' that I added, I will do my best to seek formal redress, and perhaps even try to get a group of scholars to take more interest in Wikipedia.  I also vigorously oppose blind deletion of criticism.  Yet as to the putative atrocity that I have made the Fetzer article so bad that you cannot even read it unless it is deleted and started again from scratch, you say, "Some of it may be due to undue weight on primary sources".  I am not the one who added the primary sources—so why lay that complaint at my door?  If you want to delete the primary sources about his various, minor conspiracy theories, go ahead.  When I found the article, it was nearly completely primary sources.  I shrank them down to minimally represented: one paragraph.

:I think I added a grand total of one primary source: it indicates how Fetzer himself, being interviewed, says he became involved in investigating the JFK assassination [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&oldid=610484312#JFK_assassination §"JFK assassination"]].  I had added to the article its sole authoritative, secondary source giving a biographical review [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&oldid=610484312#Conspiracy_claims note#7]].  As I found it, the article's solee authoritative, secondary source was Bugliosi's book on JFK conspiracy theories, and quoted to praise Fetzer as "good and sincere", "the editor of the only exclusively scientific books (three) on the assassination" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&oldid=610484312#Conspiracy_claims note#30]].  I dug into the book, exposed that Bugliosi aimed to ''debunk'' JFK conspiracy theories, and added Bugliosi's conclusion that Fetzer was wrong, and I addd Bugliosi's main argument ''why''.  Further, I added the hyperlink to Google Books so that one can vet that for oneself.  If you want to take more weight off primary sources, go ahead and be my guest.  For all I care, go ahead and delete them.  May this record attest to your leading a witchhunting mob against me via your own paranoia and delusions and lies about me.

Fallibility is a foundational principles in philosophy and science, while I readily accept that I often "fail to achieve that goal" of "communicating to readers clearly and accurately".  I welcome improvement to render my writing understandable to a wide readership.  You are obviously an utter novice in philosophy of science, and wholly lost in the English and mathematics of [[particle physics]].  Loftiness and obscurity are perhaps the most notorious traits of language of philosophers and physicists.  Combine them both via someone studying both, and what do you expect?  You are an enemy to your own avowed aim.  How is that you read my post to someone else, and responded about that—about my English writing—but did not respond to my latest post to you.  Is it since I exposed your fraudulent posture of expertise in philosophy of science?

:::::In the "[[Instrumentalism]]" article, since I knew very well that I was revealing truths shocking to a novice, my notes in the lead directly quoted authoritative sources.  But here, you alleged that I stated a "false dichotomy".  The rough dichotomy, however, is well explained by direct quotes in a note in the article's lead.  Instead of following the hyperlinks to Google Books, you asserted here on the Fringe noticeboard, "Many of his edits have fake 'citations', that are, in fact, just more of his own utterances [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Instrumentalism&diff=prev&oldid=610445058]".

When I asked why you are arguing with someone whose main interests—as one might well gather through my own userpage—are theoretical science and philosophy of science, while I clarified here that I am studying to become a theoretical biophysicist, your own response was [[WP:NPA|personally attacking me]].  Your writing is obnoxious, how you introduced yourself to me and have uniformly written to me.  You lack the decency to either even acknowledge your error or even just let it go once I showed your foot in your mouth, as perhaps only village atheists could deny.

You could simply and accurately stated "improved wording" or even "unclear sentence" when, actually, you also deleted a key aspect of the sentence.  And amid your paranoid, grandiose delusions while feigning expertise here on Fringe noticeboard, on the Fetzer talkpage you started a section titled [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer#Babble "Babble"], where you babbled your categorical, absolute attack as "unintelligible" one sentence in the article.  Yet as a genius, you somehow interpreted it correctly, and asked if I had meant such.  Why go through all of that?  I had directly quoted a book explaining what happened, placed it in the citation, and hyperlinked to it on [[Google Books]].  Please, stop abusing the Fringe noticeboard, the Fetzer talkpage, and a fellow Wikieditor.

You thereupon warned, "I'd suggest that you might want to back away from that line of argument.  I don't think you'd like how that thread would inevitably work out".  Yet your paranoid conclusion that you project onto me—''I must not have read it all, oh yeah, that must be it''—was already contradicted by my actual conclusion, no argumentation offered, that merely suggested your failure to finish reading it.  With added chapters, the third edition—the one I read—corrects a common misreading of their thesis advising to cut wordiness and render the reading maximally swift.  Not advising one to be brief or laconic in a composition—let alone to limit number of compositions—they advise maximal efficiency, concentrating expression within any composition.  They urge one to ''make every word tell''.

::::::::One of my replies to your posts revealed my interest in ''[[logical empiricism]]'', whose founding thesis was that most of humankind's problems reduce to misunderstood language.  I even announced my personality type, INXP—half [[INFP]] known for writing eloquence, and half [[INTP]] known for devastating argumentation—but you failed to heed that except to thump your chest.  As to your downright crude and common reasoning and argumentation errors, I could have named the formal names in introductory [[social psychology]] and [[deductive inference|logic]].  If I were so egotistical, why did I not do that?  You are severely self-absorbed and fixated on your own naive social [[heuristics]] via sociopolitical allegiance to allege that [[Steven E. Jones|a respected mainstream physicist]] was a fringe physicist [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer#Severely_biased_editing].  Your writing is wordy and clumsy, for instance ''I'd suggest that you might want to back away from that line of argument''.  Enlightened by Strunk and White, that becomes ''I suggest you retract that argument''.  If you seek to continue this, perhaps if you are masochistic, it could be ''I suggest you reroute your argument''.  Yet to make it logical, too, try ''I suggest you retract your conclusion''—I made no argumentation—or try ''I suggest you restate your conclusion''.

::::::::At the initial round of allegations, seeing myself up against Goliath, an ogre with one eye, I split up rebuttals so that no Wikieditors feigning attention deficit disorder's inability to read a "wall"—a wall aimed to settle the dispute once and for all—could tacitly insist to rehash brief accusations amid mob rule for months.  At LuckyLouie's allegations, I spliced my rebuttals into multiple compositions, each a historical and critical review terse yet trenchant.  Lacking refutations, LuckyLouie then changed horses midstream about the nature of the problem.  LuckyLouie newly alleged it to be my own userpage, and then speculated—once LuckyLouie remembered the Fetzer article—that it ''might'' be the putative abundance of primary sources.  I made my only lengthy reply, then.  It opens by succintly rebutting the first of LuckyLouie's most recent allegations, then reviews my own view of the big problem—never my writing being either wayward or incoherent, but LuckyLouie's confused reading, perhaps my speaking too bluntly, and LuckyLouie's injured feelings—and then closes with my correcting LuckyLouie's other most recent allegation that seemingly blames me for the primary sources.  I am the one who ''tamed'' the primary sources, and scarcely care if they are deleted.

::::::::To side with the fraudulent philosopher of science who mistook the writing of eminent philosophers of science for my own writing, you fully declared, "I'll agree with that too.  Unnecessarily prolix, tediously repetitive, and comically egocentric.  This is not a guy who learned much from Strunk and White".  Atop your incomplete sentence violating Strunk and White's most basic counsel—a rigid foundation of basic grammar rules to build upon—you suggest abhorrence of Strunk and White's counsel to write boldly, never timidly.  Ironically, your writing is truly prolix and comically egocentric.  You actually said, "Unnecessarily prolix, tediously repetitive".  ''Prolix'' means all four of those words.  Enlightened by Strunk and White, you might have said, "Indeed, his writing is prolix and meandering—none enlightened by Strunk and White".  Yet you read by a snowballing conflation, projection, and paranoia.  My writing on this page seems prolix only if, more or less, one reads ''all'' of my compositions, but confuses them for ''one'' composition.  I hazard your personality type to be [[ESTJ]], who, as Keirsey's website finds, "like to take charge of groups and are comfortable issuing orders.  They are cooperative with their own superiors, and they would like cooperation from the people working under them.  Rank, they believe, has its obligations, but it also has its privileges" [http://www.keirsey.com/4temps/supervisor.asp].  Your tough talk—''I don't think you'd like how that thread would inevitably work out''—helped by Strunk and White becomes ''You would dislike the outcome''.

::::::::Closing, you assert, "They don't have to be directed to me [[social proof|for me to recognize]] that your argument style is working against you, not for you".  You think I speak to make you clowns like me?  [''Later note'': Odd coming from INXP, my ''PS''—my first foray into allegation/declaration ''without'' argumentation/explanation—was cheese laid on a mousetrap set for ESTJ.]  Eyeing INTP, Keisey's website finds "the greatest precision in thought and speech of all the types.  They tend to see distinctions and inconsistencies instantaneously, and can detect contradictions no matter when or where they were made", while they "are driven to find the most efficient means to their ends, and they will learn in any manner and degree they can.  They will listen to amateurs if their ideas are useful, and will ignore the experts if theirs are not.  Authority derived from office, credential, or celebrity does not impress them" [http://www.keirsey.com/4temps/architect.asp].  My argumentation silenced all that I sought to silence here, but triggered ''[[argumentum ad hominem]]''.  If able to raise the [[white flag]], why throw worse argument after bad?

May I bronze this section of the "Fringe theories noticeboard" to help protect me from you village atheists who need idols to obey in order to be civil?  On INFP, Keisey's website finds, "They have a natural interest in scholarly activities and demonstrate, like the other Idealists, a remarkable facility with language.  They have a gift for interpreting stories, as well as for creating them, and thus often write in lyric, poetic fashion" [http://www.keirsey.com/4temps/healer.asp].

:::::And who are you whereby your mere vote is important, [[User:Balaenoptera musculus|Balaenoptera musculus]]?  On the Fetzer article's talkpage, I clarified [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer#Remove_.22Conspiracy_claims.22_section.3F your fundamental misunderstanding and even contradiction of WP:FRINGE].

The entirety of a banner atop [[WP:FRINGE]]:''' ''Fringe theory in a nutshell:''' To maintain a neutral point of view, an idea that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article about a mainstream idea. More extensive treatment should be reserved for an article about the idea, which must meet the test of notability. Additionally, when the subject of an article is the minority viewpoint itself, the proper contextual relationship between minority and majority viewpoints must be clear.''

Are Fetzer's views on alleged government conspiracies ''a mainstream idea''.  Or are they are ''minority viewpoint itself''?  Before LuckyLouie opened this topic on the Fringe noticeboard, I had started on the Fetzer article's talkpage a new section specifically addressing [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]]'s concern, but LuckyLouie [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer#Tagging_for_undue_weight_to_fringe_theories still has not responded in it]].  So why did LuckyLouie instead begin a topic on it here on the Fringe noticeboard while confabulating paranoid delusions and outright lies about my editing of the article and activities on the talkpage?  Was it to be lucky in inciting a lynch mob of village atheists?

Yet LuckyLouie deigned to respond in a different talkpage section when someone proposed deleting most of the Fetzer article.  In that section, I posed a curious finding and speculation: ''The irony of this was that [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] was the one who called for the elaboration and elucidation of the reception to Fetzer's claims by adding the ''fringe'' tag and wholly stating, "Odd that there's no 'reception' or "criticism' for the many fringe theories presented here. Per WP:FRINGE, we need to present how the fringe view differs from mainstream view" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&diff=609978789&oldid=609978216 difference]].  When the article really was just a board for Fetzer's conspiracy claims made in primary sources, none of this criticism was being aired [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_H._Fetzer&diff=577555840&oldid=575889235 difference before/after my very first edit at this Fetzer article]].  Why does all of this criticism come only once I show—as LuckyLouie urged—the reception of Fetzer's "many fringe theories"?  (I already explained that there are not even "many fringe theories presented here" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:James_H._Fetzer#Tagging_for_undue_weight_to_fringe_theories here]]) Could it be that, actually, I have made Fetzer merely appear not wholly crazy?''

This article about allegedly psychic twins is very sad reading and a monument to bad sourcing. Highly promotional tone and lots of "predictions" cited to what someone heard on [[Coast to Coast]] or some obscure website, or some obscure podcast, or their own autobiography. Also lots of synthesis connecting their alleged predictions to news reports that supposedly confirm their psychic powers. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 16:55, 23 May 2014 (UTC)

: Something fishy here, if you look on Google books, absolutely no books discuss these psychics, none at all? Apart from their own book. The only other source that comes up is about 20 issues of "[[Weekly World News]]" which was a "largely fictional news tabloid" that was well known for hoaxes and exaggerated claims. Certainly not a reliable source for anything. The article should be deleted. I can't find any reliable sources at all.

Hi, I recently corrected and improved some information on the [[Germany]] page about the number of people killed during World War II and the Holocaust. Specifically, I included actual numbers and not just "millions". I also added the lower estimates given by the West German Government to the article although the article cited a German accademic ([[Rüdiger Overmans]]) whose page only had one reference on it and his claim to notability seems to be coming up with this high estimate of German soldiers killed during the war.

::Are his estimates rejected explicitly by others? Just because someone is on one tail or another of a distribution of estimates does not necessarily make them fringe. Check to see whether he is cited critically or as simply a respected example of a high estimate.

::Fringe often means generally ignored by those in the know.

:Why bother? I can't see any indication that the subject itself meets independent notability guidelines, and there doesn't seem to be much in it that is even specifically independently referenced at all. I know that there are various books like "Weird Missouri" (the state I live in, ''and I'm not even included in the book, dammit''), and books of that type could, presumably, establish notability for [[Alleged paranormal phenomena in Missouri]] or similar articles, but I don't see anything here which would do the same thing. Other lists or index articles, like maybe "Paranormal phenomena of the 12th century," or "List of global UFO sightings," might be notable, but there's nothing to indicate that this article individually meets notability, and, honestly, the lack of references raises questions about a lot of the items listed.

== [[David Wilcock]] (Cayce reborn) ==

This is the guy who thinks he's he may be the reincarnation of Cayce. I reverted some publicity links earlier today, mainly about a 'Hollywood movie' which seems to be just a dream right now. But after that I caught up with some posts on my talk page and one directed me to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vince Molinaro]] which points out that being a best-selling author, which he is, doesn't confer notability. The only RS I've found so far that actually discusses him in any depth is a source,[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S_Leq4U5ihkC&q=Wilcock%2C+David#v=snippet&q=Wilcock%2C%20David&f=false] and that is just a short paragraph. Can anyone find more or want to work on the article? [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 10:36, 4 June 2014 (UTC)

== Dark Complected Man ==
{{articlelinks|Dark Complected Man}}

Another article linked to the JFK assassination conspiracy theories. The only information that I can found about this person in reliable sources is [[Louie Steven Witt]]'s testimony about sitting next to a "Negro man". Given the lack of discussion about "Dark Complected Man" or this part of Witt's testimony in secondary reliable sources, should this be redirected to [[Umbrella Man (JFK assassination)|Umbrella Man]] or put up on Afd? Is anyone else able to find reliable sources about this person? Thoughts? [[User:Location|Location]] ([[User talk:Location|talk]]) 02:07, 6 June 2014 (UTC)

Fringe New WOrld Order pushing film. Now at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Global Eugenics: Using Medicine to Kill]], we are getting very inexperienced editors arguing to keep it with arguments such as "Having seen this film, knowing the content and people featured within. and knowing where it gets seen and the following and controversy it has attracted, i'd say it has definite notability." and " The question whether the film is notable enough for Wikipedia could be answered by more research. There's not doubt in my mind that Brooks is notable. The film follows."(while admitting lack of reviews). [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 05:44, 22 June 2014 (UTC)
