*'''Redirect''' to [[Dance Moms]]. All reliable sources that mention Mackenzie do so in the context of ''Dance Moms'', but she definitely doesn't have enough sourcing to support independent notability.

:: '''Delete/Comment''' On second thoughts, having just realised the subject is a child, and given the really strong arguments re: articles on questionably notable children on [[User:DGG]]'s recent [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eden Wood|Eden Wood]] discussion, I question whether we should have this article at all. [[User:Mabalu|Mabalu]] ([[User talk:Mabalu|talk]]) 12:03, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' it's not just questionably notable children, it's children whose borderline notability comes from being exploited by the entertainment industry in sexualized shows. We of course need an article  about the show, and I can see including the childrens name in that article, But highlighting it with an article is a clear violation of child protection.

:* {{reply to|DGG}} I'd like to draw your attention to [[Maddie Ziegler]], which is another article about a child from ''Dance Moms''. Maybe it should be nominated for deletion as well. —[[User:Mr. Granger|Mr. Granger]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Mr. Granger|talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Mr. Granger|contribs]]) 20:12, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
