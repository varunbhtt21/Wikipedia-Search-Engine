==Former professional teams==
===St. Louis Soccer League (1907–39)===
{{main|St. Louis Soccer League}}

The St. Louis Soccer League, founded in 1907, was the country's only fully professional soccer league of its day. [[St. Leo's (soccer team)|St. Leo's]], the league's only fully professional squad, dominated the standings for seven years.

Before 1914, most teams participated only in local competitions. In 1913, the St. Louis Soccer League came to national attention when St. Leo’s tied the [[Paterson True Blues]], winners of the [[American Cup]]. At the time, the American Cup was the most recognized regional cup and was the de facto [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] championship.

In 1914, the new [[United States Football Association]] established the [[National Challenge Cup]]. When the St. Louis teams entered the competition in 1918, it became the first truly national competition; over the next few years, it replaced the regional cups. St. Louis teams initially had difficulty getting past Chicago and Cleveland teams, but in 1920 [[Ben Millers]] stunned the East Coast teams by knocking off [[Fore River (soccer)|Fore River]] to become the first club outside of the northeast to win the cup. SLSL teams went to the next four finals, winning the cup again in 1922. SLSL team also went to the final in 1926, 1929 and every season from 1932 to 1939.

The club [[Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C.]] was successful during the 1930s, reaching the finals of the National Challenge Cup for six consecutive years from 1932—1937, and winning titles in 1933, 1934, and 1935.

In 1935, the SLSL began to see internal strife, including lawsuits between teams over player tampering, which led in 1939 to its dissolution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/genealogy/dad/soccer-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512021224/http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/genealogy/dad/soccer-2.html |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}</ref>

===Major League Soccer expansion efforts===
{{see also|Expansion of Major League Soccer}}
In 1993, the new [[Major League Soccer]] league looked at St. Louis and 26 other cities for original franchises, but St. Louis did not ultimately submit a bid.

The city later made several unsuccessful efforts to land a franchise as Major League Soccer expanded from 10 teams in 2004 to 19 teams by 2012. In 2007, the [[Real Salt Lake]] team came close to moving to St. Louis until the Utah governor intervened to help build a stadium in Salt Lake City.<ref>[http://www.soccernewsday.com/usa/a/1661/st-louis-unfit-for-current-round-of-mls-expansion St. Louis Unfit For Current Round of MLS Expansion"], Soccer Newsday, February 26, 2014.</ref> In 2008, efforts to establish an expansion team in the St. Louis suburb of [[Collinsville, Illinois]], foundered when MLS awarded its 16th franchise to [[Philadelphia Union|Philadelphia]], which opened play in 2010. Later in 2008, St. Louis bid for one of two MLS expansion slots to enter the league in 2011. St. Louis was considered one of the early front runners,<ref>[http://www.soccerbyives.net/2008/11/montreal-bows-out-of-mls-expansion-race.html "MONTREAL BOWS OUT OF MLS EXPANSION RACE"], Soccer By Ives, November 21, 2008.</ref> due in part to the city's soccer history and a stadium plan.<ref>[http://www.espnfc.com/columns/story?id=582785&cc=5901 "Montreal in pole position for one of the expansion spots"], ESPN FC, October 17, 2008.</ref> But the St. Louis bid lacked an ownership group with deep pockets, and MLS awarded the expansion slots to Portland and Vancouver.

In 2017, MLS was once again considering adding a team in St. Louis, beginning in 2020.<ref>http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/01/12/expansion-hopefuls-sc-stl-provide-update-st-louis-stadium-search</ref> The group of businessmen who would own the team sought various ways to get the public to help pay to build a $200 million soccer-specific stadium next to [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] in downtown St. Louis. On January 26, 2017, a funding plan was approved by the city's Aldermanic Ways and Means Committee, and later by the entire [[Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis|Board of Aldermen]], that would have redirected $60 million in city tax revenue to the new stadium. But voters rejected the plan in an April 4, 2017, referendum, leaving the city's MLS future in doubt. <ref>http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/st-louis-bid-for-soccer-team-back-in-play-after/article_e86ec674-e480-5b4e-baa7-f3119992bd19.html</ref><ref name="fox2017">{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/st-louis-mls-expansion-bid-stadium-vote-040517 |title=St. Louis votes against soccer stadium, potentially kills city’s MLS expansion bid |last=Rosenblatt |first=Ryan |date=April 5, 2017 |work=Fox Sports |access-date=April 6, 2017 |publisher=Fox Sports}}</ref>

In September of 2018, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on a meeting between officials with the Missouri Department of Economic Development and MLS representatives regarding a stadium proposal; St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson later confirmed that a new group was trying to bring a team to St. Louis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/soccer-stadium-talks-back-on-again-in-st-louis/article_d66a9e8e-1439-57be-be85-b697715d6b79.html|title=Soccer stadium talks back on in St. Louis|last=Feldt|first=Brian|work=''stltoday.com''|access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref> St. Louis's MLS bid was effectively re-launched on October 9 of that year, with Carolyn Kindle Betz and other members of the [[Jack C.
