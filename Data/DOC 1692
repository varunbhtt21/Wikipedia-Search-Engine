== History ==
[[File:Bossard 1831.jpg|thumb|The Bossard hardware store in 1831]]
The company was founded in 1831 in Zug as a hardware store by Franz Kaspar Bossard-Kolin. The earlier silk trading business inherited from his father-in-law was dissolved at the same time. The hardware store kept its local character roughly a century before the company expanded its business activity in the 1930s and 1940s to trading fasteners. The local specialized store first developed into a regional, and from the 1950s into a national, company. From the 1960s Bossard began to set up and expand an international network of bases. In the course of expansion, the company went public on the stock market in 1987. The recession at the beginning of the 1990s and the associated worsening business trend led Bossard to a review of the entire organization. In doing so the company focused on the core competence of fastening technology and the gradual selling off of all its tools, fittings and handicraft units. Bossard is active in the field of fastening technology in Europe, America and Asia. In November 2012, the Bossard group acquired the KVT Koenig Group's range of fastening technology.<ref>Bossard acquires part of KVT Group http://www.zug4you.ch/cms/output.php?id=353&article_id=5742</ref>

== Field of activity ==
The activities of the Bossard Group include the three areas of fasteners, application engineering and customer logistics. Bossard maintains an international [[procurement]] network for screws and fasteners. The company works together with 3,200 manufacturers.
