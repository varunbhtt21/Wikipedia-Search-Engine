: [[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] Long enough. New enough. He appears notable. Everything looks good. However, I don't see the hook cited in the article. Please have the claim that he wanted to be a Navy Seal and well move forward with this. Ping me on my TP when ready.

:: {{ping|EtienneDolet}} It is sourced by source 1, the USA Today source. Sentence is "He attended the United States Naval Academy, despite his acceptance into the United States Military Academy, and planned to become a Navy SEAL". Perhaps I should change "once wanted to be" to "originally planned to be"?

::: [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Long enough. New enough. I think the original hook is fine. Sources appear to be reliable. I cited the sentence for the hook. We're good to go. Good work!!!
