Article violates [[WP:BIO1E]]. PROD declined in bad faith by a user upset with me over a totally unrelated article. [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 01:36, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' article fails to establish [[WP:GNG]], long term notability of the incident. Murder-suicides are common, and this one does not seem unusual. [[User talk:Martin451|Martin'''<font style="color:#FB0">4</font><font style="color:#F00">5</font><font style="color:#F60">1</font>''']] 11:29, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Page murdered two people, with one murder by throwing them off the Golden Gate Bridge. He then jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge himself. The unusual circumstances surrounding the events make Page worthy of inclusion.  --[[User:Kbabej|Kbabej]] ([[User talk:Kbabej|talk]]) 14:57, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' Again, I would refer to [[WP:BIO1E]]. The Golden Gate Bridge is a well known [[Suicide bridge]] the second most prolific one in the world. Murder suicides are common. The only really notable aspect is that part of the event occurred on the Golden Gate Bridge. A blurb on this event in the suicide section of the Golden Gate Bridge article might be appropriate. Another point that I would also make, if this article is retained, it should be moved to [[Steven Page murder/suicide]] as BIO1E dictates that in such situations, the article should be about the event, not the person. But again, I would delete and, at most, put a small blurb in the suicide section of the Gold Gate Bridge article. [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 20:05, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strong Keep'''. Strange proposal for deletion for such high profile case. Very notable, and indeed should be listed with other notable cases that already exist. [[User:Wangleetodd|Wangleetodd]] ([[User talk:Wangleetodd|talk]]) 21:39, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  The article forks into water impact, which is interesting, but of no avail to the topic. People hitting water after being pushed, falling off of, or being thrown off of a bridge does not make the act notable.  It does appear to violate  [[WP:BIO1E]] because though two people were sadly killed, it stems from the same non-notable incident.  It simply does not meet notability standards.  --[[User:Yachtsman1|Yachtsman1]] ([[User talk:Yachtsman1|talk]]) 21:56, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', a double murder/suicide qualifies as a notable event to have an article on. I can see a name change being appropriate, though im not sure how to write it so it covers the event. I dont think B101E quite applies here, though i would agree with how we have nearly no articles on suicides from the bridge, as only a few are of already notable people.[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 16:40, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per [[WP:NOTNEWS]]. This unfortunate episode got coverage at the time - January 1993 - but per my research there has been virtually nothing written about it since. Classic example of [[WP:1E]]; with the virtue of hindsight we can see that this case did not have any lasting impact as required per [[WP:CRIME]]. I have to disagree with my friend Mercurywoodrose: murder-suicides are not notable, in fact they are sadly commonplace; there are 1000 to 1500 of them every year in the U.S. according to [http://books.google.com/books?id=dDOW75aJMR8C&pg=PA324&dq=murder-suicides+United+States&hl=en&sa=X&ei=q1lkU-7ALMGGoQSX1oGYBg&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=murder-suicides%20United%20States&f=false this reference], in other words 3-5 a day, with similar proportions in other countries.

*'''Keep''' - perhaps a namechange is needed but W:CRIME should cover this.--[[User:BabbaQ|BabbaQ]] ([[User talk:BabbaQ|talk]]) 21:58, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strong Keep''' per nom & above. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 23:35, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
