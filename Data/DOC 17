The '''Mathews Mr Easy''' is an [[United States|American]] [[homebuilt aircraft]] that was designed by Lyle Mathews and associates and produced by the [[Vintage Ultralight and Lightplane Association]] of [[Marietta, Georgia]]. It was the sixth and final design of Mathews. The aircraft is supplied in the form of plans for amateur construction.<ref name="Aerocrafter">Purdy, Don: ''AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition'', page 286.

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed to comply with the US [[FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles]] rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of {{convert|254|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The aircraft has a standard empty weight of {{convert|250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

Mr Easy features a [[strut-braced]] and [[Flying wires|cable-braced]] [[biplane]] layout, a single-seat, open cockpit, fixed [[conventional landing gear]] and a single engine in [[pusher configuration]], mounted above the tail boom tube.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The aircraft is made from bolted-together [[aluminum]] tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in [[Aircraft dope|doped]] [[aircraft fabric]]. Its {{convert|24.00|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} span wing has a wing area of {{convert|145.0|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The  standard engine used is the {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 447]] [[two-stroke]] twin-cylinder powerplant.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

Mr Easy has a typical empty weight of {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and a gross weight of {{convert|485|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, giving a useful load of {{convert|235|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. With full fuel of {{convert|5|u.s.gal}} the payload for the pilot and baggage is {{convert|205|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The standard day, sea level, no wind, take off and landing roll with a {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine is {{convert|175|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The designer estimates the construction time from the supplied plans as 250&nbsp;hours.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

==Operational history==

In the United States ultralights are not required to be registered, and in April 2014 no examples were in fact [[Aircraft registration|registered]] in the United States with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], although a total of two had been registered at one time.<ref name="FAAReg">{{cite web|url = http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/AcftRef_Results.aspx?Mfrtxt=&Modeltxt=MR+EASY&PageNo=1|title = Make / Model Inquiry Results|accessdate = 23 April 2014|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date = 23 April 2014}}</ref>
