Only the Frederick News Post source comes close to being a source that provides some evidence of notability.  We need multiple reliable, independent sources that are actually about the subject in order to establish notability. <span style="border:2px solid #0918E8;background:#067D06;">[[User:TheCascadian|<font color="white">'''The'''</font>]]'''[[User talk:TheCascadian|<font color="white">Cascadian</font>]]'''</span> 01:54, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' It has some coverage [http://www.eveningsun.com/ci_21876365/frights-at-farnsworth-house-inn] as a [[haunted attraction]] but whatever the case, the article desperately needs to be cleaned up of dizzy PR language. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 02:34, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:*I've pretty much did a thorough scrubbing of the article. The stuff was interesting, but that's something that's more appropriate for a fan website or something along those lines. I do agree that this does seem to have a good assertion for notability and I'm finding some sources as well.

:*I've also removed mention of it being on Ghost Hunters, as it's supposed to be a season 10 episode. Since they're still doing season 9 right now, I've removed it. A lot can change between now and a prospective release date and it's not uncommon for a channel to either outright cancel a specific episode, greatly edit it to remove elements, prolong the release of the episode, or any mixture of things that could prevent the episode from airing as promised. Until we have an actual airing or a lot of coverage in RS about the inn being on the show, it shouldn't be mentioned in the article.

*'''Keep'''. I've been able to find where it's gotten a lot of coverage. It still needs work to help flesh out things and it'll likely need to be watched like a hawk to prevent it from being transformed into a non-NPOV, promotional-ish article again, but it is notable.

*'''[[WP:SNOW|Snow]] Keep''' - Per [[WP:NRVE]], [[WP:HEY]] and [[WP:N]]. Topic notability is based upon ''source availability'', rather than sourcing within articles. See also [[WP:BEFORE]]. Source examples providing significant coverage include [http://books.google.com/books?id=_OB7x4gj0qoC&pg=PA46], [http://www.fredericknewspost.com/archive/article_7fe44aa4-81b7-525d-84bc-98e405a288e6.html?mode=jqm], [http://www.post-gazette.com/life/travel/2008/04/13/Gettysburg-s-haunted-address/stories/200804130210], [http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090821/LIVING/908210322], [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/blog/ed-tobin-cooking-at-the-historic-farnsworth-house/?photo=3].

*'''Keep''' Thanks to Tokyogirl. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 14:12, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Even without the excellent work by Tokyogirl79, this would've been kept by available sources.  While article improvement is always welcomed and ecouraged, AfD is not a proper mechanism for it.--[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 22:25, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
