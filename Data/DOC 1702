Title : Richard O'Rawe
Text : '''Richard Oâ€™Rawe''' is a former [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] prisoner and author of ''Blanketmen''.

==Background==
He grew up in a house at the corner of Peel Street and Mary Street in the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Lower Falls district]] of [[Belfast]].  When that house was demolished in 1970 as part of the redevelopment of the area he and his family moved to [[Ballymurphy, Belfast|Ballymurphy]].  It was there that he got involved in politics. He was interned and imprisoned in both the Crumlin Road gaol and in [[Long Kesh]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=From the cradle up|url=http://thepensivequill.am/2014/06/from-cradle-up.html|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>

==Role in the hunger strikes==
In Long Kesh prison in 1981, he was [[Provisional IRA]] press officer.  He claims that terms for ending the [[1981 hunger strikes]], accepted by the prisoners' leadership in the prison, were rejected by IRA commanders outside. He suggests that the IRA rejected the deal as the [[Irish republican]] candidate [[Owen Carron]] would have a better chance of winning the [[August 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election|Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election]] if the hunger strike was ongoing on polling day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/columnists/eamonn-mccann/will-ira-ever-admit-truth-over-hunger-strike-28520658.html |title=Will IRA ever admit truth over hunger strike? |publisher=The Belfast Telegraph |date=27 March 2008 }}</ref>
