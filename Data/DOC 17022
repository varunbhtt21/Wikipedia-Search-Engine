'''Mississippi Highway&nbsp;444''' ('''MS&nbsp;444''') is a short highway in western [[Mississippi]]. Its western terminus is at [[Mississippi Highway 1|MS&nbsp;1]], and travels eastward through {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} of farmland. The route enters [[Duncan, Mississippi|Duncan]], and ends at [[U.S. Route 61 in Mississippi|U.S. Route&nbsp;61]] (US&nbsp;61) and [[U.S. Route 278 in Mississippi|US&nbsp;278]], its eastern terminus. MS 444 was designated in 1958, and became paved two years later.

==Route description==
All of the road is located in northern [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar County]]. In 2012, [[Mississippi Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) calculated as many as 750 vehicles traveling west of US 61/US 278, and as few as 330 vehicles traveling east of MS 1.<ref name=traffic>{{cite web|title=MDOT Traffic Count Application|url=http://mdot.ms.gov/applications/trafficcounters/|publisher=Mississippi Department of Transportation|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref> MS 444 is not included as a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS), a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation.<ref name="NHS">{{cite map | title=National Highway System: Mississippi |date=November 2003  | publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] | url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/mississippi/ms_mississippi.pdf | format=PDF|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}</ref> MS 444 is legally defined in Mississippi Code ยง 65-3-3.<ref name=mscode>{{cite web|title=Mississippi Code Of 1972 As Amended - SEC. 65-3-3.

MS 444 starts at a [[T-intersection]] with MS 1 and travels eastward. The route travels through farmland in a straight line. MS 444 intersects Caston Road, a dirt road that also leads to Duncan. MS 444 continues east, intersecting minor dirt roads. East of Yates Road, the road enters a small area of trees, before re-entering to more farmland. The route curves slightly to the southeast about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later, at Sandy Ridge Road. MS 444 soon crosses the Hushpuckena River, and enters into Duncan. Near the center of Duncan, the route intersects the old alignment of US 61. The road continues east and ends at a T-intersection with US 61.<ref name=BingMaps>{{Bing maps|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&cp=34.049337~-90.799538&lvl=13&sty=h&rtp=pos.34.046399_-90.853485_near%20MS-1%20%26%20MS-444%2C%20Duncan%2C%20MS%2038740___a_~pos.34.042533_-90.739679_near%20Main%20St%20%26%20US-278%20E%2C%20Duncan%2C%20MS%2038740___a_&mode=D&rtop=0~0~0~&form=LMLTCC|title=Mississippi Highway 444|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}</ref>
