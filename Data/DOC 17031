Doyle has gained a reputation as a sitcom "[[showrunner]]" brought in when the original showrunners have been fired from troubled shows, helping the series to recover and accumulate [[100 episodes|enough episodes for syndication]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/arts/television/last-man-standing-uses-an-experienced-stable-of-writers.html |title=Keeping the Laughs on Track |first=Paul |last=Brownfield |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2018-10-17}}</ref>

Doyle is also widely credited with originating the term "bay leaf," a term of art in television comedy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-writers-panel-107-structure-of-a-sitcom/ |title=Structure of a Sitcom and Rise of the Anti-Sitcom |author=Moderated panel of five sitcom writers |work=[[ATX Television Festival]] |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2018-10-17}}</ref> A bay leaf is material written into a script with the explicit intention that it would be removed later—either in subsequent drafts or in editing of the finished episode.  Bay leaves are generally used to address unwanted network and studio notes, the "heavy-handed suggestions given by studio executives".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thewrap.com/oscar-screenwriter-worst-studio-notes-white-people/ |title=Oscar-Nominated Screenwriters Share Worst Studio Notes: ‘So Where Are the White People?’ |first=Matt |last=Donnelly |work=[[TheWrap]] |date=2017-02-10 |accessdate=2018-10-17}}</ref>
