'''J. Kathryn Bock''' is currently  professor of [[psychology]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in Champaign, Illinois, where she conducts research in the Language Production Laboratory at the [[Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology]] in Urbana, Illinois with Dr. Gary Dell.<ref name="Bock website">{{cite web|last=Bock|first=J.

Her research focuses on language production; she was instrumental in the development and explanation of structural priming. Other fields she has contributed meaningful research to include grammatical number agreement and the influences of driving on language production. Bock categorizes her current research interests into three main questions on her website. The first question concerns the type of structure used, and how the nature of thoughts dictates that. The next topic relates to word selection and ordering. The last issue deals with how errors are produced in language production.<ref name="Bock website"/>

== Structural priming ==

Bock’s   1986 paper introduced the phenomenon of structural priming in psychology.y.<ref name="Bock, 1986">{{cite journal|last=Bock|first=J. Kathryn|title=Syntactic persistence in language production|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1986|volume=18|issue=3|pages=355–387|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(86)90004-6}}<!--|accessdate=30 April 2014--></ref> There are many different syntactic constructions that can be used to convey a particular meaning. For example, the following sentences all convey the same meaning: “The boy gave the girl a cookie”, “The boy gave a cookie to the girl”, and “The girl was given a cookie by the boy”, while maintaining different structural patterns. Sometimes these structures are repeated intentionally for stylistic purposes.<ref name="Bock & Griffin, 2000">{{cite journal|last=Bock|first=J. Kathryn|author2=Z. M. Griffin |title=The persistence of structural priming: Transient activation or implicit learning?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=2000|volume=129|issue=2|pages=177–192|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.129.2.177}}<!--|accessdate=30 April 2014--></ref> But it has also been demonstrated that syntactic constructions can be repeated unintentionally. The “unintentional and pragmatically unmotivated tendency to repeat the general syntactic pattern of an utterance is called structural priming”<ref name="Bock & Griffin, 2000"/>
