'''Mark Mazzoleni''' is an [[United States|American]] [[ice hockey]] coach. He was the head coach of the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point|Wisconsin–Stevens Point Pointers]] from 1985 thru the end of the 1991, winning 3 consecutive [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] National Titles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mark Mazzoleni Year-By-Year Coaching Record|url=http://www.uscho.com/stats/coach/mid,18/mark-mazzoleni/|publisher=USCHO.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> After 1991 he took a position as an assistant coach at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|University of Minnesota]] for three seasons before he got the opportunity to be the head coach of a [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] school.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mazzoleni Joins St. Norbert as Assistant Coach|url=http://www.uscho.com/2009/10/09/mazzoleni-joins-st-norbert-as-assistant-coach/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=2009-10-09|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> Mazzoleni stepped into the [[Miami RedHawks men's ice hockey|Miami]] job after [[George Gwozdecky]] left and while he had success with the team (3 winning seasons in 5 years), he could not sustain the high level of success his predecessor had achieved.<ref>{{cite news|title=Miami Men's Hockey Team History|url=http://www.uscho.com/stats/history/miami/mens-hockey/2013-2014/|publisher=USCHO.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> He was able to parlay his experience at Miami into a second head coaching job, this time at [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey|Harvard]], replacing the embattled [[Ronn Tomassoni]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Harvard Tabs Mazzoleni|url=http://www.uscho.com/1999/07/18/harvard-tabs-mazzoleni/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=1999-07-18|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> who had not led the Crimson to a winning season in 5 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harvard Men's Hockey Team History|url=http://www.uscho.com/stats/history/harvard/mens-hockey/2013-2014/|publisher=USCHO.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> After a one-season hangover Mazzoleni returned Harvard to [[ECAC Hockey|ECAC]] prominence, winning the [[ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|conference tournament]] in both [[2002 ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2002]] and [[2004 ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2004]] while finishing as the runner-up in [[2003 ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2003]].

Similar to what he had done with Wisconsin–Stevens Point, after three successful seasons Mazzoleni left [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to take over as head coach of the [[Green Bay Gamblers]], a [[United States Hockey League|USHL]] team based in his hometown, [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. Mazzoleni seemed to be working the same magic he had at Harvard and Wisconsin–Stevens Point when the Gamblers made the playoffs in his second season, their first appearance in 4 years, but after another moderately successful campaign Green Bay took  a sharp dip in the standings, finishing the [[2007–08 USHL season|2007–08 season]] dead last with a 13–41–6 record and his tenure as coach was terminated.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007–08 United States Hockey League Standings|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/ushl19992008.html|publisher=hockeydb.com|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=College hockey: Mazzoleni rebounds as key member of St. Norbert coaching staff|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20140304/GPG020102/303040362/College-hockey-Mazzoleni-rebounds-key-member-St-Norbert-coaching-staff|publisher=Green Bay Gazette|date=2014-03-04|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> Mazzoleni did not remain idle for long, however, as he was announced as an assistant coach for [[St. Norbert College]] in October 2009, joining the staff of [[Tim Coghlin]] who had been part of Mazzoleni's first recruiting class as a head coach.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mazzoleni Joins St. Norbert as Assistant Coach|url=http://www.uscho.com/2009/10/09/mazzoleni-joins-st-norbert-as-assistant-coach/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=2009-10-09|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> As of 2014 he no longer holds that position.
