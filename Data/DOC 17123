'''Jayadewa''' or '''Jayadeva''' ([[Sanskrit]]: जयदेव, [[Baybayin]]: {{script|Tglg|ᜇᜒᜌᜇᜒᜏ}}; full title: '''Hwan Nāyaka tuhan Pailah Jayadewa'''<ref name="bagongkasaysayan.org">http://www.bagongkasaysayan.org/ebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/3.Ang-Tundo_Kimuell-Gabriel_Marked.pdf</ref>) was the name of the Lord Minister of Pailah at the time that the [[Greater India|Indianized]]-[[Sanskritisation|Sanskritized]] [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (LCI) was written in {{circa|900 CE}}.  According to the document, he served as the representative  of the "Commander in Chief" (''pamegat senāpati di Tundun'') in pardoning the descendants of an individual named Namwaran of his debts. Although no other records describe his life and works, Jayadewa is an important figure in [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|Philippine historiography]] because he is one of the persons clearly identified in the LCI, which is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines.<ref name="Morrow" />
