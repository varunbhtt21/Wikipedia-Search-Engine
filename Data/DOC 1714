The '''Putagán—Colbún railway''', locally known as the Tren Chico (Small Train), was a {{convert|33|km}} long<ref>[http://www.railwaysofthefarsouth.co.uk/06aintroduction.html Railways of the Far South - A Chilote line]</ref> {{RailGauge|600mm|lk=on}} [[narrow gauge railway]] that operated between the communities of [[Yerba Buenas]] and [[Colbún]] in the [[province of Linares]] in [[Chile]]. It was in existence between 1914 and 1956. Parts of the former trackbed were converted to roads, the L215 and L11.

==History==
Since the early twentieth century plans were made to build a railroad that would connect local communities in the [[province of Linares]] with the national rail network, especially the village of [[Panimávida]]<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/29624311@N06/3967339076/?reg=1&src=comment la estacion del tren (Spanish)] Retrieved march 4, 2012</ref> with its famous [[hot springs]]. Construction finally started in 1910 and was finished in 1913. Operations started the following year.

On October 9, 1953 a serious accident occurred near Yerba Buena when a rural bus crashed into a train, leaving 22 people dead and many injured in one of Chile's worst train disasters ever.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/pebelschile/4333223717/ Recuerdo de una tragedia (Spanish)] Retrieved march 4, 2012</ref>

Due to this tragedy and road improvements between [[Panimávida]] and [[Yerba Buenas]], with competition of minibuses and taxis as a result, operations finally ceased in 1956.
