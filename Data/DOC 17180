==Early life and education==

Born Adeodato Gregory Ressi di Cervia, Ressi is Italian-American,<ref>https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/03/the-fundeds-adeo-ressi-arrested-after-virgin-america-incident/</ref> and was raised in [[New York City]]'s [[Upper West Side]]. As a child, he asked his parents to send him to [[Arcosanti]], an experimental town in [[Arizona]], rather than traditional [[summer camp]]. He spent four summers in Arcosanti as its youngest working resident. He was often tasked with performing menial jobs<ref name="Bloom01"/> like cleaning out sewage pipes.<ref name="Wired">{{cite magazine | last =Adler| first =Carlye | title =The Man Behind the VC Slagfest at TheFunded.com Reveals Himself to Wired | magazine = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| date =15 November 2007 | url =http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-12/ff_funded?currentPage=all | accessdate =7 December 2014}}</ref> His experiences at Arcosanti piqued his interest in environmental issues and influenced his career path to some degree.<ref name="Bloom01"/>

Ressi attended college at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where he spent time as a housemate of [[PayPal]] co-founder, [[Elon Musk]]. Ressi and Musk opened an unofficial "nightclub" at their house, boasting as many as 500 patrons on a single night.<ref name="Bloom02">{{cite magazine | last =Vance | first =Ashlee | title =Adeo Ressi on Entrepreneurs and Startup Culture | magazine = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]| date =9 August 2012 | url =http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-09/adeo-ressi-on-entrepreneurs-and-startup-culture | accessdate =7 December 2014}}</ref> As an undergraduate, he founded the Social Revolutionary Club<ref name="Wired"/> and started an environment-themed campus newspaper called, ''Green Times''. He was an [[environmental studies]] major.<ref name="Forbes01">{{cite magazine | last =Cohan | first =Peter | title =Adeo Ressi's Founder Institute Sprouts Start-ups Around The Globe | magazine = [[Forbes]]| date =5 November 2012 | url =https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/11/05/adeo-ressis-founder-institute-sprouts-start-ups-around-the-globe/ | accessdate =7 December 2014}}</ref> He spent four years in college but did not receive his degree, because he wanted to use copies of ''Green Times'' as his senior [[thesis]] instead of writing a traditional paper.<ref name="Bloom01"/>

==Career==

After ending his collegiate career, Ressi co-founded Total New York, a localized news website, in 1994.<ref name="Wired"/> In 1997, [[America Online]] purchased Total New York for an undisclosed amount of money<ref name="Bloom01"/> and redubbed it AOL Digital City.<ref name="Wired"/> He founded methodfive, a web development firm, in 1995 and sold it to [[Xceed (software company)|Xceed]] in 2000 for $88 million. Ressi used the money from his previous two ventures to found Game Trust, a developer of online casual game infrastructure, in 2002.<ref name="Bloom01"/> Game Trust had a successful first round of funding in 2003, securing investments from Silicon Valley Venture Partners and [[Intel Capital]].<ref name="Wired"/>  
[[File:Adeo Ressi 2010.jpg|thumb|Adeo Ressi speaking at a conference in 2010.]]
The second round of funding was due to be provided by [[Softbank Capital]] in 2005. On the day of the deal, however, representatives from Softbank informed Ressi that they were pulling out. The investment would have been worth $10 million. Because Ressi was contractually obligated to not seek other investors while negotiating with Softbank, Game Trust was left with little remaining capital. Ressi was forced to take out a bridge loan from existing investors to keep Game Trust afloat. Even so, by the fall of 2005, Game Trust had secured $9 million in funding, including $3 million from TWJ Capital. After a failed development project at Game Trust in 2006, Elon Musk was voted off the board of directors and replaced with the son of TWJ Capital founder, Thomas Jones. Jones would try unsuccessfully to take control of Game Trust away from Ressi.<ref name="Wired"/>

Ressi eventually sold Game Trust to [[RealNetworks]] in 2007, but his experience with venture capitalists led him to start TheFunded in 2007. The website is designed to allow entrepreneurs to write anonymous reviews about venture capital groups and their processes. The website was met with derision from venture capital groups,<ref name="Bloom01"/> but proved to be popular among entrepreneurs. Ressi intended to keep the site anonymous, but news about its existence leaked to [[TechCrunch]]. The site had 1,000 anonymous entrepreneur members by March 2007. In order to remain anonymous himself, Ressi adopted the pseudonym of "Ted." In November 2007, Ressi decided to reveal his identity in a piece in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name="Wired"/><ref name="Mash">{{cite news | last =Hopkins| first =Mark | title =theFunded: Ted is Adeo Ressi | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Mashable]]| date =15 November 2007 | url =http://mashable.com/2007/11/15/thefunded-ted-is-adeo-ressi/ | accessdate =7 December 2014}}</ref> By January 2008, TheFunded had 3,600 members.<ref name="Bloom01"/>

In 2009, Ressi embarked on another venture called The Founder Institute, a [[Seed accelerator|startup incubator]] and entrepreneur training program headquartered in [[Palo Alto, California]].<ref name="Forbes01"/> The organization was co-founded with longtime colleague Jonathan Greechan. The goal of the institute is to combat startup failure and "globalize Silicon Valley."<ref name="Forbes02">{{cite magazine | last =Greathouse | first =John | title =This Entrepreneur Publicly Spanked America's Most Arrogant VCs...

In 2011, in collaboration with [[Orrick Law Firm]], Ressi and the Founder Institute released the Founder Advisor Standard Template ("FAST" Agreement),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/free-startup-docs-how-much-equity-should-advisors-get/|title=Free Startup Docs: How Much Equity Should Advisors Get?|last=Empson|first=Rip|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref> a simple legal framework entrepreneurs can use freely to create relationships with business advisors.

In 2012, in collaboration with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich Rosai, Ressi and the Founder Institute released "Convertible Equity",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/thefunded-founder-institute-and-wilson-sonsini-debut-startup-friendly-seed-financing-vehicle-convertible-equity/|title=Convertible Equity, A Better Alternative To Convertible Debt?|last=Rao|first=Leena|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref> a financing vehicle that provides all of the flexibility of [[convertible debt]] without hindering a company with loans. In addition, he was interviewed by The New York Times as part of a cover story of the Sunday Business Section of the newspaper.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/business/founder-institutes-requirement-create-a-company.html|title=Founder Institute’s Requirement: Create a Company|last=Seligson|first=Hannah|date=2012-07-28|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref>

In 2014, Ressi co-founded Expansive Ventures, a venture capital investment firm with Jon Soberg, a venture capitalist.[2].

In 2015, Ressi was featured on the cover of [[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur Magazine]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241477|title=Inside the Mindset of Silicon Valley's Tech Innovators|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|date=2015-02-13|newspaper=Entrepreneur|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref> and began writing as a Guest Contributor to [[Forbes|Forbes Magazine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adeoressi/|title=Adeo Ressi - Adeo Ressi Blog|last=Ressi|first=Adeo|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref>
