The '''Pier-2 Art Center''' ({{zh|c=駁二藝術特區|p=Bó Èr Yìshù Tèqū}}) is an [[art center]] in [[Yancheng District, Kaohsiung|Yancheng District]], [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://khh.travel/Article.aspx?a=6889&l=2&stype=1056&sitem=4076|title=The Pier-2 Art Center|publisher=}}</ref>

==History==
The arts center was originally an abandoned warehouse site due to Kaohsiung's shift from industrial city to service city. The warehouses were built in 1973. Due to the persistence of local artists, the area was finally released and remade to be an arts center. In 2006, the Bureau of Cultural Affairs of [[Kaohsiung City Government]] and under management of the Kaohsiung Pier-2 Art Development Association and [[Shu-Te University]]'s art development workshop<ref>http://superspace.moc.gov.tw/en/local_culture_page.asp?rid=189</ref> took over the center, starting a series of exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pier-2.khcc.gov.tw/e_content/about/about01.aspx |title=Pier-2 Art Center-About Pier-2 |publisher=Pier-2.khcc.gov.tw |date=2000-10-10 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref><ref>superspace.moc.gov.tw/en/local_culture_page.asp?rid=189</ref>
