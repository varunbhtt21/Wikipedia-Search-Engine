Non-notable novel series. [[User:Mikeblas|Mikeblas]] ([[User talk:Mikeblas|talk]]) 03:03, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect to [[Fiona McIntosh]]'''. The problem here is partially the time period, since this was sort of when a lot of sources weren't on the Internet like they are now, so there is a very real possibility that sources could exist. However... the problem is that I can't really find a huge amount of information to really guarantee that these offline sources actually exist. I find some mention here and there, but mostly in relation to McIntosh's later works. She's definitely notable, but I don't really think that these are notable outside of herself at this point in time. If anyone can find sources in RS, I'm willing to be swayed, but most of what I'm finding are blog reviews, brief mentions, merchant links, and other places we can't use as a RS. I think redirecting with history would be a good choice here.
