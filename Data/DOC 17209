==Music video==
===Background===
The music video for the song was released on March 2, 2014. YG Entertainment CEO [[Yang Hyun-suk]] described the music video as "set in a near-future city", and the concept is that people in the said era prefer the virtual world over the real one, just like the movie ‘[[The Matrix|Matrix]]’."<ref>[http://officiallykmusic.com/yang-hyun-suk-explains-story-2ne1s-come-back-home-mv/]</ref> Furthermore it is notable for its high production value of half a million dollars to effectively exude a futuristic vibe with the use of extensive [[computer graphics]], as well as being directed by a rookie director, Dee Shin.<Ref>[http://beyondhallyu.com/k-pop/behind-scenes-k-pop-yg-music-video-director-dee-shin-interview-pt-2/ Behind the Scenes in K-pop: YG Music Video Director Dee Shin Interview pt. 2]</ref>

"Come Back Home" garnered positive commercial and critical success, not just for its track but also for its artistic music video for portraying the song's lyrics in a metaphorical light as opposed to what could have been another tragic love story.<ref>[http://www.asianjunkie.com/2014/03/review-2ne1s-come-back-home-was-well-worth-the-wait/ 2NE1’s “Come Back Home” was well worth the wait] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228134306/http://www.asianjunkie.com/2014/03/review-2ne1s-come-back-home-was-well-worth-the-wait/ |date=2014-12-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://seoulbeats.com/2014/03/2ne1-wants-come-back-home-happy/ 2NE1 Wants You To “Come Back Home” And Be “Happy”]</ref>
