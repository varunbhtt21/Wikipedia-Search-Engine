The '''2004 [[Myanmar]] cyclone''' was considered the worst to strike the country since 1968. The second [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2004 North Indian Ocean cyclone season]], it formed as a [[Tropical cyclone scales#North Indian Ocean|depression]] on May&nbsp;16 in the central [[Bay of Bengal]]. With low [[wind shear]] and a surge in the [[monsoon trough]], the storm intensified while meandering over open waters. The storm eventually began a steady northeastward motion due to a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to the north over [[India]]. While approaching land, an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed in the center of the storm, indicative of a strong cyclone. On May&nbsp;19, the cyclone made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] along northwestern Myanmar near [[Sittwe]], with [[maximum sustained wind]]s estimated at 165&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph) by the [[India Meteorological Department]]. The storm rapidly weakened over land, although its remnants spread rainfall into northern [[Thailand]] and [[Yunnan]] province in China.

Winds from the cyclone reached 157&nbsp;km/h (98&nbsp;mph) in Myanmar, occurring in conjunction with heavy rainfall and a high [[storm surge]]. Despite the storm's ferocity, the government did not report about the cyclone for ten days, as they usually under-report on landfalling storms. The cyclone caused heavy damage throughout [[Rakhine State]], destroying or heavily damaging 4,035&nbsp;homes and leaving 25,000&nbsp;people homeless. There was widespread crop damage, resulting in food shortages, and damaged roads disrupted subsequent relief efforts. Damage in Myanmar totaled over K621&nbsp;million [[Burmese kyat|kyat]] ($99.2&nbsp;million [[United States dollar|USD]]), making it the worst storm in the country since [[Pre-1980 North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons#1968 Myanmar cyclone|1968]], and there were 236&nbsp;deaths, with an unofficial death toll as high as 1,000. Although damage was heaviest in Myanmar, the cyclone's effects also spread into neighboring [[Bangladesh]], where strong winds knocked over trees and capsized two ships.

Late on May&nbsp;14, an area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, developed in the central [[Bay of Bengal]] about 880&nbsp;kilometres (545&nbsp;miles) south-southeast of [[Kolkata]], India,<ref name="mgp">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2000|accessdate=2015-05-24|title=Monthly Tropical Weather Summary for May 2004|url=http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0405.htm}}</ref> associated with the [[monsoon trough]].<ref name="mdar">{{cite journal|page=2|author=Darwin Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|date=May 2004|title=Darwin Tropical Diagnostic Statement|accessdate=2015-05-24|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ntregion/statements/tropical/dtds-200405.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> On May&nbsp;15, the system developed into a [[low pressure area]] off the west coast of [[Myanmar]] (Burma).<ref name="imd">{{cite report|title=Report on Cyclonic Disturbances Over North Indian Ocean During 2004|publisher=India Meteorological Department|date=January 2005|accessdate=2015-05-24|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/pdf/archive/rsmc/2004.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Initially, the convection was associated with a low-level circulation center, developing good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] despite the presence of [[wind shear]].

However, the storm quickly intensified on May&nbsp;18, strengthening into a severe cyclonic storm and later very severe cyclonic storm.

A [[buoy]] near the storm's center recorded a [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of {{convert|994|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} on May&nbsp;18, the lowest recorded pressure in association with the storm.

While stalling in the Bay of Bengal, the cyclone's outskirts dropped light to moderate rainfall along the eastern coast of India. In [[Odisha]], two locations reported daily rainfall totals of {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="imd"/> Upon making landfall, the cyclone's effects spread into southeastern Bangladesh, where heavy rainfall and high winds forced about 50,000&nbsp;people to evacuate to shelters. The winds also knocked down trees and power lines. Two boats sank off [[Cox's Bazar]], leaving five fishermen missing. Later, the remnants of the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall in northern [[Thailand]], reaching {{Convert|112.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 24&nbsp;hours at the [[Bhumibol Dam]]. In the nearby [[Yunnan]] province in China, precipitation reached {{convert|75.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in [[Ruili]].<ref name="mgp"/>
