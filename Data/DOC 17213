== API error ==

Hello. I probably could RTFM on my own given enough time, but I work 50 hours a week, so, to be blunt, I don't feel like it, and I would like my bot to stop failing. 

It appears the Mediawiki API has undergone a change and no longer accepts certain parameters. 

I am getting this error message on Commons:
<pre>
API Error...

Code: rcbadtimestamp_rcstart
Text: Invalid value '20140421185257|123445826' for timestamp parameter rcstart
</pre>

Could someone please point me to documentation on this change so that I can fix it with as little time effort as possible? Thanks. [[User:Magog the Ogre|Magog the Ogre]] ([[User talk:Magog the Ogre|t]]<small> • </small>[[Special:Contributions/Magog the Ogre|c]]) 00:01, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:Nevermind, I figured it out. I was apparently taking advantage of a "bug" in the way that Mediawiki processes its queries. When the bug got fixed, my code broke.

== Public log error? ==

Hey all - I was checking out my [[Special:Log/SuperHamster|public logs]], and noticed a series of odd logs, all from around January 29, 2014. Here are a few examples:

== Everything has gone italic ==

...since I restarted just now (the first time for a while). What's happened - it's horrible?  This is not the new font introduced recently - all text displays as italic. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 13:12, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

== Minor edits ==

Is there any specific reason that this checkbox is disabled for IP editors? No opinion on whether it should be or not, I'm just curious because I'm so used to seeing it there. [[Special:Contributions/206.117.89.4|206.117.89.4]] ([[User talk:206.117.89.4|talk]]) 09:53, 24 April 2014 (UTC) ([[User:Ansh666]])

:[[Help:Minor edit]] says: "Users who are not [[Help:Logging in|logged in]] to {{SITENAME}} are not permitted to mark changes as minor because of the potential for vandalism. The ability to mark changes as minor is [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?#More editing features|one of many reasons to register]]." It has been there since the page creation in 2004. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 10:53, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

::Ah, then I'm just blind. Many thanks. [[Special:Contributions/206.117.88.5|206.117.88.5]] ([[User talk:206.117.88.5|talk]]) 16:37, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

The whole minor edit thing seems to me expendable. It's not clear to me that anybody uses or cares about this feature. And it's often subjective when to use it. It's never really helped me with monitoring my watchlist either... I still end up checking the edit to make sure it's kosher. [[User:Jason Quinn|Jason Quinn]] ([[User talk:Jason Quinn|talk]]) 22:55, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:Minor edits were disabled for anonymous users in [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2003-January/001974.html January 2003] after [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2002-December/001737.html this discussion] (which focused on bot edits and RecentChanges). I found this out by following the links from [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Minor_edit&oldid=2342236 the first version] of {{noredirect|Wikipedia:Minor edit}} (note that the actual links are broken due to the subsequent re-organization of the mailing list archives).

::Thanks for finding that. I've added a footnote to [[Help:Minor edit]]. From that disussion the change was obviously made as the bot flag had yet to exist. I think we're actually long overdue a discussion of whether the feature should be re-enabled. Perhaps I should start an RfC on the topic? — [[User:Scott|'''<span style="color:#000">Scott</span>''']] <span style="color:#900">•</span> [[User talk:Scott|''<span style="color:#000">talk</span>'']] 14:26, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

== How do I display the basic Latin alphabet after messing with language settings? ==

On my browser, this: "{{lang|yo|èdè Yorùbá}}" is a long blank.  I can't see text formatted for a lot of languages ever since I turned on automatic font downloading to display Burmese.  I turned it off, and can no longer see Burmese, but the other languages haven't come back.  Most of my work here is on languages.  How do I get normal display back?  I'm on MS7 and FF28.  — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 17:04, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

::Thanks, but no dice.

== History of image undeletion ==

In the course of recently investigating {{u|ColonelHenry}}'s sockpuppet activities, I took a look at a deleted file that he had uploaded way back in 2005. The file itself wasn't available, just the text revisions that had been associated with it. So, my question is, when did deleted files themselves start being kept by our system, or is it the case that they always were and at some point the deletion archive got cleared out? — [[User:Scott|'''<span style="color:#000">Scott</span>''']] <span style="color:#900">•</span> [[User talk:Scott|''<span style="color:#000">talk</span>'']] 13:45, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

== Inconsistent byte counts ==

Is MediaWiki having difficulty counting bytes? --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  03:28, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== WikiChecker Problem ==

I'm not sure if this problem can be dealt with, here, as the problem is off-site. However, I expect that somebody can bring it to the attention of the relevant person, who I've already attempted to contact via email.  http://en.wikichecker.com/user/ seems to have the same problem it has had in the past. That is, it isn't able to perform an analysis of anything more than the most recent 500 edits, at the moment. The problem has been in existence for at least the last day or so.

'''Recent software changes'''
* The latest version of MediaWiki ([[mw:MediaWiki 1.24/wmf2|1.24wmf2]]) was added to test wikis and MediaWiki.org on April 24. It will be added to non-Wikipedia wikis on April 29, and all Wikipedias on May 1 ([[mw:MediaWiki 1.24/Roadmap|calendar]]).

* VisualEditor now works on all Wikipedias after broken <code>MediaWiki:Common.js</code> pages (and similar) were fixed last week. [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60842]
* VisualEditor dialogs now use an animation of moving lines rather than animated GIF images.

'''Future software changes'''
* [[mw:Search|CirrusSearch]] will be enabled as a beta feature on 41 new wikis, including Meta-Wiki and the Swedish (sv), Russian (ru), Polish (pl), Japanese (ja) and Chinese (zh) Wikipedias next week. This change means that CirrusSearch will now be enabled on all Wikimedia wikis.
* [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:MultimediaViewer|MediaViewer]] will be enabled for all users on the French (fr) and Dutch (nl) Wikipedias on [[mw:Multimedia/Media Viewer/Release Plan|May 1]]. [[mw:Talk:Multimedia/About Media Viewer|Feedback]] is welcome. [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/125034/]

'''Problems'''
* For about 30 minutes on April 21, there were problems with image scaling due to a high server load.  [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/multimedia/2014-April/000271.html] [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/multimedia/2014-April/000276.html]
* On April 22, it was not possible to use the [[mw:Extension:Collection|Collection]] extension for about 90 minutes due to a server move. [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/127658/] [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/127659/]

== Page stats ==

This may be related to multiple issues. 
*Slow loading, to not loading at all, on Wikimedia pages - includes English and other languages, Commons, etc.  Been going on for days, and when it happens, I just don't bother with Wikipedia for a few hours.  It hasn't happened on my end today (yet), but it might be part of a larger picture.
*Stats noticeably down beginning April 18.  Affects not only Henrik's stats, but also Live View Stats. I noticed it on a small page, so yesterday I accessed that page over 100 times to test it. Henrik's stats says it had [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Loyal_Valley,_Texas 4 views] only.  More telling is the main page stats since April 18.    [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Main_Page Henrik's count on Main Page].   If you go to [https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikiviewstats/index.php? Wiki View Stats at Labs] and run the search, it also shows steep decline.

The issues might be related.  Is anyone looking into this? [[User:Maile66|— Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) 14:31, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:For investigating this, most browsers provide statistics (under "Developer Tools") which elements take how many milliseconds to load. --[[User:AKlapper (WMF)|AKlapper (WMF)]] ([[User talk:AKlapper (WMF)|talk]]) 06:33, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:::OK, you've both provided some insight to the loading time.  However, a look at the Main Page article traffic statistics (stats) have had a significant drop since April 18 and have remained low.  Main Page is the sample page for stats.  Probably something wrong with the dump, or however it works these days.  We have an overall article traffic statistics reporting problem on Wikipedia.

== Tabs overlapping with page title on file pages ==

[[File:Funky boxes on image pages.png|thumb]]

== When multiple P41 values exist, how to retrieve the correct one ==

When using <nowiki>{{#property:p41}}</nowiki> in a template or on a page, it returns the name of the flag image of a country/state/..., but in the case of country United States it returns:<br />
Flag of the United States.svg, US flag 49 stars.svg, US flag 48 stars.svg<br />
Three file names! In this case <nowiki>{{#ifexist:media:{{#property:p41}}|[[File:{{#property:p41}}{{!}}35px{{!}}]]}}</nowiki> has a false condition and does not show a flag image. A difference with other countries (and other geographicals) is the presence of a start date and an end date. So to solve my problem, I need to access the one with the highest start date or the one witout an end date in case of multiple values for P41. But I also need to get the ones that have no start/end date in case of a single value for p41. What can I do?

== How to simulate section headers in documentation? ==

In the [[template:Requested move]] documentation, I give some examples which create section titles. I want [[template:Requested move#Requested move|Requested move]] and [[template:Requested move#Suggested move|Suggested move]] to ''look'' like real section headers, but to ''not'' be included in the table of contents for the documentation. How can I get the "look and feel" of '''<nowiki><h2></nowiki>''' tags, including the font-du-jour for section headers–whatever that is–and the underscore line below the section title that runs across the window–but not include them in the TOC? I'm aware that there is a [[template:TOC limit]] which allows editors to not show sections below a certain level, but in this case, I want to not show level 2 headers, while continuing to show all levels ''below'' level 2. – [[User:Wbm1058|Wbm1058]] ([[User talk:Wbm1058|talk]]) 17:53, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== HTML <tag>s and section anchors ==

Using potentially-valid markup in section titles causes the direct links shown on history and diff pages to fail, since they filter out the markup during processing... The TOC links still work, probably because they're handled differently. Specific example would be ''this'' section, which generates an anchor name of "HTML_.3Ctag.3Es_and_section_anchors" (and the text within the TOC is correctly displayed as "HTML <tag>s and section anchors"), but the links from history and/or diff pages related to this section will be to "HTML_s_and_section_anchors", with a text of "HTML s and section anchors". I tried to search at [[WP:BUG|bugzilla]], but will not report myself since i'm not very confident in my ability to spot if this issues is already known there, within the tens of potential results my search returned. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes_Free4Me]] ([[User talk:Jokes Free4Me|talk]]) 11:03, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

This script can do transformations: http://jsfiddle.net/4BJKa/32/, this works alright but: (1) The table won't be sortable anymore, (2) some of the formatting, just style is lost.

To determine the best solution for this really needs more context.  For exmple Wikia has Java available, we have Lua, other sites might have only Javascript or template coding.  More important are questions like: Is this a one off?  Are the data entries fairly static?  Who will be maintaining the table?

== Finding dead links in a batch of articles ==

Dear technical experts:  Some time ago the Canadian Encyclopedia reorganized its article URLs, leaving thousands of Wikipedia articles about Canadian topics with dead links.  Later they created redirects for some of their old links, but there are still many that need repair. I have made a list of pages with these links here: [[User:Anne Delong/CE links needing update]].  An explanation of what caused the problem is here: [[Wikipedia talk:Canadian Wikipedians' notice board#Canadian Encyclopedia]].  I'd like to shorten my list by removing ones that are already working, and it would also be handy to separate out those that could be fixed automatically in case someone creates a bot, so that I can concentrate on fixing any remaining ones.  Oh, and it would be nice to have a bot...  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I was thinking, perhaps, that there might be an existing tool that could be given a batch of article names and report any 404 errors.  Then articles with no such errors could be removed from the list. &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 12:32, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:After checking only one of the articles listed on [[User:Anne Delong/CE links needing update]], the change appears to be to build the new URL from the link/citation title (in lowercase and substitute "-" for " ").  It appears that this could be done with AWB and just regular expressions, at least for a significant percentage of the links. Given that there are only about 2,900 pages in your list and that this is a one-off change it may be easier to make theses changes semi-automatically with AWB than to have a bot do it (which requires going through the [[WP:BOTAPPROVAL|bot approval process]]). You might have some success in getting these changes made if you make a request at [[WP:AutoWikiBrowser/Tasks]]. Alternately, you could [[Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser|request access to AWB]] and use it yourself. On the other hand, given the high probability that [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Anne Delong|your RfA]] will be approved, asking for AWB access at this point would be a bit redundant as you will automatically have access to AWB once you are an admin.
:It would probably be a good idea to also perform a database scan to see if there are any additional pages which link there using the old URL syntax. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Makyen|Makyen]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Makyen|talk]]) 10:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks for the advice.  I will wait and investigate this more later. I made the original list by using an external links search [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LinkSearch&limit=5000&offset=5000&target=http%3A%2F%2F*.thecanadianencyclopedia.com HERE], copying the result into a word processor, and making creative use of search-and-replace. &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 16:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

This is may be non-trivial, and hence may be worth a bot request. (Note bot requests are often answered by people doing a quick AWB job, or who already have a bot for a specific task.)

For example in [[Elk]]

* http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008435
already redirects to:
* http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/wapiti/

It would be possible to skip these, if desired. 

OTOH [[Roch Castonguay]]  has a link to Jean Marc Dalpé,
* http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA000993
but neither 
* http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/Jean_Marc_Dalpe/
nor
* http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/Jean_Marc_Dalpé/
work

One has to use
* http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/jean-marc-dalpe/

In other words, lower case, spaces to hyphens, remove diacritics.

All this ''can'' be done with AWB, but it is tricky, whereas with the right libraries it is a cinch in perl or python. 

Also the bot should check that the targets are not 404s themselves.

I've been [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_individuals_sanctioned_during_the_2014_pro-Russian_unrest_in_Ukraine&diff=prev&oldid=606312007 trying] to get it to display the right URL using its parameters, but so far to no avail. I want it to point to http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.126.01.0055.01.ENG, but instead it points to http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ.L_.2014.126.01.0055.01.ENG. Am I doing something wrong, or does the template need to be updated?

::::The problem at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/content/help/faq/linking.html is apparently only that the page uses relative links incorrectly and inserts <code>content/help/faq/</code> when a link is clicked. I will tell them. The displayed links work if the url is copy-pasted intead of clicked. But that still doesn't help us because there are at least two url schemes. Our old links start http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=. These links still work but I haven't found a replacement using the new url scheme which starts http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content, and varies after that. I have made an ugly fix where a url scheme or an actual url can be specified in {{tl|Cite EU law}}. The default makes our old links work so those articles don't have to be edited.

If it fails then an actual url (to any website) can be given with a <code>url</code> parameter. I have updated [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cite_EU_law/doc&diff=606344957&oldid=479139781] the documentation of {{tl|Cite EU law}}.

I mean wrapping it to [[HTML_element#List_of_all_HTML_elements|<nowiki><aside></nowiki>]] element, that's a new element in HTML5 and a recommendation. It is used to content no directly connected to text, like website navigation or message boxes.
See its specification on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside

:::That article in principal is right, but due to the unfortunate fact that IE6 and IE7 are still used, in this specific case, it is totally pointless. Believe me, we already tried way back then to make it work without HTML tables, it's just not possible without seriously hampering readability of pages in IE6 and IE7. We tried both inline and block layouts, but the desired behavior of the messages is only possible with table-layout. And IE6 and IE7 simply have no way to apply table layout to elements that are not tables. I'd like nothing more then for it to be converted, but we simply need to hold out a bit longer for the full and wholly demise of IE6 and IE7. —[[User:TheDJ|Th<span style="color: green">e</span>DJ]] ([[User talk:TheDJ|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheDJ|contribs]]) 08:50, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

==Email Fail==

I recently had to totally reinstall on my computer. No big deal - an opportunity to strip out two years of redundant stuff - but when I went to sign back in to Wikipedia I had forgotten my password - easily done as I am permanently logged in. So I simply requested a reset and awaited the confirmation email - twice - didn't arrive. I know which email acc thats registered with wikipedia as I keep a wiki folder there. So I created a second wikipedia account - this one - (markdask1, my original being markdask) - and emailed myself at [[User:markdask]]. I'm getting a confirmatory copy at my designated gmail account as expected but nothing in my markdask email account. I believe the prob has arisen since I recently installed Thunderbird - which kinda fuked things a little, and then uninstalled it. Could someone go on User:markdask and email me please? Its like all email from that page is vanishing, and I cannot log in to address the issue!

::::MediaWiki automatically adds numbers to identical section headings so the anchors become different (it's possible to fool this system with section headings "Foo", "Foo" and "Foo 2" where MediaWiki changes the second to "Foo 2" so it conflicts with the third).

== Template:Dts error ==

I've found a sorting error in {{[[Template:Dts|Dts]]}} and I'm not sure how to go about fixing or working around it. When inputting the following: <nowiki>{{Dts|format=dmy|2000|February|1}}</nowiki>, the date should sort as 02000-02-01-0000. However, it sorts as 02000-03-01-0000. To demonstrate, I've created a sortable table with a February day number that is greater than a March day number. The result is that February appears after March when the table is sorted.

{| class="wikitable sortable" 
|-
! Date
|-
| {{Dts|format=dmy|2000|January|1}}
|-
| {{Dts|format=dmy|2000|February|2}}

::::"not a bug" is correct. This is a deliberate feature of PHP's strtotime function. Unfilled fields of the date are assumed to be the same as for the current date, and days overflow to the next month. Today, "February" = 30 February 2014 = 2 March 2014. [[:mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions##time]] says: "The <tt>''date/time object''</tt> can be in any format accepted by PHP's [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php strtotime()] function. Both absolute (eg <tt>20 December 2000</tt>) and relative (eg <tt>+20 hours</tt>) times are accepted." Other people may rely on #time accurately using strtotime. MediaWiki shouldn't mess with that by inventing new interpretations of some partial date formats. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 10:55, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::::{{ec}} I see in Bugzilla it was suggested that we use "February 1" instead. However, I haven't been able to find any month inputs for #time that allow us to specify the day, and that are allowed in both text format and number format. The closest I got was "1.February" and "1.2", but unfortunately the latter is interpreted as 01:02 am rather than 1 February. — '''''[[User:Mr. Stradivarius|<span style="color: #194D00; font-family: Palatino, Times, serif">Mr. Stradivarius</span>]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Mr. Stradivarius|♪ talk ♪]]</sup> 10:58, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::You can for example include an arbitrary year: <nowiki>{{#time:m|1-2-2000}}</nowiki> gives {{#time:m|1-2-2000}}. <nowiki>{{#time:m|1-February-2000}}</nowiki> gives {{#time:m|1-February-2000}}. PHP's strtotime is widely known and used. It allows a lot of of formats where you implicitly start out with today and specify what is different. For example, on any day in April, "- 2 months" and "February" are valid specifications and should give the same result: Today with month changed to February, and overflowing into the next month if needed. I'm sure lots of MediaWiki users know strtotime and assume we use it correctly. I haven't seen the MediaWiki code for #time but MediaWiki is written in PHP so I assume it simply calls strtotime at some point. Note that strtotime always gives a complete date and time, or actually a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since January 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC). It is "m" in <nowiki>{{#time:m|1-February-2000}}</nowiki> which asks which month that timestamp is in and ignores year, day, hour, minute, second. In some cases like this the result may look quirky, but a lot of other uses can break down if we start making changes to the PHP standard.

== Where are the HTML paragraph tags coming from? ==

I'm contemplating changes to {{tlx|infobox ship career}}.  Mostly the changes I wanted to make were cosmetic.  But, I've noticed an oddity that I can't explain.  It is very common for editors to list multiple items in a single field.  For example, if a ship over its lifetime has had multiple names, those might be listed like this:

:{{para|Ship name|<nowiki>Ship name1<br />Ship name2<br />Ship name3<br />Ship name4<br />Ship name5<br />Ship name6</nowiki>}}
which produces this html:

{{code|<td>Ship name1<br />
Ship name2<br />
Ship name3<br />
Ship name4<br />
Ship name5<br />
Ship name6</td>|lang=html4strict}}

But, editors very often do this:
:<code>|Ship name=<nowiki>Ship name1<br /></nowiki>
:<nowiki>Ship name2<br /></nowiki>
:<nowiki>Ship name3<br /></nowiki>
:<nowiki>Ship name4<br /></nowiki>
:<nowiki>Ship name5<br /></nowiki>
:Ship name6</code>
which produces this html:
{{code|<td>Name:</td>
<td>
<p>Ship name1<br />
Ship name2<br />
Ship name3<br />
Ship name4<br />
Ship name5<br /></p>
Ship name6</td>
</tr>|lang=html4strict}}

In the rendered display, the Name: text in the left column is at one level but the list of names in the right column is vertically offset slightly lower.  There is also a gap between the next-to-last and last names.  You can see this at [[Template:Infobox ship career/testcases#Live template]]. [[Special:ExpandTemplates]] shows that the {{tag|p}} tags are not the result of the template but must come from some other source.

I can get around this by stripping newlines from parameter values by adding this to each parameter in the template with (the template sandbox uses this for {{para|Ship name}}):
:<code><nowiki>{{#invoke:String|replace|{{{Ship name|}}}|[^%S ]||plain=false}}</nowiki></code>

Is there a better way?  Is there a way to tell whatever process follows the template to leave the contents of the {{tag|td}} alone?  Is there css or other markup that can go in the {{tag|td}} to accomplish the same thing?

:::[[WP:SHIPS]] have determined that * list markup in ship infoboxes is not acceptable.  This is why there are lots and lots of parameters that use the markup I describe above.  Additionally, there are companion templates where similar markup is preferred.  The problem doesn't occur with {{tlx|plainlist}} but editors aren't very inclined to use it and making it compulsory would not be accepted.  Which leaves me to find an alternate solution.

::::Ehm on your TD element, add <code>class="hlist"</code> or <code>class="plainlist"</code> and start converting to proper lists. If there is no list in the content, the class won't do anything, but if there is, it just works. Also you would no longer have to advise people to use the plainlist template to do the same, it would be automatic if people use proper lists. These problems have been solved, better to use the solutions than to muddle along and create less accessible articles. If WP:SHIPS has actual problems with using hlist or plainlist styling, then they should bring those concerns here, so we can help them find better technical solutions.

== Automatic wikiproject tagging of pages redirected after moves of articles already under scope of said Wikiproject ==

It'd be really handy if the redirects left behind pages that were moved were automatically tagged as redirects under the scope of the existing Wikiprojects the page is under. Would save a lot of time and is useful in keeping track of the articles (eg in project-wide watchlists). --[[User:LT910001|LT910001]] ([[User talk:LT910001|talk]]) 03:24, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:It seems that what you are asking for is the WikiProject banner templates to be copied from the existing talk page to the newly-created talk page redirect, but with all the templates having {{para|class|redir}} instead of whatever was set previously. There's nothing that we can do about this, because the page move process is part of the MediaWiki software. You would need to file a feature request at [[bugzilla:]], but don't get your hopes up - it took them *years* to change the software so that the automatic addition of {{tlx|R from move}} was actioned. They are also likely to refuse on the grounds that MediaWiki changes affect all languages, plus [[WP:SISTER|Commons, Meta, Wiktionary, etc.]], and WikiProject templates are only found on a few Wikipedias: you might expect there to be several dozen equivalents to [[Template:WikiProject France]] - but there are only four, so the MediaWiki devs are not likely to consider this a priority. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 14:20, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

== Error Rendering Book ==

I was trying to render a book from a article, and it failed at about 38%.
The page it hung on rendering was List of jōyō Kanji, which has a large table in it.
It was able to save any format besides PDF, so I think it may be a bug of soem sort or a pagees limitation.


Here is the list of pages I was turning into a book:

Japanese writing system

Dakuten

Katakana

Kana

Kanji

List of jōyō kanji

Hiragana

Hentaigana

Help:IPA for Japanese

Romanization of Japanese


I was making a collection of articles on the Japanese Language.
Downloading the EPUB version and converted it to PDF with Calibre.
Just letting you know for future reference incase anyone else experiences this.
I will check on this post every so often to see if there are any replies.

: Confirming this. Steps to reproduce:
:# Go to [[List of jōyō kanji]] and click the "Create a book" link under the print/export menu.
:# Click "Start book creator". This takes you back to List of jōyō kanji.
:# Click "Add this page to your book".
:# Click "Show book (1 page)".
:# Set the format as "e-book (PDF)", and click Download.
: For me, it rendered 85% of the page and then stopped. Rendering that 85% took a long time, though, perhaps about a minute. Refreshing the page after that didn't change the 85% figure. The table on [[List of jōyō kanji]] is just over 2000 entries, so it's not surprising that it takes a long time to render. It sounds like something is timing out, but I'm not sure exactly what. — '''''[[User:Mr. Stradivarius|<span style="color: #194D00; font-family: Palatino, Times, serif">Mr. Stradivarius</span>]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Mr. Stradivarius|♪ talk ♪]]</sup> 10:03, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

[[Special:Diff/606944302|This edit]] by TheDJ should make it better positioned, since the old "<code>toolbar.appendChild(citemain)</code>" meant the script was assuming its main button to be always in the end of the toolbar (which is not always the case).

==Parser query==
<pre>
{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],]
}}
</pre>

{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],]
}}

In the above example, the arguably broken wiki-link seems to suppress template closure.

Another legitimate link doesn't fix it
<pre>
{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],] [[bar]]
}}
</pre>
{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],] [[bar]]
}}

Nor does closing "]]" outside the template.
<pre>
{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],]
}}]]
</pre>
{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],]
}}]]

although closing the <nowiki>"}}"</nowiki>  ''after''  the "]]"works

<pre>
{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],]
}}]]}}
</pre>
{{Infobox militant organization
| ideology = [[foo],]
}}]]}}

{{Clear}}
It seems to me that the parser gives up trying to match "[[" at the end of a line, and should therefore be happy with the "}} on the following line - and indeed not match another "]]" if it finds it. {{Break}}

Does this behaviour ascend to the heights of a bug? And if so is it already 'zillared?

:I'm inclined to think it does, because 1. the text is not malformed, we are supposed to be able to have unmatched delimiters. 2. it is not expected behaviour - it is ''fragile'' rather than ''robust'' - that we expect of wiki-mark-up.

::I disagree; this is a standard case of unmatched template- and/or link markers.

== Question about use of open WiFi  ==

Dear technical experts:  I am away from home at a conference.  I have access to the Internet through my 3G/4G cell phone network, but with limited data.  There is also an open WiFi access point here.  I have been warned that if I use open WiFi to log in to Wikipedia, others could see my login and password and my account could be hacked, so I have been avoiding that.  I have asked Wikipedia to keep me logged in for 30 days.  My question is, if I am already logged in, using a private network, and then switch to the public network, is my login data still at risk?  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 18:54, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:As long as you only communicate with Wikipedia using [[HTTPS]] there should be no risk. I recommend using [[HTTPS Everywhere]] if possible.

Please see this [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 April 24#Template:Rellink|TfD:Rellink]]. It can be closed by now.

::BTW. classes are not ONLY used for styling. They are also used for semantics. So the fact that a dablink class is use explicitly tells you that the links inside it are disambiguation links. rellink means that the links are related. I'm not sure how many 3rd party software might be relying on such a thing, but such a dependency is possible.. Same with seealso (boilerplate is an old styling class btw, i don't think it is in use anymore). You always have to keep such things in mind.

== Has duration of inactivity before automatic log-off changed? ==

I've been noticing on a pretty regular basis in the last few weeks that I'm getting logged out if I've not made an edit within the past couple of hours, even if I am continuing to use the search function or go to other pages without editing or committing a logged action.  I've noticed this on several different browsers and several different computers on different ISPs, so I don't think this is in any way related.  Case in point: logged out after 3 hours of not *editing* (between 23:26 on May 3 and 02:53 May 4), despite having looked at different pages several times during that 3 hour period. What's changed?

== Sorting localization ==

Hi! Is it possible tomake a local sorting in other Wikipedia? The thing is, that [[Latvian alphabet]] has some diacritic signs (like ģ, ā and other), so in categories they are after the whole Latin alphabet (for example, see [[:lv:Kategorija:Lapas, ko šobrīd pārstrādā|this category]]'s entry "Ģeotermālā enerģija" which should be placed in section of "G"). I know, that this could be resolved with DEFAULTSORT, but it would be nice to resolve without using it, but make some changes in some javascript file (like [[:lv:MediaWiki:Common.js|this for table sorting]] (line, which starts with such code {{code|mw.config.set( 'tableSorterCollation'}})). --'''[[User:Edgars2007|<font color="FF6600">Edgars2007</font>]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Edgars2007|talk]]/[[Special:Contributions/Edgars2007|contribs]])</sup> 06:42, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

== What code makes text in Editing Window Monospace? ==

I was wondering how the following happens - when I edit the source of any article, text in the editing window is displayed in a Monospaced font. I want to implement a similar behavior on hiwikipedia. Right now in hiwiki, text in the editing window is displayed in regular varied width font, which makes reading and editing a pain. Could someone here help me locate the page and the code which make this possible on enwiki? Is it [[Mediawiki:Common.js]], [[Mediawiki:Common.css]] ?[[User:Shubhamkanodia|Shubhamkanodia]] ([[User talk:Shubhamkanodia|talk]]) 11:17, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
: {{re|Shubhamkanodia}} It's this way by default. If it's different on hi.wikipedia, then that's most likely a local override there (or a problem with fonts themselves). [[User:Matma Rex|Matma Rex]] <small>[[User talk:Matma Rex|talk]]</small> 11:27, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

== Cologne Blue ==

Hi. On Cologne Blue I already have it programmed to add the categories at the bottom rather than top. Can somebody show me the coding to also add the interwiki link titles at the bottom too? Although in looking I think it also shows at the bottom too, so I need a way to suppress it appearing at the top. It's just for popular articles with dozens of interwiki links it bloats out the top. ♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e">''Dr. Blofeld''</span>]] 16:29, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

== Template wikitext from visual editor ==

While looking for broken options in all {{tl|convert}}s, I found that a dozen of the 1.7 million converts have wikitext like the following:
*<code><nowiki>{{Convert|5|cm|4 = 0|abbr = on|sp = us}}</nowiki></code> → {{Convert|5|cm|4 = 0|abbr = on|sp = us}}
*<code><nowiki>{{Convert|15-20|cm|4 = 0|abbr = on}}</nowiki></code> → {{Convert|15-20|cm|4 = 0|abbr = on}}
The "standard" way of entering the above is:
*<code><nowiki>{{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}</nowiki></code> → {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}
*<code><nowiki>{{Convert|15-20|cm|0|abbr=on}}</nowiki></code> → {{Convert|15-20|cm|0|abbr=on}}
or perhaps:
*<code><nowiki>{{convert|5|cm|abbr=on|sp=us|0}}</nowiki></code> → {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on|sp=us|0}}
*<code><nowiki>{{Convert|15-20|cm|abbr=on|0}}</nowiki></code> → {{Convert|15-20|cm|abbr=on|0}}
The edits introducing these that I've checked have "(Tag: VisualEditor)" so presumably we can look forward to the imposition of this style in all templates. I'm overly sensitive about source style and am posting this for a minor vent, but it may be of interest to others. The <code>4&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</code> is setting the numbered parameter 4 to the string <code>0</code>, and the template will receive the parameter with leading and trailing whitespace removed. Possibly the 4 is a slightly broken attempt by VE to count where it was up to (it's not 4 in the "standard" examples above). Convert accepts some very weird syntax and I suspect that the missing parameter 3 could cause it confusion in some cases, and the stripped whitespace could conceivably matter. Does anyone feel like checking this out with some VE testing? Does the current version do the above? Is it really missing parameter 3? [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 01:57, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:You should check the TemplateData table in the template's documentation first, because that is ususally the source of these errors. VE uses these to create and edit templates. <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:Edokter|<span style="color:#008"><i>E</i>dokter</span>]] ([[User talk:Edokter|<span style="color:#080">talk</span>]]) — </span> 10:25, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

:VisualEditor is doing as it's supposed to by saying 4 = 0. [[Template:Convert#TemplateData]] says parameter 3 is the unit being converted to, and parameter 4 is the precision. If the user gave no parameter 3 then the '4' in 4 = 0 is needed to assign parameter 4 and not parameter 3 (it could also have said <code><nowiki>{{Convert|5|cm||0|abbr = on|sp = us}}</nowiki></code> to show there is no parameter 3). The "standard" <code><nowiki>{{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}</nowiki></code> corresponds to 3 = 0 and no parameter 4. The template is apparently designed so the unit being converted to is optional and a default unit is chosen if none is specified, for example inches for cm. If a number is given as parameter 3 then the template assumes it's a precision (which should normally have been parameter 4) and not the unit being converted to. I don't know whether VisualEditor can be programmed to understand such features and move parameter 4 down to parameter 3 if it's a number and no parameter 3 was given. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 10:47, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks, I see what you mean. Unfortunately convert can be a lot more complex than the template data envisages:
::*<code><nowiki>{{convert|1|x|2|x|4|ft|m|3}}</nowiki></code> → {{convert|1|x|2|x|4|ft|m|3}}
::*<code><nowiki>{{convert|1|yd|2|ft|6|in|m|adj=mid|-wide|3}}</nowiki></code> → {{convert|1|yd|2|ft|6|in|m|adj=mid|-wide|3}}
::Perhaps convert can be stripped back to a sane syntax one day. And we'll have to learn to love VE's idiosyncratic spacing style? [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 12:38, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:Is this a case of the template being overloaded, like {{tl|coord}} is? 
:The ideal spacing appears to be an unresolved debate:  if you add no spaces, then the wikitext won't wrap; if you add some, then whatever you choose is obviously wrong (unless what you choose is what I would have chosen {{smiley|wink}}).

::I do have a system, but it's variable. If the template produces a box-type structure, like an infobox, I use one parameter per line, and line up the equals:<source lang=text enclose=div>{{template

|name2       = value2
|longername3 = value3

For each named parameter, there are four permissible places to put a space - either side of the pipe, and either side of the equals. Of these four, I only put spaces before each pipe:<source lang=text enclose=div>{{template |name1=value1 |name2=value2 |longername3=value3 }}</source> This permits word wrapping, but when wrapping occurs, the name and value stay together. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 20:59, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

== No captcha for nih.gov? ==

There's currently an edit request at [[MediaWiki talk:Captcha-addurl-whitelist#PubMed etc.]] suggesting that we whitelist nih.gov so that it doesn't require a captcha by anonymous users to insert into pages.

Did you earlier click a link at [[Wikipedia talk:File Upload Wizard/Archive 3#Reader feedback: why is this a crummy upload ...]] with a colon in front like [[:File:CBB-layout-problem.gif]]?

Not as I recall, but as I said, I suppose it's possible caching or memory problems are to blame.  But perhaps the best solution is to revert the default to [[Special:Upload]] from [[Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard]], as you suggested.  There's a so much content that is policy compliant but can't be uploaded properly with the wizard.  It's more hindrance than help in my experience.

IMO, the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EinsteinPrinciple Einstein Principle] is essential to a good uploader tool, and is a principle that the wizard writers seem to have failed to honor, IMO.  Solution: If the wizards didn't over-promise, I'd be happier with them, but they do.  If they started off by saying something like, "uploading files properly is sometimes ''very complicated'' (which could link to a page listing those reasons - from copyright to file size).  This wizard is designed to be easy to use, especially for new users in the most common cases, but the simplification required to make it means that it cannot handle many of the complicated cases; for those, you should use a different upload tool."  That sentence could use some refinement, but expression of the core sentiment is critical.  Otherwise, they're more harmful than helpful.  Not to mention:

Why am I getting a box with this text:

:'''AFCH error: user not listed
:AFCH could not be loaded because "Beyond My Ken" is not listed on Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants. You can request access to the AfC helper script there.'''

:You have the AfC gadget enabled in your preferences, but you're not listed as an AfC reviewer on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants]].

[[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 22:36, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::I did not enable an "AfC" gadget, so it was added as "opt out"?  I vehemently protest about this. I will turn the gadget off, but editors should not have to opt out.  And why does the message come up when I'm simply '''''looking at a user page''''' - that's not an AfC-related activity.  This whole thing seems like an enormous fuck up and needs to be totally re-thought.  Where is the discussion that authorized it? [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 22:48, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::The gadget is, and has always been, opt-in. If it was enabled, it's because you enabled it at one point.

:::::Could someone perhaps add a hint in the box to those of us who tried AfC at one point and were burned about how to get rid of the pop-up? It took me quite a while to find this discussion and to remember that in a moment of unbecoming zeal I did change my preferences, and the change was in the gadgets section. (AfC is a seriously hot potato!) [[User:Sminthopsis84|Sminthopsis84]] ([[User talk:Sminthopsis84|talk]]) 15:30, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::::You folks instituted a change in functionality on the basis of an RfC which recieved the opinons of '''''14 editors'''''!  Do you '''''really''''' think that's a valid cross-section of the community?  And then the implementation is botched, and you're still trying to sell it as a feature, and not what it is, a bug.

[[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 23:04, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::The default status of gadgets can be seen and changed at [[MediaWiki:Gadgets-definition]]. There is no "default" in the line for afchelper so it isn't enabled by default. If it has ever been default then it should show in the page history, but I don't think it has. It would certainly be inappropriate if it was. Users sometimes say a non-default gadget is enabled in their account without any action on their part. It's hard to tell whether this is correct or they accidentally enabled it, but I think the common assumption is the latter. If it actually did enable without user action then the problem would be in MediaWiki or the Wikimedia servers and not in the implementation of this particular gadget at the English Wikipedia. Anyway, you can disable it now so your problem is solved and I don't see reason to go on about it unless other users also claim it has enabled automatically. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 23:20, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::I am almost certainly wrong about the default.  I do recall doing a few AfC's at one point, so I most probably turned on the gadget myself. '''''Nevertheless''''' a change in system functionality has been (badly) implemented on the basis of 14 people's opinion.  That's a very bad idea, and no one at AfC seems to want to own up to having pulled a boner.  They have. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 23:25, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::Implementation details of gadgets rarely get large discussions and this gadget is not default and has few users. The message you quoted is from [[MediaWiki:Gadget-afchelper.js/core.js]].

You all might be interested to learn that AFC [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Articles for creation#This just implemented: Whitelist checking for all versions of AFCH|are intending]] to remove your name from the list if you don't do a review in two months.  So even if you put your name on the whitelist to suppress the error messages, you will get them back again in two months unless you uninstall the gadget.  Seems to me that AFC are overstepping their scope with this.

::Well that wins for bad ideas.  I review AfC's as I have the time, and have reviewed quite a few.  However, it wouldn't at all surprise me if there was a two month period at some point in the future when I don't have time to review an AfC.  If I come back from whatever forced that break and realize I have to jump through a hoop to be able to use AFCH again, I'm just as likely to give up on helping a mostly broken process as I am likely to restore my name and start doing AFC reviews again.  The idea that AFCH - a script that, mind you, could be implemented in userspace without *that* much difficulty without checking the white list and with no special permissions - is so sensitive that it needs a removal of permissions only one third of the time we give inactive sysops is pretty odd. [[User:Kevin Gorman|Kevin Gorman]] ([[User talk:Kevin Gorman|talk]]) 03:46, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
What we have here, is a failure of one editor to read a message and to either add themselves to a list for AFC participants or to remove the AFCH (or previously Yet Annother AFC submission handler) preference/gadget from their javascript.  That does not excuse rudeness ([[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation#.22AFCH_error.22_box]], [[User_talk:Hasteur/Archive_9#Please....]], [[User_talk:Hasteur/Archive_9#Too_bad...]]).  If only there were some way the editor could go back to assuming good faith and following the advice they give on their own talkpage (which option will best serve the building of an encyclopedia) rather than making it a "AFC is full of bad people" battleground. [[User:Hasteur|Hasteur]] ([[User talk:Hasteur|talk]]) 00:13, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:No, what we have here is arrogance on the part of Hasteur and AfC.  Why in hell should I be required to add myself to a list in order not to receive an error message.  The message did not '''''say''''' that it was generated because I had an obscure gadget turned on.  It did not '''''say''''' that I could stop receiving the message by turning off the gadget. No, you just '''''assumed''''' that your project was so damned important that everyone should jump through your hoops to accommodate you.

:::No, HotCat's upgrade to 2.28 cannot possibly have anything to do with this.

:It's line 3648 in wikEd, which does <code>window.scroll(0, wikEd.GetOffsetTop(wikEd.inputWrapper) - 2);</code>. That's inside <code>wikEd.TurnOn()</code>, and it makes the page jump to the top. [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 21:19, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
::Hm. WikEd looks for an edit form (elements #editform, wpTextarea1 etc) in the DOM, and if it finds one, assumes it's on an edit page. HotCat does add a similar hidden form to make its edits (but the form id is #hotcatCommitForm, not #editform like for normal edit pages). So, when both are active, depending on the order the scripts run, it may or may not work: if wikEd runs first, the HotCat form isn't there yet, and everything is fine. If HotCat runs first, wikEd is misled, and then the "jump to top" problem occurs. Now, that's an area of HotCat that hasn't changed in a long time, and although I'm not sure, I don't think wikEd has changed in that area either. Why didn't that problem surface earlier?

== attempt to move a move-protected page by non-admin results in wrong error message ==
{{tracked|40145}}
About a year and a half ago, I reported a bug in which MediaWiki displays the wrong message error when a non-admin tries to move a move-protected page ({{Bugzilla|40145}}); the message would say the page can only be edited by admins even when it's merely protected from moves. A developer reported that the bug has been fixed, but when I try to rename a move-protected page with my non-admin test account, it still says the page can only be edited by administrators.

== Template expansion limits ==

I'm continuing to prep the [[Paul Erdős Bibliography]] article, and have just come across [[Wikipedia:Template limits]].  I was planning on using ~1600 [[template:cite journal|cite journal]] templates and a couple hundred [[template:math|math]] templates.  Writing an article of this size requires creating a [[BibTeX]] database, writing code to convert those entries into wiki markup, and then uploading the result.  I'd really rather not have to write the conversion script twice (once using [[template:cite|cite]], then a second time without any templates because I ran into the limit).

Can someone give me a ballpark idea how many cites can be included in an article before I can expect to start hitting the expansion limits?  I expect the answer will be "It depends", but I'm looking for a rough guide here.  If 500-citation articles regularly run into problems, then I'll plan on hand-coding my own cites.

Thanks much,

[[User:Lesser Cartographies|Lesser Cartographies]] ([[User talk:Lesser Cartographies|talk]]) 05:05, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
:Someone else may have a more technical answer, but you might consider breaking the article into multiple articles, with one article covering each decade (or some other reasonable range). Then create a master article, as was done with [[List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people]]. I don't know if this is a standard way of addressing potentially-long articles, but it appears to work. – [[User:Jonesey95|Jonesey95]] ([[User talk:Jonesey95|talk]]) 05:32, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

*At [[Wikipedia talk:Template limits]], someone reported problems at 267 {{tl|cite web}} transclusions (in 2006), so 1600 {{tl|cite journal}} calls are probably going to be problematic. I'm wondering if it might not be a good idea to resurrect the old non-lua version of {{tl|cite journal}}, so you can [[WP:substitution|subst]] in your 1600 different citations in batches to a #switch, which would give you an expansion depth of only 3200 at 2 per switch condition. [[User:Vanisaac|Van]][[User talk:Vanisaac|Isaac]]<sub><small>[[WP:WikiProject Writing systems|WS]]</small></sub><sup style="margin-left:-3.0ex">[[Special:Contributions/Vanisaac|cont]]</sup> 06:40, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
::Numbers for citation templates from 2006 have no relevance. Many of the main citation templates – including {{tl|cite journal}}, {{tl|cite book}}, {{tl|cite web}}, etc. – were re-written in Lua instead of wiki-template code. Lua is much more efficient. I don't have numbers for you, but it would be easy to find out by experiment. Just grab a version of a filled in template that approximates how you are going to use it and put 1600 copies on a page in your sandbox. See what happens.
::I would second the opinion that it sounds like your page inherently needs to be broken into multiple pages. Without consideration of the number of citation templates which you plan to use, almost anything that has 1600 entries should be broken into multiple pages. Think about how hard it will be for users to read the page with 1600 bibliographic entries. Normal default usage in Wikipedia is to present a couple of hundred entries per page for most system lists.  This could be considered an appropriate ballpark. How you organize breaking the page into subpages depends on what exactly you are listing.  As a bibliography, breaking into groups of first letters sounds normal. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Makyen|Makyen]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Makyen|talk]]) 07:10, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I just tested 2000 long-ish instances of {{tl|cite journal}} [[Special:PermaLink/607754688|in my sandbox]], and I got to 1007 before I went over the [[Wikipedia:Template limits#Post-expand include size|post-expand include size limit]]. That number will increase for shorter citations, but probably not enough to fit 1600 normal-sized citations in. There's not much you can do about that <s>apart from [[WP:SUBST|substitute]] them</s>, or better, expand them with [[Special:ExpandTemplates]]. (Alternatively, as was suggested above, separate pages would also work.) As most of the cite templates are already Lua-ified, we can't reduce the post-expand include size by tweaking things inside the templates. And VanIsaac's #switch won't work, as that is a fix for the wrong template limit (the expansion depth). The problem here is the sheer amount of text, which using #switch will not affect. So, in short, if you're expecting more than 1000 cites, and you don't want to split the page, substitution is probably the way to go. — '''''[[User:Mr. Stradivarius|<span style="color: #194D00; font-family: Palatino, Times, serif">Mr. Stradivarius</span>]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Mr. Stradivarius|♪ talk ♪]]</sup> 10:23, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

Most of these entries are categorized using one or more [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] numbers.  The article will have a tabular topic index with columns representing decades, rows representing the MCS categories, and the table itself containing a list of &lt;ref&gt; tags that point to the bibliography entries.
::I've given a fair amount of thought to how this collection could be carved into multiple articles, and at this point I haven't found a good solution.  The &lt;ref&gt; tags in the topical index will have both "group" and "name" attributes, and I'm assuming there's no way to point those to a different page.  (If there was the problem is solved:  the topical index forms one page, and each decade's worth of citations would get a separate page for the actual bibliographical entries.)
::I've also thought of creating several articles divided by either year or collection of topics.  The former means that if you want easy access to all of Erdos's work on set theory, you need to visit several articles.  The latter means that it's difficult to make serendipitous connections:  what else was Erdos working on when he published his seminal work on random graphs?  
::I agree that a 1600-entry bibliography is unreadable.  Part of my motivation for doing this work was my frustration dealing with Grossman's dead-tree attempt (and let me emphasize that Grossman did a terrific job given the limitation of the media he had to work with).  1600 ref tags spread over a table should be far more useful and usable interface to the bibliography proper.
::I started this project thinking that it was the most difficult (but feasible) article I could come up with, and while it's ''far'' more difficult that I originally imagined, I've yet to prove it isn't feasible.  Generating raw HTML sounds like a good fallback position, and perhaps writing a set of specialized "skinny" templates is worth investigating as well.

== Adding local description to files ==

What is this new feature of "adding local desciption" to files? It creates dummy files on local wikis as the users do not understand that they are not editing Wikimedia Commons but a local wiki. Why are the local descriptions even necessary? Is this a bug or flawed design? --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 18:02, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

This must be some kind of error: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Char-B1bis-Saumur.0004axt0.jpg&action=edit]. You could add local descriptions technically but it is not allowed and there is a big warning. Well there is no warning on the Finnish Wikipedia and people have started to edit the local file pages. Please relay my rant to the people who can do something about this. --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 18:07, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:It's not an error; adding a local description for a Commons file is allowed, but there's generally no reason to do that except in some cases (such as locally featured images). [[User:SiBr4|SiBr<sub>4</sub>]] ([[User talk:SiBr4|talk]]) 18:21, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

::And people will add the local descriptions to files because they cannot understand the difference between Commons and local repositories. They just think that they are editing the description of the file. It wasn't a problem before the tabs were introduced. Now it is. When the file is renamed in Commons, the local description becomes orphaned and the data is lost. --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 18:29, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:::It was always possible to create a local description, and I think there used to be a tab just saying "Edit". The new tab name is more descriptive, and a new tab "View on Wikimedia Commons" was added. The tabs are wide. You can make them more narrow and just say "Commons" and "Edit" with this in {{yourcss}}:
<code><nowiki>importScript('User:PrimeHunter/Image tabs.js'); // Linkback: [[User:PrimeHunter/Image tabs.js]]</nowiki></code>
::[[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 18:38, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:::I want the tabs to be "Edit on Commons" for everyone as default. The tab "add local description" should be hidden somewhere like the "move" tab is or the "delete" tab for administrators. --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 18:41, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:::{{ec}} Before the "View on WM Commons" and "Add"/"Edit local description" tabs there would be normal "Read"/"Edit"/"History" tabs if the local page existed and a "Create" tab if it didn't exist, if I remember correctly. I don't see how what you describe only became a problem when the tabs were changed; someone who wants to add/edit a description and doesn't know what Commons is would click "Create"/"Edit" before and will click "Add local description"/"Edit local description" now. The automatic box "This is a file from the Wikimedia Commons..." and the edit notice you described are also still there. [[User:SiBr4|SiBr<sub>4</sub>]] ([[User talk:SiBr4|talk]]) 18:47, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

::::The "create" tab conveys to the reader a meaning that by pressing it, one is going to create a file. There is no incentive to press "create" when people see that the file already exists. Now the text "add local description" might be understood as "edit the text that is visible on the page". There is a case of Finnish Wikipedia where a person uploaded the file on Commons with all the correct license information but then came back to add to what he had written. Guess where he wrote the new text? When done, the file page displays both the text from Commons and from the local page. Perhaps we should also construct an automatic box that says "you have indeed pressed the wrong tab, now go away." What's the point in that? --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 19:11, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::You can't create a file on MediaWiki, only upload one. To me it doesn't seem logical if you need to click "add a description" in order to edit one that's already there. Even if one does wrongly click the "add local description" tab, there's the edit notice that says descriptions should be added at Commons and creating a local page is rarely necessary. An "Edit on Commons" button and/or moving the local description buttons to the drop-down menu seems like a good idea, nevertheless. [[User:SiBr4|SiBr<sub>4</sub>]] ([[User talk:SiBr4|talk]]) 19:39, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::People create files by uploading them. There are thousands of people who blatantly defy logic in their everyday lives. Any logical system that is designed to be used by people will fail sooner or later. It seems perfectly logical to click various buttons to achive some goals on Wikipedia. When a tab or button gives you a page to edit, the page will be edited – and when the result seems convincing, there is no problem. Only the few logical people understand where the bits and pieces of the description really is. The rest could not care less. --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 20:00, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::The tab "add a local description" gets you to a page that says "please do not add a local description" on the English Wikipedia. On the Finnish Wikipedia there is no warning at all. The tabs read now "'''VIEW''' on something"; "'''EDIT''' something"; "'''ADD''' something". Normal people just do not understand what is "local" and what is "Commons". --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 20:17, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::{{ec}} Exactly the same can be argued for the old system as well, so again, why is it a problem that only started with the tabs change? Also, do you think the edit notice isn't clear or do you think people will ignore it? You mentioned an example at the Finnish Wikipedia, though the "this file is on Commons" note appears to be a normal line of text on fiwiki, which is more easily skipped than the red error-like box on this wiki. [[User:SiBr4|SiBr<sub>4</sub>]] ([[User talk:SiBr4|talk]]) 20:27, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::::Well to be frank, the problems only start when I notice them, of course. Hah haa! I don't think that anyone paid attention to this problem before me. I tried to explain above that the phrases "create" and "add a local description" seem different to the reader although they lead you to the same page as before. This is a problem that clearly does not affect the English wikipedia, but I am such a poor bastard that I don't know where to discuss this properly. If I can be wrong in some other venue, please direct me there. --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 20:37, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

{{od|8}}

If you want to request a change to the interface of the Finnish WP, then you obviously need to do that there, though for general discussion or technical help it's reasonable to ask the EnWP village pump rather than the Finnish one since you'll get more attention here. The "View on Commons" link was added exactly for preventing people locally editing a file page that's actually at Commons (the patch is [[gerrit:104182|here]], by the way).<br/>
<s>I've found [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/MediaWiki:Visualeditor-ca-createlocaldescriptionsource/qqq the translatewiki page] using Google (I didn't know about that site)". I think the "e.g. Wikimedia Commons" in the description of the message is incorrect, as the message should show if the ''local'' page doesn't exist yet (since if it does exist, it should display "edit local description source").</s> <small>''Refers to [[Special:Diff/607824998|removed]] comment.''</small> [[User:SiBr4|SiBr<sub>4</sub>]] ([[User talk:SiBr4|talk]]) 21:09, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:Thank you for the link to the Gerrit patch! It seems I have thought the solution was the problem, now I understand that the end users are the problem. I am certain that the new tab "add local description" will prevent people from adding local descriptions to the files. --[[User:Pxos|Pxos]] ([[User talk:Pxos|talk]]) 21:32, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

== Numbers rendering below text on article titles in Vector skin ==

I noticed that the number renders below the line of text on [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5?useskin=vector this article's title] when using the Vector skin. Is this a know bug? If not, will someone tech-wise report it, please? Thank you.—[[User:John Cline|John Cline]] ([[User talk:John Cline|talk]]) 22:41, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*It is not a bug, it's just the font. Having numbers span from baseline to cap height, called lining figures, is a feature of modern typography, while [[text figures]] have been the most common form of numbers for centuries.

::Moreover, it's an effect of the recent decision to use a different font from the body text (which is the vanilla <code>font-family: sans-serif;</code>) for the headings in Vector skin. In Vector, headings now use the cascade <code>font-family: "Linux Libertine",Georgia,Times,serif;</code> one or more of which has [[text figures]]. {{replyto|John Cline}} If you want the headings to be sans-serif like the main text, I can knock up some simple CSS to do that. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 10:38, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

==Question regarding a template==
Hello guys, I'd like to ask you something about a template I used. As you can see here [[Olympiacos B.C.#Seasons]] the template works fine, but ideally I would like the cursor to start from the bottom of the box (from the newest season, up to the older ones) when somebody visits the page.

== Transclusion of subpages with parameters broken from yesterday? ==

I implemented transclusion of a review list on the main page of [[WP:Peer review]] some time ago. I use the parameter 'mode' to set whether reviews should be transcluded in full or not. 

I use this transclusion:
<nowiki>{{Wikipedia:Peer review/List of active reviews|mode=transclude}}</nowiki>

From yesterday, this stopped transcluding anything at all, and now just sits as a link. Why is there a problem? <nowiki>{{Wikipedia:Peer review/List of active reviews}}</nowiki> transcludes fine, but with a parameter, nothing transcludes at all. This includes the headings on the subpage, which should transclude regardless of the parameter. 

I've re-implemented the old system in the meantime.

== Searching for non-alphanumeric character returns an error. ==

I wanted to search for instances of U+20A4 LIRA SIGN ("₤") [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=advanced&search=%E2%82%A4&fulltext=Search&ns0=1&ns4=1&ns9=1&ns10=1&ns12=1&profile=advanced The obvious search] gives an error. Searching for e.g. "₤5" searches for "5", ignoring the currency symbol.

On further testing, the situation seems to be: any combination of non-alphanumeric characters gives an error; if any alphanumeric characters are added then these are searched for, the non-alphas being ignored entirely. alphanumerics from other alphabets seem to be treated similarly to Latin alphanumerics.

Is this a configuration issue with this wiki, or a MediaWiki bug? And are there any workrounds to allow searching for arbitrary non-alpha characters? [[User:Pseudomonas|Pseudomonas]]<sub>([[User talk:Pseudomonas|talk]])</sub> 21:12, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

== AWB password ==

Dear editors:  I am ready to try out the AutoWikiBrowser.  I have downloaded and installed it. I have managed to coax it into loading a list of pages.  At this point I need to log in.  The instructions say that I should see the "standard Wikipedia login", but the login dialogue box does not look like the one that I usually use to log into Wikipedia.  Maybe this is because I'm not an IE user.  Just to be sure: am I right in assuming that the login and password required are those that I use when logging into the English Wikipedia, and that this is a secure connection? &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 04:31, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
*Yes, the login is for AWB, so it looks nothing like a regular wikipedia login screen, and your AWB login is completely independent of your wikipedia login status. The AWB login is a popup window called "Profiles" with heading of ID, Username, Password saved?, Default settings, and Notes; Login, Add, Edit, and Delete buttons; a Quick login frame with Username and Password fields, Save this account and Save password checkboxes, and a Login button; and lastly a Close button. If that's what you are seeing, just enter your wikipedia username and password and you can login. If you save your account, then it will become a profile that you can click on the next time you try to login.

*And yes, this is a secure connection ([[Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/User manual#Login]]).

== login problems: new public computer at public library ==

Our public computers at our local library often have givrn me trouble.  We now have HP Compaq Pro 6300.  The "START" page says the OS is Windows 7 (ver. unknown), and Windows Help says the browser is Internet Explorer 9 (ver. unknown).  When I attempt to Log in, I repeatedly find myself back on an edit page with an error message: "You are not logged in!"  I am sending this message from my cellphone, but losing battery fast: please, if gou can help, leave me a message in my User_Talk page: user:Ragityman.  I will attempt to check it from this library computer.

== Insert citation button in editor ==

Could we clean up our act here please. My watchlist is cluttered with Monkbot edits viz <pre>(diff | hist) . . mb Mellor Mill‎; 14:04 . . (-2)‎ . . ‎Monkbot (talk | contribs)‎ (→‎References: Task 3: Fix CS1 deprecated coauthor parameter errors)</pre>
When I use the Insert citation button in editorm and choose cite book, I am offered a template with these fields:
<pre>
 URL:   Title:  
 Last name:   First name:  
 Coauthors:   Publication date:  
 Work:   Publisher:  
 Pages:   Language:  
 Access date:   Location:  
 Reference name:  
</pre>

Then there is the cite/citation problem where the first requires you to then manually add |ref=harv, but the second doesn't. This is needed with our common notes/bibliography reference rendering that is familiar to anyone involved with WP:GLAM . It becomes increasing desperate when you are joint training new users. I will use one workaround and my colleague will use another which doesn't do much to inspire confidence.

Could someone 
#Check and rewrite the Insert citation templates so they are compliant
#change date to year which is another problem
#change the cite templates so they default to ref=harv

Please. -- <span class="vcard"><span class="fn nickname">[[User:ClemRutter|Clem Rutter]]</span> ([[User talk:ClemRutter|talk]])</span> 10:07, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

== Media Viewer launches next week on the English Wikipedia ==

[[File:Media_Viewer_Desktop_-_Large_Image_Opaque_Info.png|thumb|Media Viewer lets you see images in larger size]]

[[File:Media Viewer - Survey Graph - Overall Usefulness - May 5 2014.png|thumb|[[mw:Multimedia/Media_Viewer/Survey/Results_-_05-05-2014|The majority of users find Media Viewer useful]].]]

Greetings! As discussed in [[w:Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)/Archive_126#Introducing_Media_Viewer|earlier posts]], [[w:Wikipedia:Media_Viewer|Media Viewer]] is scheduled to launch on the English Wikipedia next week, to provide a better viewing experience for our users. 

[[mw:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|Media Viewer]] has been tested extensively on many large wikis around the world, and the feedback collected from thousands of users suggests that this tool is generally useful to them, as outlined in [[mw:Multimedia/Media_Viewer/Survey/Results_-_05-05-2014|these survey results]]. More importantly, the rate of favorable feedback keeps increasing across all languages over time: for example, the French approval rate started out at about 64% a few weeks ago, and is now up to 70%, which is very encouraging. 

Here on the English Wikipedia, over [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|13,874 beta users]] have been testing it, since the tool was first deployed as a beta feature in November 2013.  Thanks to all their helpful feedback, Media Viewer has been greatly improved in recent months, and we are now getting ready to roll it out on all wikis worldwide.

Media Viewer will be enabled by default on the English Wikipedia on Thursday, May 22 at about 20:00 UTC. We will deploy this tool very carefully and keep a close eye on this release, to make sure it all goes smoothly. The tool will then be released to all wikis the following week, as described in [[mw:Multimedia/Media_Viewer/Release_Plan#Large_Wikis|this release plan]]. 

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments about Media Viewer, which you can [[mw:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer#How_can_I_help.3F|test here in beta]] -- or learn more about on  [[mw:Help:Multimedia/Media_Viewer|this Help page]] (which includes tips for bypassing this tool, or turning it off in your preferences).  You are invited to [[w:Wikipedia_talk:Media_Viewer|share your feedback in this discussion]], to help improve this feature. You're also welcome to [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1?c=help-enwiki take this quick survey] -- or join [[mw:Talk:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|this in-depth discussion on MediaWiki.org]], as you prefer.

Many thanks to all the community members who helped make Media Viewer possible! This tool was created with active community participation from its early planning phase -- all the way to its final release. This has been an exceptionally productive partnership, which we hope to build on for future projects.

:BTW, our community has a huge blob of work to do here, to make sure that all license files get the proper amount of metadata to make it possible for our license templates to be machine readable. Commons has done this years ago, but our licenses are in TERRIBLE shape. For instance all PD templates are separate templates (whoever thought it was a good idea to delete PD-layout........). We need to consolidate them by layout and by restrictions and this is mostly going to be a manual process.. . —[[User:TheDJ|Th<span style="color: green">e</span>DJ]] ([[User talk:TheDJ|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheDJ|contribs]]) 10:55, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

::Thanks for pointing this out, [[User:TheDJ|TheDJ]]. You are absolutely right that more community work will be needed to help make our metadata machine-readable -- and we aim to start a Structured Data initiative later this year to address this issue on Commons, in collaboration with Wikidata and community members. The Media Viewer project is a useful prelude towards that goal, because it nudges us to place our attributions and license metdata in standard templates that are supported by this tool. We also hope to soon provide [https://wikimedia.mingle.thoughtworks.com/projects/multimedia/cards/511 a way to disable MediaViewer for certain images ], to help editors filter images that don't belong in Media Viewer - which is another community task that seems worthwhile.

== New search ==

Dear technical experts:  I have for some time been trying to create a search box that would be helpful to people reviewing at Afc, but was hindered by the fact that the search engine didn't check text in transcluded templates.  Now it seems that there is a new search engine which does.  I have "New Search" selected in my preferences.  I created this search box which checks only in "Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/":

{{Search prefixes
| small = no
| header1 = Find articles in Articles for Creation
| description = 
| searchbuttonlabel = 
| header2 = 
| Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/
|
}}


By typing "football review waiting" into the search box I thought that I would see only see submissions with the requested prefix, the word "football" and the words "review waiting" which appear in the submission template.  Instead I am getting mainly redirects to mainspace which months ago had this text, but in which currently neither the redirect not the mainspace page have the words "review waiting".  What is going wrong?  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 09:46, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

:You found a bug. The search results page shows timestamps for the searched revision. In all cases I examined, this was the last edit before the page was moved and became a redirect. The search index for the old title apparently isn't updated when a page is moved, at least not for the examined cases. For example, [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=football+review+waiting&prefix=Wikipedia+talk%3AArticles+for+creation%2F&fulltext=Search+full+text&fulltext=Search this] search currently says with UTC:
::[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Summer Cup (Scottish football)]]
::Review waiting. This may take 2–3 weeks. The Articles for creation process is highly backlogged. Please
::4 KB (587 words) - 19:45, 19 January 2014
:[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Summer Cup (Scottish football)]] was moved to [[Summer Cup (Scottish football)]]  19:46, 19 January 2014‎. The last revision before that in the page history of [[Summer Cup (Scottish football)]] is [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Summer_Cup_%28Scottish_football%29&oldid=591446379] 19:45, 19 January 2014‎. It would have produced the "Review waiting" text when it was at [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Summer Cup (Scottish football)]] before the move. In other cases the time difference was more than 1 minute but it was always the last revision before the move. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 10:21, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::Ah, that probably explains why [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=default&search=sophomore+album&fulltext=Search this search] turns up lots of albums which don't mention the word "sophomore" at all. However, it ''doesn't'' explain the presence of [[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)]] in the search results - it was only moved once, {{diff|Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|prev|277580858|in March 2009}}, at which time the word "sophomore" wasn't in the article.

:::{{ping|Redrose64}} Do you have "New search" enabled at [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]]?

I look forward to this feature. While primarily intended for the good people working at AfC, OTRS agents will find it useful. It is quite common for someone to report some issue with an article but it turns out they are talking about an AfC submission and don't know to provide the link.

::Is there any ETA on a refresh that will update the timestamp for redirects?  Right now the new search is not useful for articles that have been moved, because the search picks up text that was in the article before it was moved, perhaps months ago, rather than the current text.

== Inline audio ==

{{tl|Audio-nohelp}} allows text to be linked inline to an audio file.  Unfortunately, clicking the link opens the file player in the full window.  Is there a template that will just play the sound without leaving the article page, or at worst, in a pop-up window? There is particularly a problem in the tables at [[Morse code#Letters, numbers, punctuation]].  It is quite inconvenient to have to keep backing out of the file player while trying to read through the tables and listen at the same time.

:: I saw that,  and [[Template:Audio]] does pretty much the same thing.  Something along the lines of [[Template:Listen]] might be better as it would allow you to stay on the same page. For example:

== Stop Crawling on pages with frequent editing ==

I'd like to propose a way to prevent Google / Yahoo / Bing from crawling pages which are undergoing a lot of revisions.
Google uses Wikipedia as an "authoratative source" when performing web searches on subjects which have articles about them, however there are many cases where edit warring / vandalism can cause the information to be incorrect, thus causing searchers who arrive at the Wikipedia page due to the indexing to believe that the information on the page is credible.

The proposed rule is:

Any page that has more than 3 edits in the period of 1 week should be "de-indexed" (have meta tags added which tell the indexing engine to ignore the page and / or the content)

[[User:BDBJack|BDBJack]] ([[User talk:BDBJack|talk]]) 01:38, 15 May 2014 (UTC)

: That's a silly idea. If anything, actively edited pages should be indexed more often. You seem to actually want [[Wikipedia:Pending changes]]. [[User:Matma Rex|Matma Rex]] <small>[[User talk:Matma Rex|talk]]</small> 02:14, 15 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::I have doubtless used the wrong word.

== seeing what an old revision of a page looked like at the time? ==

This is probably a silly question, but is there a way to see how ''exactly'' an old revision of a page looked like at the time?

Sure, I can click on any old version in the history of a page, but any templates transcluded onto the old revision would still be their latest versions. Is any tool that displays an old revision of a page exactly as it was, using the old revisions of the templates or any other transcluded page? --[[User:Ixfd64|Ixfd64]] ([[User talk:Ixfd64|talk]]) 05:21, 15 May 2014 (UTC)

== Items disappearing from watchlist ==

{{archive top|result={{resolved}}}}
I've noticed recently that, after I have edited an article on my watchlist, it fails to list at all when I click on the watchlist.

*Under your watchlist preferences, do you have "Hide my edits from the watchlist" checked? If you do, and don't have "Expand watchlist to show all changes, not just the most recent" checked, I would think that it would take another editor in order for a page to show up on your watchlist again, since the most recent edit would be yours.

== Display problems ==
{{tracked|54091}}
Since yesterday, some old display problems have re-appeared. On the left-hand side of the page, the tabs "Interaction", "Tools", "Print/export", "Languages" and "Scripts" are no longer hide-able, and the search-bar at the top right doesn't pop straight down, but is aligned underneath "read", "edit" and "view history". When I had the first problem over 12 months ago, I was advised it was due to my then-outdated browser, and in addition to that, sortable wiki-tables weren't sortable. This time round, there isn't a problem with the wikitables sorting and I have the most recent [[Pale Moon (web browser)|Pale Moon web browser]]. Purging doesn't help, so what's causing this?

== Edit conflict ==

Something has been happening lately which never happened before. I make an edit (usually it's to an editor's talk page), click "Save", and then get "Edit conflict". I've had no trouble until recently dealing with the "Edit conflict" notice. I copy what I had typed from the bottom of the page, as instructed, and paste it to the top, but lately I've been getting the "Edit conflict" notice more often. I also noticed that in the instances where I just clicked "leave the page", and went to look, my edit, with my signature, is there. It was saved, even though it said "Edit conflict". And there was no other edit being made to that page at that moment. It's kind of annoying. What can I do to stop the "Edit conflict" notice from happening so often, and unnecessarily?

== Reflist should be shown when previewing a section edit ==
{{tracked|5984}}
This is an attempt to revive an [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 83#Reflist should be shown when previewing a section edit|older discussion]], which was unsuccessful because of dive into implementation detail. The essence of proposal is following:

:''In section preview the editing interface should provide preview of references (as formatted with {{tl|reflist}}).''

'''Rationale''': normally reference list is not available during section editing, which leads to two kinds of undesired edits:
* an editor misformats citation template(s) or
* an editor forgets to remove {{tl|reflist}} which was added temporarily to be able to review references.
Even if editor manages to avoid both issues, verifying correctness of citation formatting takes longer then it could have taken, be references presented during preview.

I specifically ask to avoid discussing placement, scope and implementation details for the required change. This poll is held in order to determine consensus on the general idea, so that more in-depth discussion about the proper way to implement this proposal could be started. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.

=== Problem with black screen on Monobook skin ===

I use the black background/green text gadget on Monobook. It is not currently working (was earlier). Some pages do not do it at all, others do it partially, so that bits of the screen are green on black, others ore blue on white.

=== Monobook skin screwed ===

In the Monobook skin, below the edit box there should be some clickable links for special characters. These have gone completely, and the copypaste fallback doesn't appear in their place - which is what normally happens when javascript is slow or AWOL. Also non-working are gadgets like "{{int:Gadget-righteditlinks}}", "{{int:Gadget-edittop}}" and "{{int:Gadget-OldDiff}}".

Once the problem is resolved, anyone who is aware that it's resolved (whether by a temporary fix, as in this case, or a complete fix) can close the thread, and there are lots of people who aren't involved in doing the actual fixing who would be watching the IRC feed or the bugzilla and could do so.  {{u|Matma Rex}}, I'm sorry to see you found some of your edits reverted; however, that may actually have to do with another thread on this page, aboute edit conflicts.

== Media Viewer: coming May 22 ==

Greetings everyone, this is a friendly [[#Media_Viewer_launches_next_week_on_the_English_Wikipedia|reminder from further up the page]].

The [[mw:Multimedia/Media Viewer/Release Plan|release]] for [[Wikipedia:Media Viewer]] is moving along, and we've scheduled Media Viewer to be enabled for all here on the English Wikipedia this coming Thursday, May 22. Currently Media Viewer has over 14,000 registered users trying it our here on English in their [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|Beta Features]] and I welcome you to try it out there before the broad release. After Media Viewer is switched on, there will be an option to disable it under the "Appearence" tab of your preferences if you do a lot of File: page work and do not find the viewer good for your work.

Please spread the word to any corner of this project you think might be interested about this change. I hope y'all like the improved file viewing experience. [[User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 21:27, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:It's already a default setting on Commons, I disabled it there. When I click an image, what I'm after is the file description page - primarily the licensing and categories. For a SVG file, I'm probably after the direct link to the original.

::Thanks for sharing your reasons, [[User:Redrose64|Redrose64]]. True, Media Viewer does not contain the extensive amount of other information you can find on a File page. Media Viewer's purpose is to provide a vastly better experience viewing the image and returning to text instead of being taken to the very, very cluttered File page. Once you've disabled Media Viewer you ''can'' still use it by clicking on "Expand view" right below the image. [[User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 23:35, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Wow, would it not be better to just put "Click this image to see it full size" on the desc. page than all this effort? That's how I do it at present, one click goes to the desc. page, the next click takes me to a large image on its own. The Media Viewer just forces me to scroll down to see info, if I wanted it full size I would click on it. How much research was done on how many people clicked through twice to see it full size ( and so did not want to see the desc.) compared to those that did not? And what were the results of that investigation?
:::All this smacks of making things really complicated to do simple things, then forcing us all to use them as default when we didn't want them, and then creating a workaround/selecting a preference to avoid whatever it was that we didn't want. This is the fifth time I have had this happen in the last five years, but two of them are this year, and it is only a third of the way through!

::::Overall site design is not something that should really be subject to mob rule. That is an excellent way to strangle development.

::::::::Well that's certainly not the kind of impression that I'm trying to give.
::::::::My point is that there are some things that we (everyone) can do to enhance the educational experience of Wikimedia projects. This includes when someone just wants to look at an image that is a thumbnail for a moment to get context, they shouldn't have to go to a clunky, ugly file page. Viewing an image associated with educational text has high learning value and we only increase it by not diverting attention by opening up a new page. Whether this tool is developed by the WMF or by volunteer manpower shouldn't be the point at all. The efforts to build any and everything here is collaborative, there are volunteers helping with Media Viewer both in code development and within communities for the release. [[User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 04:13, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

:::''How much research was done on how many people clicked through twice to see it full size ( and so did not want to see the desc.) compared to those that did not?'' - if you mean how many people clicked through the file page to see the full image, that was not measured (it would be hard and potentially invasive since it would require tracking users across wikis). We did measure how often people use various features of MediaViewer, though: there are about 5 million image views a day, and less than three thousand go to the image page from there. (The numbers are a bit off, since there is an extra shortcut to the file page for logged-in users, and that one is not measured - but logged-in views are a small minority, so that would probably not change the numbers by much.) So it seems that either the metadata MediaViewer provides is good enough for most people (which is not very likely), or they don't care that much about metadata in the first place. With such a huge discrepancy between the interests of readers and editors (very active editors, actually - in the surveys we did, less active editors were closer to readers than to active editors in their satisfaction level), editors getting a less decisive role in the design was maybe not such a bad thing.
:::Which is not to say editors should not play a major role in design - they did, actually. We tried to have an inclusive design process, with a long public beta period with public feedback, lots of mailing list conversations, IRC  office hours, roundtables... and if you have advice on how to make it even more inclusive, it is always welcome. But readers are affected by a change (or the lack of change!) in the image viewing experience just as much as editors, and they are the ones these sites exists for, after all; it would not be fair to expect that design decisions favor editors over readers all the time.

== Categorise a Cat ==

Adding a category to page [[:Category:Examples]] makes it a subcategory in that parent. Is it possible to categorise a category page as a page, not as a subcategory? Or maybe add its talkpage ([[:Category talk:Examples]]) through the subject page? (editing the subject page, and the talkpage would appear, which could be OK in situations). -[[User:DePiep|DePiep]] ([[User talk:DePiep|talk]]) 07:37, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

::No it's not that obvious, I'll describe more. I am working on a template that categorises pages into a maintenance category, say <nowiki>[[Category:MyMaintCat]]</nowiki>. That template should also work when put on pages in category namespace (that is, edited ''into'' a page <nowiki>[[Category:Holydays]]</nowiki>). But when the template categorises that one into <nowiki>[[Category:MyMaintCat]]</nowiki>), it appears as a ''subcategory'' (all standard behaviour so far). 
::What I would like to see is that the ''page'' <nowiki>[[Category:Holydays]]</nowiki> appears in the page list (expected somewhere near article <nowiki>[[Christmas]]</nowiki>). Listed nicely for maintenance.

== Is MediaWiki broken? ==

Or is it just parsoid? Or only one user script? See [[User talk:Technical 13#Responding to protected edit requests]]. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 14:12, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
:MediaWiki core isn't broken. Parsoid has a few minor bugs, which all of its consumers (VisualEditor, Flow, [[WP:EPH|the user script in question]], etc.) will appear to have as well. You can see whether a change is being introduced by Parsoid or its consumer by looking at its _rtselser output for a version of a page that one of its consumers broke. For example, to confirm that the unintended changes at https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Bot&diff=608957227&oldid=607060964 were caused by Parsoid, the page http://parsoid-prod.wmflabs.org/_rtselser/enwiki/Template_talk:Bot?oldid=607060964 (specifically, the red and green highlighted parts at the bottom) demonstrates that Parsoid does indeed show a "dirty diff" for that page, which matches the unintended changes made by the script. The Parsoid team is already aware of this particular bug, but any new ones found in this manner should be reported to them via [[bugzilla:]].

== Help with changes to educational assignment template ==

This is not a proposal to change anything yet -- I know that would be done elsewhere with [[Template:edit template-protected]]. Right now I just need help getting something right before I bother doing so. 

As discussed in [[Wikipedia:Education_noticeboard/Archive7#Current_vs._past_student_articles|this discussion, now archived, at the Education noticeboard]], I wanted to fix and modify [[Template:Educational assignment]] to better tell current from past assignments and to categorize based on when/if the assignment ended. I have a version mostly working in my userspace at [[User:Rhododendrites/sandbox/eduassign]]. Everything seemed to be going well until until I tried to reincorporate the parameter that links to a course page. It's functional, but inserting line breaks for reasons I can't figure out. [[User talk:Rhododendrites/sandbox/eduassign1]] is an example use of the template for a current course with link to the course page. [[User talk:Rhododendrites/sandbox/eduassign2]] is an example use of the template for a course in the past that doesn't try to use the link parameter.

As an additional question, am I threatening to break anything by defaulting undefined month to 12 and undefined day to 31 when one or both are missing but a year is specified? (The idea is to err on the side of overshooting assignment time rather than the template thinking it ended before it actually did).

Help would be appreciated. Thanks! --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 21:17, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

*Yeah, it looks like you just have a lot of extraneous newlines after your conditional ending brackets. One way to eliminate the newlines while retaining redability is to comment between conditionals brackets, so:

:::It does work by the same rules, but it's sneaky when you have conditionals stacked on top of each other, so the following code:

<code>
:::{{))}} '''<- first newline'''<br />
:::{{((}}#if:...<br />
:::{{))}} '''<- second newline'''<br />
:::{{#if:</code>

:::ends up giving you a line break whenever that middle conditional is found false, since the parser puts those two newlines together.

::::One trick that I use exploits the fact that leading and trailing whitespace is stripped by parser functions. Whitespace includes newlines; so if my initial thoughts were along these lines: <source enclose=div lang=text>{{#if: (condition1) | (outcome1) }}
{{#if: (condition2) | (outcome2) }}
{{#if: (condition3) | (outcome3) }}</source> I would move the newline from outside to inside, thus: <source enclose=div lang=text>{{#if: (condition1) | (outcome1)
}}{{#if: (condition2) | (outcome2)
}}{{#if: (condition3) | (outcome3)

== Using Skype on 3G ==

Dear technical experts:  This is only sort of a Wikipedia question, but I figure that someone here will know the answer. I am part of a committee at Meta that has decided to have an online meeting using Skype.  The meeting will last about one hour, and it is an audio + chat meeting  - no video. Unfortunately, at the time chosen for the meeting, I will be many miles from my DSL connection, attending a bluegrass event.  I do have access to a 3G connection with a 1GB per month contract.  I could take time out to attend the meeting by using headphones and responding through chat only to avoid flooding the meeting with the sound of fiddles and banjos.  My question is: How much of my monthly allotment will this take up?  If it's too much I won't be able to do it. I am assuming that the 3G connection has the speed to support this as long as it's being hosted by someone else. &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 03:40, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:As long as it's just chat and not video, you shouldn't have to have any problems with your data plans. I'd gauge a five minute chat conversation at only a couple MB at most. <small>Unless you plan on blasting fiddles and banjos for 20+ hours, but I doubt anyone in the conversation would want that.</small> <b>~<i><font color="#07517C">[[User:SuperHamster|Super]]</font></i><font color="#6FA23B">[[User:SuperHamster|Hamster]]</font></b> <small>[[User talk:SuperHamster|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/SuperHamster|Contribs]]</small> 04:05, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

== One-click prepopulating the EditPage user interface to expedite semi-automatic standardized talk page discussions ==

I know of some cases where clicking a link on a wiki-page prepopulates a form by using the [[mw:API]]. For example, [[Template:RMassist]] prepopulates the [[Special:MovePage/Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)|Special:MovePage]] form at [[Special:Permalink/609096810|Wikipedia:Requested moves/Technical requests]], where it is used. For example,
* <nowiki>([{{fullurl:Special:MovePage|wpOldTitle={{Urlencode: Usambara Eagle-Owl }}&wpNewTitle={{Urlencode: Usambara eagle-owl }}&wpReason={{Urlencode:Requested at [[WP:RM]] as uncontroversial ([[Special:Permalink/{{REVISIONID}}|permalink]])}}&wpMovetalk=1}} move])</nowiki> gives:
* ([{{fullurl:Special:MovePage|wpOldTitle={{Urlencode: Usambara Eagle-Owl }}&wpNewTitle={{Urlencode: Usambara eagle-owl }}&wpReason={{Urlencode:Requested at [[WP:RM]] as uncontroversial ([[Special:Permalink/{{REVISIONID}}|permalink]])}}&wpMovetalk=1}} move]).
In the above example it's prepopulated the ''To new title:'' and ''Reason:'' fields in that form. I've also had some success playing with similar prepopulating the [[Special:Block]] form, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Edit_protected&diff=next&oldid=321950455 here] was a short-lived use of this technique to prepopulate the standard EditPage user interface. [[mw:API:Edit]] documents the parameters available for editing pages with with <code>action=edit</code>. I have gotten some of these parameters to work. <code>action=edit</code> opens up the desired page's edit interface <code>&summary=</code> prepopulates the edit summary. <code>&section=new</code> opens up a new section for editing, but without the desired edit summary field. I suppose this is standard behavior for section edits, but it would be nice to be able to make a section edit with a customized edit summary. <code>&sectiontitle=</code> does ''not'' prepopulate the Subject/headline field, which I could live with if I could just put the section title at the top of the text box, but <code>&text=</code> doesn't prepopulate the text box of the new section either. Is there a way to make these parameters work this way? Do I need an [[mw:Manual:Edit token|edit token]] to use those parameters? If so, how do I do that? Thanks, [[User:Wbm1058|Wbm1058]] ([[User talk:Wbm1058|talk]]) 17:22, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:I don't know about specifying an edit summary for new sections, but preloading text in the editing box can be done by putting the desired text in a page and using the parameter <code>&preload=Page name</code>. This is used for the link in [[Template:Category interwiki]], for example. [[User:SiBr4|SiBr<sub>4</sub>]] ([[User talk:SiBr4|talk]]) 18:21, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks! I might be able to work with that. Where is parameter <code>&preload=Page name</code> documented? I don't see it at [[mw:API:Edit]]. I wonder if there are any other parameters not documented there that might be helpful. [[User:Wbm1058|Wbm1058]] ([[User talk:Wbm1058|talk]]) 18:48, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

:: {{re|Wbm1058}} [[mw:index.php#Edit and submit]] documents them all.

::{{ec}} The standard edit summary for new sections created by using the "new section" tab is based on the user-entered section name. So if the user enters a section heading like this:
:::{{Inputbox|Requested move on 19 May 2014|style=background:white;}}
::the saved edit summary will be:
:::<span class="comment">(→<span class="autocomment">Requested move on 19 May 2014: </span> new section)</span>
::that is, it is exactly as if they had entered:
:::{{Inputbox|/* Requested move on 19 May 2014 */ new section|style=background:white;}}
::into an edit summary input box. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 18:55, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

== Undesireable Change in the Page Template ==

Sometime in the past 24 hours, it appears that the HTML template for Wiki pages changed. It used to be that if you had just arrived at a page and hit the tab key, the focus would move to the "Search" text control. Now it jumps around among various links; I don't know if Search is even in the tab order; if it is, it's more than 10 tabs from the start.
I actually preferred the old layout (with the Search control on the left, similar to "Modern") but switched to the new layout ("Vector") because of the convenience of using the tab key that way. (As a sometime webpage designer/maintainer, my personal opinion is that the primary type-in area should have the focus as soon as the page is loaded.) If I can't have that, I guess I'll switch to "Modern," but I would really like to see this restored. [[User:Bgoldnyxnet|Bgoldnyxnet]] ([[User talk:Bgoldnyxnet|talk]]) 20:38, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:I'm not sure if this is your problem, but if you want to be focused on the search bar whenever the page loads, add
<source lang="javascript">$('#searchInput').focus();</source>
:to [[Special:MyPage/common.js|your common.js]]. /~[[User:HueSatLum|hue]][[User talk:HueSatLum#top|sat]][[Special:Contributions/HueSatLum|lum]]/ 21:48, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

:If it helps, there's also a [[WP:KS#List of access keys|shortcut]] that moves the cursor directly to the search box from anywhere on the page. For me (Firefox on Windows) it's Alt+Shift+F; the Alt+Shift part may be different for other browsers/systems (see [[WP:KS#Modifier keys]]). [[User:SiBr4|SiBr<sub>4</sub>]] ([[User talk:SiBr4|talk]]) 11:39, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

:: Thank you, that works. It's kind of an awkward gesture, but it still beats using the mouse.  Of course, this still means there's no good reason for me to sitck with "Vector". [[User:Bgoldnyxnet|Bgoldnyxnet]] ([[User talk:Bgoldnyxnet|talk]]) 03:41, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

== Purge-page tab (asterisk) ==

When enabled, the purge-page tab (added beside e.g. the "watch" tab) is identified only by an asterisk ("&thinsp;*&thinsp;"). Could this be replaced with something a little more substantial/meaningful, please, such as "P" (or even "purge")..? [[User:Sardanaphalus|Sardanaphalus]] ([[User talk:Sardanaphalus|talk]]) 09:08, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
:I'm all for it. However, the "*" is only shown in Monobook, and some users may be a little attached to it. <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'"> — [[User:Edokter|<span style="color:#008"><i>E</i>dokter</span>]] ([[User talk:Edokter|<span style="color:#080">talk</span>]]) — </span> 10:28, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
:Yes, it's compact; and when you've got the extra tabs associated with [[WP:SYSOP|the admin bit]], and those produced by some other gadgets, space becomes a premium. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 11:50, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
:* If it were "P" rather than "purge", I doubt it would eat more than its fair share of the tab row (and barely more than the current asterisk?). [[User:Sardanaphalus|Sardanaphalus]] ([[User talk:Sardanaphalus|talk]]) 19:31, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

::Another option for a purge link is listed under Preferences -> Gadgets -> Appearance. It is labeled "Add a clock in the personal toolbar that displays the current time in UTC (which also provides a link to purge the current page)." I find it useful. – [[User:Jonesey95|Jonesey95]] ([[User talk:Jonesey95|talk]]) 15:54, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
::* Thanks for this suggestion, which I'm now trying. Is there a way to customize the clock's output (e.g. no seconds)..? (Apologies if I've missed links to a config/preferences/etc page.) [[User:Sardanaphalus|Sardanaphalus]] ([[User talk:Sardanaphalus|talk]]) 19:31, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

<pre>
$( document ).ready( function() {
    $( 'a', '#ca-purge' ).text( 'Purge tab text' );
});
</pre>
:If you add that you your /common.js you can rename the tab to whatever you want. [[User:Werieth|Werieth]] ([[User talk:Werieth|talk]]) 20:18, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
:* That's great – especially after replacing the 'Purge tab text' with 'P' – thank you! I'm going to add it (as a collapsed item) to [[Wikipedia:Purge]]. [[User:Sardanaphalus|Sardanaphalus]] ([[User talk:Sardanaphalus|talk]]) 09:47, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

== Soft-blocking private addresses ==

There was recently [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive261#10.68.16.31|a thread on AN]] about a bot editing logged out.  I raised the question of whether there was any legitimate reason to allow anonymous editing from private IP addresses but it garnered no response.  This seemed like a better forum to get wider feedback on this question with a view to [[WP:SOFTBLOCK|''soft''-blocking]] all [[Private network|private IP address ranges]], and perhaps also external toolservers.  This technical measure would prevent (many) bots from editing logged out, hopefully alerting the operator to the problem sooner, and avoiding any drama.  Thanks, [[User:Bovlb|Bovlb]] ([[User talk:Bovlb|talk]]) 21:22, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:See [[User_talk:Anomie/Archives/2013#10.111.0.0.2F16]]. [[User:Legoktm|Legoktm]] ([[User talk:Legoktm|talk]]) 23:23, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:: Fair enough.  I wasn't expecting that to be an issue. Thanks for the link.  [[User:Bovlb|Bovlb]] ([[User talk:Bovlb|talk]]) 16:02, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

== "What links here" to group links from templates as it does with redirects ==

It would be very useful if the "what links here" page could be modified so that links from templates are separately categorised. At the moment, links from a navbox or sidebar are displayed as if the link is in-text. That means that altering links requires manually opening stacks of articles to find which ones link in-text and may need to be altered. In contrast, a template only needs to be altered once. For example, here: [[:Special:WhatLinksHere/Development_of_the_urinary_system]]. --[[User:LT910001|LT910001]] ([[User talk:LT910001|talk]]) 23:40, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

:It would be nice but as I wrote at [[Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)/Archive 122#WhatLinksHere overwhelmed by links in navigation templates]]: "It's a frequently requested feature but the developers will not implement it. See for example [[bugzilla:1392]] and [[bugzilla:3241]]." [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 23:57, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:This isn't technically feasible. To understand why, look at the following cases, and try to decide whether or not to include the link to "target" under the template:
:*Template:X1 contains <nowiki>[[{{{1}}}]]</nowiki>. A page contains <nowiki>{{X1|target}}</nowiki>.
:*Template:X1 contains <nowiki>target</nowiki>. A page contains <nowiki>[[{{X1}}]]</nowiki>.
:*Template:X1 contains <nowiki>{{{1}}}</nowiki>. A page contains <nowiki>{{X1|[[target]]}}</nowiki>.

:*Template:X1 contains <nowiki>{{#ifeq:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|Foo|[[target]]}}</noinclude></nowiki>. A page named Bar contains <nowiki>{{X1}}</nowiki>.
:As you'll see, you won't be able to come up with a consistent way of deciding which way to count them, so there's no chance that software could correctly figure it out. [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 00:48, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

::* I'm sorry, but I don't understand to what end or benefit this is.  Even if ''every'' instance out of 250K instances is the result of a single template, then you either still have to wait for months for the job queue to run through and process that template change or null edit every page to confirm that was the case.  So, the two options here is to either filter WHL to just the template namespace, fix those instances only, with for the job queue to process and update all of the cascading pages and see what is left, or go through every page and fix the ones that need fixing directly and null editing the rest (I prefer the first option and letting the job queue do it's job). — <span class="nowrap">&#123;&#123;U&#124;[[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]]&#125;&#125;</span> <sup>([[User talk:Technical 13|t]] • [[Special:EmailUser/Technical 13|e]] • [[Special:Contribs/Technical 13|c]])</sup> 02:16, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

::::Here's the main use:  You have an article, and you need to know how it's being used.  Maybe you're about to turn into in a dab page (and want to clean up the mess that you're about to create), or merge and redirect it, or change the subject in a reasonable but possibly significant way (so some of those links need to be sent to a different article), or maybe you're just trying to [[WP:Build the web]] to it better.  The article happens, unfortunately, to be listed in a navbox that is transcluded into five hundred pages.
::::You don't care which pages have a link only in the navbox.  You just want to find the real links (if any).

:Attempting to update all links is only one possible use for the feature. There is no perfect solution which will always give everyone what they want, but there rarely is about anything. A useful feature shouldn't be dismissed just because it isn't perfect. In [[bugzilla:3241]] I wrote:
:"At [[Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)/Archive 69#What links here and navboxes]] I suggested a relatively simple sounding version: An option to hide pages that would not have linked if no transclusions had been performed on them. This seems good enough for most purposes to me, and a big improvement over the current options."
:An implementation could simply scan the page source without performing any transclusions at all, and count which pages are still being linked. All other links in the rendered page would be considered template-generated. It would be nice to also catch some of Jackmcbarn's examples (especially "A page contains <nowiki>{{X1|[[target]]}}</nowiki>"), but none of them should be showstoppers.

== End-of-table rowspan incorrect render ==

[[Work_(Iggy_Azalea_song)#Release_history]] has a small table and as you can see, the last release entry should span two rows like the ones above.

== Insert Citation Toolbar has gone ==

I use the basic version of Wikipedia when editing, I don't use any add-ons or features. When I click edit, the tool bar at the top has the heading options "Advanced", "Special characters" and "Help"; until recently it had "Cite" too (with the sub-options web, book, journal, news ect) but that seems to have disappeared recently. I'm using the latest version of Firefox and I thought it might be something to with that such as compatibility, however it has disappeared on Google Chrome too and on my work's PC which uses Internet Explorer. I'm now having to manually write or copy + paste blank citations and it is rather annoying. It was much simpler before. Can someone please help? Or tell me of any easier less tedious ways to do references please? Regards [[User:IJA|IJA]] ([[User talk:IJA|talk]]) 16:37, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:Is the problem persisting?  I believe that it's added late in the page-loading process, so that suggests that it might disappear during peak activity (Twinkle disappears sometimes then, too).  The Cite menu is present for me at the moment, but it took an extra second or so to appear.

== Wikipedia editing bug ==

Once when I made an edit to [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)/Archive 106#Pending changes]], ever time I typed a character in the middle of the text during that one time of editing, it overwrote the next character instead of pushing all the characters after it forwards. It never happened any other time I edited Wikipedia that I remember. [[User:Blackbombchu|Blackbombchu]] ([[User talk:Blackbombchu|talk]]) 16:28, 21 May 2014 (UTC)

::I don't know what you mean by 'toggled' but there's no problem anymore. The problem I had during that one edit already got fixed all by itself the next time I was making an edit to the same 'Pending changes' section and I don't have that problem now either.

[[User:Blackbombchu|Blackbombchu]] ([[User talk:Blackbombchu|talk]]) 16:41, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:::80's point is that it was likely not a bug: this is how typing is supposed to work when the "Insert" key is pressed. (The idea is that, when you press "insert", the text processor switches from "insert" mode to "overwrite" mode, where you're replacing text with other text, rather than simply inserting it; the mode saves you a step and deletes the characters ahead of the cursor as you type. See also [[Insert key]].) So, this doesn't actually sound like a bug with Wikipedia, or even a bug at all.

== [[Template:Pie chart]] and the mobile version ==

[[Template:Pie chart]] seems to be broken on the mobile version of wikipedia, but not on the desktop version on the same phone and the same browser, see http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh#Demographics for an example. Is there something wrong with the css for the mobile version that prevents the template from rendering properly? Pie charts are pretty important for demographic articles, and the template is a common way of making them.

== AfC Invite Template Questions ==

A few questions:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JustBerry#AfC_Invite_Template_Test_-_Check_for_Autosign_Bot - here, the entire template page shows up. Is there a way to only get the top part of that template page to only get the template?
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JustBerry/AfCInvite - here, the Add To Participants button doesn't work. Is there any way to get the button to add a new section with a section header with their username and the text body preloaded as "Questions/Suggestions:" (somewhat similar to [[WP:GOCE]])
# Same page - Do you know of a way to have the template placer's signature at the end of the template?

== Languages messed up ==
{{tracked|32483}}
Hovering over the links to other languages at [[Danish West Indies]] produces a tooltip with the name of the other language's article, a dash, and the English name of the other language.  For example, hovering over Українська produces a tooltip of <Данська Вест-Індія – Ukrainian>  However, be-x-old is broken.  Hovering over Беларуская (тарашкевіца) produces a tooltip of <Дацкая Вэст-Індыя – Беларуская (тарашкевіца)> Note that the language is in its own name, not in English, in the tooltip.  [[Special:Contributions/129.79.34.79|129.79.34.79]] ([[User talk:129.79.34.79|talk]]) 20:43, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:The problem is that be-x-old is not a standard language code, and thus is not in [[CLDR]]. Wikipedia gets translated language names from [[mw:Extension:CLDR|the CLDR extension for MediaWiki]]. Since the CLDR extension already has "be-tarask" (which is also not in CLDR), I think it makes sense to add "be-x-old", which is basically an outdated version of be-tarask. Since it was not in CLDR, MediaWiki defaulted to getting the autonym from [https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-core/blob/master/languages/Names.php#L74 Names.php]. I have submitted a [[gerrit:134779|change]] to Wikimedia's code reviewer system which adds be-x-old to the CLDR extension (but not CLDR itself), which should fix this particular issue.  I would not be surprised if this change were to be rejected. However, there are other nonstandard codes this won't be fixed. For example, Wikimedia uses 'nrm' for [[Norman language|Norman]] instead of [[Narom language|Narom]], and 'als' for [[Alemannic language|Alemannic]] instead of [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk Albanian]].

== Media Viewer update: June 3 ==

Greetings all,

I posted a reminder last week about Media Viewer's scheduled deployment here on the English Wikipedia tomorrow, Thursday, May 22. After a meeting today the [[mw:Multimedia|Multimedia team]] and I agreed to space out the English full release just a little further so that we can be sure we can assist with the deployment and feedback as best possible. 

As a result, we will be moving Media Viewer out of Beta Features and enabled for everyone on '''Tuesday, June 3'''. If you haven't tried out Media Viewer yet, I encourage you to do so by turning it on in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|your Beta Features]]. You can find out more on [[Wikipedia:Media Viewer|Media Viewer's page]]. Please leave us feedback on either that talk page or on [[mw:Talk:Multimedia/About Media Viewer|the MediaWiki wiki]]. Thanks!

It is center-aligned if I remove the "wikitable" class from the table, so it must be something to do with that. But I can't coax it to center with the class still present, despite valiant attempts. The reason I ask is because I'm trying to center-align the bottom line at [[User:Mr. Stradivarius/UBX/RfX report]], but it appears left-aligned when I put that userbox inside the table on [[User:Mr. Stradivarius|my user page]].

== Ruh-roh ==

Hey I got a Wikipedia ''talk'' page in my results from DuckDuckGo. The string was {{xt|"Love Affair", Leslie Kenton}} (formatted just so) and the link was to [[Talk:Stan Kenton]] and it was the 25th result on the page and it repeated. I thought this was not supposed to be able to happen, wondering if this is a one-time glitch or what. [[User:Herostratus|Herostratus]] ([[User talk:Herostratus|talk]]) 00:22, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
:I don't know where you got that idea from, but it seems that talk pages are regularly indexed in search results. The exceptions are pages specifically mentioned in [//en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt robots.txt] and pages with [[Wikipedia:NOINDEX|<nowiki>__NOINDEX__</nowiki>]] (or a template that adds that). Talkpages of BLPs have templates which prevent them from being indexed, but, since Stan Kenton is not alive, this does not apply here.

There's hella lot of unreferenced and scurrilous gossip that goes on on talk pages even if they're not BLPs, along with complete nonsense. It seems it would be trivial to NOINDEX all talk pages on creation.

== Recent changes to Anoneditwarning ==

The usual edit notification when editing anonymously ([[MediaWiki:Anoneditwarning]]) was recently changed to feature a very large stop hand, from its previous and more subtle state.  Given that the primary use of the stop hand is in user warnings and block notices, this feels like a dramatic way to [[WP:BITE]] anonymous editors.  As best I can tell, there has been no discussion of this change (here or at [[MediaWiki talk:Anoneditwarning]], which directed me here), and I imagine it will interfere with [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Anonymous_editor_acquisition/Signup_CTA_experiment the current anonymous editor recruiting experiment].  Personally, I would like to be able to continue contributing anonymously without the user interface shouting at me every time. [[Special:Contributions/130.216.218.47|130.216.218.47]] ([[User talk:130.216.218.47|talk]]) 04:24, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
:I imagine {{ping|Risker}} might like a notification of this discussion. —<span style="font-family:'century gothic';background:black;border-radius:2em 0;">&nbsp;&nbsp;[[User:Dainomite|<span style="color:#008BE3">dain</span>]][[User_talk:Dainomite#top|<span style="color:#808080">omite</span>]]&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> 04:37, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks, {{u|Dainomite}}. There were several reasons behind this change. The first is that the previous version was so subtle that lots of first-time editors were missing it; then they'd come and ask for oversight of their IPs because it wasn't obvious to them that their IP would be publicly displayed; I'll point out that [[WP:BITE]] is actually focused on new editors, not experienced ones who may choose intentionally to edit knowing that their IP address will be visible, and indeed the first intention is to not bite those brand-new first-time editors.  Wikipedia is one of the very few websites that will publicly display user IP addresses, and I know some of the editor recruiting experiments include consideration of obscuring the IP information from the view of the general public, at least in part because it's rather shocking to the uninitiated.  Secondly, should a first-time editor who didn't realise her IP address would be put into the history want to take steps to remove it, they'll start by "undo", which only compounds the problem (now it's shown three times, twice as the editor "name" and also in the automatic "undo edit" summary), or if they're unusually savvy, they'll seek out [[WP:OVERSIGHT|oversighters]].  Although many oversighters have quietly taken care of those edits for many years under IAR, technically it's [[Wikipedia:Oversight/FAQ#Types_of_content_that_may_or_may_not_require_suppression|not grounds for suppression]], and a more rules-bound oversighter might very well revert, as in fact happened today.  Thus we bit a potential new editor twice - first by not making it really obvious to him that his IP address would show up in the history, and then by insisting that it remain there "because that is the rule". Finally, that notice is intended to be a warning, and warnings should not be "subtle", they should be obvious.  While I am very open to a change in the image to something else that is big and eye-catching (I used the stop sign because it's red and I knew where to find it), it does need to be obvious. We want new editors, and starting off by failing to give them good warning that what is normally non-public information will be published if they edit without an account, and then compounding that by refusing to provide them with a way of addressing this unintentional revelation, is [[WP:BITE|hardly the way]] to make them excited about participating.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 05:04, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
*As another point to 130.216.218.47, attracting, supporting and improving the experience of new editors is something that all of us should be doing; it's not the exclusive remit of the WMF product group. While I'm happy to have them trying things out, and doing experiments, I'm really not going to get worked up about making a change to a poorly designed warning message 90% of the way through an experiment. (Seriously? We wouldn't fix things when we see a problem because someone's doing data collection?) The current experiment looks to be primarily focused on the pre-edit condition, i.e. before the "Edit" button is clicked, in any case.

:*We ought to cease all discussion of IP editing as "anonymous editing" and make it clear in as many ways as reasonable that editing with an account, disclosing no personal information, is by far the most anonymous way to edit.

By the way, I agree with Risker that "it's not the exclusive remit of the WMF product group.". What we're saying is that A) the design should be balanced, so that it's not overly annoying B) we need to test one thing at a time. It takes just a couple weeks to finish an A/B test here and analyze it, and we shouldn't make new big changes while we're testing other changes to the experience. If we do that, it makes it impossible to tell what caused any effects in registrations or edits by IPs. <font style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">[[User:Steven (WMF)|Steven Walling (WMF)]]&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;[[User talk:Steven (WMF)|<span style="color: #8080b0">talk</span>]]</font>  22:16, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
*A follow-up note:  {{u|Ianmacm}} suggested using a different graphic (red triangle with exclamation point) that is an improvement over the more imperative stop-hand, and I've applied it. It was good of the OP to highlight his/her initial concerns, and on reflection I appreciate that using a graphic that's also on high-level, about-to-be-blocked user warnings was suboptimal.

::I had not realized that so many users were upset to see their IP addresses displayed; my feeling has always been that it may disclose some information about my affiliation and broad geographic location (which if anything is better for openness), but getting my actual name and contact details would require legal action.  I suppose that a first-time editor is unlikely to be aware of that, or may strongly wish not to disclose their employer or affiliation. Certainly those of us who persist in editing without accounts cannot keep at it without having thick skin, and there's nothing wrong with a bit of annoyance for us if it makes life better for new editors and reduces the amount of oversighting required.  

::In any event, what had struck me the most was the use of the stop hand. If I hadn't been doing this for many years, that message would certainly make me think twice about editing! Something akin to the red warning triangle (as is now in use) seems more appropriate to me, as it's not visually telling the prospective editor to stop what they're doing.

== I'm making a list ==

I'd like to have a list of MediaWiki features and extensions that were created by volunteer developers.  I know it's not going to be a short list, but I'd like it to be somewhat more specific and user-facing than "practically everything".  I thought it would be good to link to it off of [[:mw:How to become a MediaWiki hacker]], to give people an idea of how important volunteer devs are to the movement and the scale of things they usually work on.  

However, I don't think I could name even 10% of the things that belong in this list, and it's possible that someone else has already written it.  Does anyone have any advice for me, or suggestions of things to include in the list?  [[User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing]] ([[User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk]]) 23:20, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
: MediaWiki itself was created by volunteer developers from scratch ;) I'm pretty sure you could start with basically everything that the software included, say, pre-2010 – there's a nice list of features added in each subsequent version at [[MediaWiki version history]] (funny thing there's an article about this here).

== Proposing Template:Convert-range ==

Hello.

Wouldn't it be smart with a variant of {{tl|convert}} called {{tl|convert-range}} (or something similar)?

What I'm thinking of is a template where one can specify a range in one unit, and have the range converted into another unit.

Convert converts a single value, but Convert-range would work on ranges, in a way similar to Convert.

Like this:
* code <nowiki>{{convert-range|10|13|mi|km}}</nowiki> would result in "10–13 miles (16–21 km)"

It's hard to write good wikicode using Convert when dealing with ranges.

I tried to find out if there was already such a template, but couldn't find anything.

== Edit window annoyance ==

Lately, when I edit a page, the top line of text in the edit window is obscured. This seems to go away if I refresh once or twice, but it is very annoying, particularly when I am trying to edit that line.

[[File:WP edit screen offset problem.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of the problem I have been having when attempting to edit with Wikipedia.]]

Above is a screenshot of what I have been seeing (and continue to see) when I first open a window to edit. The first line is completely obscured, and the second line is partially obscured. The issue first cropped up about a week ago. Can someone help fix this? [[User:BD2412|<font style="background:gold">'''''bd2412'''''</font>]] [[User talk:BD2412|'''T''']] 18:00, 23 May 2014 (UTC)

== Talk page history problem (Byzantine Empire) ==

The [[Byzantine Empire]] article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Byzantine_Empire&dir=prev&action=history talk page] shows all history in the various archives, but the View history link does not show edits prior to the first archival in 2008.  It looks like someone mistakenly deleted all of the history elements when archiving the talk page on June 15, 2008 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Byzantine_Empire&oldid=219567351 THIS] edit).  There is a redirect to the archive, located [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Byzantine_Empire/Archive_1 HERE], but there is no capacity to view history in archives.  Or, rather, the history only shows the history of the archival.  Does anyone know how to remedy this situation?  I assume it is possible to recover the history from the underlying database (at least it seems to appear to be there and in exported XML).

This query is also posted on the article talk page, but it seems more appropriate here.[[User:Wikipositivist|Wikipositivist]] ([[User talk:Wikipositivist|talk]]) 03:58, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
:The history is at [[Talk:Byzantine Empire/Archive 7]], as shown by [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Talk%3AByzantine+Empire%2FArchive+1 these logs]. '''[[User:Graham87|Graham]]'''<font color="green">[[User talk:Graham87|87]]</font> 06:43, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks for the info Graham87.  It helps with that particular page, but I'm a bit confused regarding the archival process.  Do you (or does anyone reading) know why some archives take the history with them whereas most do not?  For example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Byzantine_Empire/Archive_6&action=history talk archive 6] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Byzantine_Empire/Archive_8&action=history talk archive 8] of Byzantine Empire do not have any edit history other than those edits associated with the archival, but archive 7 has the full history, which is now unavailable on the root page View history tab.  Most articles seem to have more or less complete edit history on the main talk page, with only the text moved to the archive.  
::For example, the [[Israel]] article has (predictably) sparked a lot of talk, with 30+ archives, but the main talk page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Israel&dir=prev&action=history View history tab] goes back to 2001.  ((Granted, there are some issues with that talk history since the first edit shows a link to "Previous revision" but that link goes to an edit from 2010, nine years later.  The fact that the talk page for that article predates the "first" article edit is also confusing.))  The [[Christianity]] article also seems to have all talk history on the main talk page [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&dir=prev&action=history View history] tab although it has 57 archives.  Is there some way on the root talk page to tell which pages have had history exported?
::I ask because the talk history is of interest to me, and I would like to be able to find it predictably/reliably.  I suspect some of these issues are a result of some ad hoc decisions waywayback, but I'm hoping someone has a handle on the archival process for talk pages (and can explain it to me, despite my limited expertise).  I hope my questions make sense, and I would be happy to try to clarify if helpful.  (I have not posted this on the article talk page since it no longer concerns only that page.)[[User:Wikipositivist|Wikipositivist]] ([[User talk:Wikipositivist|talk]]) 22:33, 26 May 2014 (UTC)
:::At one time, it was normal practice to move the talk page to a subpage (which then became the archive), and then to convert the freshly-created redirect into a non-redirected empty page (which then became the "proper" talk page). A page move takes the history with it. There are several problems with that technique, the main one being that it's inselective - you need to archive every single thread, including very recent ones and those with ongoing discussion. The normal technique now - which is used by {{user|ClueBot III}} and {{user|Lowercase sigmabot III}} - is to cut-and-paste individual threads. See [[Help:Archiving a talk page]] for preferred methods, and [[Help:Archiving a talk page/Other procedures]] for older methods. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 23:11, 26 May 2014 (UTC)

== Contributors to a Wikipedia page ==

== Watchlist heading ==
{{Tracked|65819}}
You know.  It's getting to be a bother to have to scroll down before I can see more than snip of my watchlist.  Is it really necessary to have it take up a half of your screen when it first loads.  There's so much redundant whitespace that could be put to good use to make it feel less cluttered.  The legend within the blue borders is longer than the content within it.  Any chance of compressing that a bit?—[[User:C678|<span style="color:green;font-family:Courier">cyberpower]] [[User talk:C678|<sup style="color:olive;font-family:Comic Sans MS">Chat]]<sub style="margin-left:-4.2ex;color:olive;font-family:Comic Sans MS">Online</sub> 02:22, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

Apparently, the bug affected new users that have only edited for a month, and IPs that have only edited for a month, e.g. any user that only had 1 bar, and 1 month, on the monthly charts.  It was causing the JS graphing library to loop infinitely, not only causing the browser to freeze, but really drain the PC's memory in the process.  It wasn't an issue until the optin was removed since all IPs weren't opted in at that time, and neither were new users.  I have patched it and it should work smoothly now.  Try looking up that user you were trying to look earlier, the one that froze, and see if it works.<p>TL;DR: {{fixed}}—[[User:C678|<span style="color:green;font-family:Courier">cyberpower]] [[User talk:C678|<sup style="color:olive;font-family:Comic Sans MS">Chat]]<sub style="margin-left:-4.2ex;color:olive;font-family:Comic Sans MS">Online</sub> 22:26, 27 May 2014 (UTC)

== "Save" button ==

For the past few days I have been having a problem with the "Save" button, in both IE11 and Firefox.  If I press "Save", it seems to take, but then the edit page comes up again; a proper "Save" only happens on the second attempt.  Why is this?  This does not happen every time I try to save a page, which is even odder.  Has anybody else been experiencing this problem?  --  [[User:P123ct1|P123ct1]] ([[User talk:P123ct1|talk]]) 11:22, 27 May 2014 (UTC)

== Prompt to create an account whenever I make an edit ==
{{Tracked|65566}}
{{Resolved}}
I'm sure there's probably a better place for me to report this but I can't think of where. If anyone knows of someone/somewhere better to take it to, please let me know. On to the problem, I'm an IP editor (i.e. I don't have an account) and for the last day every time I make an edit I get prompt coming up telling me I should create an account. I don't have a problem with this in principal, but the problem is it happens every single time I make an edit even if the edits are less than a minute apart and I'm on the same IP, computer, browser, etc. Surely once I hit the 'X' once it's clear I don't want to make an account and it shouldn't prompt again for at least a day? And unfortunately I can't just ignore it because it doesn't disappear in time (like the "your edit was saved" thing) and the prompt is rather large, covering both the search bar and the edit button.

Yes, Chris, it is a very new addition so I can understand there being teething issues. But even if it's just a technical issue, it's one the should be resolved ASAP.

** Sorry to be blunt, but do I sound like I don't know how to create an account and need those links pointed out to me? And more importantly, there are plenty of IPs who choose not to create an account for a multitude of fair reasons so you can guarantee it's not just the two people posting here that this has irritated. While I'm thinking about it, I also can't see any purpose for the prompt occurring when I make an edit in the Wikipedia namespace (or any namespace but the article namespace really). I'm perfectly happy to wait a while for this to be fixed, I can understand it not being of the highest priority, but honestly if the only long-term solution ends up being "you must create an account" I probably just won't bother editing anymore.

***There is a huge difference between "[http://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/05/16/anonymous-editor-acquisition/ Inviting anonymous editors to join the Wikipedia community]" (as linked below by John of Reading) and nagging them into it. The suggestion that IP editors should just "permanently fix" the annoyance by creating account is, imo, indefensible. Use of annoyance tactics like that would seem to me to conflict heavily with the right to edit Wikipedia in gf as an IP, as recently also enshrined in the new Privacy Policy.

::"primarily because Jimbo doesn't want long-term editors to gain too much control" Registration is not required to edit because we don't want to create excessive barriers to contribution for those who want to edit casually, and because anonymous editing is clearly a gateway to editing further for many Wikipedians.

== VisualEditor newsletter—May 2014 ==
Hello everybody. This is a <u>one-time posting</u> to this page to remind people to the availability of this opt-in newsletter. If you do not already receive it (about one per month) on your talk page and would like to, please add your page link to the subscribers' list at  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Newsletter&action=edit Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Newsletter]. --[[User:Elitre (WMF)|Elitre (WMF)]] ([[User talk:Elitre (WMF)|talk]]) 18:53, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

<div style="float:right;width:230px;margin-left:1em;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:1em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200px|center]]

'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">
[[File:VisualEditor - Editing References - Cite Pulldown.png|centre|277x277px]]
The cite menu offers quick access to up to five citation templates.  If your wiki has enabled the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" menu, press "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" and select the appropriate template from the menu.  

Existing citations that use these templates can be edited either using the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" tool or by selecting the reference and choosing the "{{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-reference-tooltip}}" item in the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu. 

Read [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]] for more information.
</div></div>

''Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] team has mostly worked on the new citation tool, improving performance, reducing technical debt, and other infrastructure needs''.           

The biggest change in the last few weeks is the new '''citation template menu''', labeled "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}".  The new citation menu offers a locally configurable list of citation templates on the main toolbar.  It adds or opens references using the simplified template dialog that was deployed last month.  This tool is in addition to the "{{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-reference-tooltip}}" item in the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu, and it is not displayed unless it has been configured for that wiki. To enable this tool on your wiki, see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/Citation tool|VisualEditor/Citation tool]].         

Eventually, the VisualEditor team [[:mw:Cite-from-id|plans to add autofill features]] for these citations.  When this long-awaited feature is created, you could add an ISBN, URL, DOI or other identifier to the citation tool, and VisualEditor would automatically fill in as much information for that source as possible.  The concept drawings can be seen at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Design/Reference Dialog]], and <mark>your [[:mw:VisualEditor/Design/Reference Dialog|ideas about making referencing quick and easy]] are still wanted.</mark>         

*  There is a '''new [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|Beta Feature for setting content language and direction]]'''.  This allows editors who have opted in to use the "{{int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-language-tooltip}}" tool in the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu to add HTML span tags that label text with the language and as being left-to-right (LTR) or right-to-left (RTL), like this:  <code><nowiki><span lang="en" dir="ltr">English</span></nowiki></code>.  This tool is most useful for pages whose text combines multiple languages with different directions, common on Right-to-Left wikis.
*  The tool for '''editing mathematics formulae''' in VisualEditor has been slightly updated and is now available to all users, as the "{{int:math-visualeditor-mwmathinspector-title}}" item in the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu.  It uses LaTeX like in the wikitext editor.
*  The '''layout of template dialogs has been changed''', putting the label above the field.  Parameters are now called "fields", to avoid a technical term that many editors are unfamiliar with.
*  '''[[:mw:VisualEditor/Portal/TemplateData|TemplateData]] has been expanded''':  You can now add "suggested" parameters in TemplateData, and VisualEditor will display them in the template dialogs like required ones.  "Suggested" is recommended for parameters that are commonly used, but not actually required to make the template work.  There is also a new type for TemplateData parameters:  wiki-file-name, for file names.  The template tool can now tell you if a parameter is marked as being obsolete.
*  Some templates that previously displayed strangely due to absolute CSS positioning hacks should now display correctly.
*  Several messages have changed:  The notices shown when you save a page have been merged into those used in the wikitext editor, for consistency.  The message shown when you "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cancel}}" out of an edit is clearer.  The beta dialog notice, which is shown the first time you open VisualEditor, will be hidden for logged-in users via a user preference rather than a cookie.  As a result of this change, '''the beta notice will show up one last time for all logged-in users''' on their next VisualEditor use after Thursday's upgrade. 
*  Adding a category that is a '''redirect to another category''' prompts you to add the target category instead of the redirect.
*  In the "{{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-media-tooltip}}" dialog, it is no longer possible to set a redundant border for thumbnail and framed images.
*  There is a '''new Template Documentation Editor for TemplateData'''.  You can test it by editing a documentation subpage (not a template page) at Mediawiki.org: edit [[mw:Template:Sandbox/doc]], and then click "Manage template documentation" above the wikitext edit box.  If your community would like to use this TemplateData editor at your project, please contact product manager [[m:User:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]] or file an enhancement request in Bugzilla.
*  There have been multiple small changes to the appearance:  External links are shown in the same light blue color as in MediaWiki.  This is a lighter shade of blue than the internal links.  The styling of the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-style-tooltip}}" (character formatting) drop-down menu has been synchronized with the recent font changes to the Vector skin.  VisualEditor dialogs, such as the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-savedialog}}" dialog, now use a "loading" animation of moving lines, rather than animated GIF images.  Other changes were made to the appearance upon opening a page in VisualEditor which should make the transition between reading and editing be smoother.
*  The developers merged in many minor fixes and improvements to MediaWiki interface integration (e.g., edit notices), and made VisualEditor handle [[:mw:Extension:Education Program|Education Program]] pages better.
*   At the request of the community, VisualEditor has been deployed to [[:commons:|Commons]] as an opt-in. It is currently available by default for 161 Wikipedia language editions and by [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|opt-in through Beta Features]] at all others, as well as on several non-Wikipedia sites. 

'''Looking ahead:'''  The toolbar from the [[:mw:Extension:PageTriage|PageTriage extension]] will no longer be visible inside VisualEditor.  More buttons and icons will be accessible from the keyboard.  The "{{int:visualeditor-dialog-command-help-title}}" link will be moved out of the "{{int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}}" menu, into the "{{int:visualeditor-help-tool}}" menu.  Support for upright image sizes (preferred for accessibility) and inline images is being developed.  You will be able to see the Table of Contents while editing.  Looking further out, the developers are also working on support for viewing and editing hidden HTML comments.  VisualEditor will be available to all users on mobile devices and tablet computers.  It will be possible to upload images to Commons from inside VisualEditor.  

If you have questions or suggestions for future improvements, or if you encounter problems, please let everyone know by posting a note at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]] or by joining the [[:meta:IRC office hours|office hours]] on Thursday, 19 June 2014 at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=10&min=00&sec=0&day=19&month=05&year=2014 10:00 UTC].

::::::::::::#{{re|Peridon}} you *can* test monobook when logged out: just add "?useskin=monobook" to the end of the address line. if there's already a question mark in the address line (true when editing), replace the "?" with "&".

Hi

I know that when several accounts are created during a training meeting (with the IP address), account creation is blocked after a certain number of accounts. I am looking for information (I could not find the info on help pages yet)
# How many accounts may be created prior to account creation blocking ?
# Is there a way to prevent the blocking prior to the event (when IP info is known) ? If so, how ?
# If account creation is blocked during the meeting, is there a way to ask for an unblock (where) ?

Thanks :)

== How to stop automatic "typo corrections" of a word that is not a typo? ==

Well, at least I've discovered that the edit summary ''"clean up, typo(s) fixed: Eg → E.g. (2) using AWB"'' is used by several people.  No point telling them they are wrong.

In the article [[Norwegian language]], the perfectly good word '''eg''' is found twice.  It constantly gets "corrected" as above, by various editors.  Is there some way to mark this word in the article so that it won't be "corrected"?  (Could it somehow be changed to an image, for example?)  

I'll watch this page for a while.  Thanks, [[User:Hordaland|Hordaland]] ([[User talk:Hordaland|talk]]) 18:39, 28 May 2014 (UTC)

== Undesirable automatic resizing of table column widths ==

I'm using a table with a collapsible table/[[Template:Hidden|hidden]] section within it.  The problem is, when that hidden table is shown/hidden, it's causing the width of the right-most column to change; this resizes other columns and causes occasional unwanted wrapping of text elsewhere in the table.

[[File:Wikitable ‘Column sizing’ bug.png|652px|Screenshot of Wikipedia showing a bug… for use in discussion at Village pump (technical).]]<br />
I could try to find workarounds and build them into the table; but it'd obviously be easier & more efficient coding if it actually turns out to be a wikitable bug and can be fixed on that end.  <br />An example of a template demonstrating the problem is: {{Ontario provincial election, 2011/Ottawa Centre}} Click the ['''show'''] link for the Source(s) and note how the Expenditures column resizes, which causes text in the Party column to wrap and increases the overall height of the upper section of the table (which should remain constant).  Additional examples (using this same template set) can be found in {{tl|Canadian election result/testcases}}.<br />

That brings up additional wikitable problems, which became apparent through the same template series; that issue has to do with borders of cells.  '''Example:'''<br />
{| width=100%
|-
|
{| class=wikitable
|-
! Column 1 !! Column 2 !! Column 3 !! Column 4 !! Column 5
|-
| A || B || C || D || E
|-
| F || G || H || I
|-
| J || K || L || M || N
|-
| colspan=2 | O || P || Q || R
|-
| S 
|-
| T || U || colspan=2 | V || W
|-
| X || Y || Z || AA || AB
|}
|
{| class=wikitable
|-
! Column 1 !! Column 2 !! Column 3 !! Column 4 !! Column 5
|-
| A || B || C || D || E
|-
| F || G || H || I
|-
| J || K || L || M || N
|-
| colspan=2 bgcolor=white | O || P || Q || R
|-
| S 
|-
| T || U || colspan=2 | V || W
|-
| X || Y || Z || AA || AB
|}
|}
Depending on the which way the wind's blowing (or some other equally unrelated mystery factor), cell "K" (in the above examples) may or may not have a bottom border.  On other occasions (in more complex adaptive template based examples), cells such as "N", "U", "V", & "W" (where there's an empty ‘nothing’ above) may not have top borders.  Just to make it really interesting, the missing bottom borders ("K" or the row above "Total valid votes/Expense Limit" in the transcluded ''Ottawa Centre'' template above) will occasionally appear later (after scrolling or typing in the code window, etc) and sometimes it won't (which makes me think that that one might be a browser issue rather than just a wikitable issue).  The missing top borders ("N", "U", "V", & "W" and the like) seem, if missing, to remain missing {{resize|(they do appear properly in the example tables above, so that problem isn't demonstrated here, but appears in some of [[Template:Canadian election result/testcases|these testcases]])}}; so that's likely an unrelated issue.  A work-around for the missing top borders exists; setting the style="border-bottom:none;" on the upper row and style="border-top:1px solid darkgray;" on the lower row forces the table to properly draw the border all the way across; but the intermittent bottom border issue is another story.  My browser is IE 10.0.9200 (Update: 10.0.16) on Windows 8.0 {{resize|(Outdated, I know)}}; but I believe these issues even appeared when I was using Firefox not too long ago.  Is everybody on every browser even seeing the same issue(s)?

:It's not a good idea to design a table to have an ideal layout by specifying any of the column widths - quite simply, you do not know how wide the screen is (other than your own). Regarding the missing borders: the lack of cells above N, U, V, W etc. is certainly a factor, and the cell should be present even if it will always be empty. Another factor is variation between browsers: what looks good in (for example) Opera might look dreadful in (say) Internet Explorer. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 19:28, 29 May 2014 (UTC)

== Pending changes configuration ==

I installed [[mw:Extension:FlaggedRevs]] on my wiki. Edits by IPs will go live immediately, instead of being held until a reviewer approves it.

== Forward/backward links in [[Special:ListFiles]] ==

The table is in chronological order, and sortable forward/backward by that column but no other. The links to jump between pages are named "First page", "Previous page", "Next page", and "Last page". Those terms are confusing because depending on sorting direction, "next" and "previous" could be parallel to the direction of time or opposite. For example, the default order appears to be newest first, then progressing back into history, but it's the "next" button that takes you to the ''next screen'' that is the ''previous timeframe''. It would be clearer if they were called "older" (and "oldest") and "newer" (and "newest"), just like the analogous links are named in [[Special:Contributions]].

Also, even on one of the extreme pages (first or last), all 4 links are still active, suggesting that there is something before the first page (or after the last). Again as with contributions-history and similar pageable lists, links that suggest additional content vs returning to the same page should be disabled.

== Finding earliest version of a Wiki article ==

I know clicking a date in an article's "Revision history" pages will show the version on that date, but I cannot see how to locate the earliest version of an article.  This because at the top of  the first page in "Revision history": 
* I can't see how to fill in the box to find the earliest date.

* Clicking on external tool "Revision history search" below the box leads to a WikiBlame page, but I don't know how to fill it in correctly.  (I tried putting in an early date, pressed "Start", but nothing happened.)

* I looked at Help:Page history and Help:Edit summary, but still couldn't understand how to find an article's earliest version.

I just want to write <code><nowiki>{{User:Josve05a/template-sanbox|1}}</nowiki></code> (meaning it is <code>{{para|1}}1</code>) For Reason 1 and <code><nowiki>{{User:Josve05a/template-sanbox|2}}</nowiki></code> (meaning it is <code>{{para|1}}2</code>) for Reason 2.

:Yeah, it's pretty easy. Instead of #if: conditions, you want to use a #switch:. So something like <code><nowiki>{{#switch: {{{1|}}}</nowiki> | 1 = reason #1. | 2 = reason #2. <nowiki>}}</nowiki></code> will check the first parameter, <nowiki>{{{1|}}}</nowiki>, and send "reason #1." if that parameter is equal to "1", and "reason #2." if that parameter is set to "2".

* {{Ec}} Sure, not defining 1= or 2= implies the first parameter is 1=. Therefor, you just need to adjust your code so that if 1=1 use reason 1 and if 1=2 use reason 2.

== History merge and undelete ==

Dear technical experts:  I am learning to perform history merges, and I want to make sure that I have a clear understanding of the process. I have two questions:

*Some articles have in their history revisions that are deleted even though the article itself is not deleted.  For example, [[Madison Eagles]] has 250 deleted edits because it was deleted many times.  Other articles may have had selective revision deletions.  If in the process of a history merge, or as a result of an undelete request, a deleted article with this mixed history is to be undeleted, how can you tell which of the revisions to restore, and which should remain deleted? Or do you have to make a note of this ahead of time? 

*Am I right in assuming that when an article is deleted, then selectively restored, and later moved leaving a redirect, only the restored edits are moved to the new title, leaving the deleted edits in the history of the old page which is now a redirect?   &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 02:39, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
:*If it has mixed history, you need to make a note ahead of time. It's not as bad as it seems, though, since unless weird stuff already happened with the page, all of the "real" deleted revisions will be older than the temporarily deleted ones. Worst case, you may find yourself comparing timestamps on log entries.
:*Yes. Deleted edits don't move. [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 02:51, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

*Thanks, [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]].  Okay, checking the deletion log times makes sense.  However, sometimes an article is deleted and restored, and other times an article is deleted and then newly created.  If an article is to be restored, for example as a result of a G13 refund request, it would seem that I should look down the list past any previous delete/restore pairs until I come to a page creation, and stop there even if there are more deletions and restorations further back.  Is there no way in this case to detect selective revision deletions, since the article will have already been deleted before I see it?  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 03:27, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
::There's no way to know exactly which revisions used to be deleted. If you get a messy case like this, you can make it simpler by moving the pages elsewhere (to get a clean area to put the deleted revisions), performing the history merge, then moving the result back where it belongs. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sprint_Corporation&offset=20130712000000&action=history] for an example of when this was done. [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 03:45, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

*I tried this on one of my own user pages.  First I copied [[User:Anne Delong/Burleigh Falls]] to [[User:Anne Delong/Burleigh Falls (2)]], and then added late edits to the first while improving the second. I followed the standard instructions, but although the article looked good on the surface, this left the late edits jumbled into the history as expected.  Then I did another copy-paste to [[User:Anne Delong/Burleigh Falls (3)]], added AfC comments to the old page and editing the new one as well.  This time I used the alternate instructions, moving the new page over the old, then undeleting everything except the AfC comments and the junk from the first failed merge.  Then I moved the page back.  I think it's right this time.  Can someone check my work and see if I have forgotten anything?  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 10:59, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
**From my perspective, that looks good. I can't be sure, though, since I can't see what revisions are deleted. [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 15:05, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

*Okay, next question (sorry).  I didn't see anything in the instructions about accompanying talk pages.  I'm presuming that if I just move an article page, merge it with a draft, and move it right back, the talk page will just stay there and nothing will need to be done.  But, now that the AfC submissions are being moved to Draft space, in the future there could be two talk pages involved.  It doesn't seem right to leave old discussions on the talk page of a redirect, where they would never be seen.  Should these just be cut and and pasted to the talk page of the mainspace article?  Couldn't that cause broken links?  I know that this isn't so much a technical question, but it kind of goes with the rest.... &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 16:15, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
**If they're worth keeping at all, then yes, just copy and paste them. [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 17:33, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
***Since the talk page entries are ''supposed'' to be signed this sounds good, but to retain attribution it is better to histmerge the talk page too.

:{{ping|Sandstein}} Add <code>closeAFD_redirectlimit = 500;</code> to [[User:Sandstein/vector.js]]. That will override the script's limit. [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 19:27, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

:::You closed with "Can be redirected at editorial discretion". Of course deleting all its own redirects makes this much harder.  A redirect would have probably been a better close here.

== Navigating mobile interface ==

I'm using Firefox on Android Galaxy S3 to access the mobile website. Is there any way to get to a talk page other than by manually editing the URL? Is there any way at all to do a  wiki search? Please {{tn| ping}} me. --[[User:Thnidu|Thnidu]] ([[User talk:Thnidu|talk]]) 05:20, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
:{{replyto|Thnidu}} If you go into the Mobile website and into it's settings and then enable the Beta mode, you will get a new 'button' (with speech bubbles) that will take you to the Talk page. —[[User:TheDJ|Th<span style="color: green">e</span>DJ]] ([[User talk:TheDJ|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheDJ|contribs]]) 07:36, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
