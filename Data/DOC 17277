==Graduate school and early career==

Clippinger received a fellowship to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School]], where he studied cybernetics and information theory, completing his master’s thesis on a computer simulation and statistical analysis of adaptation strategies for “self-organizing symbolic system”. While in graduate school in Philadelphia, he worked with the Black Panther Breakfast program and Hispanic Young Lords and North Philadelphia gangs to mitigate youth violence. He entered the University of Pennsylvania doctoral program to study content analysis, computational linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. While in graduate school he worked as a Research Associate at the [[Brandeis University#The Heller School|Brandeis University Florence Heller School]], where he applied cybernetics, systems theory and simulation models to the design and delivery of integrated and accountable human services. From 1972- 1975, he undertook his thesis research at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab working with Terry Winograd, and with the support of Stephen Kosslyn, he published it as a book, Meaning and Discourse: A Computational Model of Psychoanalytic Cognition and Discourse, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Henry Clippinger Jr|title=Meaning and discourse : a computer model of psychoanalytic speech and cognition|year=1977|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801819431}}</ref> It was the first computer model of distributed, multi-agent cognition and discourse composition derived from transcribed discourse. In 1976–1979, Clippinger became a Research Fellow at Harvard’s Information Resources Policy Program working with Professor Anthony Oettinger, where he conducted research on cross border data flow, telecommunications and development and information privacy. In 1978-80, he became an Expert Advisor for the formation of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and with Art Bushnell, helped formulate some of the United States first information policy.

In 1980 Clippinger founded one of the first artificial NLP (natural language processing) software companies, Brattle Research Corp. The company was an early innovator in natural language processing, content categorization, object oriented databases, financial trading compliance and oversight, [[Libor|LIBOR]] interest rate swaps, and “information refining” strategies. The company was funded by competing LISP machine vendors, Texas Instruments and Symbolics, and partnered with Dow Jones online services to prototype a bitmap graphic, semantically indexed and linked version of the Wall Street Journal. When the company was sold, Clippinger joined for seven years Coopers & Lybrand, where he became Director, Intellectual Capital and developed one of the first fully automated semantic classification intranet services, called CLIPS (Coopers & Lybrand Intellectual Property Service). Clippinger founded three other companies (Context Media, Lexeme/LingoMotors/ EcoCap/Azigo) and he then consulted on networked organizations to the [[Command and Control Research Program]] (CCRP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks, Information and Integration)before becoming a Senior Fellow at the Harvard Law School Berkman Center for Internet and Society. During this time, he was also active as an Aspen Institute Fellow and member of the Santa Fe Business Network, and authored and edited the book, The Biology of Business: Decoding the Natural Laws of Enterprises (Jossey Bass, 1998).<ref>{{cite book|last=ed|first=John Henry Clippinger|title=The biology of business : decoding the natural laws of enterprise|year=1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=078794324X|edition=1st}}</ref> At the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, he founded the Social Physics project and co-founded Project Higgins for user control over personal data and the Law Lab with a grant from the Kauffman Foundation.

He is the author of a book and many articles on topics related to identity, trust frameworks and governance: A Crowd of One: The Future of Individual Identity (Perseus, Public Affairs, 2007);<ref>{{cite book|last=Clippinger|first=John Henry|title=A crowd of one : the future of individual identity|year=2007|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=1586483676|edition=1st}}</ref> with David Bollier, A Renaissance of the Commons: How the New Sciences and Internet are Framing a New Global Identity and Order, chapter in Code: Collaboration, Ownership and the Digital Economy Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.2009;<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Ghosh|editor-first=Rishab Aiyer|title=CODE collaborative ownership and the digital economy|year=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262256247|pages=259–286|chapter=A Renaissance of the Commons: How the New Sciences and Internet are Framing a New Global Identity and Order}}</ref> Social Physics, Designing New Social Institutions, The Center for Natural and Social Science, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing China, September; 2007 ; On Protecting One’s Good Name: An Inquiry into Effective Reputation and Rating Systems, in Hassan Massum, Mark Tovey, editors, Reputation Society, MIT Press: 2012;<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Masum |editor-first=Hassan |editor2=Mark Tovey |title=The reputation society : how online opinions are reshaping the offline world |year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262016643}}</ref>  Digital Innovation in Governance: New Rules for Sharing and Protecting Private Information, in Kauffman Task Force on Law, Innovation, and Growth, Rules for Growth; Promoting Innovation and Growth Through Legal Reform, p.&nbsp;381-407, 2011, Marion Kauffman Foundation.<ref>{{cite book |author=The Kauffman Task Force on Law |title=Rules for growth : promoting innovation and growth through legal reform |year=2011 |publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation |location=Kansas City, Mo. |isbn=9780983177500}}</ref>
