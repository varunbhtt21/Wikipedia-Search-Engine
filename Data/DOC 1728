:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Long enough, new enough, well cited, didn't notice close paraphrasing or other problems. Regarding the hook, given that the citations don't agree on the bugging (one article says former employees claimed there were bugs, another says no devices were found) how about this for an alt?
:* '''ALT2''':... that '''[[Carling Campus]]''', the future home of [[National Defence Headquarters (Canada)|National Defence Headquarters]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]], was rumored to contain [[covert listening device]]s?

:*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Unsigned review, and it's unclear which of the two original hooks were reviewed (and whether one or both have problems). Need someone new to check the new ALT2 hook, plus another opinion on the original hooks would be nice. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 04:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
