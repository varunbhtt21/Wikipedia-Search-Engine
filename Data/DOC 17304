The [[Allmusic]] review awarded the album 4 stars stating "This intriguing set features Jimmy Raney in a set of overdubbed guitar duets with himself. He put a lot of thought into the interpretations".<ref name="Allmusic">Yanow, S., [http://www.allmusic.com/album/solo-mw0000940813 Allmusic Review] accessed April 30, 2014</ref>
