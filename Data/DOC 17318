The son of Jean Orillat and Marie Dupuy, he was born in [[Barbezieux]] and came to Canada at a young age. He was involved in the [[fur trade]] in the [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Michilimackinac]] and [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|La Baye]] areas and also operated a shop in [[Montreal]]. Orillat also lent money and dealt in real estate, lumber and wheat.<ref name="cdob"/> He operated in partnership with various other merchants, including [[Pierre Foretier]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Canada's Entrepreneurs: From the Fur Trade to the 1929 Stock Market Crash |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDSDuZXe5zoC&pg=PA99 |page=99 |last2=Ross |first2=J.

After the invasion of Quebec in September 1775 by the Americans, some parishes in the [[Richelieu River|Richilieu]] valley joined the Americans. Orillat was sent by Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Carleton]] with an offer of amnesty, but was taken prisoner and brought to [[Connecticut]]. He was able to escape in late December of that year and had resumed business by September of the following year.<ref name="cdob"/>

He was married twice, both times in Montreal: first to Marie-Amable Filiau, dit Dubois in 1761 and then to Thérèse-Amable Viger in 1767.<ref name="cdob"/>

Orillat died in Montreal. After his death, his estate was left to his daughter Luce-Amable. Her husband Alexis Réaume took over the operation of the business interests but, by 1786, the firm of Rashleigh and Company in London had taken over the operation of the estate.<ref name="cdob"/>
