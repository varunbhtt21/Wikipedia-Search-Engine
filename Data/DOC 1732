'''Cameleon''' is a free and [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Visual programming|graphical language]] for [[functional programming]], released under an [[MIT License]].

Cameleon language is a graphical data flow language following a two-scale paradigm. It allows an easy up-scale, that is, the integration of any library writing in C++ into the data flow language. Cameleon language aims to democratize macro-programming by an intuitive interaction between the human and the computer where building an application based on a data-process and a GUI is a simple task to learn and to do. Cameleon language allows conditional execution and repetition to solve complex macro-problems.

Cameleon is built on an extension of the [[petri net]] model for the description of how the Cameleon language executes a composition.

== Features ==
* Graphical Algorithm Editor,
* Real time calibration,
* Dynamic building,
* Multi-Scale approach,
* XML-based model for data definition and manipulation based on [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]], [[XPath]] and [[XQuery]],
* Easy integration of new algorithm with the dev kit.
