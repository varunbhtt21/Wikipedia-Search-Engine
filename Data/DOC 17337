* ... that '''''[[Zanabazar (dinosaur)|Zanabazar]]''''' ''(pictured)'' is known from a larger well-preserved braincase than any assigned to ''[[Troodon]]'', yet estimates of the brain volume of ''Troodon'' are higher than ''Zanabazar''?
:* '''ALT1''':... that '''''[[Zanabazar (dinosaur)|Zanabazar]]''''' ''(pictured)'' was previously classified as a species of ''[[Saurornithoides]]'', and might be a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of either ''[[Borogovia]]'' or ''[[Tochisaurus]]'', from the same region?
:* '''ALT2''':... that '''''[[Zanabazar (dinosaur)|Zanabazar]]''''' ''(pictured)'' is only known from a {{convert|272|cm|in|abbr=on}} long skull and some non-skull material, and is estimated to be the longest [[Troodontidae|troodontid]] known?
:* '''ALT3''':... that '''''[[Zanabazar (dinosaur)|Zanabazar]]''''' ''(pictured)'' was named in honor of [[Zanabazar]], the spiritual head of [[Tibetan buddhism]]?
:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/Przevalski's Nuthatch|Przevalski's Nuthatch]]
:* ''Comment'': I have little-to-no preference over which ALT to use, but I find the most interesting one to be the original. [[User:Reid,iain james|IJReid]] ([[User talk:Reid,iain james|talk]]) 04:14, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] This article is long enough and new enough. The image is appropriately licensed. Only the abstract of the main source is available to me and all the hooks are referenced to it and accepted in good faith. I prefer ALT3 because it is short, simple and straightforward.

[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] Pulled from prep. Please address the concerns regarding close paraphrasing as reported on [[WT:DYK#Copyvio in Zanabazar (dinosaur)]]. Thanks. --[[User:PFHLai|PFHLai]] ([[User talk:PFHLai|talk]]) 04:47, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] 20 days and no response from nominator.  Admin removed copyvio two days ago with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zanabazar_%28dinosaur%29&diff=prev&oldid=609938891 this edit].  The article is now a 812 character stub.
