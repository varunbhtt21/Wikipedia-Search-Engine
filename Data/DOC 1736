The '''Chebakia''' ({{lang-ar|شباكية}}) is a pastry of Moroccan origin<ref>[http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/dessertsandcookies/r/Chebakia.htm about.com]</ref> made of strips of dough rolled to resemble a rose, deep-fried until golden, then coated with a syrup made of [[honey]] and [[rosewater]] and sprinkled with [[sesame]].

Similar pastries include the [[Cartellate]] and the [[Fazuelos]], though the latter is constructed differently, and is thinner and less dense.
