'''Joep Franssens''' (born 13 January 1955) is a Dutch [[composer]].

==Work==
Joep Franssens studied piano in Groningen and composition in the Hague and Rotterdam with composer [[Louis Andriessen]] and [[Klaas de Vries (composer)|Klaas de Vries]] respectively. Franssens is a representative of the post-serial generation of Dutch composers who use tonal means and an accessible idiom without neo-Romantic features, even if the pathos-laden, highly emotional nature of his music appears to contradict this endeavour. In his works, which consist of chamber music, choral and orchestral works, Franssens aims at a synthesis of monumentality and euphony and is initially guided by J.S. Bach and the work of György Ligeti such as Lontano and Atmosphères. Later a trend towards radical austerity become apparent under the influence of American [[Minimal music|minimalist music]], East European mysticism (e.g. [[Arvo Pärt|Pärt]]) and the symphonic pop music of the 1970s such as Yes and Genesis, culminating in the static diatonicism of the ensemble work ‘Dwaallicht’ (1989) and the serene counterpoint of ‘Sanctus’ for orchestra (1996, rev. 1999). The instrumentation increasingly shows a preference for warm, luxuriant colours.<ref>1997 Sound, Johan Kolsteeg PhD, 'Key Notes' XXXI/I-1997, p. 20-23;</ref>

Although Franssens' multifaceted musical style does not make it easy to classify him, he is often regarded as a representative of the so-called New Spirituality in the Netherlands.<ref>2015 Musical Religiosity, dr. Martin J.M. Hoondert (Tilburg University), 'Temenos', Vol. 51, no 1, 2015, p.123 - 136</ref> NTR (Dutch public Television) made the documentary 'The Third Ear' on this international movement, with composers such as [[Arvo Pärt]] and [[Giya Kancheli]].<ref>2009 The Third Ear, documentary on Joep Franssens, a.o. Produced by Viewpoint Productions and NPO (Dutch Public Television)</ref> In his music Franssens aims to express the Universal; his sources of inspiration are to be found amongst writers and philosophers like Fernando Pessoa and Baruch de Spinoza.<ref>1999 Affirmation and Restraint: Relationships between concepts of spirituality and music in the work of Joep Franssens and Daan Manneke. Prof. dr. Rokus de Groot, published in the ASCA Yearbook 1999</ref> In a rich tonal language his music evokes strong emotions by the public, both unacquainted with contemporary classical music as well as experienced listeners. 

Franssens' choral work ''Harmony of the Spheres'' has been performed globally.<ref>2010 Joep Franssens Harmony of the Spheres, A Conductor's Analysis, Dr. David Andrew Hobson, Louisiana State University, USA December 2010</ref> He worked with choirs such as the Swedish Radio Choir, BBC Singers, Latvian National State Choir, Finnish Radio Chamber Choir and [[Nederlands Kamerkoor|Netherlands Chamber Choir]]. The latter took Franssens’ music on tour through Europe and the USA in 2000 and 2001, led by the Estonian conductor Tõnu Kaljuste. Multi-laureate pianist Ralph van Raat has his music on his repertoire since 2000. His orchestral music is performed by many Dutch orchestras. 

Well-known conductors like [[Yakov Kreizberg]], [[Tõnu Kaljuste]], [[Lukas Foss|Lucas Foss]], [[Gerd Albrecht]], [[Vasily Petrenko]], and Daniel Raiskin performed his works with the [[Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]], The Hague Philharmonic Orchestra, [[Łódź Philharmonic|Lodz Philharmonic]] Orchestra, Latvian National State Orchestra, [[Radio Filharmonisch Orkest|Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Tallinn Chamber Orchestra. 

Franssens received commissions from, amongst others, Rotterdam Art Foundation, [[Eduard van Beinum]] Foundation, [[De Doelen]], NTR ZaterdagMatinee, Fund for the Creation of the Arts, SNS Reaal Fund and [[Netherlands Symphony Orchestra]]. The latter performed the world premiere of ''Bridge of Dawn'' (Second Movement) in Spring 2013.<ref>2016 Joep Franssens, catalogue, DEUSS Music (managed by Albersen Verhuur), The Hague, July 2016</ref>

On the occasion of the 80th birthday of Arvo Pärt in November 2015, the first performance of his Piano Concerto<ref>2015 Piano Concerto by Ralph van Raat, interview - mini- documentary with English subtitles. You Tube</ref> took place with soloist [[Ralph van Raat|Ralph Van Raat]] accompanied by the [[Noord Nederlands Orkest]] conducted by Tõnu Kaljuste. Just prior to the premiere, Franssens was awarded ‘Het Gouden Viooltje’ (The Golden Violin).  An award earmarked for outstanding musical talent, born in the northern Dutch provinces, with an international career.<ref>2015 Gouden Viooltje voor componist Joep Franssens, Dagblad van het Noorden, Groningen 30 October 2015</ref>
