'''''Peter Pan Live!''''' is a [[television special]] that was broadcast by [[NBC]] on December 4, 2014. The special featured a [[Live television|live]] production of the [[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|1954 musical adaptation]] of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'', televised from [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]], starring [[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]] in the [[Peter Pan|title role]] and [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Captain Hook]].

The production was a follow-up to ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]''—a similar adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' which aired on NBC in December 2013 and brought the network's highest Thursday-night ratings since 2004. NBC's entertainment head [[Bob Greenblatt]] would sign [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]]—who served as the [[executive producer]]s of the special, to produce another live musical for the 2014 holiday season. Additionally, the production served as a follow-up to three productions of ''Peter Pan'' produced for NBC in 1955, 1956, and 1960 that featured cast members from its original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run.  While similar in content to the original, the version of ''Peter Pan'' featured in the special contained revisions to its [[Book (musical theater)|book]] to emphasize the character of Captain Hook, along with additional songs from its revivals, new songs adapted from the musicals ''[[Do Re Mi (musical)|Do Re Mi]]'' and ''[[Say, Darling]]'', and the restoration of a song that had been cut from the musical before its original Broadway premiere.

==Development and production==
In December 2013, NBC presented ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]''—a live adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' that starred [[country music]] performer and singer [[Carrie Underwood]] and was produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]]. After bringing NBC's highest Thursday night ratings for entertainment programming since 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-ratings-nbc/ |title=Ratings: NBC's Sound of Music Live! Does Something Very Good; Glee and Grey's Eye Lows |last=Mitovich|first=Matt Webb |date=December 6, 2013 |work=TVLine |accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref> NBC's entertainment head [[Bob Greenblatt]] announced that the network would present another live musical for the 2014 holiday season, and that it had signed Meron and Zadan on to continue their role as producers. Greenblatt felt that there were enough recognizable, family-friendly musicals to make live musicals an annual tradition, and noted that various theatrical rightsholders had expressed interest in having their musicals adapted for television in this manner.<ref name=nyt-morelive>{{cite web|title=NBC Says It Will Put On a Show, Again| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/arts/television/a-network-is-buoyed-by-sound-of-music-ratings.html?ref=television&_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}</ref> In January 2014, NBC announced that its next musical would be an adaptation of the 1954 musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Frizell |first=Sam |date=January 19, 2014 |title=NBC Announces 'Peter Pan' for Next Live Production |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/19/nbc-announces-peter-pan-for-next-live-production/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014 }}</ref> This would not be the first time that NBC had broadcast a live production of ''Peter Pan'', as a presentation featuring [[Mary Martin]], [[Cyril Ritchard]], and its original Broadway cast was presented by NBC on March 7, 1955, as part of the anthology series ''[[Producers' Showcase]]''. The [[Peter Pan (1954 musical)#Television productions|telecast]], produced by [[Fred Coe]], was one of the highest-rated programs in the early history of television,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/coefred.htm |title=COE, FRED |accessdate=22 December 2008|author=Tino Balio |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications}}</ref><ref name=npr-nbccounting>{{cite web|title=Hate The Idea Of 'Peter Pan Live'?

Produced on a $10 million budget and broadcast live from the [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]], the staff from ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was carried over to ''Peter Pan'', including Zadan and Meron, along with David Chase as music director and [[Derek McLane]] as [[production designer]]. Whilst producing ''The Sound of Music Live!'', Zadan and Meron shared a fondness for creating what Meron described as "moments of theatricality"—a practice that carried over into ''Peter Pan Live!''. Meron emphasized that the production would not be bound to the limitations of a traditional [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] setting, allowing for larger sets, and "dynamic" camera angles and flying sequences. In total, he described the production as a "total balls-out musical."<ref name=variety-peterpanbts>{{cite web|title=NBC Hopes ‘Peter Pan Live’ Can Fly to New Heights|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/features/peter-pan-live-nbc-new-heights-1201364850/|website=Variety|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=ew-cgitinkerbell>{{cite web|title=Tinkerbell will be computer generated in 'Peter Pan Live!'-see video|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/11/26/tinker-bell-will-be-computer-generated-in-peter-pan-live/|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> The production employed a [[computer generated imagery|CGI]] version of [[Tinker Bell]]: rendered live and controlled by a technician, it expressed emotions and thoughts by changing its size and color.<ref name=ew-cgitinkerbell/>

[[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]], star of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'' and daughter of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' anchor [[Brian Williams (news anchor)|Brian Williams]], was cast as Peter Pan, continuing an established tradition of females portraying the title character of the musical.<ref name=npr-nbccounting/><ref name=variety-peterpanbts/> Actor [[Christopher Walken]] was cast as [[Captain Hook]]; Walken showed uncertainty for his role in the production due to its unique format, noting that "when you do a [stage] show, even if it isn’t a hit, you’re in previews for a few weeks and you get comfortable in the role. This is rehearsed as a stage show, but then the cameras are there. I’m never even sure when the camera is on me." In total, the production featured 46 cast members, and a production crew of at least 350 members.<ref name=npr-nbccounting/><ref name=variety-peterpanbts/>

Admitting that ''Peter Pan'' was not as much of a "bona fide classic" as ''The Sound of Music'', Meron's crew was given flexibility in revising the show's contents. [[Irene Mecchi]] — who is best known for her [[screenwriting]] contributions to films such as ''[[The Lion King]]'' - was brought in to "strengthen and deepen" the portrayal of [[Captain Hook]] in the production.<ref name=variety-peterpanbts/> Revisions were also made to its soundtrack, including the addition of new songs with lyrical adaptations by [[Amanda Green]], the daughter of [[Adolph Green]], who, with [[Jule Styne]] and [[Betty Comden]], added some songs for later productions, including "Never Never Land".<ref name="green"/> New songs added to the production included the Captain Hook song "Vengeance", an adaptation of "Ambition" from the Styne-Comden-Green musical ''[[Do Re Mi (musical)|Do Re Mi]]'', "Only Pretend", adapted from "I Know About Love", also from ''Do Re Mi'', and the Peter and Hook duet "A Wonderful World Without Peter", adapted from “Something’s Always Happening On The River” from the Styne-Comden-Green musical ''[[Say, Darling]]''. "When I Went Home", a song sung by Peter that was cut before the musical's 1954 premiere due to a "subdued" reaction in try-outs, was also restored for this production; Meron explained that the song would help viewers to "understand more" about the character of Peter Pan.<ref name="green"/><ref name=variety-peterpanbts/> "Oh My Mysterious Lady", a song written with [[Mary Martin]] in mind, was cut from the show<ref name="green"/><ref name=variety-peterpanbts/> while the song "Ugg-a-Wugg", which contained racially insensitive lyrics, was rewritten into a new song entitled "True Blood Brothers."<ref name="green"/><ref name=variety-peterpanbts/>

As in ''The Sound of Music Live!'', [[Walmart]] served as a major sponsor of the telecast. NBC produced five themed Walmart commercials starring [[Melissa Joan Hart]] and her family, to air throughout the special. The commercials featured allusions to ''Peter Pan'' and presentations of products from the store.<ref name=wsj-warrroom>{{cite news|title=Wal-Mart’s Peter Pan ‘Warr’ Room|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/05/wal-marts-peter-pan-warr-room/|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref name=bandc-walmart>{{cite web|title=Walmart Takes Big Role in 'Peter Pan Live!'|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/walmart-takes-big-role-peter-pan-live/136050|website=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=4 December 2015}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Peter Pan Live!'' aired on the night of December 4, 2014 on NBC and was met with immediate public and critical reactions, both positive and negative. After a mediocre reception to the network's ''The Sound of Music Live!'' from 2013, many viewers were wary of the new production. Lead actress Allison Williams warned viewers in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'': “I will say this about last year: today’s audiences like to watch things cynically. And I’m on a show that’s cynical in tone so I’m no stranger to that … Hate-watching is a thing. It’s a whole way of watching something, and it’s not an audience that’s natural to a non-cynical performance. ''Peter Pan'', you cannot watch cynically. If you do, you’re going to hate it, no question. It falls apart instantly.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/12/03/allison-williams-hate-watch-peter-pan/|title=Allison Williams says you cannot hate-watch 'Peter Pan Live'|first=James|last=Hibberd|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2014-12-03| accessdate=2014-12-05}}</ref> She said almost the opposite to [[NPR]], which reported that NBC expected that "hate-watchers" would help the event to succeed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/04/368308833/hate-the-idea-of-peter-pan-live-nbc-is-counting-on-it|title=Hate The Idea Of 'Peter Pan Live'?

=== Viewership ===
''Peter Pan Live!'' was seen in its original airing by 9.21 million viewers with a ratings share of 2.4/7 among adults 18–49, making it the most-watched program of the night across the major networks—but trailing a ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' game on [[NFL Network]], which brought 9.1 million viewers, but had a larger 18–49 share of 3.2/10. The special also brought NBC its second-highest 18–49 ratings on Thursday night entertainment programming since ''The Sound of Music Live!'' before being surpassed by ''[[The Wiz Live!]]'' a year later. Greenblatt did not expect viewership for ''Peter Pan Live!'' to be as high as that of ''The Sound of Music Live!'', but still felt that NBC had a "great night", and thanked the cast and crew for their involvement in "three months of the hardest work I’ve ever seen."<ref name=variety-peterpanratings>{{cite web|title=‘Peter Pan Live’ Ratings: Not ‘Sound of Music’ Big But Strong for NBC Thursday|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/peter-pan-live-ratings-not-sound-of-music-big-but-strong-for-nbc-thursday-1201371871/|website=Variety|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> [[Nielsen Online|Nielsen]] also estimated that over 475,000 posts were made about the telecast on [[Twitter]], which were seen 106.9 million times—more than double the number of views that tweets during ''The Sound of Music Live!'' received.<ref name=variety-peterpanratings/> The special retained 61% of its viewership, from beginning to end.<ref>Patten, Dominic (December 5, 2014).
