'''Function overview:'''   Apply a special purge to articles with [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion]] templates in the same manner we do so for BLPPROD and a handful of CSDs. 

<!-- Bot tasks require consensus in order to be approved. Please list any relevant discussions here to indicate consensus for the task. If such input is not necessary (for instance, a task that is duplicating or closely matching an existing bot) leave this blank-->

<!-- List full and complete function details here. Please be precise and explicit, describing all changes the bot would make. Bots cannot be approved for open-ended tasks, so ensure the details cover all cases. Consider making several BRFAs for tasks with large independent changes. Vague or incomplete details can delay the BRFA process. Straight-forward details and examples will speed up the approval. If you need to modify these details after a discussion starts, it is recommended that you use del tags – <del></del> – to remove text and ins tags – <ins></ins> – for additions (this preserves coherence of the discussion), or show/hide boxes as you see fit. -->
'''Function details:'''  Currently, task 1 traverses [[:Category:BLP articles proposed for deletion by days left]] and applies a special purge (see the bot user page for more details on this) to each to insure that each category is placed into time-dependent categories correctly.  This handles articles marked with BLPPROD, but not PROD.  

As there's been a request to extend this to articles marked with the PROD tag, the simplest way to do this is to modify task 1 so that it traverses [[:Category:All articles proposed for deletion]] instead.   This category contains both PROD and BLPPROD tagged articles.  Other than that change, and a change to a value in a paranoia check in the software, I expect no other changes.
