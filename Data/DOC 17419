The '''1990 [[ECAC Hockey]] Men's Ice Hockey Tournament''' was the 29th [[ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|tournament]] in league history. It was played between February 27 and March 11, 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=ECAC Tournament|url=http://www.augenblick.org/chha/ecac_trn.html|publisher=College Hockey Historical Archives|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> Preliminary and quarterfinal games were played at home team campus sites, while the 'final four' games were played at the [[Boston Garden]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. By winning the tournament, [[Colgate Red Raiders men's ice hockey|Colgate]] received the [[ECAC Hockey|ECAC]]'s automatic bid to the [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].

The Quarterfinal game between [[Colgate Red Raiders men's ice hockey|Colgate]] and [[Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey|Yale]] scheduled for March 3 was postponed until the following day due to a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] malfunction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Columbia Daily Spectator, Volume CXIV, Number 92, 7 March 1990 — Page 12 |url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19900307-01.1.11&srpos=&dliv=none&st=1&e=------199-en-20--1--txt-IN-swimming----1990|publisher=Columbia Spectator|date=1990-03-07|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref>

==Format==
The tournament featured four rounds of play. The two teams that finish below tenth place in the standings are not eligible for tournament play. In the first round, the seventh and tenth seeds and the eighth and ninth seeds each play a single game to determine the final qualifying teams for the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals the first seed and lower ranked qualifier, the second seed and higher ranked qualifier, the third seed and sixth seed and the fourth seed and fifth seed played a two-game series to determine the winner. In the two games no overtime was permitted and if the two teams remained tied after the two games then a 10-minute mini-game would be played where a sudden-death overtime was allowed if the scheduled time did not produce a victor.<ref>{{cite news|title=College Hockey Notebook; Road to Final a 3-Way Route |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/08/sports/college-hockey-notebook-road-to-final-a-3-way-route.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=1988-03-08|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> After the opening round every series becomes a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] game. In the semifinals, the highest seed plays the lowest remaining seed while the two remaining teams play with the winners advancing to the championship game and the losers advancing to the third place game. The tournament champion receives an automatic bid to the [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].
