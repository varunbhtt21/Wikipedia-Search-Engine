'''Columbia Coliseum''', also known as '''Columbia Gymnasium''', was a [[gym]]nasium on the campus of Columbia University (now the [[University of Portland]]) in [[Portland, Oregon]]. It was designed in 1902 by [[Joseph Jacobberger]] to house sports that were traditionally played outdoors, like [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]]. Constructed the following year it was the largest gymnasium in [[Oregon]], and possibly the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Starting in 1905, Columbia Coliseum became the site of an annual statewide [[track and field]] event hosted by the university. It was last used in 1927 and has since been demolished.

==History==
At {{convert|24500|sqft}}, Columbia Coliseum was the largest sports venue in [[Oregon]] (and possibly the [[Pacific Northwest]]) when it opened in 1903. At the highest point, the ceilings were {{convert|70|ft}}. The gymnasium was constructed with [[truss]]es so no support beams would obstruct the playing area. The building featured natural light from glass [[skylight]]s in the ceiling. Tracks were on the outside of a dirt playing surface, which was big enough for sports traditionally played outdoors like [[baseball]] or [[American football|football]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Track and field sports booming|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=7 April 1907|location=Portland, Oregon|page=37}}</ref> Although [[indoor baseball]] (now known as softball) was becoming popularized at the turn of the 20th century, Columbia University organized a traditional baseball team to play indoors, a rarity at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Play baseball indoors|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=22 February 1903|location=Portland, Oregon|page=32}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dual Track Meet At Columbia Gymnasium|work=The Oregon Daily Journal|date=February 19, 1905|location=Portland, Oregon|page=8}}</ref> 

[[Joseph Jacobberger]] was the building's architect.<ref name=build>{{cite news|title=Fine building being erected on Catholic campus|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=1 July 1902|location=Portland, Oregon|page=5}}</ref> In 1927, Columbia University again commissioned Joseph Jacobberger (now partnered with Alfred Smith) to design a new gymnasium for the school which became [[Howard Hall (Portland, Oregon)|Howard Hall]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Design for New Columbia $75,000 gymnasium|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=5 June 1927|location=Portland, Oregon|page=71}}</ref>

In 1907 the Columbia University [[basketball]] team joined the [[Portland Interscholastic League]]. The first few seasons all the league's teams had to play in the Columbia Coliseum since most venues could not accommodate the relatively new sport of basketball.<ref>{{cite news|title=Form basketball league; Five Portland schools lay plans for season|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=1 November 1907|location=Portland, Oregon|page=7}}</ref> No wood floor was installed for basketball games, meaning the teams would have to play on dirt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hoopers play tomorrow|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=10 January 1924|location=Portland, Oregon|page=12}}</ref>

The Commercial Club, a group of Portland businessmen, donated $10,000 towards upgrading Columbia Coliseum in 1910.<ref>{{cite news|title=Columbia to get addition|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=17 May 1910|location=Portland, Oregon|page=8}}</ref> The coliseum was closed temporarily in 1916 due to significant damage to the structure after snow had built-up on the ceiling, causing part of it to cave in.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coliseum ruined; track meet off|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=13 February 1916|location=Portland, Oregon|page=7}}</ref> The roof was repaired and the gymnasium re-opened the following year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Athletes at Columbia University indoor meet next Saturday will compete in remodeled coliseum|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=9 April 1917|location=Portland, Oregon|page=11}}</ref>
