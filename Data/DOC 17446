Title : Tentacle (botany)
Text : [[Image:Drosera capensis bend.JPG|thumb|upright|Leaf and tentacle movement on [[Drosera capensis|Cape sundew]]]]
In [[botany]], '''tentacles''' are glandular hairs on the leaves of some species of [[carnivorous plant|insectivorous plants]] such as ''[[Drosera]]'' (sundews). Tentacles are different from organs such as the [[tendril]]s of climbing plants.

In [[carnivorous plant]]s such as [[Drosera|sundews]], the tentacles are the stalked glands of the upper surface of the [[leaf|leaves]]. They are hairlike projections with a drop of sticky [[mucilage]] which attract insects. Unlike a usual plant hair which is of epidermal origin, the '''tentacle''' is highly complex and includes all the tissue types present in the leaf. It consists of a tall, tapering stalk of multi-cellular structure, topped with two layers of glandular cells. They are highly touch-sensitive. When an insect or small animal is captured, the tentacles bend inward and the leaf rolls together as shown in the picture. The glandular cells then secrete [[enzyme]]s to dissolve and digest the insect.<ref>{{cite web| author= Honda M | title= Carnivorous Plants / Insectivorous Plants in the Wilderness: Sundews |url= http://www.honda-e.com/IPW_3_Description/TX-3Sundews.htm|date= |work= Carnivorous Plants Web Site |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Poppinga S, Hartmeyer SR, Seidel R, Masselter T, Hartmeyer I, Speck T |title= Catapulting Tentacles in a Sticky Carnivorous Plant |year = 2013 |url= | journal= PLoS ONE | volume= 7 | issue= 9 |page = e45735 |pmid=23049849 |pmc= 3458893|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0045735}}</ref>
