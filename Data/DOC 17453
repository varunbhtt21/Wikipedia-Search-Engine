'''Lucknow Junction ''' (officially '''Lucknow NER''', station code: '''LJN''') is one of the two main railway stations of [[Lucknow]] city for [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] trains. It is situated right next to [[Lucknow Charbagh Railway Station]].

==Background==
Colloquially, it is known as "Chhoti Line", historically it harboured NE Railways' Meter Gauge trains of erstwhile Izzatnagar Division, now falls under Lucknow Division of NE Railway. It has recently taken over [[Rajya Rani Express]] and the prestigious train of Lucknow NR [[Lucknow Swarna Shatabdi Express]].

==Location==
The adjacent and almost contiguous railway station to [[Lucknow Charbagh railway station]] officially known as Lucknow Junction or Lucknow Jn NER (station code LJN), is unofficially considered a part of Charbagh railway stations. It is situated at Charbagh in the south of the city, hence the popular name. The words 'Char Bagh' refer to the four gardens which existed here earlier.<ref>[http://lucknow.nic.in/hplaces.htm Historical Places in Lucknow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703051908/http://lucknow.nic.in/hplaces.htm |date=3 July 2006 }}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
Lucknow JN or LJN station has six platforms. The platform no.6 is accessible to the two wheelers, auto rikshaws and cars through an underpass cabway. This cabway is third cabway of Indian Railway after Howrah and Gorakhpur railway stations.

==Development==
Earlier Lucknow junction was the terminus for [[metre gauge]] trains as almost all tracks of [[North Eastern Railway zone]] were metre gauge.  With the conversion of most of these tracks to 1676&nbsp;mm [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]], the Lucknow junction does not have any metre gauge tracks.Now all tracks in Lucknow are broad gauge and there is no metre gauge train connection in the city.
