* '''Support ALT as nominator''' – [[User:Godot13|Godot13]] ([[User talk:Godot13|talk]]) 05:52, 30 April 2014 (UTC) 
* '''Oppose''' Where's the rest of the building? --[[User:Janke|Janke]] | [[User talk:Janke|Talk]] 08:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:* As part of an Oxford college quad the library faces inwards on one side of the square, meaning this is a picture of the entire library facade.

::* The title has been amended to reflect the image is of the facade.-[[User:Godot13|Godot13]] ([[User talk:Godot13|talk]]) 14:45, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::* Still, it is chopped off, visually not pleasing, IMO. --[[User:Janke|Janke]] | [[User talk:Janke|Talk]] 12:22, 30 April 2014(UTC)
::::* '''Comment'''  Quite a lot of gras. There is no motion in the picture. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 19:06, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Oppose''' Nice picture, but to get the sense that it's part of a quad, you would have to step back a bit to show that the walls come in on either side, right now it's ambiguous, so missing some critical encyclopedic value.

* '''Comment''' I would like to see this picture cropped. I think the ends of the picture is what it makes it - ambiguous. It ends in something that starts, if you understand what I mean. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 19:23, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
[[File:UK-2014-Oxford-All Souls College 02 (alt-crop).jpg|thumb|right|100000x260px|'''Alternate''' – cropped]]
*'''Comment''' - Alternate image added.--[[User:Godot13|Godot13]] ([[User talk:Godot13|talk]]) 19:40, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Well, that was fast. let me think. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 19:43, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Ok, '''Support ALT'''. The image is good, clear and depicts an iconic building. I think it may have a place among Featured pictures, after this change. This image has the crisp quality people want about the other pictures.   [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 19:46, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Suppor ALT''' - The crop really brings out the facade's personality.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 14:55, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose both''' - I'd want to see more, not less, of the building. [[User:Sven Manguard|<font color="207004">'''<big>S</big>ven&nbsp;<big>M</big>anguard'''</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Sven Manguard|<small><font color="F0A804">'''Wha?'''</font></small>]] 01:34, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose Alt 1.''' & '''Weak support original'''-- The picture must show the subject. You are placing a cropped version with almost 60% of library missing. IMO, original is far better than the Alt.1. But both have the quality and EV perfect.<font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0em 0em 0.8em,#FF4500 -0.8em -0.8em 0.9em,#90EE90 0.7em 0.7em 0.8em;color:#696969"><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;color:black"><big>[[User:The Herald|The herald]]</big></span></font> 13:27, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support Alt.''' — Sometimes less is more. [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 00:31, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
