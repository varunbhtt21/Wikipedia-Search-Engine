The result was    '''keep'''.

Non-notable grammar school. We don't generally have articles for such schools, unless they are especially notable. Tagged for five years for lack of refs. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 05:54, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Keep''' - You were told in the previous AFD high schools are kept So was utterly pointless renominating.......

:*It's name denotes it as a grammar school. We don't -- anymore -- generally keep stand-alone articles for grammar schools, absent extraordinary circumstances. And even in the last AfD -- it was not closed a keep as you suggest, but a "no consensus. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 17:43, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::*"Grammar school" means different things in different countries. In the British tradition, it generally means secondary school. [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 01:22, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. As I noted in the previous discussion, this is a K–10 school. The debate closed with no consensus as editors disagreed whether this qualifies as a high school. [[User:Gene93k|• Gene93k]] ([[User talk:Gene93k|talk]]) 01:18, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Grade 10 is the leaving grade in Pakistan (only some students go on to Grade 12) so it should be regarded as a high school. We keep high schools because experience shows that, with enough research, sources can almost invariably be found that meet [[WP:ORG]]. Google is a poor tool for finding sources on schools in the Indian sub-continent. Very few have much of an Internet presence. We need to avoid systemic bias and encourage local hard-copy and local language sources to be investigated.

:Thanks -- this is interesting ... but is there RS support for it? I guess it would be RS support that would related to your view that while in the US 12th grade is what we deem relevant, that 10th grade is the equivalent here, and that a self-described grammar school here is equal to a high school in the West. Or, is it that this is an OR argument? Also, I don't think a redirect or delete here would go against your goal of encouraging hard copy and local language sources to be investigated -- just the opposite, it would tend to encourage it.  I expect. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 05:21, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. In countries using the British system, a grammar school is a secondary school, and secondary schools are kept by long-standing consensus and precedent. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 20:30, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
