The '''Mykilska Slobidka''' ({{lang-uk|Микільська слобідка}}; {{lang-ru|Никольская слободка}}) was a former [[sloboda]] (settlement) located on the left-bank outskirts of [[Kiev]], the capital of [[Ukraine]]. Today, the settlement is now part of the [[Livoberezhnyi neighborhood, Kiev|Livoberezhnyi neighborhood]] of the [[Dnipro Raion, Kiev|Dnipro Raion]] ([[Raions of Ukraine|district]]) of Kiev.

==History==
In the 18th century, the remains of the Mesolithic [[Dnieper–Donets culture]] were found on the territory of the Mykilska Slobidka.<ref name=donas>{{cite web|title=Brovarska Darnytsia|url=http://donas.in.ua/vsyake/brovarska-darnytsya.html|work=Do nas, do Brovarschyny|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Ukrainian}}</ref> In 1508, the territory belonged to the Pustyno-Mykilskyi Monastery, from which the settlement received its name.<ref name=ph>{{cite web|title=History of the neighborhood around the Levoberezhnaya metro station|url=http://kievphotosite.com/node/4#|work=kievphotosite.com|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Russian}}</ref><ref name=info>{{cite web|title=KYIV TODAY.

In the 18th century, the settlement was inhabited by the [[Kiev Arsenal]] workers.<ref name=info/> From 1802 to 1902, the settlement was part of the [[Brovary]] [[Volost]]. In 1858, the settlement consisted of 76 residences, 350 residents, and the St. Nicholas Church.<ref name=donas/> Famed Russian poets [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Nikolay Gumilev]] were married in this church in 1910.<ref name=ph/> The settlement had a small lake named Sviatysche located to its north, and a small settlement exclave named Buhry to the lake's north.<ref name=donas/>

From 1903 to 1923, the settlement was the administrative center of the Mykilsko-Slobidska Volost, in the [[Oster]] [[Powiat|Povit]] of the [[Chernigov Governorate|Chernihiv Governorate]].<ref name=rus>{{cite web|title=A little history of the development of tram connections across the Rusanivka bridge|url=http://rusanivka.org.ua/?page_id=224|work=Community organization "Committee of Rusanivka neighborhood"|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Ukrainian}}</ref> In the early 1910s, the settlement was home to the [[Trams in Kiev|city's tram]] depot,<ref name=rus/> located in between three tram routes which ran through the settlement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mashke|first=S|title=Schemes and lists: 1936|url=http://www.mashke.org/kievtram/history/schemes/1936-routes/|work=In Memory of Kiev trams|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Russian}}</ref> It is particularly notable since the city's two banks were then administratively part of other governorates ([[Kiev Governorate|Kiev]] and Chernihiv, respectively).<ref name=rus/>

When Kiev's city limits were expanded to the [[Left-bank Ukraine|left-bank]] in 1923, the settlement became a part of the city.<ref name=info/> In the 1930s, [[Soviet Union|Soviet authorities]] closed the functioning church and monastery down, and repressed the local [[archimandrite]]. In 1935, the monastery and bellower were demolished, and a new park and street were built in its place.<ref>{{cite web|last=Halaiba|first=Vasyl|title=St. Nicholas Church in Kyiv|url=http://www.cerkva.kiev.ua/biblioteka/Hrami-Mikolaya-v-KievI-Vasil-Galayba-/333.html|work=www.cerkva.kiev.ua|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Ukrainian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003157/http://www.cerkva.kiev.ua/biblioteka/Hrami-Mikolaya-v-KievI-Vasil-Galayba-/333.html|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=}}</ref> During the 1960s to 1970s, the territory of the Mykilska Slobidka was demolished to make way for the Livoberezhnyi neighborhood;<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Reference|url=http://dnipr.kievcity.gov.ua/content/mennyu-1.html|work=Dnipro Raion of Kiev City State Administration|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Ukrainian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mykilska slobidka|url=http://www.oldkyiv.org.ua/data/slobidka.php?lang=ua|work=Site of the History of Kyiv|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Ukrainian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309004512/http://www.oldkyiv.org.ua/data/slobidka.php?lang=ua|archivedate=9 March 2014|df=}}</ref> nothing remains of the original settlement except for one pre-[[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] building.<ref>{{cite web|title=Levoberezhnyi / Nikolskaya slobodka|url=http://artemco.livejournal.com/62978.html|work=artemco.livejournal.com|publisher=[[LiveJournal]]|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Russian}}</ref>
