'''[[Albert Ball]]''' (1896–1917) was a British [[fighter pilot]] during the First World War. At the time of his death he was, with 44 victories, the United Kingdom's leading [[flying ace]]. Raised in [[Nottingham]], Ball was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in October 1914. He transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) the following year, and gained his pilot's [[Aircrew brevet|wings]] in January 1916. He then joined [[No. 13 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;13 Squadron RFC]] in France, flying reconnaissance missions before being posted in May to [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;11 Squadron]], a fighter unit. From then until his return to England on leave in October, he accrued many aerial victories, earning two [[Distinguished Service Order]]s and the [[Military Cross]]. He was the first British ace to become a popular hero. After a period on home establishment, Ball was posted to [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|No. 56&nbsp;Squadron]], which was sent to the Western Front in April 1917. He crashed to his death in a field in France on 7 May, sparking a wave of national mourning and posthumous recognition, which included the award of the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions during his final tour of duty.  His most renowned enemy, [[Manfred von Richthofen]], remarked upon hearing of Ball's death that he was "by far the best English flying man". {{TFAFULL|Albert Ball}}
