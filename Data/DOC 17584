|Date = 2010-09-19
|Author = The copyright holder of the Miracle Piano Teaching System software, most likely the software publisher or developer(s).
|Article = Miracle Piano Teaching System
|Purpose = This screenshot provides users with illustrative and informative details regarding typical usage of a notable portion of the Miracle Piano Teaching System software (specifically, game activities that combine video gaming-type gameplay and practicing of musical skills) along with details regarding elements of the graphical portion of the software and also assistance in interpreting critical commentary about the software. Among other things, the screenshot shows visual elements, overall style, and typical gameplay from a notable portion of the software (the "Robo Man" game, one of several game activities in the software) which is mentioned in the article and also by third parties. (For example, see pg. 300 of [//books.google.com/books?id=MpOxoAiQXXQC "Awesome Super Nintendo Secrets 2"] (Zach Meston, Semantix Design LLC, 1993) and [//books.google.com/books?id=F01wiUr9LKQC&lpg=PT382&dq=&pg=PT382#v=onepage&q&f=false "Classic Home Video Games, 1985-1988: A Complete Reference Guide"] (Brett Weiss, McFarland, 2009.)) In addition, the graphical interface is the main point of usage of the Miracle Piano Teaching System software and therefore it affects how the software is used and experienced by the user.
|Replaceability = No freely licensed versions of the Miracle Piano Teaching System software are known to exist. A screenshot from a freely licensed software title of a similar nature (assuming such a software title existed) would not be faithful and accurate when providing illustrative and informative details and augmenting critical commentary in the case of the specific Miracle Piano Teaching System software.
|Minimality = This screenshot is of lower resolution than the original (about 78% of the original 256 x 244 screenshot) and comprises a very small part of the Miracle Piano Teaching System software. In addition, the screenshot is used only in this article which is specifically about the software from which the screenshot was taken and the article contains only one screenshot from the software.
|Commercial = The screenshot is being used in this article to provide illustrative and informative details in conjunction with encyclopedic information and to assist users in interpreting critical commentary about the software. These uses are different from the original market uses of marketing software and facilitating usage of the software. In addition, a single low resolution screenshot should not replace the market for higher resolution screenshots or for the Miracle Piano Teaching System software itself. It should not be possible to generate illegitimate copies of the software from this single screenshot.
