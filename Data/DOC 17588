The name is that of the [[Tsimshian]] peoples, and was conferred in 1927 by the Geographic Names Board of Canada, who noted the variety of spellings then in use i.e. "Tsimshean, Timshian, Chimsain, Tsimpsian, Tsimp-Sheean, Chimsyan" before settling on this one.<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/35330.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Tsimpsean Peninsula"]</ref>
