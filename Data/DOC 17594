'''Seo Young-woo''' ({{lang-ko|서영우}}, born 27 October 1991) is a South Korean [[Bobsleigh|bobsledder]] who competes as the brakeman for the two-man bobsled piloted by [[Won Yun-jong]] as well as a push crewman for the four-man bobsled also piloted by Won Yun-jong.<ref name="fibtprofile">{{cite web |url=http://www.fibt.com/bobsleigh/athletes.html?athl_id=129900 |title=Seo Young-woo |publisher=[[International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103000000/http://www.fibt.com/bobsleigh/athletes.html?athl_id=129900 |archivedate=2014-01-03}}</ref>

==Career==
Seo previously competed in track & field as a high school athlete. As a freshman at Sungkyul University, he was selected for the South Korean national bobsleigh team in early 2010 and made his first international appearance at the North American Cup in [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] in November 2010.

Seo competed at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] for South Korea. He teamed with pilot [[Won Yun-jong]] in the South Korea-1 sled in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Two-man|two-man]] event, finishing 18th, and with Won, [[Jun Jung-lin]] and [[Suk Young-jin]] in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Four-man|four-man]], finishing 20th.<ref name="sportsrefprofile">{{cite Sports-Reference |title=Seo Young-Woo |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/se/seo-young-woo-1.html}}</ref><ref name="sochi2014profile">{{cite web |title=Youngwoo SEO |publisher=[[Sochi 2014]] |url=http://www.sochi2014.com/en/athlete-youngwoo-seo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319223518/http://www.sochi2014.com/en/athlete-youngwoo-seo |archivedate=2014-03-19}}</ref>

His best showing at the [[IBSF World Championships (bobsleigh and skeleton)|IBSF World Championships]] is fifth, in the two-man event in [[FIBT World Championships 2015|2015]].

Seo made his [[Bobsleigh World Cup|World Cup]] debut in December 2010, as a brakeman for mediocre driver [[Kang Kwang-bae]]. After a couple of rocky seasons with different pilots, Seo temporarily quit bobsleigh to focus on studying in college. Seo teamed up with promising pilot Won Yun-jong in 2013 when Seo returned to the national team, and his team outperformed expectations. Following a respectable 11th-place finish in [[2014–15 Bobsleigh World Cup|2014–15 World Cup]] season series, Seo & Won became the overall champion in the [[2015–16 Bobsleigh World Cup|2015–2016 World Cup]] season, clinching five medals including two gold medals at [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] and [[Konigssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Konigssee]].

Their performances gradually  deteriorated in the 2016–17 season when the duo began to use the domestic sled that was manufactured by the [[Hyundai Motor Company]], South Korea's largest automaker. Seo and Won never stood on a podium in any race during the World Cup series and dipped to an IBSF ranking of 46th. Prior to the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the duo eventually decided to use Larvia's BTC sled again that they became the World Cup overall champion with.

Seo along with pilot Won placed sixth out of 30 teams in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Two-man|two-man]] event at the 2018 Winter Olympics in [[Pyeongchang]] on February 19, recording an overall time of 3:17.40 in four runs. Although they failed to win a medal, it was the best Olympic result by an Asian bobsleigh team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aId=3040561&gCat=010|script-title=Two-Man Bobsleigh Team Achieves Korea's Best Olympic Result|date=February 20, 2018|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|first=Hyung-jun|last=Yoon}}</ref> The following week, on February 25, the South Korean four-man team of Seo, Won, [[Kim Dong-hyun (bobsledder)|Kim Dong-hyun]] and [[Jun Jung-lin]] won a surprising silver medal in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Four-man|four-man]] event, tying with a German team led by [[Nico Walther]]. With the silver medal, South Korea became the first Asian nation to claim an Olympic medal in a bobsleigh event.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Sp_detail.htm?No=134228|script-title=Silver Win for S.
