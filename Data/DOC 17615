==Premise==
The show follows British newscaster Walter Blunt who moves to Los Angeles with the intention of conquering American nightly cable news. His misguided decisions on and off the air prove that his ultimate ambitions will be difficult to achieve.

Blunt's name was taken from the minor character Sir Walter Blunt in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', which was Stewart's first role with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].<ref>{{cite video|title=Squawk Box|date=August 21, 2015|publisher=CNBC}}</ref>

==Reception==

===Critical response===

''Blunt Talk'' received generally mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the first season of the show a rating of 53%, based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's consensus states, "''Blunt Talk'' squanders Sir Patrick Stewart's considerable gifts on a show that too often mistakes forced vulgarity for wit."<ref name="rt">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/blunt-talk/s01/|title=Blunt Talk: Season 1|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives the show a score of 54 out of 100, based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref name="mc">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/blunt-talk|title=Blunt Talk: Season 1|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] ([[CBS Corporation]])|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref>

Dominic Patten of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' states in his review, "If the new series from creator Jonathan Ames and executive producer Seth MacFarlane was just a mix between another Network-inspired show about journalism and some very consistently bad behavior on the part of Patrick Stewart’s cable news host Walter Blunt, it would be hard to recommend giving such a collection of clichés much of your time. However, ''Blunt Talk'', which debuts August 22 on Starz, is more than that and worth going along for the ride."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/blunt-talk-review-patrick-stewarts-starz-comedy-1201501816/|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=August 22, 2015|first=Dominic|last=Patten|date=August 19, 2015|title=‘Blunt Talk’ Review: Patrick Stewart’s Starz Comedy Nails Pitfalls Of Celebrity}}</ref>

TV Columnist Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' states in his review, "The premiere starts with a rambunctious energy that temporarily promotes a sense of good will. Stewart’s Walter Blunt goes on a bender, sings rap and picks up a transgender prostitute. When the hooker politely asks if he’s troubled at all by who she is, he replies cheerfully, “No, I’m English.” The adventure ends fantastically badly, at least for Blunt’s reputation. But from there, the series—which Ames produced with the seemingly ubiquitous Seth MacFarlane — pretty rapidly disintegrates, relying too heavily on Stewart’s madcap antics and an assortment of not particularly distinctive supporting players, including Walter’s sycophantic producers, Richard Lewis as his therapist and Romany Malco as the harried network boss."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/reviews/blunt-talk-patrick-stewart-comedy-review-starz-1201569988/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=August 22, 2015|date=August 19, 2015|first=Brian|last=Lowry|title=TV Review: ‘Blunt Talk’}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Brian Moylan states in his review, "''Blunt Talk'' is an odd bird. It’s sort of like if The Newsroom and Veep had a love child and it was raised by Nanny McPhee in the Royal Shakespeare Company. It takes a close look at cable news and the personalities and celebrity involved, but it’s essentially about one man who is trying to change himself and do the right thing, but is incredibly bad at it. A crew as colorfully inept as Selina Meyer’s also surrounds him, but they don’t have the stinging bile of Veep’s crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/21/blunt-talk-patrick-stewart-review|title=Blunt Talk: Patrick Stewart's new show is duller than it should be|accessdate=August 22, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Brian|last=Moylan|date=August 21, 2015}}</ref>

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' states in his review, "It’s not accurate to say that Patrick Stewart hasn’t done comedy. He was funny playing himself as a poker-faced pervert in an episode of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', or dancing with [[Kelsey Grammer]] and telling him how sexy he looked in a tux on ''[[Frasier]]''. And he’s lent his plummy voice to a raft of animated shows from ''[[Family Guy]]'' to ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. But it’s fair to say that ''Blunt Talk'', a new sitcom beginning on Saturday night on Starz, offers Patrick Stewart as we haven’t seen him before. Shuffling around an airport men’s room stall with his pants around his ankles, for instance, losing his patience as he tries unsuccessfully to cover the toilet seat, or gravely asking a transgender prostitute whether he can feed at her breasts."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/arts/television/review-on-blunt-talk-patrick-stewart-is-far-from-home-and-caught-with-his-pants-down.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 22, 2015|title=Review: On ‘Blunt Talk,’ Patrick Stewart Is Far From Home and Caught With His Pants Down|date=August 21, 2015|first=Mike|last=Hale|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>
