'''Jun Jung-lin''' (born 27 January 1989) is a South Korean [[Bobsleigh|bobsledder]] who competes as the brakeman for the two-man bobsled piloted by [[Kim Dong-hyun (bobsledder)|Kim Dong-hyun]] as well as a push crewman for the four-man bobsled piloted by [[Won Yun-jong]].<ref name="fibtprofile">[http://www.fibt.com/bobsleigh/athletes.html?athl_id=129895 FIBT Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226004648/http://www.fibt.com/bobsleigh/athletes.html?athl_id=129895 |date=2014-02-26 }}</ref>

==Career==
Jun became interested in bobsleigh as a junior at [[Yonsei University]] in 2011 when fellow Yonsei alumnus and bobsled pilot [[Kim Dong-hyun (bobsledder)|Kim Dong-hyun]] suggested he give it a try.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pyeongchang2018.com/en/game-time/results/OWG2018/en/bobsleigh/athlete-profile-n3040476-jun-junglin.htm |title=Athlete Profile|publisher=pyeongchang2018.com |accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref> In May 2012 Jun participated in a South Korean national bobsleigh team try-out and was selected for the national team.

After a five-month training, Jun made his [[Bobsleigh World Cup|World Cup]] debut at [[Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run|Lake Placid]] in November 2012. Jun, along with pilot [[Won Yun-jong]], finished 21st out of 27 teams in the two-man event and 22nd out of 24 teams in the four-man event, as the brakeman.

In 2013, Jun was demoted to the South Korea-2 bobsled with former track and field athlete [[Seo Young-woo]] returning to the national team to join the 1 sled as the brakeman. Jun teamed up with South Korea's second-string pilot [[Kim Dong-hyun (bobsledder)|Kim Dong-hyun]], and won his first international gold medal at the 2013 North American Cup, finishing 0.12 seconds ahead of the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] duo of [[Patrice Servelle]] and [[Sébastien Gattuso]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/31251 |title=2013 North American Cup / 2-man bobsleigh |publisher=[[International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation]] |accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref> Although Jun along with Kim earned a spot on the [[2013–14 Bobsleigh World Cup|2013–14 World Cup]] tour, the duo failed to make an impact like they did in the previous second-tier competitions, finishing 32nd in the overall standings.

Jun competed at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] for South Korea. He teamed with pilot Kim in the South Korea-2 sled in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Two-man|two-man]] event, finishing 25th, and with pilot Won Yun-jong, Seo Young-woo and [[Suk Young-jin]] in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Four-man|four-man]], finishing 20th.<ref>{{cite web |title=Profile|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/je/jeon-jeong-rin-1.html|publisher=sports-reference.com |accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name="sochi2014profile">{{cite web|title=Sochi2014.com profile |date=March 19, 2014 |url=http://www.sochi2014.com/en/athlete-junglin-jun |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319071353/http://www.sochi2014.com/en/athlete-junglin-jun |archivedate=March 19, 2014 }}</ref>

Jun & Kim flourished after the 2014 Winter Olympics under the leadership of British coach Malcolm "Gomer" Lloyd who vastly improved the South Korean bobsleigh team by implementing customized training methods.<ref name="malcolm lloyd"/> Following a respectable 16th-place finish in [[2015–16 Bobsleigh World Cup|2015–16 World Cup]] season series, Jun & Kim had back-to-back top-10 finishes on the first two events at [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] and [[Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run|Lake Placid]] in the [[2016–17 Bobsleigh World Cup|2016–17 World Cup]] season. But if anything, their performances gradually deteriorated in the second half of the 2016–17 season when the duo began to use the domestic sled that was manufactured by the [[Hyundai Motor Company]], South Korea's largest automaker.<ref name="btc"/> Following coach Lloyd's sudden death from cancer in 2016,<ref>{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Robin |date=January 5, 2016 |title=Welsh bobsleigh Olympic competitor dies aged 68 |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/welsh-bobsleigh-olympic-competitor-dies-10687050 |work=[[Media Wales]] |accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref> South Korean national team hired numerous bobsled experts. However, they failed to fill the leadership void left by Lloyd,<ref>{{cite news |last=Yoon |first=Hyeong-jun |date=February 28, 2017 |title=[스포츠 인사이드] 썰매 1위를 추락시킨 건 팀 내분이었다 |trans-title=[Sports Inside] Internal discord leads to no. 1 sled team's fall|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/02/28/2017022800067.html |language=Korean |work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |location=Seoul |access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref> and Jun & Kim struggled to bounce back from the slump throughout the remainder of the season.

Jun & Kim opted to miss the two-man competitions at the [[2017–18 Bobsleigh World Cup|2017–18 World Cup]] season in order to focus on the four-man event at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]]. At the Olympics in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]] on 25 February 2018, the South Korean four-man team of Jun, Kim, Seo Young-woo and pilot Won Yun-jong won a surprising silver medal in the [[Bobsleigh at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Four-man|four-man]] event, tying with a German team led by [[Nico Walther]]. With the silver medal, South Korea became the first Asian nation to claim an Olympic medal in a bobsleigh event.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_Sp_detail.htm?No=134228|script-title=Silver Win for S.
