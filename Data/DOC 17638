Title : Plate column
Text : A '''plate column''' (or '''tray column'''<ref name=theo>{{harv|Theodore|2011|pp=196–199}}</ref>) is a [[chemical equipment]] used to carry out [[unit operation]]s where it is necessary to [[mass transfer|transfer mass]] between a liquid phase and a gas phase. In other words, it is a particular [[gas-liquid contactor]].<ref name=ghos>{{harv|Ghosal|2011|pp=253–257}}</ref> The peculiarity of this gas-liquid contactor is that the gas comes in contact with liquid through different stages;<ref name=theo/> each stage is delimited by two plates (except the stage at the top of the column and the stage at the bottom of the column).

Some common applications of plate columns are [[distillation]], [[gas-liquid absorption]] and [[liquid-liquid extraction]]. In general, plate columns are suitable for both continuous and batch operations.

The feed to the column can be liquid, gas or gas and liquid at [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. Inside the column there are instead always two phases: one gas phase and one liquid phase. The liquid phase flows downward through the column via gravity,<ref name=theo/> while the gas phase flows upward. These two phases come in contact in correspondence of holes, valves or bubble caps that fill the area of the plates.<ref name=ghos/> Gas moves to the higher plate through these devices, while the liquid move to the lower plate through a downcomer.<ref name=theo/>

The liquid is collected to the bottom of the column and it undergoes [[evaporation]] through a [[reboiler]], while the gas is collected to the top and it undergoes [[condensation]] through a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. The liquid and gas produced at the top and at the bottom are in general recirculated.

In the simplest case, there are just one feed stream and two product streams. In the case of [[fractionating column]] there are instead many product streams.
