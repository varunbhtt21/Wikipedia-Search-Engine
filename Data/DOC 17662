Carter and Knight's respective bands, the [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[New Kids on the Block]], have previously collaborated on an album entitled ''[[NKOTBSB (album)|NKOTBSB]]'', and also went out on a joint tour between 2011 and 2012 as [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[NKOTBSB]].

==Background==
In 2011 and 2012 Nick Carter and Jordan Knight performed with their respective bands, [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[New Kids on the Block]] as part of the [[NKOTBSB Tour]]. During the tour the idea of a collaboration between the two artists came up. Carter said how they explored the idea and eventually it turned into an entire album. According to Knight being part of a group "puts a lot of pressure on the creative process", while the collaboration gave them "a little more freedom to just explore and do something different than what would be expected."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/nick-carter-jordan-knight-team-album-tour-25386003 Entertainment News, Celebrity and Pop Culture - ABC News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Reception==
Jennifer Gerson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said of the album; "Boybands just won't die. [[Backstreet Boys]] heartthrob Nick Carter and former [[New Kids on the Block]] sensation Jordan Knight have joined forces to create cross-generational behemoth Nick & Knight. With their eponymous album released on Monday and their national tour starting later this month, the two insist not only on their own notable individual influences on music, but also on the importance of the sound they helped create. Nick & Knight showcase amazing, refreshing, fun take on a certain kind of masculinity, and thus the whole boyband genre: though pretty and well-choreographed, the duo are respectful and receptive in their attempt to accent each other's importance, and Most assuredly their sex appeal still palpable.  Nick & Knight, singing together was so surprising refreshing creating a exuberant pulsing atmosphere that could still be felt in the air long after the shows end.  In an interview with ''[[Good Morning America]]'', the duo describe their sound as 'pop, rock, R&B, urban ... all mixed together to create Nick & Knight.' Carter and Knight have also promised to cover [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Lenny Kravitz]] songs in their live shows, essentially promising a fabulous journey through nostalgia that's always worth revisiting and living in, if only for a moment.
