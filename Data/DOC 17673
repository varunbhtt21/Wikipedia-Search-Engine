Fails [[WP:NF]]:  Lacks reliable sources. No reviews by nationally known critics. Etc. [[User:Brycehughes|Brycehughes]] ([[User talk:Brycehughes|talk]]) 08:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': From what I can see, only two of the movies appear to have been made. I'm trying to clean it as we speak, although I admit that I'm a little worried about a lack of notability.

:*I'm really frustrated by this as a whole. Rotten Tomatoes has two reviews listed for the first, which definitely helps push towards notability. I did find a mini review in the SF Gate by Laura Shumaker, who is considered to be a fairly RS on the subject of autism. I know we've used her as a source in various autism related articles before. I'm not familiar with people associated with autism, but I do know her name so that kind of says something for her. (Which brings it up to 3 reviews.) Now I also found a mention of the second film in a small community newspaper. I'm kind of leery about that one, but it was written by a staff member and it is a fairly lengthy mention. I'm going to hold off in the hopes that Schmidt or other editors can work their magic. It's kind of a neutral/weak keep somewhat on my end at the moment.

*'''Keep'''-I think this seems good enough. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:40, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. A serious and sober effort has been made to find evidence of notability, and even given the ridiculously low bar to jump over, this topic really doesn't clear it properly. It made a splash, once (ok, not a splash, more a quiet plop), then vanished. Sorry, but well done for trying.
