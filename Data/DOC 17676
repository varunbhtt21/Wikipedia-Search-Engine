The '''Five Crowns''', also known as the '''Five Heavenly Crowns''', is a concept in [[Christian theology]] that pertains to various [[Bible|biblical]] references to the righteous's eventual reception of a crown after the [[Last Judgment]].<ref name="Thiessen1979">{{cite book|last=Thiessen|first=Henry Clarence|title=Lectures in Systematic Theology|year=1979|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=9780802835291|page=389|quote=As we have seen, when the Lord returns, he will judge believers for their works (Rom. 14:10; 1 Cor. 3:11-15; 4:5; 2 Co. 5:10). Everyone will be asked to give an account of the use he has made of the talents (Matt. 25:14-30), the pounds or minas (Luke 19:11-27), and the opportunities (Matt. 20:1-16) that have been entrusted to him. The day will declare whether a man has built of wood, hay, and straw or of gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). If of the former, his works will be burnt up, and yet he will be saved so as through fire (v. 15); if of the latter, he will receive a reward (v. 14). Scripture lists several crowns or trophies: the incorruptible or imperishable crown (1 Cor. 9:25), the crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8), the crown of life (James 1:12; Rev. 2:10), the crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:4), and the crown of rejoicing or exultation (1 Thess. 2:19; cf. Phil. 4:1).}}<!--|accessdate=30 April 2014--></ref> Proponents of this concept interpret these passages as specifying five separate crowns, these being the Crown of Life; the Incorruptible Crown; the Crown of Righteousness; the Crown of Glory; and the Crown of Exultation.<ref name="Thiessen1979"/> In the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] language, ''stephanos'' ([[wiktionary:στέφανος|στέφανος]]) is the word for ''crown'' and is translated as such in the Bible, especially in versions descending from the [[King James Version]].<ref name="HastingsSelbie1909">{{cite book|last1=Hastings|first1=James|last2=Selbie|first2=John Alexander|last3=Lambert|first3=John Chisholm|author4=Shailer Mathews|title=Dictionary of the Bible|year=1909|publisher=C.
