[[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and the Dwarves watch from the [[Lonely Mountain]] as the dragon [[Smaug]] sets [[Esgaroth|Laketown]] ablaze. [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]] breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the [[Middle-earth weapons and armour#Black Arrow|black arrow]] brought to him by his son [[List of kings of Dale|Bain]]. Smaug's falling body crushes the fleeing Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat laden with the town's gold. Bard reluctantly becomes the new leader of the people of Laketown, with the Master's conniving servant, Alfrid, acting as Bard's reluctant servant, as they seek refuge in the ruins of Dale, while [[Legolas]] travels to investigate [[List of minor places in Middle-earth#Mount Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] with [[Tauriel]]. Thorin, now struck with "dragon sickness" over the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the [[Arkenstone]], which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Thorin, hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.

Meanwhile, [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]], and [[Saruman]] arrive at [[Dol Guldur]] and free [[Gandalf]], sending him to safety with [[Radagast]]. They battle and defeat the [[Nazgûl]] and a formless [[Sauron]] himself, banishing them to the East. [[Azog]], marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son [[Bolg]] to Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.

[[Thranduil]] and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by [[Middle-earth dwarf characters#Thrór|Thrór]]. Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the treasures they were promised and prevent a battle. When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo. Thorin's cousin [[Dáin II Ironfoot|Dáin]] arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men ensues, until [[Wereworms]] emerge from the ground, releasing Azog's army from their tunnels. With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin's army, Thranduil and Bard's forces, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, join the battle, fighting the Orcs. However, a second front is opened when many Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city, while Alfrid takes a bunch of gold and flees from Dale to his ultimate fate.

Inside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides towards [[Ravenhill (Middle-earth)|Ravenhill]] with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog; Bilbo follows them, using [[One Ring|his magic ring]] to move through the combat unseen. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's approaching army. Fíli is captured, and Azog kills him as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. Thorin kills Azog, but is fatally wounded in the process. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] arrive with Radagast and [[Beorn]] to fight the newly arriving Orc army, and the Orcs are finally defeated. Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with the dying Thorin. Tauriel mourns Kili, and Thranduil acknowledges their love. Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave, and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name [[Aragorn|"Strider"]].

As Thorin's company begin settling back into Erebor (with Dáin now the king), and Dale begins to recover with Bard as the leader, Bilbo bids farewell to the company's remaining members and journeys home to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He cancels the sale, but finds his home pillaged; he starts to tidy up and to settle back in. [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|Sixty years later]], Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.

===Development===
{{Further|The Hobbit (film series)#Development}}
''The Hobbit'' was originally envisioned as a two-part film, but Jackson confirmed plans for a third film on 30 July 2012, turning his adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' into a trilogy.<ref name=THR30712>{{cite news| first =Zakarin | last = Jordan |date=30 July 2012 |url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/third-hobbit-film-confirmed-355817 |title=Third 'Hobbit' Film Confirmed |work= The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=PJFB30712>{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Peter |authorlink= Peter Jackson | date= 30 July 2012 | url= https://www.facebook.com/notes/peter-jackson/an-unexpected-journey/10151114596546558 | title = An unexpected journey |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> According to Jackson, the third film would contain the [[Battle of the Five Armies]] and make extensive use of the appendices that Tolkien wrote to expand the story of [[Middle-earth]] (published in the back of ''[[The Return of the King]]''). Jackson also stated that while the third film would largely make use of footage originally shot for the first and second films, it would require additional filming as well.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://screenrant.com/hobbit-3-peter-jackson/ |title='The Hobbit 3' Edges Closer to Production | publisher =ScreenRant |last=Outlaw |first=Kofi |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> The third film was titled ''There and Back Again'' in August 2012.<ref name="McClintock">{{cite news| last= McClintock|first= Pamela| title= Third 'Hobbit' Film Sets Release Date |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/third-hobbit-film-sets-release-367258 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=31 August 2012 |date=31 August 2012}}</ref> In April 2014, Jackson changed the title of the film to ''The Battle of the Five Armies'' as he thought the new title better suited the situation of the film.<ref name=Guardian1>{{cite web|title=Peter Jackson retitles The Hobbit part three The Battle of the Five Armies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/24/peter-jackson-hobbit-battle-of-the-five-armies|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 May 2014|first=Ben |last=Child|date=24 April 2014}}</ref> He stated on his [[Facebook]] page, "''There and Back Again'' felt like the right name for the second of a two film telling of the quest to reclaim Erebor, when Bilbo's arrival there, and departure, were both contained within the second film.

===Score===
{{Main|Music of The Hobbit film series#The Battle of the Five Armies}}
As with all the previous films, [[Howard Shore]] composed the score. Conrad Pope (who conducted the orchestra) and James Sizemore orchestrated the music for the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]] and for two [[Gamelan]] orchestra, while the [[London Voices]] and Tiffin' Boys choir were recorded in [[Air Lyndhurst|AIR Lyndhurst]], London. The score featured a few new themes for Dain, Gundabad (featuring a "chorus" of didgeridoos) and the Dwarves' war preparations, but focused more on blending and clashing the themes against one another, eventually bringing the themes to a resolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cbwritingblogblog.wordpress.com/2014/12/10/interview-h-shore/|title=Interview: Howard Shore|date=10 December 2014|publisher=}}</ref>

[[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]], who played [[Peregrin Took]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', wrote and recorded the song "The Last Goodbye" to be played over the end credits of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2014/10/20/93144-our-final-trip-to-middle-earth-to-finish-with-the-last-goodbye-sung-by-billy-boyd/|title=Our final trip to Middle-earth to finish with "The Last Goodbye" sung by Billy Boyd.

===Video games===
Two video games were developed to coincide with the film's theatrical release. A tie-in fighting video game ''The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies – Fight for Middle Earth'' was released simultaneously with the film for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] platforms to negative reviews from critics and users. An [[action-adventure]] video game ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] & [[Xbox One]] in October 2014 and for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] on November 21, nearly a week prior to The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies world [[premiere]] in London, on 1 December. The events of the game take place directly after [[Sauron]] fled to [[Mordor]], escaping [[The White Council]], which was shown at the beginning of the film. The game was planned to act as an overlap between [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit film series]] and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings film series]].

[[MTV]] reported that early reviews for ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'' were "generally positive" with critics praising the film "for its energy, shorter running time and satisfying closure".<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin P.|date=2 December 2014|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2013811/hobbit-battle-of-five-armies-reviews/|title=Early The Hobbit: The Battle Of Five Armies Reviews Are Here|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> According to [[International Business Times|IBT]], reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics "praising director Peter Jackson's effort at transforming J.

Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said "The result is at once the trilogy's most engrossing episode, its most expeditious (at a comparatively lean 144 minutes) and also its darkest—both visually and in terms of the forces that stir in the hearts of men, dwarves and orcs alike."<ref>{{cite web |last=Foundas |first=Scott |date=1 December 2014|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-1201367492/ |title=Film Review: 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said "After six films, 13 years and 1031 minutes of accumulated running time, Peter Jackson has concluded his massively remunerative genuflection at the altar of J.R.R.

Conversely, Inkoo Kang of [[TheWrap]] said "The 144-minute running time showcases Jackson's worst tendencies: eons-long battle scenes, sloppy and abrupt resolutions, portentous romances, off-rhythm comic timing, and, newly in this case, patience-testing fan service."<ref>{{cite web |last=Kang |first=Inkoo |date=1 December 2014|url=http://www.thewrap.com/the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-review-martin-freeman-ian-mckellen-cate-blanchett/ |title='The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies' Review: Martin Freeman and Company End Trilogy, Provide Fan Service |publisher=[[The Wrap]] |accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the film as "a paragraph on steroids" that was "neither very terrible nor remotely unexpected.
