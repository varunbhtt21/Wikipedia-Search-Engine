The result was    '''merge to [[Future_of_the_Russian_Navy#Destroyers]]'''. I leave it up to a subject matter expert to figure out how much information should be merged.  In any case, leave a redirect behind.  No bias against breaking this back out into a stand-alone article if at some future time, sufficient reliable independent sources emerge. -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 13:33, 24 May 2014 (UTC)

This article is about a vessel concept identified by a project name or number. Typically, ship design companies create and publish concepts identified by some name or number every now and then, but only a fraction of them will ever be built. In this case, none of these "Project 21956" ships have been built or even ordered - it's just a concept that the ship design company hopes someone would buy. In [[WP:SHIPS]], "proposed ships" are considered notable enough to warrant an article (i.e. not fail [[WP:CRYSTAL]]) when the shipbuilding contract is awarded (or was awarded but later cancelled) or there is (was) otherwise strong indication (e.g. strong media publicity) that the vessel will be (or would have been) built. This is not the case with this article and thus I have proposed it for deletion. [[User:Tupsumato|Tupsumato]] ([[User talk:Tupsumato|talk]]) 14:17, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Keep but reword''' - An alternative would be to reword the article so it talks about the project rather than as if the ships already existed (as it does at present). This would be appropriate if the project itself is notable which it seems to be as there are several references. It is certainly the sort of thing a reader might reasonably be searching for.

::That doesn't mean it's not a violation of [[WP:CRYSTAL]] - we routinely delete pages that receive quite a lot of hits if they don't meet our inclusion policies. Ships that weren't built (and most of those that were cancelled after work began) usually don't merit an article (and when they do warrant an article, it's because they are discussed significantly by reputable naval historians, and usually merged in with related topics - as in the case with [[French battlecruiser proposals]] or [[German FK cruiser designs]]). At best, this article could be merged into a hypothetical [[List of destroyers of Russia and the Soviet Union]] if someone wants to go through the trouble of creating it.

: I might be failing some kind of Wikipedia policy here by making this comparison, but in my eyes "Project 21956" is comparable to e.g. [http://baltictransportjournal.com/finland/aker-arctic-presents-the-arc-100-hd-icebreaker,861.html Aker ARC 100 HD], a conceptual design that was published last spring and was featured in a number of high-profile ship technology publications. While I wrote an article about [[oblique icebreaker]]s in general and another about [[Baltika (icebreaker)|the one that is being built right now]], I haven't mentioned it in Wikipedia. As a project, it is simply not notable enough.
: By the way, of the "several references", 50% are from the design bureau's own website. [[User:Tupsumato|Tupsumato]] ([[User talk:Tupsumato|talk]]) 17:05, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Merge''' to [[List of destroyers of Russia and the Soviet Union]],</s> which I plan to get a start on tomorrow. There's no hulls laid down so it's "[[WP:CRYSTAL]] unless [[WP:GNG]]", and GNG isn't met here. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 00:53, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
**I started working on that and quickly went "Nope". But I did find a better target, where the ship is already mentioned, so '''redirect''' to [[Future of the Russian Navy#Destroyers]]. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 08:02, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

—————————
I take serious issue with the using the ship number (and lack of name) as a point against this article. The actual class and ship names are allocated by the Russian Navy, and done so after production. Just because French or American companies produce promotional names does not mean that this is the practice elsewhere. IMHO, it shows a degree of ignorance of Russian naval design to use this argument. There is no way that this design is significantly less notable than the DDG-X/DDG-1000 was before it was procured.
