The '''Luhansk People's Republic''' ({{lang-uk|Луганська Народна Республіка}}, ''{{transl|uk|Luhanska Narodna Respublika}}''), also known as '''Lugansk People's Republic'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.lug-info.com/|title=Lugansk Media Centre|website=en.lug-info.com}}</ref><ref name="tassresigns" /> ({{lang-rus|Луга́нская Наро́дная Респу́блика|Luganskaya Narodnaya Respublika, LNR|lʊˈɡanskəjə nɐˈrodnəjə rʲɪˈspublʲɪkə}}), usually abbreviated as '''LPR''' or '''LNR''', is a landlocked [[proto-state]] in the [[Luhansk Oblast]] in the [[Donbass]] region, in [[eastern Ukraine]]. Along with the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] (DPR), the LPR declared independence from [[Ukraine]] in the aftermath of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]]. An armed conflict with Ukraine followed its declaration of independence, during which the LPR and DPR received military and humanitarian assistance from Russia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} This conflict is still ongoing as of August 2019. LPR remains unrecognised by any UN member state, including [[Russia]] – although Russia recognises documents issued by the LPR government, such as identity documents, diplomas, birth and marriage certificates and vehicle registration plates.<ref name="RrsUp18217lpr">[http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN15X0KR Putin orders Russia to recognize documents issued in rebel-held east Ukraine], [[Reuters]] (18 February 2017)</ref>

==Geography and demographics==
The LPR is [[landlocked]] and borders Ukraine (i.e., the rest of Ukraine) to the north, the self-proclaimed [[Donetsk People's Republic]] to the west, and [[Russia]] to the east. The LPR extends to approximately half of Luhansk Oblast, including its densely populated areas, the regional capital [[Luhansk]], as well as the major cities [[Alchevsk]] and [[Krasnodon]]. Approximately 64.4% of the population of the Oblast lives in the LPR.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/751315 |title=Self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic governs most residents |publisher=en.itar-tass.com |date=25 September 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> The northern part of [[Luhansk Oblast]], which is predominantly Ukrainian-speaking, has remained under Ukrainian control.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/luhansk-will-never-be-the-same-again-in-kyiv-a-blogger-reflects-on-his-native-city/25414757.html |title='Luhansk Will Never Be The Same Again:' In Kyiv, A Blogger Reflects On His Native City |work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty |accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref> The territory controlled by the LPR is mostly, but not completely, coincident with the right (southern) bank of the [[Donets]].

The highest point of the LPR (and of the whole Donbass) is Grave Mechetna hill ({{convert|367.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level), which is located in the vicinity of the city of [[Petrovske]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umoloda.kiev.ua/number/1723/235/60906/|title=На даху Донбасу|website=Club-tourist|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref>

The population of the republic is estimated by the LPR's bureau of statistics at approximately 1.5 million people, although the exactness of this estimate is questionable due to war-time migration and a lack of independent sources.<ref name=lprstat/> Approximately 435,000 of the republic's population live in [[Luhansk]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://geopoliticalfutures.com/four-years-luhansk-peoples-republic/|title=Four Years of the Luhansk People's Republic – Geopolitical Futures|date=2018-03-02|work=Geopolitical Futures|access-date=2018-06-07}}</ref> where the republic has its administration.

==History==
{{See also | Timeline of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine| War in Donbass}}
Lugansk and Donetsk People's republics are located in the historical region of [[Donbass]], which was added to Ukraine in 1922.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Andrés|first=César García|date=2018|title=Historical Evolution of Ukraine and its Post Communist Challenges|url=http://cis01.central.ucv.ro/revistadestiintepolitice/files/numarul58_2018/8.pdf|journal=Revista de Stiinte Politice (RST)|volume=58|pages=|via=}}</ref> The majority of the population speak Russian as their first language. Attempts by various Ukrainian governments to question the legitimacy of the Russian culture in Ukraine had since the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] often resulted in political conflict. In the Ukrainian national elections, a remarkably stable pattern had developed, where Donbass and the Western Ukrainian regions had voted for the opposite candidates since the presidential election in 1994. [[Viktor Yanukovych]], a Donetsk native, had been elected as a president of Ukraine in 2010. His overthrow in the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] led to protests in Eastern Ukraine, which gradually escalated into an armed conflict between the newly formed Ukrainian government and the local armed militias.<ref name=":0">Petro, Nicolai N., Understanding the Other Ukraine: Identity and Allegiance in Russophone Ukraine (1 March 2015).

Additional elections took place simultaneously in Donetsk and Luhansk republics on 11 November 2018. The official position of the U.S. and European union is that the vote is illegitimate because it was not controlled by the Ukrainian government, and that it was contrary to the 2015 Minsk agreement. Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the Luhansk People's Republic, disagreed and said that the vote was in accordance with the Minsk Agreement. The separatist leaders said that the election was a key step toward establishing full-fledged democracy in the regions. The President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko told residents of eastern Ukraine not to participate in the vote. Both regions reported voter turnout of more than 70 percent as of two hours before the polls closed at 8 p.m. local time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-rebels-hold-elections-in-defiance-of-west|title=Ukraine rebels hold elections in defiance of West|last=hermesauto|date=2018-11-11|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/11/11/world/europe/ap-eu-ukraine-rebel-elections.html|title=Ukraine Rebel Regions Vote in Ballot That West Calls Bogus|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistanpoint.com/en/story/477912/lpr-election-commission-delivers-accreditations-to-int.html|title=LPR Election Commission Delivers Accreditations To Int'l Observers Ahead Of Sunday's Vote|last=Khalil|first=Rania|date=|website=Pakistan Point|access-date=}}</ref>
