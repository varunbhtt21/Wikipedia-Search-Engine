Title : Viktoria Tereshkina
Text : '''Viktoria Tereshkina''' ({{lang-ru|Виктория Терёшкина}};  born 31 May 1983) is a Russian ballet dancer, currently one of the stars of the [[Mariinsky Ballet]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Early life==
Tereshkina was born in [[Krasnoyarsk]] in Siberia where her father was a gymnastics teacher. From the age of four she was trained in [[artistic gymnastics]] in which she performed increasingly well. However, when she reached the age of 10, her parents decided her prospects for an extended career would be better in ballet. As a result, she was sent to the ballet school in Krasnoyarsk. When she was 16, she took part in a ballet festival in [[Saint Petersburg]]. She was noticed by [[Igor Belsky]] who recommended she should join the [[Vaganova Academy]] where he was artistic director. After  training for five years in Krasnoyarsk, she therefore spent a further three years in Saint Petersburg in the class of Marina Vassilieva.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-dansomanie.net/pagesdanso/mariinsky_londres_2009_entretien_viktoria_tereshkina.html|title=Le Mariinsky en tournée à Londres: 07 août 2009 : à la rencontre de Viktoria Tereshkina|author=B.
