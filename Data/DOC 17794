'''''Thorax porcellana''''' [[Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure|Saussure]] is a species of epilamprid cockroach occurring in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]]. Both sexes are fully winged, but only the male takes flight, and then rarely and on short flights.<ref>"Cockroaches - Ecology, Behaviour, and Natural History" - Bell, Roth & Nalepa (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007)</ref>

Louis M. Roth speculated in 1981 that the arched [[tegmina]] found in ''Phoraspis'' and ''Thorax'' were similar to that of ''Phlebonotus pallens'' and  would suggest similar maternal care. The Indian entomologist S. Bhoopathy confirmed in 1998 that this [[ovoviviparous]] species carries some 30-40 hatchling nymphs for their first two instars in a special recess under the domed forewings on the dorsum of the mother. During their stay of about 7&nbsp;weeks they drink a pinkish liquid secreted from between the [[tergites]] of their mother’s abdomen. They also use their relatively long, sharp, mandibular tooth-like processes to pierce the mother’s cuticle and feed directly on her [[haemolymph]]. These 'teeth' are lost after two instars when there is no longer a close association with the mother.<ref name="speciesfile">{{cite web|url=http://blattodea.speciesfile.org/Common/basic/Taxa.aspx?TaxonNameID=1173448|title=genus Thorax Saussure, 1862: Blattodea Species File|publisher=blattodea.speciesfile.org|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref><ref name="researchgate">{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229456553_Breeding_ecology_of_the_rainforest_dung_beetle_Cephalodesmius_armiger_(Scarabaeidae)_in_Tooloom_National_Park|title=Breeding ecology of the rainforest dung beetle Cephalodesmius armiger (Scarabaeidae) in Tooloom National Park - ResearchGate|publisher=researchgate.net|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref><ref name="terrarium">{{cite web|url=http://www.karaczany.terrarium.pl/zachowania-spoleczne-karaczanow|title=Zachowania społeczne karaczanów - karaczany.terrarium.pl|publisher=karaczany.terrarium.pl|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

{{quote|''"Immediately after hatching, the first instar nymphs crawled over the abdomen of the mother. The upper surface of her abdomen became markedly depressed into a fairly tight spacious trough or chamber with its sides raised. As the nymphs crawled over her body, she raised up her tegmina, which were large, tough, and dome-shaped, and all the nymphs were accommodated compactly; the tegmina were placed in position so as to conceal all the nymphs and to afford perfect protection."''|Bhoopathy 1998}}.
Parental care among cockroaches, where offspring are fed on bodily secretions, is not rare, and has been recorded in ''[[Perisphaerus]]'', ''[[Trichoblatta]]'', ''[[Pseudophoraspis]]'', ''[[Phlebonotus]]'', ''[[Gromphadorhina]]'', ''[[Solganea]]'', ''[[Cryptocercus]]'' and ''[[Blattella]]'', whereas biparental care is found only in wood-eating cockroaches - wood is low in nutrients and is made assimilable by micro-organisms in the adult gut.
