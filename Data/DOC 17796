Title : Birmingham City F.C. in European football
Text : [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] is an English professional football club based in [[Birmingham]]. The club's involvement in European competition dates back to the 1950s.

Invitations to enter the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], a football tournament set up to promote industrial [[trade fair]]s, were extended to the city hosting the trade fair rather than to clubs. Some cities entered a select team including players from more than one club, but [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], the other major club based in the city of [[Birmingham]], rejected the opportunity to field a combined team.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goodyear |first1=David |last2=Matthews |first2=Tony |lastauthoramp=y |title=Aston Villa A Complete Record 1875–1988 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |year=1988 |isbn=0-907969-37-2 |quote=At this time there seemed a general lack of ambition at Villa Park. The club were slow to install floodlights, they turned down the chance of combining with Blues to field a 'Birmingham' team for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup...}}</ref> Thus Birmingham City became the first English club side to play in European competition when they played their first match in the [[1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] on 15 May 1956. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, the [[1958–60 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1960 Fairs Cup final]], in which they met [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. The home leg, a goalless draw, was played on 29 March 1960 and the away leg, which Barcelona won 4–1, some six weeks later.{{#tag:ref|The [[London XI]], including players from several London clubs, were the first English ''team'' to play in European competition when they played their first match in [[1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|the inaugural Fairs Cup]] in 1955, and the first English ''team'' to reach a final, in the same campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ecomp.html |title=European Cups Archive |accessdate=27 July 2007 |last=Ross |first=James M. |date=13 July 2006 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF)}}</ref>|group=upper-alpha}} In the semifinal of the [[1960–61 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1961 Fairs Cup]] Birmingham beat [[F.C.
