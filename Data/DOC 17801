==Biography==
Born in [[Algiers]] in the [[French Algeria]], Jacques Benoit left for [[France]] at the age of seven, after the [[Algerian independence war]]. He attended high school at [[Orleans, France|Orleans]] and [[Nice, France|Nice]], eventually settling in [[Paris, France|Paris]], where he studied [[Graphic Arts]] at the Met de Penninghen Art School<ref>ESAG Met de Penninghen Paris Art School [http://www.penninghen.com/ View on line]</ref> in the early 1970s.

As a young professional, Benoit worked in advertising agencies before taking the position of Creative Director<ref>Euro Disney. French newspaper ''Les Echos'', n° 16283, December 9th 1992, p 54. [http://www.lesechos.fr/09/12/1992/LesEchos/16283-091-ECH_euro-disney-alfredo-gangotena.htm View on line]</ref> at [[Euro Disney]], between 1991 and 1995; followed by another two-year stint as Director of Creative at the [[Futuroscope|Futuroscope Park]], between 2000 and 2002.

The new century marked a turning point in Benoit's life, as the painter abandoned his career in advertising to commit himself full-time to the painting activities he had started in the mid 1990s.

==Style==
Since the late 1990s, Benoit's work has been mostly inspired by [[Modern Architecture]], including its Brazilian branch (inaugurated by the architect [[Lúcio Costa]], and developed by his apprentice [[Oscar Niemeyer]]).

Pop Music is another strong influence on Benoit's paintings, which encompass [[Figurative art|figurative]], narrative and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] trends. As primary influence, the painter quotes the music of [[Joni Mitchell]]. But also the music of [[Elton John]], [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Kate Bush]], or  [[Patti Smith]],<ref>(« Horsesvision » : hommage vibrant à l’album Horses de Patti Smith|Published November 9th, 2015 at 6:42 [http://www.ouifm.fr/horsesvision-hommage-vibrant-a-lalbum-horses-de-patti-smith/] View on line]</ref> followed by the [[jazz]] music of [[Miles Davis]], [[Shirley Horn]] and the [[Jazz Fusion]] composer [[Pat Metheny]].

Occasionally Benoit's paintings can also make reference to [[Stanley Kubrick]]’s and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]’s films.

==Influences==

===The music of Elton John===
In 1973 [[Elton John]] commissioned Jacques Benoit a series of artworks to be used in the promotional material for John's 1974 US & World Tour (tour book,<ref>Archives (copyright Jacques Benoit) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images%20refonte%20mars%202014/Conform%C3%A9%20WEB/Tour-Book-Elton-John-1974-copyright-Jacques-Benoit-archives.jpg View on line]</ref> T-shirts<ref>Archives (copyright Jacques Benoit) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images%20refonte%20mars%202014/Conform%C3%A9%20WEB/Elton-John-Tour-1974-copyright-Jacques-Benoit-archives.jpg View on line]</ref> and posters<ref>Archives (copyright Jacques Benoit) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images%20refonte%20mars%202014/Conform%C3%A9%20WEB/Poster-elton-John-Tour-1974-copyright-Jacques-Benoit-archives.jpg View on line]</ref>).

Thirty years later, Benoit contributed to the [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]] by offering the singer a painting<ref>''Painting The Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes'' (Jacques Benoit's Archives) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/divers_page_peintures%20-%20UK.html View on line]</ref> especially made for him, inspired by his composition ''Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes'' from his 2001 album ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]''.

===The music of Joni Mitchell===
Passionate<ref>Influence of Joni Mitchell's poems and music (Jacques Benoit's archives) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Joni_page_texte_UK.html View on line]</ref><ref>Assumpção, Maurício. ''The Man who painted Niemeyer''. Valor Econômico Newspaper, Brazil, April 27th, 2012 [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images/presse/Valor-Economico-Page-UK-pour-web.jpg View on line]</ref> about the music of the Canadian composer and singer Joni Mitchell, Benoit produced, between 1977 and 1989, a series of works inspired by a selection of fifty poems drawn from her albums from ''[[Song to a Seagull]]'' (1968) through ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm]]'' (1988).

In the 1980s, Benoit and Mitchell met twice<ref>Joni Mitchell's Official Site http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2799&from=search</ref> to discuss his works. On April 30, 1983, the painter presented a first selection<ref>First selection of paintings (Jacques Benoit's Archives) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Joni_page_texte_UK.html View on line]</ref> of his works to Mitchell during her series of concerts<ref>Joni Mitchell's 1983 ''Wild Things'' World Tour (Joni Mitchell's Archives) [http://jonimitchell.com/chronology/tour.cfm?id=7 View on line]</ref> in Paris at [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] and [[Casino de Paris]] (Joni Mitchell World Tour, Wild Things Tour/1983).

Encouraged by this meeting, Benoit pursued his work, planning to publish a book with Mitchell's lyrics alongside his paintings. In 1987 the painter sent the book's mockup<ref>Book mock up (Jacques Benoit's archives) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Joni_page_texte_UK.html View on line]</ref> to [[Box, Wiltshire|Box]] in [[Wiltshire, England|Wiltshire]], [[England, UK|England]], where Mitchell was then recording her new album ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm]]'' at [[Peter Gabriel]]’s [[Real World Studios]].

A second meeting took place in the Real World studio, where Benoit presented Mitchell with a series of new paintings. Altogether, Benoit's production comprises sixty<ref>Works inspired by Joni Mitchell's œuvre [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Joni_page_peintures%20-%20UK.html View on line]</ref> [[gouaches]], [[engravings]] (as monotype [[Linocut|linocut prints]]), [[Oil painting|oil]] and large-format paintings on paper based on Mitchell’s texts.
According to Benoit, it was this Joni Mitchell phase that led him to embrace his career as a professional painter.

===The World Trade Center===
In 2002 Benoit saw on the French TV channel [[France 3]] the ''[[9/11 (2002 film)|9/11]]'' documentary film about the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center]] in [[New York City|New York]]. The film was directed by the then fireman [[James Hanlon]] and the French-American filmmakers [[Jules and Gedeon Naudet|Jules and Gédéon Naudet]].

In the film, James Hanlon suggested an identical reconstruction of the destroyed towers, while the Mayor of New York City [[Rudy Giuliani]] advocated the construction of a [[Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks|9/11 memorial]] alongside a brand new development.

Those opposing views inspired Benoit's own vision<ref>World Trade Center paintings (Jacques Benoit's archives) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/world_Trade_Center_page_texte_UK.html View on line]</ref> of the reconstructed towers, exactly as they were, with a memorial inserted into its original design.

In agreement with Gédéon Naudet, Benoit donated a [[triptych]] of his proposal<ref>World Trade Center Tryptych (Jacques Benoit's archives) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/World_trade_center.html View on line]</ref> to James Hanlon at the [[New York City Fire Department]] in [[Manhattan]].

===The architecture of Oscar Niemeyer===

====Exhibition: ''Brasilia. Flesh and Soul'' (1997, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2014)====
In 1997, Benoit exhibited in Paris his first series of paintings inspired by the city of [[Brasília|Brasilia]] (a place the painter visited for the first time in 1994). The paintings were followed by a new series of works, under the title ''Brasilia. Flesh and Soul'', exhibited in art galleries and at the [[Maison du Brésil]] in Paris in 2005,<ref>Maison du Brésil 2005 [http://www.maisondubresil.org/Culturel/vu_maison_2005.php View on line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220553/http://www.maisondubresil.org/Culturel/vu_maison_2005.php |date=2014-04-18 }}</ref> 2007<ref>Maison du Brésil 2007 [http://www.maisondubresil.org/Culturel/vu_maison_2007.php View on line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220340/http://www.maisondubresil.org/Culturel/vu_maison_2007.php |date=2014-04-18 }}</ref> and 2010.<ref>Maison du Brésil 2005 [http://www.maisondubresil.org/Culturel/vu_maison_2010.php View on line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220456/http://www.maisondubresil.org/Culturel/vu_maison_2010.php |date=2014-04-18 }}</ref> "Brasilia.

==== ''Brasilia. Travel towards Dawn'' (2004) ====
In 2003, the Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] received Jacques Benoit's proposal for a documentary film about the creation of Brasilia entitled ''Brasilia. Travel towards Dawn''. The architect agreed to meet the artist in 2004<ref>Assumpção, Maurício. ''The Man who painted Niemeyer''.

After the interview, Benoit offered the architect a painting<ref>Painting "Brasilia Airport" - Jacques Benoit's archives [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images/aeroporto%20brasilia%20for%20Page%20Text.pdf View on line]</ref> representing his 1960's project for the [[Brasília International Airport]]. Niemeyer's modern airport had never been built<ref>"Architect". The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects [http://www.architectmagazine.com/architects/man-of-the-people.aspx View on line]</ref> due to divergences with the [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military dictatorship]] that ruled [[Brazil]] between 1964 and 1985. As a gesture of courtesy, Oscar Niemeyer offered the painter his sketches made during the interview.

Back in France, the painter made a 13-minute trailer<ref>Prologue of ''Brasilia. Travel towards Dawn'' [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Brasilia_page_texte_UK.html View on line]</ref> out of the three-hour-long rushes he produced in Brazil. In the following years, Benoit met several French production companies who showed interest for the film. The project, however, never reached production stage due to lack of funding.

====Exhibition: ''Three Traces of Oscar'' (2006)====
In 2005, the director of the Espace Niemeyer cultural center at the [[French Communist Party]] headquarters, Gérard Fournier,<ref>Gérard Fournier. Director of Espace Niemeyer in Paris. French radio station ''France Bleu'' [http://www.francebleu.fr/infos/le-coup-de-fil-d-actualite/invitedujour-10 View on line]</ref> visited the ''Brasilia. Flesh and Soul'' exhibition at Maison du Brésil. He decided to host Benoit's next exhibition, ''Three Traces Oscar'', in the party's headquarters, designed by Niemeyer himself.

This project involved the creation of a new series of paintings inspired by the three buildings projected by Oscar Niemeyer in the [[Paris metropolitan area]]: the headquarters of the French Communist Party in the [[Place du Colonel Fabien]], the headquarters of the Bourse du Travail in [[Bobigny, France|Bobigny]] and the headquarters of the daily ''[[L'Humanité]]'' in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]].

====Exhibition: Château d’Ars (2009)====
In 2009, the mayor of the city of [[La Chatre]] in the French region of [[Indre]], [[Nicolas Forissier]], invited Jacques Benoit to exhibit at the Château d'Ars's art galleries for a two-month event that combined different themes exploited by his work - with an emphasis on the canvas that paid tribute to Oscar Niemeyer's architecture.

The exhibition,<ref>Château d'Ars exhibition.

''Brasilia. Half a Century of the Capital of Brazil'' is a traveling exhibition on the history of the city through a collection of documents, objects and photographs dating back to the 18th century. The show was held at Espace Niemeyer in Paris and presented a selection of Benoit's works.<ref>Exhibition ''Brasilia.

This symbolic work commemorates Oscar Niemeyer's death, occurred in December 2012. It portrays Niemeyer's loft on Copacabana beach, where he lived and worked, alongside [[Brasilia Cathedral|Brasilia's cathedral]], one of his most iconic projects. According to the painter, the polyptych was made under the influence of [[Melody Gardot]]’s music, from her 2012 album [[The Absence (Melody Gardot album)|''The Absence'']], as well as the composition ''Nenia'' by the Italian trumpeter [[Paolo Fresu]].

=== Los Angeles and the music of Rickie Lee Jones ===
Tapping different architectural and urban sources, Benoit created in 2007 a series of canvas inspired by [[Los Angeles]], CA, offering a [[Kaleidoscope|kaleidoscopic]] nocturne vision of the city.

This vision, entitled ''Sur la Trace des Versants Ouest''<ref>Sur la Trace des Versants Ouest [http://jacquesbenoit.com/versants_ouest_page_texte_UK.html View on line]</ref> was inspired by the composition ''Traces of the Western Slopes'' by the American musician and composer [[Rickie Lee Jones]], co-written by Sal Bernardi (seventh track on Rickie Lee Jones' 1981 [[Pirates (album)|Pirates album]]). An over eight-minute-long epic, jazzy and symphonic composition, which explores the confluences of [[Jazz Fusion]], [[Blues]] and [[Rock music|Rock]], ''Traces of the Western Slopes'' is generally considered one of Rickie Lee Jones's best works of all time.

==== Exhibition: ''Sur la Trace des Versants Ouest'' ====
Series of nine large format paintings<ref>''Sur la Trace des Versants Ouest'' paintings [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Versants_Ouest%20-%20UK.html View on line]</ref> exhibited in Paris in November 2007.

=== The Architecture of Orly Airport ===
In 2003, Benoit produced two canvases, ''Orly (South)'', inspired by the [[Orly Airport]] in Paris. Designed by the French architect Henri Vicariot, the 1962 building was renamed South Wing after the addition of a West Wing, and the construction of a new airport ([[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle]]) in the North of Paris.

Back to his Brazilian projects, the artist put aside the Orly airport series for several years. He was not back to the Orly phase until 2008, as he created a series of 11 new paintings<ref>''Orly (Sud)'' series of paintings [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Orly_page_peintures_UK.html View on line]</ref><ref>Newspaper ''L'Express-Le Vif'' (February 19th, 2012) [http://weekend.levif.be/tendance/lifestyle/expo/expo-decryptee-jacques-benoit-chez-dubois-friedland/album-4000044854687.htm View on line]</ref><ref>Newspaper ''L'Express-Le Vif-Focus'' (January 20th, 2012) [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images%20refonte%20mars%202014/Conform%C3%A9%20WEB/ORLY-LEVIF-20janvier2012.jpg View on line]</ref><ref>Newspaper ''The Brussels Tribune'' [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images%20refonte%20mars%202014/Conform%C3%A9%20WEB/ORLY-Brussels-tribune-low-def.jpg View on line]</ref><ref>Newspaper ''Art Actuel'' [http://www.artactuel.com/galerie-art/dubois-friedland-gallery-1547/evenement/jacques-benoit-orly-sud-2035.html View on line]</ref><ref>''Moustique'' news [http://www.moustique.be/mosquito/agenda-culturel/detail/0/25929/jacques-benoit-orly-sud View on line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306172810/http://www.moustique.be/mosquito/agenda-culturel/detail/0/25929/jacques-benoit-orly-sud |date=2014-03-06 }}</ref><ref>''Arts Hebdo Medias'' [http://www.artshebdomedias.com/agenda/101211-jacques-benoit-orly-sud View on line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306175842/http://www.artshebdomedias.com/agenda/101211-jacques-benoit-orly-sud |date=2014-03-06 }}</ref> under the influence of the jazz singer [[Shirley Horn]], the soundtrack [[Miles Davis]] composed for [[Louis Malle]]’s film, ''[[Lift to the Scaffold]]'', and the soundtracks of [[Claude Lelouch]]’s films [[Vivre pour vivre|''Live for Life'']] and ''[[A Man and a Woman]]'', both composed by [[Francis Lai]].

====Exhibition: ''Orly (South)''====
In 2012, the gallery Dubois Friedland<ref>''Dubois Friedland'' gallery [http://www.artshebdomedias.com/annuaire/070311-duboisfriedland View on line]</ref> in [[Brussels]] presented the ''Orly (South)''<ref>''Orly (Sud)'' exhibition [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Orly_page_textes_UK.html View on line]</ref> exhibition with the support of the French Embassy<ref>''Orly (Sud)'' and the French Embassy in Belgium [http://jacquesbenoit.com/Images/presse/Embassade-France-agenda-culturel_page-web.jpg View on line]</ref> in [[Belgium]].

Since then Benoit has been working on a sequel to ''Orly (Sud)'', with a new series of paintings inspired by the works of the French architect Henri Vicariot.
