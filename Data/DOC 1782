In mathematics and theoretical physics, '''[[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]]''' is a relationship between [[geometry|geometric]] objects called [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s ''(pictured)''. The term refers to a situation where two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as [[extra dimension]]s of [[string theory]]. Mirror symmetry was originally discovered by physicists. Mathematicians became interested in this relationship around 1990 when [[Philip Candelas]], Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parks showed that it could be used as a tool in a branch of mathematics called [[enumerative geometry]]. Today mirror symmetry is a major research topic in [[pure mathematics]], and mathematicians are working to develop a mathematical understanding of the relationship based on physicists' intuition. Mirror symmetry is also a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory, and it has been used to understand aspects of [[quantum field theory]], the formalism that physicists use to describe [[elementary particle]]s. Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the [[homological mirror symmetry]] program of [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and the [[SYZ conjecture]] of [[Andrew Strominger]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], and [[Eric Zaslow]]. {{TFAFULL|Mirror symmetry (string theory)}}
