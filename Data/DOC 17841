==History==
Witte de With was established on January 27, 1990 as a center for [[contemporary art]] with the mission of introducing international contemporary art and theory in the context of the City of Rotterdam as well as the Netherlands. The institution initially sought to present an alternative to both the classic museum for modern art and existing artists’ initiatives.  Witte de With celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2015.<ref>http://www.wdw.nl/en/our_program/long_term/in_light_of_25_years</ref> Sofía Hernández Chong Cuy leads Witte de With since 2017, she succeeds Defne Ayas; who was appointed director in 2012.
