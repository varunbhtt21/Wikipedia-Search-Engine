==AFL career==
Bontempelli made his senior debut in Round 5 of the [[2014 AFL season]] against {{AFL Car}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Ralph|first=Jon|date=20 April 2014|title=Carlton recruit Dale Thomas says Blues will take confidence from win, own form gradually improving|work=Herald Sun|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/western-bulldogs-believe-marcus-bontempelli-will-repay-decision-to-draft-him-with-pick-4/story-fni5fazt-1226765630292|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> and received a NAB AFL Rising Star nomination in Round 13 for his 22 disposals and one goal performance in the Bulldogs' win over {{AFL Col}}. In Round 15, Bontempelli kicked a remarkable goal tight up on the boundary in the final minutes of the match to give the Dogs a one-goal win over Melbourne. Bontempelli was awarded the Club's best first-year player in 2014, alongside his AFLPA best first-year player award. He finished second in the NAB AFL Rising Star in the same year.

2015 was a good season for the Dogs as they made the finals for the first time since 2010, though they were knocked out in the Elimination Final by the Adelaide Crows.

On 5 June 2016, in the absence of acting captain [[Easton Wood]], who was filling in for injured regular captain [[Robert Murphy (footballer)|Robert Murphy]], Bontempelli captained the Western Bulldogs against the {{AFL WC}} at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]], becoming the youngest match day captain since [[Jack Trengove]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.triplem.com.au/melbourne/sport/afl/news/2016/6/marcus-bontempellis-massive-achievement/|title=Marcus Bontempelli's Massive Achievement|publisher=Triple M|date=5 June 2016|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref> With the Bulldogs winning the match by eight points, Bontempelli became the youngest player in history to captain a VFL/AFL side to victory at 20 years and 194 days of age.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-06-07/young-skipper-bontempelli-breaks-new-ground|title=Young skipper Bontempelli breaks new ground|last1=Ryan|first1=Peter|last2=Navaratnam|first2=Dinny|date=7 June 2016|work=AFL.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref> He received 20 votes in the [[2016 Brownlow Medal]], the highest of any player for the Bulldogs. He was instrumental in the Bulldogs' four consecutive finals, including the [[2016 AFL Grand Final]], which was the club's first premiership victory in 62 years, where he had 22 disposals. His season was rewarded with the [[Charles Sutton Medal]] as the club [[best and fairest]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-10-05/bontempelli-adds-another-medal-to-his-cabinet-with-best-and-fairest-award|title=Bontempelli adds another medal to his cabinet with best and fairest award|last=Davidson|first=Ryan|date=5 October 2016|work=AFL.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref>

On 20 November 2017, Bontempelli was named vice-captain of the club for the [[2018 AFL season]], following Murphy's retirement and Wood's elevation to captain from vice-captain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westernbulldogs.com.au/news/2017-11-20/wood-named-bulldogs-captain|title=Wood named Bulldogs captain|publisher=Western Bulldogs|date=20 November 2017|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref>

On 10 July 2018 Bontempelli was taken to hospital with severe appendicitis and had surgery to resolve the issue. Bontempelli was then placed on the sidelines in order to allow him to recover from the surgery.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFL star undergoes emergency surgery |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/afl-briefs-marcus-bontempellis-emergency-surgery-sloane-signs-on-with-crows/news-story/3c268810e78839c0b8d9130da6acafe2 |website=[[News.com.au]] |accessdate=20 July 2018 |date=11 July 2018}}</ref>
