== Summary==
A small Ukrainian village is caught in the middle of the Russian Civil War turmoil, the Reds (Bolsheviks), the Whites (the White Army) and the [[Green armies|Greens]] (the [[anarchist]]s, the nationalists, the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|SRs]]) ousting each other in quick succession. Two boys, Dimka and Zhigan, discover an injured Red Army officer in an old barn and start helping him with food and medicine. Anticipating the inevitable enemy onslaught, they manage to bring a Red Army Unit in to rescue the injured man who happens to be a Revvoyensovet commander (his  personal R.V.S.-stamped blank given for boys to serve as a password).<ref>R.V.S.
