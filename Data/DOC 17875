'''Jeremy McGovern''' (born 15 April 1992) is an [[Australian rules football]]er who plays for the [[West Coast Eagles]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). He is a tall key-position player who has spent most of his career as a defender, although he occasionally plays forward.

McGovern was recruited from the [[Claremont Football Club]] with the 44th pick in the [[2010 AFL draft#2011 rookie draft|2011 Rookie Draft]]. He was something of a late bloomer, only making his senior debut for West Coast midway through the [[2014 AFL season|2014 season]] (aged 22). McGovern has been a fixture in the Eagles' line-up since then, and in 2015 played in [[2015 AFL Grand Final|the grand final loss]] to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. He was named as a defender in the [[2016 All-Australian team|2016]], [[2017 All-Australian team|2017]] and [[2018 All-Australian team]]s, enhancing himself as one of the best key defenders in the league.

==Early life==
McGovern is the son of [[Andrew McGovern]], who played for {{AFL Fre}} and {{AFL Syd}} in the 1990s. His younger brother [[Mitch McGovern|Mitch]] plays for {{AFL Car}}.<ref name=theaustralian>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/afl-grand-final-how-jeremy-mcgovern-learnt-to-hunt-for-marks/news-story/7a30838e9fce1faa5a057a906a95db16|title=How Jeremy McGovern learnt to hunt for marks}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/afl/west-coast-eagles/from-red-centre-to-epicentre-jeremy-mcgoverns-getting-of-football-wisdom-20151001-gjyuz3.html|author=Baum, Greg|title=From red centre to epicentre: Jeremy McGovern's getting of football wisdom|date=2 October 2015|website=[[WAtoday]]|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>

As a child, McGovern spent four years living in [[Warburton, Western Australia|Warburton]], a remote community in the [[Gibson Desert]] where his father was working for the [[Clontarf Foundation]]. He later spent time in [[Kalgoorlie]] and [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], attending [[North Albany Senior High School]].<ref name=theaustralian/> McGovern played his junior football for the [[North Albany Football Club]], in the same teams as two other future AFL players – [[Josh Bootsma]] and [[Marley Williams]].<ref>[https://thewest.com.au/sport/afl/career-turns-of-four-country-teammates-ng-ya-373649 Career turns of four country teammates]</ref> He played [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] colts for [[Claremont Football Club|Claremont]] in 2010, as a ruckman.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/great-southern/football-mcgovern-on-eagles-rookie-list-ng-ya-188392|title=McGovern on Eagles' rookie list|author=Davidson, Brad|work=[[Albany Advertiser]]/[[The West Australian]]|date=9 December 2010|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>

==AFL career==
McGovern was drafted by the Eagles with the 44th pick in the [[2010 AFL Draft|2011 Rookie Draft]] (held in late 2010).<ref>{{cite news|date=24 April 2014|title=Eagle McGovern wins back coach's trust|periodical=The Age|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/eagle-mcgovern-wins-back-coachs-trust-20140424-zqz1i.html}}</ref> He was elevated to the senior list in November 2013.<ref name="hagdorn">{{citation|author=Hagdorn, Kim|date=24 April 2014|title=Jeremy McGovern gets his chance to debut for West Coast Eagles against Carlton|periodical=perthnow|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/afl/jeremy-mcgovern-gets-his-chance-to-debut-for-west-coast-eagles-against-carlton/story-fniv6fhh-1226894944007|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref> In late 2013, McGovern showed up for pre-season training significantly overweight, after a holiday to Thailand. He was "banished" from the club and told to pursue an individual training routine if he wished to continue his career, eventually losing 10 kg and regaining the trust of the coaching staff.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-29/unprofessional-eagle-mcgovern-learns-his-lesson|author=Chadwick, Justin|title='Unprofessional' McGovern learns his lesson|agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]]|publisher=[[Australian Football League|AFL]]|date=29 September 2015|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>

In his fourth year on West Coast's playing list, McGovern finally made his senior debut for the club in round six of the [[2014 AFL season|2014 season]], against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]].<ref name="hagdorn"/> He was dropped for the next game, but returned in round twelve against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] as a like-for-like replacement for [[Josh Kennedy (footballer, born 1987)|Josh Kennedy]] (who had a fractured cheekbone).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/west-coast-eagles/eagles-players-told-to-fix-it-ng-ya-372139|author=Duffield, Mark|title=Eagles players told to fix it|work=The West Australian|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref> McGovern kicked 10 goals across the next four games, and held his spot for the rest of the year. Overall he managed 13 games in 2014, playing predominantly as a swingman in a similar vein to how [[Adam Hunter (footballer)|Adam Hunter]] was used under [[John Worsfold]].

[[2015 AFL season|In 2015]], McGovern emerged as one of the best contested marks in the game as a result of West Coast's considerable injury list. Injuries to [[Eric Mackenzie (footballer)|Eric MacKenzie]] and [[Mitch Brown (Australian footballer born 1988)|Mitch Brown]] meant McGovern was forced back into a key defender role.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-07-18/adam-simpson-postmatch|author=King, Travis|title=McGovern injury leaves Simpson with a headache|publisher=AFL|date=18 July 2015|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref> He performed it with aplomb despite often being undersized and inexperienced compared to some of the best forwards in the game. He emerged as a reliable mark, often going back with the flight of the ball into packs to influence the contest, and he was rewarded with a position in the 40-man [[All-Australian team|All-Australian]] squad (although he did not make the final team).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/all-australian-squad-of-40-named|author=Ryan, Peter|title=All Australian squad of 40 named|publisher=AFL|date=8 September 2015|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>

In 2016, after a career-best season, McGovern was named as a defender in the [[2016 All-Australian team]]. He was the first Eagles key defender to make the team since [[Darren Glass]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-09-01/2016-all-australian-team-revealed|author=Schmook, Nathan|title=All Australian: Five Swans in 2016's best 22|publisher=AFL|date=1 September 2016|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref> McGovern set a new overall record for the most contested intercept marks in a season, and recorded the equal-most marks from opposition kicks in 2016 (alongside [[Easton Wood]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/afl/why-west-coast-must-swing-allaustralian-defender-jeremy-mcgovern-forward-20170413-gvk04r.html|author=Carrier, Tim|title=Why West Coast must swing All-Australian defender Jeremy McGovern forward|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=13 April 2017|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>

In July 2018, McGovern signed a five-year contract extension with West Coast reportedly worth [[Australian dollar|$]]5 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-07-23/star-eagle-mcgovern-signs-huge-fiveyear-extension|title=No Gov lost: Eagle signs $5m five-year deal|last=Cleary|first=Mitch|date=2018-07-23|work=afl.com.au|access-date=2018-07-23}}</ref> Many clubs were interested in recruiting him, including Fremantle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-trade-free-agency-news-2018-fremantle-players-confident-jeremy-mcgovern-will-choose-dockers/news-story/7be03b1a8da508770772d709170b43d0|title=AFL trade free agency news 2018: Fremantle players confident on Jeremy McGovern|last=Morris|first=Tom|date=2018-07-03|website=www.foxsports.com.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-23}}</ref> [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/west-coast-eagles/jeremy-mcgoverns-manager-colin-young-meets-with-st-kilda-ng-b88849652z|title=Saints meet with McGovern’s manager|last=|first=|date=2018-05-28|work=PerthNow|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-AU}}</ref> and Sydney.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theroar.com.au/2018/07/23/hand-gov-jeremy-mcgovern-signs-five-year-deal-west-coast/|title=Hand in Gov: Jeremy McGovern signs five-year deal with West Coast|last=Elliott|first=Josh|date=2018-07-23|work=The Roar|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}</ref> In the West Coast game against Port Adelaide on Saturday 11 August 2018, McGovern kicked a goal after the siren to win the game for the West Coast Eagles.<ref>Nick Rynne, The West Australian. Unbelievable-jeremy-mcgovern-wins-it-for-the-eagles-after-the-siren. Retrieved 11.08.2018</ref>

In Round 23, 2018, McGovern broke the record for most intercept marks in a season by taking his 77th of 2018. The record was previously held by Easton Wood of the Western Bulldogs at 76 and was set in 2015.<ref>http://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-08-26/five-talking-points-brisbane-v-west-coast</ref>
