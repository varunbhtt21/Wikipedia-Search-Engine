When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was  '''snow close'''. If this gets more coverage, we can always re-create but right now it is just too soon.  Given that the article for [[Amit manwar]] has been recreated several times after deletion, I'm salting this to prevent a similar situation. I have no problem un-salting it if/when sources become available.

No indication that this comes anywhere near [[WP:Notability (films)]]. Searches on the film's name together with the names of the director or the star find nothing except this article. One of a string of articles about the works of a 14-year-old "''actor, singer, producer, poet, writter, director, wrestler, martial artist, music director... ''" - see [[User talk:Sunil gav]] for related notices. Contested PROD. See also [[WP:Articles for deletion/Bad born]]. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 10:18, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. No indication of notability, fails the guidelines for inclusion set out at [[WP:GNG]], [[WP:N]] etc. The article creator's talk page speaks volumes.[[User:Sparklism| — sparklism]] <sup><small>''[[User_talk:Sparklism| hey!]]''</small></sup> 11:20, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-almost seems like a home made film. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:39, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
