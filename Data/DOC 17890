Title : I am Error
Text : [[File:I am Error.png|thumb|right|The original usage of the phrase in ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'']]
'''"I am Error"''' is a quote from the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] [[Video game|game]] ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''. The quote is spoken by a villager, apparently named Error, in the town of Ruto. In the original Japanese version of the game, the line is {{nihongo||オレノナハ エラー ダ...|Ore no na wa Erā da...}}, which translates to "My name is Error...".

The unlikely character name is widely believed to have been a programmer's in-joke, since the game also features a similar looking character named {{nihongo||バグ|Bagu}}, meaning [[software bug]]. In computing, a bug is a flaw in the programming code. Error and Bug are thus assumed to form a comical, in-universe parallel. In the English version, the name ''Erā'' was translated, but the name ''Bagu'' was not. Many gamers therefore missed the joke and variously believed the "I am Error" phrase to be a mistranslation, a misspelling, or an actual [[error message]].

The phrase has since become part of the NES folklore and became an early [[Internet meme]] around 2000. It has been referenced in a number of games, including ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'', ''[[Guacamelee!]]'' and ''[[Pony Island]]''

==Origin==
''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]'' was released in Japan on 14 January 1987, and internationally in late 1988. The player controls [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], who travels through Hyrule in his quest to rescue [[Princess Zelda]]. Early in the game, Link arrives in the town of Ruto, where he can enter a house inhabited by a bearded man with purple attire. If the player approaches him, he announces: "I AM ERROR."

Many puzzled gamers believed the cryptic phrase to be a translation mistake or a [[glitch]] within the game, but it is actually neither. The line is a correct English translation of the original Japanese text {{nihongo||オレノナハ エラー ダ...|Ore no na wa Erā da...}}, of which a more precise translation would be "My name is Error...".{{Refn | group=nb | Due to space considerations, the original Japanese version of this line was rendered in single-byte [[katakana]] rather than double-byte [[Shift JIS]] characters as would be expected for standard Japanese writing.}}<ref name="Mandelin">{{Cite web | first=Clyde | last=Mandelin | title=What’s up with The “I am Error” Guy in Zelda II? | url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/whats-up-with-the-i-am-error-guy-in-zelda-ii/ | work=Legends of Localization | date=2013-06-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113095058/https://legendsoflocalization.com/whats-up-with-the-i-am-error-guy-in-zelda-ii/ | archivedate=2018-01-13 | dead-url=no}}</ref> Initially, the character does not say anything else. However, when the player advances to the harbor town of Mido, a man there advises Link to "Ask Error of Ruto about the Palace". If the player then goes back to Error, he provides Link with a clue about how to gain access to the Island Palace, the game's third dungeon.

While no official explanation from Nintendo exists regarding the origin of the ''Erā''/Error character, his name is widely believed to have been an in-joke from the game's programmers. Aside from Error, the game also features a character named {{nihongo||バグ|Bagu}}, meaning "[[Software bug|&#91;software&#93; bug]]". ''Bagu''/Bug lives near Error, residing in a house hidden in a forest south of Ruto. The two characters look identical, except that Error wears a purple tunic, while Bug's tunic is red. It is therefore assumed that one of the developers named one character Error and another one Bug, so as having the two men form a humorous thematic connection within the game's universe.<ref name="Mandelin" /><ref name="Altice">{{Cite book | first=Nathan | last=Altice | title=I Am Error: The Nintendo Family Computer / Entertainment System Platform | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | series=Platform Studies | date=2015 | pages=1-2 | isbn=9780262328401}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media | title=Let's Play Zelda II #2 - I Am Error | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgPrbE0d18s | date=2013-05-29 | format=[[YouTube]] video | publisher=BaltisMC}} See 2:30 for Error and 6:34 for Bagu.</ref> When the game was translated to English, the name ''Erā'' was (correctly) translated to Error, but the name ''Bagu'' was not translated to Bug, leading ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' to conclude: "In reality, then, ''Bagu'' is the mistake, because his name was translated wrongly and should have been Bug.

Translator [[Clyde Mandelin]] wrote that the "I am Error" quote is often incorrectly believed to be a translation mistake, and is even considered "one of the biggest mistranslations of early NES games", even though it is not actually a mistranslation.<ref name="Mandelin" /> Another incorrect notion about Error is that his name is a typo and should have been Errol.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Aaron | last=Kaluszka | title=A Legacy of Personality: The Characters of the Legend of Zelda | url=https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/26431/a-legacy-of-personality-the-characters-of-the-legend-of-zelda-error-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link | work=Nintendo World Report | date=2011-05-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005303/https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/26431/a-legacy-of-personality-the-characters-of-the-legend-of-zelda-error-zelda-ii-the-adventure-of-link | archivedate=2014-05-02 | deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Gera2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/oddest_character_names_in_games.html|title=Oddest Character Names in Games|last=Gera|first=Emily|date=2010-12-16|work=VideoGamer.com|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050214/http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/oddest_character_names_in_games.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=27 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | author=Kyle | title=MAJORA’S MEMES – I AM ERROR | url=https://www.zeldadungeon.net/majoras-memes-i-am-error/ | work=Zelda Dungeon | date=2013-10-15 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112184829/https://www.zeldadungeon.net/majoras-memes-i-am-error/ | archivedate=2018-01-12 | deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Siliconera">{{Cite web | author=Spencer | title=Everyone’s favorite Zelda II error gets his own game | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2006/06/07/everyones-favorite-zelda-ii-error-gets-his-own-game/ | work=Siliconera | date=2006-06-07 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924101841/http://www.siliconera.com/2006/06/07/everyones-favorite-zelda-ii-error-gets-his-own-game/ | archivedate=2015-09-24 | deadurl=no}}</ref> The original Japanese text proves this wrong though.

==Legacy==
Around 2000, "I am Error" became an early [[Internet meme]]. According to [[Ben Huh]], founder of [[I Can Has Cheezburger?|Cheezburger Inc.]], the meme was inspired by the successful "[[All your base are belong to us]]" meme, which in turn inspired a number of memes based on '[[Engrish]]' quotes from old games, such as "A Winner is You" (from the NES game ''[[Pro Wrestling (NES video game)|Pro Wrestling]]'').<ref name="Ben_Huh" /> The "All your base" joke is believed to have sprung up in 1998 and surged in popularity in 2000-2001, giving some indication of when the "I am Error" meme must have originated.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Time Line - All Your Base Are Belong to Us | url=http://www.frogstar.com/content/time-line-all-your-base-are-belong-us | work=Frogstar.com | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118094714/http://www.frogstar.com:80/content/time-line-all-your-base-are-belong-us | archivedate=2010-02-23 | deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Despite being a minor [[Non-player character|NPC]], Error has become part of the NES folklore and has been mentioned in several media.
