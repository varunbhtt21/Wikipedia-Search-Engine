In a preview for the album by Rolling Stone, the song was explained as, "Until It's Gone" kicks off with the sort of warbling synth effect that was the group's calling card on their 2000 breakthrough debut, ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'', but builds into a brooding, textured gloom rocker that reminds listeners, via singer [[Chester Bennington]], that "[you] don't know what you've got until it's gone."<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-linkin-parks-heavy-new-album-we-need-to-weed-out-the-emo-20140410| title= Album preview by Rolling Stone}}</ref> In another preview by Loudwire the single is explained as "it's a more mid-tempo track with softer lyrics provided by Chester Bennington, who really shows his vocal versatility. The dreamy and atmospheric sounds are enough to whisk you away but Bennington brings you back down to earth as he belts out their take on a familiar chorus."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/early-preview-linkin-park-the-hunting-party/|title=Early Preview Linkin Park-The Hunting Party}}</ref> The song continues its outro into [[The Hunting Party (album)|''The Hunting Party'']]'s eighth track and fourth single, "[[Rebellion (Linkin Park song)|Rebellion]]" with [[System of a Down]] guitarist, [[Daron Malakian]].

== Background ==
Lyrically, the song is about a failed relationship lead vocalist [[Chester Bennington]] has been in. AltWire explains it as a "beginning with a synth line similar to '[[Numb (Linkin Park song)|Numb]]' from the 2003 album ''[[Meteora (album)|Meteora]]'', taking a sharp turn to an unexpected brooding goth rock anthem, proving to be one of the songs on the 6-track sampler of ''The Hunting Party'' in recent memory with a choir-like backing vocals and intense orchestral backdrops that stays and impacts after 'it's gone.'"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Oswald|first=Derek|title=AltWire Linkin Park The Hunting Party Early Impressions|url=http://www.altwire.net/2014/04/28/altwire-linkin-park-the-hunting-party-early-impressions/||accessdate=28 April 2014|publisher=AltWire}}</ref>

==Reception==
In a track-by-track review by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the song was given a positive response and explained as "So returns the warped sonar synth effect heard on hits like 'Numb', and while it arrives in the opening seconds amid a rush of heavy guitars, 'Until It's Gone' quickly turns into a philosophical electro-rock mood piece. The buildup of blips in the bridge hints at a coming bass drop, but then the guitars kick back in, and Bennington belts out his clichéd lyrics for the middle schoolers in the cheap seats who don't know any better."<ref>Partridge, Kenneth (6-18-2014)[http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6121623/linkin-park-the-hunting-party-track-by-track-review-mike-shinoda "Linkin Park's 'The Hunting Party': Track-by-Track Review"] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' June 18, 2014.
