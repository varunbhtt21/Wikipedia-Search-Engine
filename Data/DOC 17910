==History==

[[Image:Harriet Sweetwood Unique Photo.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Harriet Sweetwood, Co-Founder of Unique Photo.]]
The company started when Bernard and Harriet Sweetwood opened a small photographic supply outlet in [[Brooklyn]] in 1947. Soon after, they opened over 20 [[retail]] outlets in department stores across [[New Jersey]] and then the Hoboken Camera Center in the 1950s. In the 1980s, their two sons Jonathan and Matthew Sweetwood took over daily operations. On February 13, 2008, Unique Photo announced that their [[Florham Park, New Jersey]] location on Vreeland Road would be moving 8 miles away to the Fairfield, NJ superstore on Route 46 that exists today. The Fairfield, NJ superstore opened for business on February 18, 2008. Alexander Sweetwood is the third generation to join the company after graduating with an MBA from [[Montclair State University]].<ref name="g">[http://www.direporter.com/article/strategy-session-as-times-change-so-does-unique-photo/1 Strategy Session: As Times Change, So Does Unique Photo]</ref>  In October 2015, Alexander Sweetwood was named President of Unique Photo.<ref>{{cite news|title=Unique Photo names third-generation family member to run company|url=http://www.njbiz.com/article/20151016/NJBIZ01/151019839/unique-photo-names-thirdgeneration-family-member-to-run-company}}</ref>
