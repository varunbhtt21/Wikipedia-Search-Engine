'''John McCormick''' (August 17, 1893 â€“ May 3, 1961) was an American [[film producer]] associated with the [[Hollywood]] studio [[First National Pictures]]. Between 1923 and 1930, he was married to [[Colleen Moore]], one of the highest-paid and most popular stars of the [[silent era]]. McCormick initially was unconvinced by the development of [[sound films]] and vetoed Moore's appearing in them. He changed his mind in 1929 and placed Moore in her first talkie, ''[[Smiling Irish Eyes]]'', which was not a great success.<ref>Crafton p.278</ref> Their marriage was under increasing strain, and in 1930, the couple divorced.

His relationship with Moore is believed to have been the basis for the film ''[[What Price Hollywood?]]'' (1932).<ref>Crafton p.278</ref>
