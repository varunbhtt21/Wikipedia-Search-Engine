He was a respected [[missionary]], [[linguist]], translator and author of several books including, most notably, ''The Present State of the Greek Church in Russia'' (1816) and ''Russia or Miscellaneous Observations on the past and present state of that country and its inhabitants'' (1833).

==Biography==
In 1813 Pinkerton helped found the Russian Bible Society in [[St Petersburg]]; he then toured Germany (inc. [[Dresden]] especially) returning to Russia for three years before making a two-year missionary tour of Europe including Greece.<ref>From "An Analysis of the System of the Bible Society: Throughout Its Various Parts By Charles Stokes Dudley".</ref> Between 1823 and 1830 he lived in London with some of his family after which he moved to [[Frankfurt]] to take the post of Sole Agent for the BFBS in the German-speaking countries in Europe.<ref name=Anderson/>

In the 1820s Pinkerton found himself having to resolve his opinions of the conflicting views of the BFBS and those of [[Robert Haldane]] that came to be known as the [[Apocrypha Controversy]] and which resulted in a split and the formation of the [[Scottish Bible Society]].<ref>Mr. J.
