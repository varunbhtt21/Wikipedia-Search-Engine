==Plot==
Arjun Chaturvedi, a corrupt police officer is facing imprisonment on charges for a crime he actually never committed. His rivals, a powerful state minister, Vijendra and liquor mafia, Vishnu, trick him into an inescapable situation. The court is yet to decide Arjun's end. If he survives the case, he will be a dangerous threat to all his rivals. But his enemies who are well aware of Arjun's brutal rage, plan his death within the jail premises, but fail to kill him. Arjun goes into coma for a long period of time, wherein he recollects his entire past trying to untangle the mess he had created because of his desire.

The day, he picked up the college group and accused Jaysingh Rana, student to be a bootlegger. He misbehaves with Jia, a college student and loots her rich father, Hardeep Singh for holding an alcohol party at home. Arjun recollects the night when he was mocked at by the minister in front of everybody. He knew none of them have been clean players. He understood how the air of authority controls each and every being. He was betrayed by the people he had now served for a long time. He was left alone. Till now he was blinded by the money and the power if his uniform. He had nothing much to go back to; he was passing through a rough phase in his marriage too. The night he loses his control and shouts at his wife Shruti, is his anniversary that, he had completely forgotten. His heart broken, and on the verge of killing himself but there too he stood alone, defeated at the hands of courage. Finally when he decides to get up and apologise for his mistakes, destiny takes a vicious turn. The traumatizing day he felt his heart melt, the sight of hundreds of people ailing and crying around him slapped him hard. He was thrown into reality for the first time away from the cloud of materialism. He stood there shaken to his soul.

The people accused him for a tragedy of which he never knew about. A great trap swung on him, leaving him helpless. The bribes, the uncouth politician and the smart liquor mafia, all came back to him like a flash. He solves the mystifying puzzle, one by one, that had led him to this hospital bed. Now he knew exactly, how the game was flipped to trap him. Before the manipulative and deceitful politics could trap him again and kill him, Arjun wakes up from coma; this time more powerful and focused about his desire.
