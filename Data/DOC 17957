* '''Merge'''Definetly [[WP:TOOSOON]] as its not scheduled to happen until October 2014, also most likely [[WP:NOTE]], could quite happily be merged with [[Asian_Youth_Volleyball_Championship]] [[User:Amortias|Amortias]] ([[User talk:Amortias|T]])([[Special:Contributions/Amortias|C]]) 21:03, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Move to Draft:''' namespace until after the event, when it's likely to get the refs and be notable. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 21:33, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Per [[WP:CRYSTAL]], this regular international sporting event is almost certain to take place within five months. [[WP:TOOSOON]] is a bogus criterion here because not only is that a non-authoritative essay, it only covers biographies and films, not events.

*'''Keep''' An event that will take place and is notable, so no crystal. [[User:Kante4|Kante4]] ([[User talk:Kante4|talk]]) 17:47, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
