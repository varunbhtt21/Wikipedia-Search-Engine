==Reception==
''To Kill a Man'' received mostly positive reviews upon its premiere at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]].''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewer Guy Lodge, called "“To Kill a Man,” a grim, fat-free revenge thriller that extracts an impressive degree of moral equivocation from its exceedingly simple premise."<ref>{{cite web |title=Film Review: ‘To Kill a Man’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-to-kill-a-man-1201085026/|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

John DeFore in his review for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "A quiet drama that cares as much about familial alienation as getting away with murder."<ref>{{cite web |title=To Kill a Man: Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/kill-a-man-sundance-review-673772|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

Carlos Aguilar of ''[[Indiewire]]'' grade the film B+ by saying that "Chilean director Alejandro Fernandez Almendras' third feature "To Kill a Man" is a quietly powerful character study that meditates on the ramifications of a family man's choice to defend his kind."<ref>{{cite web |title=Sundance Review: A Father Is Transformed By The Remorseful Burden That Comes From Taking Human Life in 'To Kill a Man'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-a-father-is-transformed-by-the-remorseful-burden-that-comes-from-taking-a-human-life-in-to-kill-a-man|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

Lorri Vodi Rupard from ''[[TheGATE.ca|The GATE]]'' praised the film by saying that "The tonality of To Kill A Man is that of stark desperation, the subject matter weighty. Still, woven throughout Alejandro’s undertaking there’s tangible humor and pathos as if one is watching an unanimated rip-off of WB’s Roadrunner where Wile E. Coyote has found Jesus and is less emaciated after all these years but still can’t get his man."<ref>{{cite web |title=Sundance ’14 Review: ‘To Kill A Man’ by director Alejandro Fernandez Almendras|url=http://www.thegate.ca/reviews/020123/sundance-14-review-kill-man-director-alejandro-fernandez-almendras/|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

Chris Michael of ''[[theguardian.com|The Guardian]]'' gave the film four out of five stars by saying that "This meticulous film squeezes Jorge ever tighter in its grip as his contemptuous wife, his vulnerable daughter and, you feel, his own pride demand that he stand up for his family when the authorities can't kiss it better. A terrifically tense first half culminates in a truly brilliant scene featuring a car alarm used as a lure. The pace subsequently sags, but it all ends with a dramatic pop as sharp as the first of only two gunshots in this menacing, morally agnostic film."<ref>{{cite web |title=To Kill a Man – first look review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/28/to-kill-a-man-first-look-review|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>
