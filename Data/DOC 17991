:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/Pete Hampton]]

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]]: The hook is supported by a reliable source and interesting enough. As for the article... It's sourced with reliable publishers, with the exception of the ''Latin Times'', which I'll need you to substitute as it isn't an RS, I think; its readable prose size meets the criteria and contains no close paraphrasing, copyvios or original research. The subject covered (in this case being a recent song) has broad and neutral coverage, whereas the article was created three days ago thus being eligible for a DYK feature. All's fine regarding the article and hook themselves, however you do need to submit a review to fulfill the QPQ parameter (you have passed 5 DYKs). <small><b>[[User:Prism|<span style="color:#D9E312">prism</span>]]</b></small><sup><small>[[User talk:Prism|<span style="color:#000000"><b>△</b></span>]]</small></sup> 17:34, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
