Title : 2014 NACRA Rugby Championship
Text : The '''2014 NACRA Rugby Championship''', the seventh edition of the [[NACRA Rugby Championship]], was a [[rugby union]] championship for Tier 3 North American and Caribbean teams. Pool play took place between 10 May and 28 June. A championship game followed in June, with Guyana defeating USA South in extra time. Mexico was promoted to the North Championship, with Bermuda moving down, due to the latter's inability to organize the promotion/relegation match. In the South division, Barbados defeated Curaçao to remain in the Championship.

The championship is split between North and South zones, which each have a three-team Championship and four-team Cup. The winner of each Championship play for the final, championship game, and a promotion/relegation game is played in each zone, between the winner of the Cup, and the last place team of the Championship.

Competition points are different from [[Rugby union bonus points system|most rugby union tournaments]]: Two points are awarded for a win, one for a draw. There are also bonus points for scoring four tries and for losing within a margin of 7 points or less.<ref name='fixtures'>[http://www.nacrugby.com/fixtures.html "Fixtures"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514135828/http://www.nacrugby.com/fixtures.html |date=May 14, 2014 }}.
