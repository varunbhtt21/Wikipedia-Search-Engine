'''[[Thomas Ellison]]''' ({{circa|1867}} – 1904) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] player. After being educated at [[Te Aute College]], where he was introduced to rugby, Ellison moved to [[Wellington]], and played for the Poneke Football Club. He was subsequently selected to represent [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington province]], and was later recruited into [[Joe Warbrick]]'s privately organised [[1888–89 New Zealand Native football team]]. Ellison scored 113 points and 43 [[try|tries]] on their epic 107-match tour of the British Isles, Australia and New Zealand. On his return he continued with Poneke and Wellington, and from 1892 started to refine and popularise the wing-forward system of play, which was a vital element of New Zealand rugby's style until 1932. At the first [[New Zealand Rugby Union|New Zealand Rugby Football Union]] annual general meeting in 1893, he proposed that the playing colours of the New Zealand side should be predominantly black with a silver fern—a playing strip that inspired the team’s name of ''All Blacks''. That year he captained the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] side on their [[1893 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia|tour]] of Australia. He retired from playing afterwards, but continued as a coach and administrator. Ellison was the author of a coaching manual, ''The Art of Rugby Football'', published in 1902. {{TFAFULL|Thomas Ellison}}
