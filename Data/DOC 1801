*'''Delete''' as non notable and promotional; but the nomination does not make sense--why is "old information" a reason for deletion rather than improvement? '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 22:38, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' The nominator, NickyNik, is also the author of the article (and an SPA). There have been no other significant contributors to the article. Would this qualify for speedy deletion under [[WP:G7]]? --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 03:14, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
