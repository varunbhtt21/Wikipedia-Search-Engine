==History==
The party was established in October 1990 by expatriate Malians living in [[Gabon]],<ref name=HD>Pascal James Imperato & Gavin H.

In the [[Malian presidential election, 1992|presidential elections]] later in the year it nominated Almamy Sylla as its candidate. Sylla finished fourth with 9.4% of the vote.

Sylla was the party's presidential candidate again in the [[Malian presidential election, 1997|1997 elections]], but received only 1% of the vote. The party then boycotted the [[Malian parliamentary election, July 1997|July 1997 parliamentary elections]] following the annulment of the [[Malian parliamentary election, April 1997|April elections]],<ref>[http://africanelections.tripod.com/ml.html Elections in Mali] African Elections Database</ref> in which it had received 2% of the vote. The boycott led to a split in the party, with moderates breaking away to form the [[National Rally for Democracy (Mali)|National Rally for Democracy]], which did run in the elections, winning one seat.

The [[Malian presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential elections]] saw Sylla run again, but his vote share was reduced to 0.6%.
