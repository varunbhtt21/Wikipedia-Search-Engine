The '''National Academy of Science and Technology''' (''abbreviated as '''''NAST''') is the highest recognition and scientific advisory body of the [[Philippines]] under the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]]. It was created through Presidential Decree 1003-A issued by President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] in 1976 to honor and recognize Filipino scientists who made worthy contributions in the advancement of science and technology in the country.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Science and Technology 1: General Science|last = Rabago|first = Lilia|publisher = Vibal Publishing House, Inc.|year = 1989|isbn = 971-07-0860-0|location = Quezon City|pages = 15|last2 = Intong|first2 = Mona Lisa|last3 = Ferrer|first3 = Diana|last4 = Joaquin|first4 = Cresencia}}</ref> It also recommends individuals to be conferred the Order of [[National Scientist of the Philippines|National Scientist]] upon approval of the [[President of the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sabillo|first1=Kristine Angeli|title=Who are the 4 new National Scientists of PH?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/628386/aquino-confers-awards-on-four-new-national-scientists|website=Inquirer.net|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
The establishment of the National Academy of Science and Technology was a proposal of several professors from the [[University of the Philippines]]. It was endorsed by the National Science Development Board (now [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]]) to the [[President of the Philippines]]. NAST was created through Presidential Decree 1003-A issued by President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] in October 6, 1976.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2013|title=NAST 2013 35th Scientific Meeting Conference Proceedings|url=http://www.nast.ph/images/pdf%20files/Publications/ASM/NAST%202013%2035th%20Annual%20Scientific%20Meeting.pdf|format=PDF|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=|via=}}</ref> In 1978, President Marcos named the first ten members of the academy from members of the scientific community with three of them proclaimed as ''National Scientist'', namely: Juan S. Salcedo, Jr., Alfredo C. Santos and Gregorio Y. Zara. Through Executive Order 818 in 1982, the academy was tasked to give recommendations to the [[President of the Philippines|President of the Republic of the Philippines]] and the Cabinet on policies concerning science and technology in the country.

== Mandates ==
The National Academy of Science and Technology is mandated:
# To recognize outstanding achievements in science and technology as well as provide meaningful incentives to those engaged in scientific and technological researches
# To advise the President and the Cabinet on matters related to science and technology
# To engage in projects and programs designed to recognize outstanding achievements in science and to promote scientific productivity
# To embark on programs traditionally and internationally expected of an academy of science
# To manage, operate and maintain the Philippine Science Heritage Center

== Functions ==
The Academy's function is divided into three components namely, advisory, recognition and scientific Linkages.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nast.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10|title = Functions of the National Academy of Science and Technology|date = |accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = |publisher = National Academy of Science and Technology|last = |first = }}</ref>
* Recognition: As a highest government recognition body, it recognizes and supports works of different Filipino scientist that promotes advancement of science and encourages the youth to pursue science related careers. 
* Advisory: As an advisory body, it brings science closer to the people through awareness, promotes  public participation on science issues and advises the government and non-government entities on science-related policies
*Scientific Linkages: NAST communicates with other scientist inside and outside the country to promote collaboration and exchange of works, knowledge and participation.

== Organization and Membership ==
Members of the National Academy of Science and Technology are nominated by members of the scientific community. Current NAST members deliberate on the membership of an individual following strict rules and regulations.<ref name=":0" /> Once admitted to the organization, members are called ''Academicians ''(''abbreviated as ''Acd.)''. ''The academy is divided into several divisions to which an academician is a member depending on his area of expertise. The following divisions are:
# Agricultural Sciences
# Biological Sciences
# Engineering Sciences and Technology
# Health Sciences
# Mathematical and Physical Sciences
# Social Sciences
From each division of the academy, a chair is elected to form the Executive Council. A president, vice-president and secretary is elected from the Executive Council. The secretariat of NAST is headed by an executive director which implements the decisions of the Executive Council, and attends to the day-to-day affairs of the Academy. 
Since 2012,  the NAST Executive Council is composed of:<ref name=":0" />
* Acd. William G. Padolina, ''President''
*  Acd. Fabian M. Dayrit, ''Vice-President and Chair, Mathematical and Physical Sciences''
* Acd. Jaime C. Montoya, ''Secretary and Chair, Health Sciences''
* Acd. Rhodora V. Azanza, ''Chair, Biological Sciences''
* Acd. Reynaldo B. Vea, ''Chair, Engineering Sciences and Technology''
* Acd. Eufemio T. Rasco, ''Chair, Agricultural Sciences''
* Mrs. Luningning E. Samarita, ''Executive Director IV''
