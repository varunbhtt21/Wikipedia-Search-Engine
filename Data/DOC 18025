article claims this is a major prize but don't see any mainstream coverage. The fact that it was downgraded to bi annual awards and awards a mere $1500 does not make it major. [[User:LibStar|LibStar]] ([[User talk:LibStar|talk]]) 12:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Weak keep'''. Mentioned on Pen American page. [http://www.pen.org/grants-and-awards/barnard-college-women-poets-prize]. No other significant web coverage I can see, but a number of Google Book mentions suggest notability. I don't have time to investigate whether they are in passing or not, but at least they seem numerous (100+). --<sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 11:21, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''<s>Delete''' per lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. Smallish prize.  Notable judges is not enough.</s> [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:26, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
::Revising to '''Weak Keep''' per some evidence of significance even though there is essentially no coverage in reliable independent sources. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 00:30, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''.  Poetry prizes are not an easy category to fit into notability standards because the world of poetry is so insular and nonremunerative (I would suggest that $1500 is actually not such a bad amount given the world in which poets operate) and there are a lot of awards; and yet I don't think it benefits our encyclopedia—or the broader cause of literacy—to impose particularly tough standards on legitimate awards.  Operating under that philosophy, I find it relevant that (1) this prize is often noted as a significant credential in biographical sketches of poets who've won it (see e.g. [https://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q=%22Barnard+Women+Poets+Prize%22][https://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22Barnard+New+Women+Poets+Prize%22&num=50][http://www.highbeam.com/Search?searchTerm=%26quot%3BBarnard%20New%20Women%20Poets%20Prize%26quot%3B][http://www.highbeam.com/Search?searchTerm=%26quot%3BBarnard%20Women%20Poets%20Prize%26quot%3B]); (2) the creation of the second version of this award was covered (albeit concisely) in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/11/nyregion/bulletin-board-the-second-book-of-poetry.html]; and (3) a 2000 ''[[Chicago Review]]'' essay criticizing the perceived plethora of poetry awards says this: "There are first-book awards of notable integrity, derived mostly from a judicious selection of judges. Though its winners occasionally leave me cold, the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition|Yale Series of Younger Poets]] competition has an impressive track record. More recently, the Barnard New Women Poets Prize has proved exciting: in 1997 [[Brenda Hillman]] chose [[Larissa Szporluk]]'s Dark Sky Question, in 1998 [[Lyn Hejinian]] chose [[Jena Osman]]'s The Character, and last year [[Heather McHugh]] selected [[Christine Hume]]'s Musca Domestica. In such cases, first-book competitions can function as a barometer of interesting new writing." --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 23:45, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:: "this prize is often noted as a significant credential in biographical sketches of poets who've won it". they are all one line mentions, and biographical sketches are not sources which cover this prize as the subject. I don't see this really adding to notability. if there is significant coverage where this prize is the actual subject of sources then that would establish notability.

:::'''Question''' Is the prize now every other year? Also, it notes a second prize for a poet's seond book intiated in 2003. As that a different prize or what this one became? Where are those winners? I find the article confusing. I also don't understand the responsible for 16 debut books part. What does that part mean? I may have mucked it up so perhaps view the original way it was written in the history, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

::::I've made some edits and I hope it's clearer now.  This was originally the Barnard New Women Poets Prize, a prize for a first book. The winner had their book published under the auspices of the award; there were 16 of those from 1986 to 2001.  As the 2003 ''[[New York Times]]'' article reported, in that year they decided to drop the "New" from the award name and make it a prize for a ''second'' book.[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/11/nyregion/bulletin-board-the-second-book-of-poetry.html]  Since 2007 the prize has been awarded every other year; the "Women Poets" page at barnard.edu lists the winners up to 2009 [https://english.barnard.edu/women-poets]; there are separate pages for the two most recent winners. [http://barnard.edu/headlines/traci-brimhall-awarded-barnard-women-poets-prize][http://barnard.edu/news/sandra-lim-awarded-2013-barnard-women-poets-prize].  The judges make up a pretty impressive group: [[Louise Glück]], [[Carolyn Forché]], [[Joy Harjo]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Adrienne Rich]], etc. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 01:27, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Thanks. Getting clearer. Can the table be sectioned with titles of the original and more recent prize titles? One table seems to suggest a continuity that is not accurate since the name and scope of the prize changed significantly (if I understand correctly).

*'''Keep''', (ec) (ec) especially per LibStar above.  $1500 is indeed actually significant relatively for dollar values associated with poetry prizes methinks, and there are smaller dollar amount awards that are really quite prestigious, where the importance is not measured in dollars, by gove.  And if it is now biannual, then it must be even harder now to receive this award, it is ever rarer and must be going up in overall value, yes, love.  :)  --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 01:30, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:: "And if it is now biannual, then it must be even harder now to receive this award, it is ever rarer and must be going up in overall value" maybe it's biannual because of a lack of funding and resourcing to coordinate the awards, something isn't necessarily more notable because it's less frequent.

*'''Comment'''.  Note the article contains a list of numerous winners of the Barnard Women Poets Prize, about 20 of them individually notable (having Wikipedia articles), and would be valid as a list-article alone.  It would not help to delete this article only to have a valid, separate list-article created as a valid complement (per [[wp:CLT]]) to the sensible category of same.  I !voted Keep already. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 14:21, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
