Hannon comes from a family with a long tradition of horse training. Both his father, Richard, and grandfather, Harry, were also trainers. In his younger days, he spent time learning his trade at top stables in Australia, before returning to England to be his father's assistant,<ref name=RHJrBiog/> just like his father had been his grandfather's assistant before the elder man's retirement in 1970.<ref name=RHSrBiog/> He served as his father's assistant for twelve years.<ref name=RHJrBiog/>

During his time as assistant, the yard was highly successful, his father winning three trainers' championships in four years, thanks to the success of horses like 2013 [[1,000 Guineas]] winner, [[Sky Lantern (horse)|Sky Lantern]], [[Sussex Stakes]] winner, [[Toronado (racehorse)|Toronado]], and [[Canford Cliffs (horse)|Canford Cliffs]], winner of five [[Group One]] races before his retirement in 2011. He was instrumental in bringing in new owners to the yard including [[Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Sheikh Hamdan]], [[Andrew Tinkler]], Sir Robert Ogden, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] and [[House of Thani|Sheikh Fahad Al Thani]].<ref name=RHJrBiog/> It was announced at the end of November 2013 that he would take over the running of the stable from his father with effect from 1 January 2014.<ref name=Armytage131121/><ref name=BBC131121/>

His first runner in his own right was an unraced three-year-old called Unscripted in a seven [[furlong]] [[maiden race]] at [[Wolverhampton Racecourse|Wolverhampton]] on 3 January 2014.<ref name=Brodkin140102/> The horse duly won by 10 lengths as the [[odds|2/1 favourite]], ridden by Sean Levey.<ref name=Cook140104/>

He currently has 240 horses in training, including [[Toormore]], [[Toronado (racehorse)|Toronado]], [[Olympic Glory]] and [[Sky Lantern (horse)|Sky Lantern]], all of whom won big races for his father.<ref name=Cook140104/> Toormore gave him his first big race victory when winning the [[Group races|Group 3]] [[Craven Stakes]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]<ref name=BBC140417/> and went into the 2014 [[2,000 Guineas]] as one of the leading fancies. It was in fact the stable's second string [[Night of Thunder (horse)|Night of Thunder]], ridden by [[Kieren Fallon]], that won the race, despite lurching wildly as the post approached. This gave Hannon his first [[British Classic Races|Classic]] victory as a trainer in his own right.<ref name=BBC140503/>

His brother-in-law [[Richard Hughes (jockey)|Richard Hughes]] is the stable jockey.

==Personal life==
