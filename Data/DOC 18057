Title : TimedText:Constant Motion.ogg.en.srt
Text : Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more into the night blistering

Focus here, focus there
Cannot see the light
Falling down through the night
Sprawling everywhere

Searching left, searching right
Panic setting in
I can no longer fight
When will this end?

Accelerate, dislocate
Set to crash and burn
Haven't got time to waste
