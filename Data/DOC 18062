==Background==
The musical is based on the 1994 film ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'', which had a screenplay by [[Woody Allen]] and [[Douglas McGrath]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/06/woody-allen-bullets-over-broadway-mia-farrow-abuse-allegation | title=The backstage dramas behind Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway musical | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | work=theguardian.com | date=April 6, 2014 | accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> Work on a musical version of ''Bullets'' started in 2000, with [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Craig Carnelia]] writing the music and Allen writing the book. In 2003, Hamlisch confirmed that work on the musical was proceeding.<ref>[[Simonson, Robert]]. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/80729-Work-Continues-of-Musical-Version-of-Bullets-Over-Broadway Work Continues of Musical Version of ''Bullets Over Broadway'' "] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224142919/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/80729-Work-Continues-of-Musical-Version-of-Bullets-Over-Broadway |date=December 24, 2013 }}, playbill.com, July 17, 2003</ref>

In an interview on the opening night of the musical in April 2014, Allen said that he had resisted turning the film into a musical for years, having no interest in it as a musical. However, his sister Letty Aronson thought that it could be done as a period musical, and Allen then became interested. Marvin Hamlisch had played a few of the new songs for Allen, but Allen did not think they were right for the musical. His sister then proposed the idea of using songs of the 1920s, "and it suddenly came to life." Susan Stroman was brought into the creative team two years before the opening.<ref>Haun, Harry.

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
In 1929, playwright David Shayne is finally getting his first play ''God of Our Fathers'' produced on Broadway. The producer, Julian Marx, has enlisted the wealthy gangster Nick Valenti to pay for the show. Valenti wants to have his dim-witted and untalented girlfriend, Olive Neal, star as one of the leads. Valenti has assigned his strong-arm gangster Cheech to watch over Olive.  Surprisingly, Cheech comes up with great ideas for improving the play.  However, aging diva Helen Sinclair, the real star of the show, romances the younger David, who already has a girlfriend, Ellen. Meanwhile, the leading man, Warner Purcell, has his eye on Olive.

==Critical reception==
According to ''Stagegrade'', the reviews were mixed, with some praising ("fun, beautiful musical") and some panning ("charm-free") the musical.  The latter especially criticized the use of existing songs rather than having an original score. They conclude that this "may be among the most polarizing shows of the current season."<ref>Chaffa, M. [http://stagegrade.com/productions/1403# "Critical Snapshot"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502210054/http://stagegrade.com/productions/1403%23 |date=May 2, 2014 }}, stagegrade.com, accessed May 2, 2014</ref>
 
[[Ben Brantley]] in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called the musical "occasionally funny but mostly just loud."<ref>Brantley, Ben. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/theater/woody-allen-transforms-his-bullets-over-broadway.html?_r=0# "Woody Allen Transforms His 'Bullets Over Broadway'"], ''The New York Times'', April 10, 2014</ref> Elysa Gardner, in her review for ''[[USA Today]]'', commented that the musical has "playful wit and exuberance" and wrote that "'Bullets' offers as much sheer, shameless fun as any show you'll see this season."<ref>Gardner, Elysa. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/theater/2014/04/10/broadway-review-bullets-over-broadway/7412981/ " 'Bullets Over Broadway' a sheer, shameless good time"], ''USA Today'', April 10, 2014</ref>

Alexis Soloski, reviewing for ''The Guardian'', praised the way Stroman tells the plot through her choreography and especially noted the staging for Ashmanskas ("lumbering jetés"), Yorke ("brassy thrusts') and the tap numbers for the male ensemble. However, she found that the songs were not well integrated into the story.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/11/bullets-over-broadway-musical-review-woody-allen-new-york | title=Woody Allen musical opens with a bang | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | work=theguardian.com | date=April 11, 2014 | accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref><!--
