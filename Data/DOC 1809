The '''''Squalo''-class submarines''' were a group of four [[submarine]]s built for the [[Royal Italian Navy]] (''Regia Marina'') during the 1930s. They were built at the [[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico]] (CRDA) shipyard at [[Monfalcone]], and designed by Curio Bernardis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.regiamarina.net/ship_info.asp?class=Squalo&nid=157&lid=1 | title=Early Bernardis: Squalo class | work=regiamarina.net | accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

==Design and description==
The ''Squalo''-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding {{sclass-|Bandiera|submarine|4}}. They shared that design's problems with [[Ship stability|stability]] and [[seakeeping]] and required the same modifications to rectify the problems. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|920|t|LT|sp=us}} surfaced and {{convert|1125|t|LT|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|69.8|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|7.21|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.19|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref name=c5>Chesneau, p. 308</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|1500|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|650|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|15.1|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the ''Squalo'' class had a range of {{convert|5650|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}}, submerged, they had a range of {{convert|100|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|3|kn}}.<ref name=b4>Bagnasco, p. 144</ref>

The boats were armed with eight internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four each in the bow and stern. They carried a total of a dozen [[torpedo]]es. They were also armed with one [[Cannon 102/35 Model 1914|{{Convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on}}/35]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] machine guns.<ref name=c5/>
