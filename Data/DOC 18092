{{see also|Government of Washington (state)}}

The [[Constitution of Washington]] is the foremost source of state law. Legislation is enacted by the [[Washington State Legislature]], published in the ''[[Laws of Washington]]'', and codified in the ''[[Revised Code of Washington]]''. State agency regulations (sometimes called administrative law) are published in the ''[[Washington State Register]]'' and codified in the ''[[Washington Administrative Code]]''. Washington's legal system is based on [[common law]], which is interpreted by case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which are published in the ''[[Washington Reports]]'' and ''[[Washington Appellate Reports]]'', respectively. Counties, cities, and towns may also promulgate [[local ordinance]]s.

===Constitution===
The foremost source of state law is the [[Constitution of Washington]]. The Washington Constitution in turn is subordinate to the [[Constitution of the United States]], which is the supreme law of the land.

===Legislation===
Pursuant to the state constitution, the [[Washington State Legislature]] has enacted [[legislation]]. Its [[session laws]] are published in the ''[[Laws of Washington]]'', which in turn have been [[codification (law)|codified]], compiled, and/or consolidated in the ''[[Revised Code of Washington]]'' (RCW).<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington Laws, Legislation & the Legislature |publisher=[[University of Washington School of Law]] |date=5 June 2013 |url=https://lib.law.washington.edu/content/guides/WALaws |accessdate=22 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524003925/https://lib.law.washington.edu/content/guides/WALaws |archivedate=24 May 2014 |df= }}</ref> Both are published by the [[Washington State Statute Law Committee]] and the [[Washington State Code Reviser]] which it employs and supervises.<ref>RCW 1.08.015; Chapter 44.20 RCW.</ref><ref name=code-reviser>{{cite web|title=Office of the Code Reviser|publisher=[[Washington State Legislative Service Center]]|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/default.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>

===Regulations===
[[File:Washington_State_Register.png|thumb|right|The ''[[Washington State Register]]'' is the official [[government gazette]].]]

Pursuant to certain statutes, state agencies have promulgated [[regulation]]s, also known as [[administrative law]]. The ''[[Washington State Register]]'' (WSR) is a biweekly publication that includes notices of proposed and expedited rules, emergency and permanently adopted rules, public meetings, requests for public input, notices of rules review, executive orders of the Governor, court rules, summary of attorney general opinions, juvenile disposition standards, and the state maximum interest rate.<ref name=uw-rules>{{cite web|title=Washington State Administrative Law Research |publisher=[[University of Washington School of Law]] |date=9 January 2013 |url=https://lib.law.washington.edu/content/guides/WArules |accessdate=22 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524003816/https://lib.law.washington.edu/content/guides/WArules |archivedate=24 May 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref name=laws-rules>{{cite web|title=Laws and Agency Rules|publisher=[[Washington State Legislative Service Center]]|url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/lawsandagencyrules/Pages/default.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> The ''[[Washington Administrative Code]]'' (WAC) codifies or compiles the regulations and arranges them by subject or agency, and is updated twice a month.<ref name=uw-rules/><ref name=laws-rules/> There are also many agencies with quasi-judicial authority to hold hearings and make decisions.<ref name=uw-rules/> The ''Washington State Register'' is published by the Statute Law Committee,<ref>RCW 1.08.110</ref> and the ''Washington Administrative Code'' is compiled and published under the authority of its Code Reviser.<ref>RCW 34.05.210</ref><ref name=code-reviser/>

===Case law===
The legal system of Washington is based on the [[common law]]. Like all U.S. states except [[Louisiana]], Washington has a [[reception statute]] providing for the "reception" of [[English law]]. All statutes, regulations, and ordinances are subject to [[judicial review]]. Pursuant to common law tradition, the courts of Washington have developed a large body of [[case law]] through the [[legal opinion|decisions]] of the [[Washington Supreme Court]] and [[Washington Court of Appeals]].

The decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals are published in the ''[[Washington Reports]]'' and ''[[Washington Appellate Reports]]'', respectively.<ref name=uw-reporters>{{cite web|title=Reporters & Digests|publisher=[[University of Washington School of Law]]|date=7 November 2013|url=https://lib.law.washington.edu/ref/repdig.html|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> Both are published by [[LexisNexis]], while [[slip opinion]]s are published on the Internet.<ref name=reporter>{{cite web|title=Office of Reporter of Decisions|publisher=[[Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts]]|url=http://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/supreme/?fa=atc_supreme.reporter|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> The Reporter of Decisions is the constitutional officer of the Supreme Court that prepares the decisions and opinions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for publication in the official court reports.<ref name=reporter/> Cases from Washington appellate courts are also reported in the unofficial ''[[Pacific Reporter]]''.<ref name=uw-reporters/> From 1854 to 1889, opinions of the territorial Supreme Court were published in the three volumes of the ''Washington Territory Reports''.<ref name=reporter/>

===Local ordinances===
The legislative bodies of counties, cities, and towns may adopt ordinances, resolutions, rules, regulations, motions, and orders, violations of which are punishable by a maximum of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, or for a gross misdemeanor one year in jail and a $5,000 fine.<ref name=ordinances/><ref name=public-safety>{{cite web|title=MRSC Inquiries - Public Safety|publisher=[[Municipal Research and Services Center]]|url=http://www.mrsc.org/askmrsc/pastinqsubject.aspx?sid=31|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> Alternatively, a legislative body may make an offense a civil infraction, but no city or county may establish a civil penalty for an act that constitutes a crime under state law, nor may it establish a different criminal punishment than that provided by state law for the same act.<ref name=ordinances/><ref name=public-safety/> The power of the public to initiate ordinances by petition and to have enacted ordinances referred to the voters are only available in first class cities, code cities, cities or towns organized under the commission plan of government, and home rule counties.<ref name=ordinances>{{cite book|title=Local Ordinances for Washington Cities and Counties|year=2000|publisher=[[Municipal Research and Services Center]]|url=http://www.mrsc.org/publications/ordinances.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722185430/http://www.mrsc.org/publications/ordinances.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-22|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Initiative and Referendum Guide for Washington City and Charter Counties|year=2006|publisher=[[Municipal Research and Services Center]]|url=http://www.mrsc.org/publications/irg06.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703064339/https://www.mrsc.org/publications/irg06.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-03|df=}}</ref>

All cities and towns are required to publish every ordinance in their official newspaper, although in lieu of publishing an entire ordinance a city or town may publish a summary.<ref name=ordinances/> Counties must provide advance notice of proposed police or sanitary regulations prior to adoption by the legislative body, and the notice may either set out a copy of the regulation or summarize its content.<ref name=ordinances/>
