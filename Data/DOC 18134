Kickerillo agreed to purchase half of the home sites in the tract to develop houses.<ref name=BivinsAcquires/> Development began in 1995.<ref name=SuebaUSA/> By 1996 Kickerillo agreed to spend $60 million to purchase all of the homesites within the subdivision. Construction in Lakes of Parkway, built on the Barnhart tract, began in 1996. That year, Bivins wrote that Lakes on Parkway was "one of the largest upscale communities to be started inside the Houston city limits in years."<ref name=BivinsKickerstart/>

Peggy O'Hare of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote that in 2002, when adult entertainment businessperson Evan Howard Loewenstein moved to Lakes of Parkway, "he immediately drew attention" by installing security equipment and materials at his house and having a frequent entourage.<ref name=OHare/> Residents complained to the homeowners association because many cars were parked in front of the house, while they were required to be in the driveway.<ref name=OHare/> On May 12, 2005, federal agents and [[Houston Police Department]] (HPD) [[SWAT]] officers served a search warrant and arrested Loewenstein and his ex-wife, and a bank bought the foreclosed house for $700,000 (${{inflation|USD|700000|2005|r=2}} when adjusted for inflation) at an auction in June 2005.<ref name=OHare/>

Development of new houses in Lakes of Parkway ended in 2009.<ref name=SuebaUSA/>

The plans for Lakes on Parkway stated that there would be 800 custom-built houses.<ref name=BivinsKickerstart/> For beautification reasons and for increasing drainage capabilities,<ref name=BivinsAcquires/> plans included building seven lakes,<ref name=BivinsKickerstart/> placing them on {{convert|50|acre|ha}} of the community's land.<ref name=BivinsAcquires/>
