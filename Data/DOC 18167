It was agreed that she would start an order of sisters to be known as the [[Community of the Resurrection of our Lord]] (not to be confused with the [[Community of the Resurrection]]). She was clothed as a novice on St. Mark’s Day, 25 April 1884, and made her final profession on 14 November 1887. Isherwood became the mother superior of the order and was styled Mother Cecile CR.
