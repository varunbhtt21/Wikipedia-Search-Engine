'''''Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital''''' is a 2013 [[non-fiction]] book by the American journalist [[Sheri Fink]]. The book details the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] at [[Ochsner Baptist Medical Center|Memorial Medical Center]] in [[New Orleans]] in August 2005, and is an expansion of a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning article written by Fink and published in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as thousands of people were trapped in the hospital without power. The [[triage]] system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and it was later alleged that a number of these patients were [[euthanasia|euthanized]] by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for non-fiction.

The book was set to be the basis of the third season of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology [[true crime]] series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' before being scrapped.<ref>http://deadline.com/2017/08/ryan-murphy-katrina-based-on-five-days-at-memorial-book-scott-rudin-producer-sarah-paulson-star-1202146468/ </ref>

==Background==
''Five Days at Memorial'' originated as a 13,000-word magazine article titled "The Deadly Choices at Memorial", published by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in August 2009, the fourth anniversary of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=artsbeat>{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/life-and-death-in-new-orleans-sheri-fink-talks-about-five-days-at-memorial/|title=Life and Death in New Orleans: Sheri Fink Talks About 'Five Days at Memorial'|first=John|last=Williams|date=September 20, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=propublica>{{cite press release|url=https://www.propublica.org/awards/item/pulitzer-prize-in-investigative-reporting-deadly-choices-at-memorial/|title=Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting: Deadly Choices at Memorial|publisher=[[ProPublica]]|year=2010|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> The story focused on the events that unfolded in [[New Orleans]]' Memorial Medical Center (now [[Ochsner Baptist Medical Center]]) when the hospital was flooded and its generators failed in the aftermath of Katrina, drawing particular attention to the [[euthanasia]] of numerous patients by the medical and nursing staff.<ref name=propublica/> Fink was drawn to the subject matter because of her experience as a doctor working in areas of conflict and as a journalist reporting on hospitals in war zones.<ref name=propublica/><ref name=csmon>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2013/0910/Interview-with-Sheri-Fink-author-of-Five-Days-At-Memorial|title=Interview with Sheri Fink, author of 'Five Days At Memorial'|date=September 10, 2013|first=Marjorie|last=Kehe|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> The article, which was a joint assignment for [[ProPublica]] and ''The New York Times Magazine'',<ref name=boston>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/09/14/review-five-days-memorial-life-and-death-storm-ravaged-hospital-sheri-fink/igU8SfpYuPOPoZWCQq1HZI/story.html|title='Five Days at Memorial' by Sheri Fink|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Julia M.|last=Klein|date=September 14, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> drew on two years' worth of research and interviews with 140 people and won the 2009 [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]].<ref name=propublica/>

While she was writing "The Deadly Choices at Memorial", Fink decided to expand the article into a book. Since she "kept finding out new facts and trying to fit them into the story because they seemed essential", she was encouraged by her editor to save the extra material to publish in a book.<ref name=artsbeat/> Expanding on her original research, Fink conducted over 500 interviews with people who were at the hospital during the disaster, families of the dead patients, hospital executives, law enforcement officials and ethicists;<ref name=times>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/books/review/sheri-finks-five-days-at-memorial.html?pagewanted=2|date=September 5, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Sherwin B.|last=Nuland|title=Critical Conditions|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> she wished to interview Dr. Anna Pou, one of the principal characters of the story, about the allegations of euthanasia but Pou refused based on her lawyer's advice.<ref name=artsbeat/> Fink said that while "some of the medical and nursing professionals were observing a code of silence", she was impressed by the openness of several staff members, including two doctors who talked freely of their decision to euthanize their patients.<ref name=artsbeat/> Fink also reviewed photographs, videos, emails and diary entries produced at the time, and consulted weather reports and the hospital's floor plans.<ref name=artsbeat/>

The book is divided into two parts. The first part, titled "Deadly Choices", focuses on the events that occurred at Memorial Medical Center over the "five days" referred to in the book's title: August 28 – September 1, 2005.<ref name=berry>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/04/books/five-days-at-memorial-by-sheri-fink.html|title=Harrowing Questions, and Ethics, During Katrina|date=September 3, 2013|first=Jason|last=Berry|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> During these five days, Memorial's emergency plans proved inadequate as the hospital lost power and its back-up generators had failed, leaving it without lights, air conditioning, sewer systems and essential medical equipment.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/10654131/Five-Days-at-Memorial-Life-and-Death-in-a-Storm-Ravaged-Hospital-by-Sheri-Fink-review.html|title=Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital, by Sheri Fink, review|date=February 25, 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Lewis|last=Jones|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=seattle>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/books/2021755690_fivedaysmemoriaxml.html|title='Five Days at Memorial': 45 patient deaths in Katrina's wake|first=John B.|last=Saul|date=September 8, 2013|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> Thousands of staff, patients and evacuees were trapped by floodwaters inside the building awaiting evacuation by boat or helicopter.<ref name=independent>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/five-days-at-memorial-by-sheri-fink-book-review-9112823.html|title=Five Days at Memorial by Sheri Fink: Book review|date=February 7, 2014|first=Hirsh|last=Sawhney|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> Fink describes the unconventional method of [[triage]] adopted by the medical staff, whereby ambulatory patients were prioritized for evacuation and those with "[[do not resuscitate]]" orders were placed last in the list.<ref name=telegraph/> Patient evacuation began on the third day and progressed slowly until the fifth day, when some medical staff decided to hasten the deaths of critically ill patients, believing they would not survive, with lethal injections of [[morphine]].<ref name=berry/><ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/08/216838132/five-days-of-ambiguous-morality-at-katrina-hit-hospital|title='Five Days' Of Ambiguous Morality At Katrina-Hit Hospital|first=Susan Jane|last=Gilman|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=September 8, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> The story is described from the perspective of several participants, pieced together from interviews, emails and phone logs.<ref name=salon>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/09/08/five_days_at_memorial_a_hospital_becomes_hell/|title= "Five Days at Memorial": A hospital becomes hell |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=September 9, 2013|first=Laura|last=Miller|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

The second part, titled "Reckoning", discusses the legal and political ramifications of Memorial's response to the crisis and especially the decisions to euthanize patients.<ref name=telegraph/> In total, 45 patients died before the hospital was evacuated and 23 were identified as having concentrations of morphine and other drugs in their tissues.<ref name=berry/> Fink focuses largely on the investigation into the actions of Dr. Anna Pou and two intensive care nurses, Cheri Landry and Lori Budo, all three of whom were charged with [[Murder (United States law)|second-degree murder]] following allegations that they had administered lethal doses of morphine to some patients.<ref name=berry/><ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/17/five-days-memorial-sheri-fink-review|first=Peter|last=Beaumont|title=Five Days at Memorial by Sheri Fink – review|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 17, 2014|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> The public's sympathy lay largely with the three accused Memorial staff; the charges against Landry and Budo were eventually dropped, and a [[grand jury]] chose not to indict Pou in 2007.<ref name=salon/> Fink discusses the ethical issues surrounding the events at Memorial, as well as those involved in disaster settings and euthanasia in general.<ref name=boston/> A brief epilogue critiques health care protocols in disasters and uses the example of [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012 to illustrate the lack of change undertaken by hospitals in response to the disaster caused by Katrina and a failure of the US government to enforce standards for "emergency preparedness".<ref name=artsbeat/><ref name=boston/>

==Reception==
Critical reviews of ''Five Days at Memorial'' were mostly positive. Jason Berry of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commended the "shimmering intelligence" of Fink's discussion of the events and their ethical issues, and summarized the book as "social reporting of the first rank".<ref name=berry/> Another ''New York Times'' critic, bioethicist [[Sherwin B. Nuland]], felt the book displayed "masterly reporting and the glow of fine writing" and offered particular praise for the tone and language of Fink's writing.<ref name=times/> ''[[The Independent]]''{{'s}} Hirsh Sawhney admired the detail and variety of perspectives offered in the book and described the book as "soar[ing] to artistic and intellectual heights undreamed of in other realms of media".<ref name=independent/> Peter Beaumont, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', found parts of the book awkward in structure, but felt that overall it was "tight, provocative and gripping" with a "fair and deeply sympathetic" approach to the involved parties.<ref name=guardian/> A review by John B. Saul in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' commended Fink's ability to produce a "compelling and revealing account" of events despite limited access to evidence such as investigative reports and Pou's testimony,<ref name=seattle/> while the ''[[Star Tribune]]''{{'s}} Curt Schleier described ''Five Days at Memorial'' as "an important book that will make your blood boil no matter which side of the issue you support".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/228205201.html|title=REVIEW: 'Five Days at Memorial,' by Sheri Fink|date=October 19, 2013|first=Curt|last=Schleier|work=[[Star Tribune]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407230120/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/228205201.html|archivedate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

A more negative review came from Julia M. Klein of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', who found the book to be "overly long and detailed, sometimes hard to follow, and without a real narrative payoff" and felt that Fink's conclusions were presented more clearly in her original magazine article than in the book.<ref name=boston/> ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' magazine's Laura Miller found the first half of the book lacking in "shape or coherence, the meaning of this or that detail unclear and the timeline occasionally muddled", but was more impressed with the discussion of the disaster aftermath in the second half.<ref name=salon/> [[NPR]] critic Susan Jane Gilman faulted the book for "provok[ing] more debate than it answers" but praised Fink's "fair and balanced", "nuanced" writing.<ref name=npr/>
