:({{Find sources|Daisy Ridley}})
[[WP:TOOSOON]]. The role in Star Wars will be notable when that comes out, but now she only has a handful of minor roles. [[User:Beerest 2|Beerest 2]] [[User talk:Beerest 2|Talk page]] 13:35, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Do a Google search and you'll see that she already meets [[WP:GNG]] for significant coverage in multiple sources, as many publications are interested in who she is because of this high profile role. She's getting other work too (her first film comes out in August). The [[WP:POTENTIAL]] for this stub to grow as we learn more about her overweighs any TOOSOON concerns. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Muboshgu|Muboshgu]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Muboshgu#top|talk]]) 13:41, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Mild keep'''. People are going to be looking her up (and are already doing so). I don't think it's a violation of the crystal ball principle to consider that her having been cast for a part in ''Star Wars'' makes her inherently notable. [[User:Aridd|Aridd]] ([[User talk:Aridd|talk]]) 14:38, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**Indeed, it got [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Daisy_Ridley 7,585 page views] on April 29. Why take this consolidated information away from them? It's not the role that makes her notable, but the coverage about her and her getting the role that does. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Muboshgu|Muboshgu]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Muboshgu#top|talk]]) 14:47, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' for same reasons as above. [[User:Scarecroe|—scarecroe]] ([[User talk:Scarecroe|talk]]) 14:46, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' This person has been cast in the lead of the biggest movie of the decade.  The article needs work, but she is an important person.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Drewinmaine|Drewinmaine]] ([[User talk:Drewinmaine|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Drewinmaine|contribs]]) 15:03, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
*'''Keep'''-She is notable enough, nothing wrong here. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:37, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per most of the above, A Google search brings up alot of stuff & people will be searching her up, Not the most perfect article but IMO cleaning it up is the best solution.

*'''Keep''' as subject easily crosses the verifiability and notability thresholds. - [[User:Dravecky|Dravecky]] ([[User talk:Dravecky|talk]]) 20:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' She's going to be a lead actress in a major movie. I agree that the article falls under [[WP:POTENTIAL]]. [[User:Blaylockjam10|Blaylockjam10]] ([[User talk:Blaylockjam10|talk]]) 22:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' She has a new agent now, and her previous Facebook page is rumored to have been taken down.  Disney publicity flacks have apparently been hard at work to sell her as a newcomer.  As Davey2010 says, a lot of people will be seeking info on Wikipedia.[[User:Lynxx2|Lynxx2]] ([[User talk:Lynxx2|talk]]) 22:52, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Speedy keep'''. Considering the fact that she has important involvement with Star Wars Episode VII, and has been verified and legitimately announced as being so, her article must be kept. Sure, the details of Star Wars VII are scant currently, and there is the crystal ball rule which attempts to prevent too much future prediction and notability based off of something that has not happened yet. While Daisy Ridley was a virtual unknown until the announcement of her participation, I think that her close affiliation with the coming Star Wars film, and the fact that Star Wars is still a monolithic franchise, should be considered in the context of deciding to keep or delete the article. If the article does get deleted, which is highly doubtful since as of my posting there are no nay-saying votes, then it will have to be made later. However, in my opinion, Ridley is already notable enough for her own article here. Mungo Kitsch ([[User talk:Mungo Kitsch|talk]]) 00:22, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' This debate is one of the dumber things I've ever seen Wikipedia divided on. Who is the lunatic saying that a lead in a Star Wars movie isn't notable enough for an encyclopedia that has a lengthy entry on Sha Na Na?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.47.57.162|69.47.57.162]] ([[User talk:69.47.57.162|talk]]) 03:57, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Speedy keep''' News broke this week; 20-something confirmed for major role in Star Wars VII http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2617679/Daisy-Ridleys-father-celebrates-daughters-leading-role-new-Star-Wars-movie.html ... most experience guest roles in UK TV http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5397459/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 .... With news, a lot of 'Who is?'. My thanks to originator of page, found partial answer here. Deletion consideration,Wikipedia takes a step back.

*'''Keep'''- The female lead role in the third trilogy of ''Star Wars''. [[User:Hektor|Hektor]] ([[User talk:Hektor|talk]]) 14:26, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Definite Keep''' - Confirmed, by numerous sources, as a lead role in a film which is expected to be very high-profile. The Daisy Ridley article had over 20,000 page views, yesterday. [[User:EP111|EP111]] ([[User talk:EP111|talk]]) 16:27, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
