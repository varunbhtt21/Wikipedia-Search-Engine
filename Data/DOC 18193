:({{Find sources|Radio Free Moskow}})
No evidence of notability.  No sources, and a check for sources failed to turn up anything that wasn't self-referential.  There is a radio station, owned by a corporation with a very similar name, in Moskow, Idaho that is notable, but is unrelated to this topic.  I hope I'm wrong, and someone finds independent, reliable sources, and thereby improves the article, but I have failed.

* Also strongly promotional tone, so after trimming only the fact that it's a show on UCLA Radio remains. '''Delete'''. [[User:Qwertyus|Q<small>VVERTYVS</small>]] <small>([[User talk:Qwertyus|hm?]])</small> 13:51, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
