*'''Keep''', AfDs is not a venue for clean-ups. As per notability; "In the course of hiswanderings Sai Baba is said tohave visited Shri Manik Prabhu of Humanabad (18171865 AD.), whois consideredto be a Dattaavatar inthe Datta Sampradaya.", "The village has the samadhis with shrines of the renowned and highly venerated saint Manik Prabhu", etc,etc., --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 09:48, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
::Clean up would in this case mean a rewrite. The writing is so dense that, IMO, it borders on [[WP:CSD#A1]]. [[User:Qwertyus|Q<small>VVERTYVS</small>]] <small>([[User talk:Qwertyus|hm?]])</small> 14:44, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep'''. There is a number of Google Hits. Soman is probably right the article is on a notable topic, and should be considered an unreferenced stub, but not deleted. Comments from Indian Wikipedians would be helpful. --<sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 11:16, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
