==History==
The company was the creation of former managing director Mark Johnson and his partner David Rogerson who purchased a subsidiary of Burleigh Inc. In 2003 the company moved from being a distributor to a manufacturer of its own products.<ref>Mark Johnson biography http://www.scientifica.uk.com/press/resources</ref> Their products are sold worldwide, including Europe, The United States of America (USA), Brazil, India, China, Korea, Singapore, Japan and Russia.<ref>Insider Media Limited, News South East  www.insidermedia.com/insider/south-east/100409-xtrac-does-double-made-south-east</ref> The largest market is the United States but around thirty countries have bought Scientifica instruments.<ref>http://www.scientifica.uk.com/scientifica-worldwide-we-sell-to-over-30-countries List of thirty countries receiving products</ref>

==Philosophy==
Johnson and Rogerson's motivation was to provide bespoke and well tested products to electrophysiology and imaging researchers. [[Electrophysiology]] is the study and measurement of the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues, and Scientifica's products are used extensively to broaden the understanding of the nervous and cardiac systems, particularly diseases that include: [[Alzheimers]], [[Parkinsons]] and [[Epilepsy]].<ref>Scientifica website  http://www.scientifica.uk.com/</ref>
