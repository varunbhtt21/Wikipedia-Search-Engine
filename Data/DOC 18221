==Political life==

In 1982, Hooper ran for the District 81 state House seat vacated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Larry Dixon (politician)|Larry Dixon]], who was elected to the [[Alabama State Senate]] and switched to Republican affiliation in 1984. He was narrowly defeated by another Democrat, Ham Wilson Jr., who received 7,996 votes (50.9 percent) to Hooper's 7,725 (49.1 percent). In a [[special election]] in District 73 in 1983, a result of [[redistricting]], he narrowly unseated Wilson, 4,518 (51.1 percent) to 4,328 (48.9 percent) to fill the remaining three years of the term. Hooper was unopposed for reelection in 1986 and won with 64.1 percent in 1990 over the Democrat Robert Finley. Hooper increased his margin in 1994 to 73.3 percent over another Democrat, Ray Vaughan. He won re-nomination in 1998 over fellow Republican Donald Blair Little (1954–2012), an attorney in Montgomery and a son of Republican former state Representative [[Tandy Little]]. Hooper had no Democratic opponent in 1998 for what turned out to be his last four-year term in the state House. Hooper lost in the 2002 primary to fellow Republican [[David Grimes (Alabama politician)|David Grimes]], 3,582 (52.3 percent) to 3,273 (47.8 percent). Grimes was then unopposed in the [[general election]] of 2002 but lost the Republican primary in 2008.<ref name=campaigns/>Hooper's defeat by Grimes is attributed in part to a $12,000 fine in 2001 from the Alabama Ethics Commission.<ref name=ddaily>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/060716/loyalty.shtml|title=Candidates in GOP runoff for PSC 2 question loyalty|publisher=''Decatur Daily'', [[Decatur, Alabama]], July 16, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

Hooper failed in a political comeback in 2006 though he won the Republican nomination with 58 percent of the vote for the Place 2 seat on the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]] vacated by Democrat-turned Republican [[George Wallace Jr.]] Hooper defeated a former state senator, Democrat-turned-Republican [[John Amari]], a lawyer from the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] [[suburb]] of [[Trussville, Alabama|Trussville]], to win the Republican nomination for the Public Service Commission. Hooper was thereafter defeated in the general election by the Democratic former state auditor, [[Susan Parker]], 633,584 (53.5 percent), to 550,435 (46.4 percent).<ref name=campaigns/> Amari served twenty years in both houses of the legislature and was elected in 2008 as a judge of the Alabama 10th Judicial Circuit Court. In the 2006 campaign, Hooper called Amari a "[[Republican in Name Only|RINO]], a Republican in name only." Amari replied that Hooper "might have been born in a Republican family, but [by] his conduct ... he has 'left his raising' as they say."<ref name=ddaily/> 

In 1987 at the age of thirty-three, Hooper was named "Outstanding Young Man of Alabama" by the [[Junior Chamber International]]. He received the Thomas Jefferson Free Enterprise Award from the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), a group of [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] lawmakers and businesses.{{cn|date=January 2015}} A coach of youth athletics, Hooper is a former "Man of the Year" by the [[YMCA]] of Montgomery.
