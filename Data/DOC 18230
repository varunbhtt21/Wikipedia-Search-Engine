Does not meet [[:WP:NALBUMS]]. I found articles on AllMusic, and other sites, but they do not have professional reviews. I could not find charting information for the album either. [[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 13:56, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

It references Jesus Freak Hideout as a professional review and I found another one on indievisionmusic.com and newreleasetuesday.com. Guess I am confused as to what makes it not meet [[:WP:NALBUMS]]? [[User:Frenzy5579|Frenzy5579]] ([[User talk:Frenzy5579|talk]]) 15:47, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*I would probably '''merge''' to [[Capital Lights]] for now. Not much independent notability and there's room in the main article to cover this subject. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:32, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
