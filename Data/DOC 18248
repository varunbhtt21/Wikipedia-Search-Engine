Title : Robert Joseph Haddon
Text : {{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}
'''Robert Joseph Haddon''' (1866–1929) was an England-born architect who practised in Victoria in the 1900s-1910s. He was a major figure in the profession in Victoria,  championing the Arts & Crafts in his writing and teaching. He designed some of the most original  buildings of the period, featuring restraint, balanced asymmetry and Art Nouveau details.

== Biography ==
Haddon was born in London, and training there in the early 1880s, before emigrating to Australia in 1889 when he was 25. After a few years in Melbourne, faced with the crash of the 1890s, he relocated a number of times around southern Australia, including [[Perth]] for a while as the Assistant Architect at the [[Public Works Department (Western Australia)|Department of Public Works]], He finally settled back in [[Melbourne]] in 1899, setting up his own practice in 1902.

Haddon worked extensively on councils, examining boards and committees, while writing a number of [[Article (publishing)|article]]s in technical magazines, as well as a book (''Australian Domestic Architecture'') in 1908. As the head of the architecture school, the [[RMIT University#Working Men's College (1887–1960)|Melbourne Technical College]] from 1902, he taught several generations of students. He opened a practice as an architectural consultant, taking on Percy Oakley as his first assistant, and William Alexander in 1903, who was made a full partner seven years later. On his deathbed, he made provision for the richest traveling scholarship in the [[British empire|Empire]] at the time.<ref name="vic modern">Boyd 2011, "Victoria Modern"{{page needed|date=June 2014}}</ref>

Many buildings are supposedly attributed to Robert Joseph Haddon without actually bearing his name.<ref name="vic modern" /> When Haddon practiced in [[Melbourne]], much of his work was acting as a consultant to other firms, notably the practice Sydney Smith & Ogg. He also consulted with regional practices including [[Camperdown, Victoria|Camperdown (Victoria)]] based firms Tombs & Durran and Michael McCabe & Perry Knights, as well as Geelong architects Buchan & Laird.<ref name="towards dawn">Howells and Nicholson 1989, "Towards the Dawn"{{page needed|date=June 2014}}</ref> His buildings often possess a set of features that will distinguish them as one of his designs. His [[Elevation (view)#Elevation|elevations]] were composed with [[symmetry]], he regularly incorporated windows of varied shapes and sizes, but set simply without [[architrave]]s, and he did not use careless [[ornament (art)|ornament]], but all of his designs featured an area with a burst of extravagance. Hanging [[bronze]] strips were his favourite form of decoration, usually supporting a lamp or hood. They was his signature and feature throughout his designs. He later sought Australian [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], as well as flora and fauna from abroad, most notably lion heads.<ref name="vic modern" />

== Publications ==
# Haddon's 1908 book ''Australian Architecture'' was influential and has been described by writer Nick Bryant, in the Global Mail as ''THE EMERGENCE of a style of architecture immediately recognisable as Australian had been taken as a given when in 1908 Robert Haddon became the first local architect to write a book, Australian Architecture, solely devoted to local buildings. Naturally it would come, predicted Haddon, from the "points of peculiar difference that will always separate our Australian requirements and practice from that of the old world"''<ref>The Global Mail 14 June 2012 "What's better than the Sydney Opera House?" http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/whats-better-than-the-sydney-opera-house/266/</ref>  
#  He wrote a section on 'Australian Planning and Construction' in volume 5 of Modern Buildings: their Planning, Construction and Equipment, edited by G. A. T. Middleton (London, 1905–06)<ref>Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, (MUP), 1983 http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/haddon-robert-joseph-6516</ref>

=== Former Fourth Victoria Building ===

[[File:Former Fourth Victoria Building.jpg|thumb|Former Fourth Victoria Building]]

The Fourth Victoria Building, at 273 [[Collins Street, Melbourne]], was originally a brick warehouse, built in 1884 and remodelled in 1912 by Robert Haddon for its new owner, the Fourth Victoria Building Society. The remodelled design differed greatly from the [[architecture|architectural]] scape of [[Melbourne]] at the time. The building's Eastern Façade is approached as a whimsical interpretation derived from his passion in the [[arts and crafts movement]]s in Europe. Above the ground floor shop front and [[awning]], the first floor façade is covered with a panel of green glazed [[tile]]s, surmounted by a stylised [[wrought iron]] [[balcony]]. The façade above this is of plain white [[cement render|render]] pierced by windows without [[architrave]]s. Above the fifth level are two large majolica [[medallion]]s, containing green lions' heads, and trunk-like elements dribbled from these down the façade.<ref name="ffvb heritage site">"Former Fourth Victoria Building", Victorian Heritage</ref> The innovative ideas implemented through the materiality and design placed this building in a close threshold of Early European [[modern architecture|Modernism]]. The significance of Haddon's approach on [[architecture of australia|Australian architecture]] thereafter was noted by [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]].<ref name="ffvb heritage site" /> Following the completion of the building, an [[article (publishing)|article]] by the title "Art and architecture: the possibility of tiles" published in [[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] newspaper on 17 March 1915 complimented the architect and encouraged the architecture to be inspired from innovative [[Materiality (architecture)|materiality]] as a notion of breaking apart from tradition. Later on, many buildings like [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne|Her Majesty's Theatre]] and [[Melbourne Town Hall]] incorporated the use of the green glazed tiles and publicised its identity as a façade element.<ref name="tile article">"Possibilities of Tiles", 1915</ref>

=== Anselm ===

[[File:Anselm House.jpg|thumb|Anselm House]]

In his own house, "Anselm" at 4 Glenferrie Street [[Caulfield, Victoria]], Australia, built in 1907, Robert Haddon implemented his [[Art Nouveau]] ideas with his originality of unconventional architecture. Anselm plays with the [[visual hierarchy|hierarchy]] and scale of Art Nouveau classics such as a dominant octagonal [[tower]], visible [[chimney]] stacks and steep pitched roofs that bleed onto the building as decorative façade elements. Haddon treated the building with an [[open plan]] living that created a mixture of usable spaces and designed without hallways, which was unusual at the time. The building was a grand gesture that Haddon posed to the community, of his image as an influential architect, teacher and a writer.<ref name="anselm heritage site">"Anselm", Victorian Heritage</ref>

=== Malvern Presbyterian Church ===
{{Further|Malvern Presbyterian Church, Melbourne}}
[[File:1955 cover - Malvern Presbyterian Church souvenir booklet.jpg|thumb|Commemorative booklet 1955.]]
<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/haddon-robert-joseph-6516</ref> The first of three Presbyterian churches designed by Haddon, this work, at 163 Wattletree Rd, [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]] was commissioned in 1904 and completed in 1906 demonstrating a restrained and dignified [[Art Nouveau]] treatment of a basic church form used by Reformed and [[Presbyterian]] congregations - a clear, light-filled, open space ideal for the spoken word - a modern and sophisticated treatment of the traditional Presbyterian preaching hall.  Its basic [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] cruciform footprint is broad and fits the full depth of the shallow site with seating for 500 in the wide [[Nave]] and short [[transepts]] with two entrance lobbies flanking the Wattletree Rd end of the nave, thus avoiding using up depth with a [[Narthex]]. A shallow [[Apse]] contains the organ pipes. Broad arched windows represent the most overt art nouveau element of the design with tracery reflecting vine-like interpretations of traditional Gothic [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestration]]. The similarities with St Stephens, Caulfield, built 20 years later, are striking, particularly the powerful cement column that divides the main façade symmetrically and draws the eye upwards to the apex of the gable and beyond. In this case, the gable is surmounted by an interesting combination of a [[saltire]] and [[National symbols of Scotland|thistle]] representing St Andrew's cross and Scotland. This, in turn, is mounted by a finial composed of eight wrought iron thistles. the interior and casing for the organ pipes were designed by Haddon as was most of the furniture, much of which continues the thistle and Satire motifs in various and sometimes extremely subtle forms. the addition of [[The Vine|vine]] and acanthus leaves is seen in [[corbels]] for the [[Hammerbeam roof|hammer-beam roof]] and around the pulpit, which is placed off-centre to relieve space (possibly also reflecting doctrinal changes in Presbyterian churches at the time) and giving the communion table the focal point of the interior. Built at a cost of £4738 <ref>http://malvernpc.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=113&Itemid=1266</ref> with an additional cost of £1800 for the [[George Fincham]] organ, this lavish church  represents a complete vision of Robert Haddon's thesis of a [[Gesamtkunstwerk|"total work of art"]]<ref>http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;124816</ref> treatment for his own congregation, being a short walk from his new house, Anselm. After World War I, Haddon was again commissioned to design a [[World War I memorials|memorial]] to the fallen men of the congregation, most of whom he would have known personally.

=== St Stephen's Church ===

[[File:St Stephens Church Caulfield Nth.jpg|thumb|St Stephens Church Caulfield Nth]]

Built in 1926,<ref name="st stephens article">"New Church For Caulfield", 1926</ref> Haddon's incorporation of the [[arts and crafts movement|arts and crafts]] style with the traditional [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] style is evident in St Stephen's Church, known when built as St Stephen's Presbyterian Church,<ref name="st stephens article" /> on Balaclava Road, [[Caulfield North, Victoria|North Caulfield, Victoria]], Australia. The fusion of styles marks a transition in Melbourne's [[church architecture]], where the traditional [[proportion (architecture)|proportions]] become reinvented through exterior and interior details. The outside of St. Stephens is softened by the use of [[red brick]] and [[stucco]], with a striking cement cross that divides the façade symmetrically. Haddon also appropriates the verticality of gothic windows, dividing the internal space into smaller vertically stacked lead rectangles throughout. He repeated the arts and crafts approach to other church commissions he received, and this church remains significant in its close proximity to Haddon's own residence (Anselm).<ref name="st stephens heritage site">"St Stephen's Church", Victorian Heritage</ref><ref name="state lib plans">"[Building] No. 98", State Library of Victoria</ref>

===The Archangel Michael and St Anthony's Coptic Orthodox Church, Oakleigh===
Built in 1928 as St Andrew's Presbyterian, Oakleigh<ref>The Argus, Saturday 14 July 1928, page 23 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3943458</ref> and designed by Haddon in cooperation with his business partner, William Henderson, this building confidently sits the corner of Drummond and Palmer Streets,<ref>street view https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/136+Drummond+St,+Oakleigh+VIC+3166/@-37.896479,145.090164,3a,40y,105.44h,91.89t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s3Qj8AkQEh57_mskJCBHVaw!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x6ad66a5ee74eaa7b:0xad634aa3942d1707!6m1!1e1</ref> Oakleigh. Short and squat with an octagonal castellated tower, the windows, brickwork and restrained adornment look decidedly "Haddonian" as Professor [[Miles Lewis|Miles Lewis AM]] of Melbourne University states in a 1991 National Trust of Victoria publication.<ref>National Trust of Victoria, Victorian Churches edited by Miles Lewis, 1991, page 78 http://www.stonnington.vic.gov.au/DownloadDocument.ashx?DocumentID=9199</ref>  While Professor Lewis goes on to describe the cantilevered wrought iron lamp over the entrance and a blind [[oculus]] in the western wall, he is clearly not a fan and calls the spire "risible". In Miles Lewis' words, an overall mannered and clumsy form. However, with the benefit of two and a half decades, tastes have moved on from Lewis' time to reassess this era of building.  Similar to Malvern and St Stephen's, Caulfield, the Oakleigh church enjoys a cement gable treatment enhancing the focus on the apex, and proudly displaying the year of construction.  The overall impression is coherent and pleasing in its suburban scale.  Recent sympathetic additions have enhanced the facilities of this attractive campus but the Haddon building still sits the corner site well.  Its presence shows a transition to the heavier, monolithic presence of the moderne and [[Art Deco]] of the 1920-30s.  In this sense, Haddon carries forward his Arts and Crafts ideals but has left the gothic well behind and synthesized for the new architecture of the inter-war period.
