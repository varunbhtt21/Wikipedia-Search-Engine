The [[2014–15 Premier League|2014–15 season]] is [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]'s seventh season in the [[Premier League]] and the 59th in the [[English football league system|top tier of English football]].

In preparation for the 2014–15 season [[Mark Hughes]] signed [[Phil Bardsley]], [[Mame Biram Diouf]], [[Bojan Krkić]], [[Steve Sidwell]], [[Dionatan Teixeira]] whilst [[Victor Moses]] and [[Oussama Assaidi]] joined on season-long loans. Departing the [[Britannia Stadium]] were [[Matthew Etherington]], [[Cameron Jerome]], [[Michael Kightly]] and [[Ryan Shotton]]. Stoke had a mixed start to the season as they lost 1–0 at home to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], drew 1–1 with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and then beat the reigning league champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] 1–0. This set the tone for an inconsistent Autumn as Stoke managed just three wins in September, October and November and lost at home to newly promoted sides [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

Results improved in December as the Potters beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3–2, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] both 1–0. Stoke suffered a number of injuries in January most notably to Bojan but the side were still able to secure victories against Leicester City and Queens Park Rangers. Stoke's only arrival in the January transfer window was German centre-back [[Philipp Wollscheid]] on loan from [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]]. After drawing 1–1 at Newcastle United, Stoke suffered back-to-back 4–1 defeats to Manchester City and then in the [[FA Cup]] to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Stoke recovered well from this set-back winning their next three matches against Aston Villa, Hull City and Everton. This was the followed by three defeats against West Brom, Crystal Palace and Chelsea. Stoke ended the season strongly with victories over Southampton (2–1), Tottenham Hotspur (3–0) and Liverpool (6–1) ensuring a second consecutive 9th-place finish.

{{Main|2014–15 Premier League}}

===August===
For the first match of the 2014–15 season Stoke faced Midlands rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at the [[Britannia Stadium]]. Manager [[Mark Hughes]] gave debuts to new arrivals [[Phil Bardsley]], [[Mame Biram Diouf]] and [[Bojan Krkić]]. Stoke made a decent start as they enjoyed a lot of possession in the Villa half without troubling [[Brad Guzan]]. Stoke almost fell behind after a mix-up between [[Asmir Begović]] and [[Marc Wilson (Irish footballer)|Marc Wilson]] allowed [[Kieran Richardson]] to cross to [[Gabriel Agbonlahor]], but despite an open goal he failed to hit the target. Villa took the lead just after half-time with a powerful shot from [[Andreas Weimann]]. Stoke rarely looked like getting back into the game thereafter and Villa were able to see the game out.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke City 0, Aston Villa 1: |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-0-Aston-Villa-1-time-report/story-22756468-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> Before the match Stoke announced the signing of [[Victor Moses]] on a season-long loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke City: Victor Moses to be up and running for Hull City game |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Victor-Moses-running-Hull-City-game/story-22761112-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref>

Stoke's first away match of the season saw them travel to the [[KC Stadium]] to take on Hull City. Stoke were handed an early boost as Tigers defender [[James Chester]] was sent-off for a professional foul on [[Glenn Whelan]]. Despite their one-man advantage Stoke struggled to create goalscoring opportunities and just before half-time Hull took the lead when [[Tom Huddlestone]]'s shot was only parried by Begović into the path of [[Nikica Jelavić]]. Stoke managed to salvage a point after [[Ryan Shawcross]] bundled the ball just over the line in the 83rd minute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hull City 1, Stoke City 1: Goal hero Shawcross almost falls victim to hi-tech horror|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Hull-City-1-Stoke-City-1-Potters-going-basics/story-22813358-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> It was frustrating match for Stoke as despite having 19 shots on goal only 3 were on target.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hull 1-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28824514|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>

On 30 August 2014 Stoke faced the current champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]]. After a goalless first half Stoke took a shock lead on 58 minutes after a Man City corner was headed out to [[Mame Biram Diouf]] just outside his own penalty area, Diouf sprinted 70 yards down the pitch and scored past [[Joe Hart]]. Stoke were defensively resolute and were able to hold out for a 1–0 victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manchester City 0, Stoke City 1: Martin Spinks' match analysis |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Manchester-City-0-Stoke-City-1-Martin-Spinks/story-22855582-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Full-time report: Man City 0, Stoke City 1 |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/time-report-Man-City-0-Stoke-City-1/story-22853006-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref> After the match Asmir Begovic stated that it was Stoke's best win in the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manchester City 0, Stoke City 1: That was out best Premier League win, says Asmir Begovic |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Manchester-City-0-Stoke-City-1-best-Premier/story-22856048-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref> There was some bad news for Stoke however as [[Peter Odemwingie]] sustained a knee injury which required surgery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Odemwingie requires knee surgery - but vows to be back for Wembley! |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Peter-Odemwingie-requires-surgery-knee/story-22864575-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref>

===September===
On transfer deadline day Stoke brought back winger [[Oussama Assaidi]] on another season-long loan from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Transfer deadline day: Stoke sign Oussama Assaidi from Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29020948|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref> After the international break Stoke came up against newly promoted [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at the Britannia Stadium on 13 September. It was another frustrating afternoon for the Potters as they had 27 shots on goal with only 6 on target and Leicester took full advantage of Stoke's wastefulness scoring the only goal of the game through [[Leonardo Ulloa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Full-time report: Stoke City 0, Leicester City 1|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/time-report-Stoke-City-0-Leicester-City-1/story-22921049-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 0-1 Leicester|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29090535|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>

Stoke then faced another newly promoted side, [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] away at [[Loftus Road]]. Stoke took the lead through Diouf after good wing play from Victor Moses. QPR levelled through [[Steven Caulker]] before [[Peter Crouch]] scored his first goal of the season against his former club. Stoke were denied a victory as [[Niko Kranjčar]] curled in a late free-kick and the match ended in a 2–2 draw.<ref>{{cite web|title=QPR 2-2 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29187276|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=QPR 2, Stoke City 2: Super late free-kick robs Potters of victory|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/QPR-2-Stoke-City-2-Super-late-free-kick-robs/story-22956119-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>

On 29 September Stoke took on [[Alan Pardew]]'s Newcastle United at the Britannia Stadium. Both sides went into the match under pressure with Stoke losing both of their home games whilst Newcastle had failed to record a victory. Stoke took an early lead as Peter Crouch headed in a cross from Victor Moses. Newcastle struggled to get back into the game and Arnautovic could have extended Stoke's advantage but his shot hit the post. Newcastle did have a chance to claim a point but [[Jack Colback]] could only hit the crossbar from four yards out.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke City 1, Newcastle United 0: Martin Spinks' report from the Britannia Stadium |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-1-Newcastle-United-0-Martin-Spinks/story-23016348-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 1-0 Newcastle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29305924|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>

===October===
After beating Sunderland at the [[Stadium of Light]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in September, Stoke were looking to make it a quick fire double. However Sunderland scored early through [[Connor Wickham]], [[Charlie Adam]] levelled on 15 minutes before two goals from [[Steven Fletcher (footballer)|Steven Fletcher]] earned Sunderland a 3–1 victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunderland 3-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29389678|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> It was a poor performance from Stoke and Mark Hughes admitted that his side deserved to lose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match report: Sunderland 3, Stoke City 1|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Match-report-Sunderland-3-Stoke-City-1/story-23043984-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sunderland 3, Stoke 1: Mark Hughes makes no excuses for first away defeat |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Sunderland-3-Stoke-1-Mark-Hughes-makes-excuses/story-23044091-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Following the international break Stoke took on Swansea City on 19 October. After an uneventful start the game turned as referee [[Michael Oliver (referee)|Michael Oliver]] awarded both sides controversial penalties. Firstly Ryan Shawcross was penalised for holding [[Wilfried Bony]] and then Victor Moses was brought down by [[Àngel Rangel]]. Both managers were unhappy with the decisions with Hughes stating that he feels Shawcross is being singled-out whilst [[Garry Monk]] claimed that Moses dived.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke City 2, Swansea City 1: 'Cheat' jibe and 'soft' penalty spark angry reaction from Mark Hughes|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-2-Swansea-City-1-Cheat-jibe-soft/story-23265847-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> Stoke were able to earn a 2–1 victory after [[Jonathan Walters]] headed past [[Łukasz Fabiański]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 2-1 Swansea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29586592|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>

Stoke ended October with back to back League and Cup matches against an in-form [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] side who went into the matches having previously beaten Sunderland 8–0. The Saints had the better chances and scored the only goal of the game through [[Sadio Mané]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Match report: Southampton 1, Stoke City 0|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Match-report-Southampton-1-Stoke-City-0/story-23508109-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>

===November===
After Stoke were knocked out of the League Cup by Southampton they played against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. Stoke created numerous chances and goals from Victor Moses and Mame Diouf seemed to have given Stoke the victory. But the Hammers mounted a late comeback with goals from [[Enner Valencia]] and [[Stewart Downing]] which left Stoke having to settle for a 2–2 draw.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke City 2, West Ham 2: Martin Spinks' match analysis from the Britannia Stadium|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-2-West-Ham-2-Martin-Spinks-match/story-23975012-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref>

On 9 November Stoke made the trip to the capital to take on [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[White Hart Lane]]. Stoke took an early lead through a low shot from [[Bojan Krkić]]. Stoke added a second goal after Walters scored from close range following a square ball from Diouf. Spurs pulled one back late on through a [[Nacer Chadli]] volley but soon after Tottenham defender [[Kyle Naughton]] was sent-off for a professional foul on Moses and Stoke were able to see out a 2–1 victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tottenham Hotspur 1, Stoke City 2: Martin Spinks' match report from White Hart Lane|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Tottenham-Hotspur-1-Stoke-City-2-Martin-Spinks/story-24502913-detail/story.html|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Despite defeating Tottenham, Stoke's inconsistency remained as they fell to a home defeat against newly promoted [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. The Potters made a woeful start to the match and conceded two goals in the opening 15 minutes, [[Danny Ings]] scoring both Burnley goals. Stoke pulled one back via Jon Walters but a wasteful second half display saw them suffer a third home defeat of the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 1-2 Burnley|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30065845|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>

Stoke's preparation for the final match of November against Liverpool was disrupted by a sickness bug at the club's training ground.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sickness bug was no fun at all - Geoff Cameron|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Liverpool-1-Stoke-City-0-Sickness-bug-fun-Geoff/story-24906321-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> The match itself was a largely uneventful affair which was won 1–0 by Liverpool, [[Glen Johnson (English footballer)|Glen Johnson]] scoring in the 85th minute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full-time report: Liverpool 1, Stoke City 0|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/time-report-Liverpool-1-Stoke-City-0/story-24895461-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref>

===December===
Stoke suffered a third straight league defeat on 2 December losing 2–1 at Manchester United. [[Marouane Fellaini]] headed Man United in front which was cancelled out by [[Steven Nzonzi]] just before half time. A free-kick from [[Juan Mata]] put the home side back in front and Stoke were denied a point after Diouf's shot was blocked on the line by [[Ashley Young]] late in the match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full-time report: Man United 2, Stoke City 1|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/time-report/story-25051115-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

Stoke then took on Arsenal in what was an eventful 90 minutes of football. The Potters made a perfect start as straight from kick-off the ball was played down the wing to Nzonzi who crossed in for Peter Crouch to tap the ball past [[Emiliano Martínez]].<ref name="Stoke 3-2 Arsenal"/> Arsenal had the chance to pull level after [[Héctor Bellerín]]'s cross found an unmarked [[Olivier Giroud]] but he could only guide his header off target.<ref name="Stoke 3-2 Arsenal"/> Stoke added a second after Bojan turned in a cross from Walters before Walters himself scored to make it 3–0 at half time. Stoke thought they had made it 4–0 after Bojan had fired past Martínez but after a short delay the officials disallowed it for Diouf being in offside position and therefore interfering with play.<ref name="Stoke 3-2 Arsenal"/> Arsenal took advantage of the confusion with goals from [[Santi Cazorla]] and [[Aaron Ramsey]] but their hopes of completing a comeback were ended when [[Calum Chambers]] was sent-off for a second bookable offence and Stoke saw out a 3–2 victory.<ref name="Stoke 3-2 Arsenal">{{cite web|title=Stoke 3-2 Arsenal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30257121|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>

The next match away at Crystal Palace saw both teams make a bright start as Palace scored in the eleventh minute via a looping header from [[James McArthur]]. Just 92 seconds later Crouch scored from close range after a shot from Walters deflected into his path. However the remainder of the match saw both teams cancel each other out as the match ended in an drab 1–1 draw.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace 1-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30357667|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 December 2014}}</ref>

Stoke began the festive period with a home match against league leaders [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 22 December. Stoke made a terrible start as [[John Terry]] headed in a [[Cesc Fàbregas]] corner after only two minutes. Stoke struggled to cause Chelsea too much problems and they sealed the win through Fàbregas late in the second half.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke City 0, Chelsea 2: Potters caught napping again to gift Chelsea Xmas victory|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-0-Chelsea-2-Potters-caught-napping/story-25752508-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>

On Boxing Day Stoke made the journey to [[Goodison Park]] to face Everton. The first half was a disrupted by a number of lengthy injury delays before the key moment in the match. Everton full-back [[Leighton Baines]] burst through on goal only for Jonathan Walters to pull him back, however [[Lee Mason]] gave Walters a yellow card. From the resulting free-kick Everton lost possession and Stoke counter-attacked through Bojan who was fouled by [[James McCarthy (footballer)|James McCarthy]] in the penalty area, Bojan then converted the spot-kick. Stoke were able to produce a strong defensive performance in the second half and were able to hold on for a 1–0 victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everton 1-0 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30544231|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>

Stoke ended a successful 2014 with a home match against Midlands rivals West Bromwich Albion at the Britannia. After a goalless first half a well worked moved ended with Diouf firing past [[Ben Foster]]. The Baggies should have equalized following a goalmouth scramble but [[Gareth McAuley]] could only hit the post from close range. Stoke secured back to back victories for the first time in the 2014–15 season after Arnautovic's shot deflected in off Diouf.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 2-0 West Brom|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30566675|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> After the match West Brom sacked manager [[Alan Irvine (footballer, born 1958)|Alan Irvine]] and replaced him with former Stoke manager [[Tony Pulis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tony Pulis confirmed as new West Brom boss|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30648573|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref>

===January===
The first match of 2015 came against Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke made a perfect start to the match as Ryan Shawcross scored past his former club after just two minutes. Stoke should have added a second after Diouf outmuscled [[Jonny Evans]] to go clean through on goal but he fired the shot over the bar, shortly after Man United leveled through [[Radamel Falcao]]. In the second half Stoke had a penalty appeal turned down by referee [[Michael Oliver (referee)|Michael Oliver]] for a handball by [[Chris Smalling]] and then a header by Crouch hit the post as the match ended 1–1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 1-1 Man United|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30600756|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref>

On 7 January 2015 Stoke made their first signing of the January transfer with the loan arrival of German defender [[Philipp Wollscheid]] on loan from [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke sign Germany defender Philipp Wollscheid on loan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30716936|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> He made his debut in the next league match away at Arsenal, however Stoke went on to produce a poor performance. Goals from [[Laurent Koscielny]] and a brace from [[Alexis Sánchez]] earned the home side the three points.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arsenal 3, Stoke City 0 match report: Outclassed Potters lick their wounds|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Arsenal-3-Stoke-City-0-match-report-Outclassed/story-25838362-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>

Stoke recovered well the following week away at Midlands rivals Leicester City where they produced a commanding performance in a 1–0 victory. Stoke were dealt a blow before kick-off after Ryan Shawcross failed a fitness test meaning that Glenn Whelan took over as captain. After a goalless first half, Bojan fired a low shot past [[Ben Hamer]] after 63 minutes which was enough to earn the Potters their fourth away win of the season and their first at the [[King Power Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Leicester 0-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30758438|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>

Stoke suffered a major blow before their match against Queens Park Rangers with the news that Bojan will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bojan Krkic: Stoke striker ruled out for season with knee injury|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31006307|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> [[Stephen Ireland]] took the role vacated by Bojan and he set-up Walters for the opening goal after 21 minutes. Walters added a second goal before [[Niko Kranjčar]] pulled one back for QPR just before half-time. Rangers tried in vain for force an equalizer in the second half with a [[Joey Barton]] free-kick which hit the crossbar the closest they came. Walters completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, becoming the first Stoke player to score a Premier League hat-trick.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 3-1 QPR|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30963548|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> On the final day of the January transfer window Mark Hughes allowed [[Robert Huth]] to join Leicester City on loan for the remainder of the 2014–15 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Huth: Leicester City sign defender on loan from Stoke City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31077446|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref>

===February===
Stoke's next match was against [[John Carver (footballer)|John Carver]]'s Newcastle United at [[St James' Park]]. After a fairly uneventful encounter the match came to life in the final 20 minutes after Newcastle midfielder [[Jack Colback]] avoided being sent-off for a foul on Victor Moses. Colback then scored with a low shot past Begovic on 74 minutes. Ireland had a goal ruled out for offside whilst [[Yoan Gouffran]] and [[Ayoze Pérez]] were guilt of poor finishing for the home side. Stoke were able to claim a point as Crouch headed in a Geoff Cameron cross in the final moments of the match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Newcastle 1-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31079322|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref>

On 11 February champions Manchester City, claimed their first Premier League win at the [[Britannia Stadium]] in emphatic fashion. It was an even first half where a Crouch header cancelled out [[Sergio Agüero]]'s opening goal. However Man City scored three times without reply in the second half with goals from Agüero, [[James Milner]] and [[Samir Nasri]]. With the match over as a contest Hughes was able to bring on [[Ollie Shenton]] for his league debut.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke v Man City|url=http://www.stokecityfc.com/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3735337|website=Stoke City F.C|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref>

After the embarrassing [[FA Cup]] defeat to Blackburn Rovers, Stoke took on [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]]. Villa had new manager [[Tim Sherwood]] in charge for the first time following the sacking of [[Paul Lambert]]. [[Scott Sinclair]] headed Villa in front after 20 minutes before a header from Diouf made it 1–1 just before half time. With the match seemingly headed for a draw, a mistake from Villa captain [[Ron Vlaar]] let [[Victor Moses]] through on goal, Vlaar then mistimed a sliding tackle and conceded a 90th-minute penalty. Vlaar was then sent-off by referee [[Roger East (referee)|Roger East]] and Moses scored the penalty to earn Stoke a 2–1 victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aston Villa 1-2 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31466727|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>

Stoke ended the month of February with a scrappy 1–0 win over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Peter Crouch scored the only goal of the game after 71 minutes just moments after coming on as a substitute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 1-0 Hull|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31562895|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> [[Stephen Ireland]] suffered a deep cut on his calf which required 15 stitches following a challenge by Hull City defender [[Maynor Figueroa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mark Hughes fumes as Stoke's Stephen Ireland sidelined|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31678119|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>

===March===
Stoke then made it three wins in a row with a 2–0 victory over [[Roberto Martínez]]'s [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Goals from Moses and Diouf sealed the victory which moved Stoke onto 42 points and into 8th position.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke City 2, Everton 0 match report: Moses and Diouf fire Potters to eighth|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-2-Everton-0-match-report-Moses-Diouf/story-26121733-detail/story.html|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Stoke then came up against former manager [[Tony Pulis]] now in charge at West Bromwich Albion. It was a drab 90 minutes of football 
with a header from [[Brown Ideye]] proving to be the only goal of the contest.<ref>{{cite web|title=West Brom v Stoke|url=http://www.stokecityfc.com/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?matchid=3735649|website=Stoke City|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref>

Crystal Palace then inflicted a fourth home defeat of the campaign upon Stoke on 21 March. Diouf scored early on after a Charlie Adam free-kick deflected into his path before the game turned in the last five minutes of the first half. Referee [[Andre Marriner]] adjudged that Begovic had fouled [[Yannick Bolasie]] in the penalty area which [[Glenn Murray]] converted. Slack defending then let in [[Wilfried Zaha]] just to give Palace a 2–1 half time lead. Stoke tried in vain to find an equaliser with Palace 'keeper [[Julián Speroni]] in fine form.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 1-2 Crystal Palace|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31883077|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>

===April===
Stoke began April with a trip to league leaders [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 4 April. The home side made a commanding start and after a period of sustained pressure they were awarded a penalty after Phillip Wollschied miss-timed a challenge on [[Cesc Fàbregas]]. [[Eden Hazard]] sent Begović the wrong way from the spot. Stoke equalised just before half time in spectacular fashion as [[Charlie Adam]] beat Chelsea 'keeper [[Thibaut Courtois]] from his own half.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Charlie Adam's wonder goal for Stoke City shook the country|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32185639|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] brought on his top goalscorer [[Diego Costa]] at half-time but went off injured 10 minutes later.<ref>{{cite web|title=It was a risk to play Diego Costa against Stoke - Mourinho|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32185984|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> The Blues went back in front after a mistake from Begovic, which allowed Hazard to square the ball for [[Loïc Rémy]] for a simple tap-in. Nzonzi hit the post for Stoke as they fell to a 2–1 defeat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chelsea 2-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32098130|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref>

Stoke went into their next match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] looking end a run of three defeats. However they made a poor start to the match as [[Aaron Cresswell]] curled in a free-kick after seven minutes. Stoke dominated the remainder of the match from then on but were left frustrated in the search of an equaliser. [[Marko Arnautović]] twice had a goal ruled out of offside whilst a header from Diouf hit the post. Stoke and were not to be denied a point though as Arnautović finally scored a legitimate goal in the 95th minute.<ref>{{cite web|title=West Ham 1-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32179965|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>

[[Ronald Koeman]]'s [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] were next at the Britannia on 18 April. The Saints went into the match still looking to earn a place in Europe following a successful campaign, and they took the lead when [[Morgan Schneiderlin]] tapped in from close range after Stoke had failed to deal with a corner. Stoke should have equalised just before half-time but Nzonzi miscued from just yards out. He helped Stoke level straight after half time as his over hit cross hit the crossbar and Diouf was quickest to react. Stoke managed to beat Southampton for the first time in the Premier League after Charlie Adam scored the winning goal in the 84th minute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 2-1 Southampton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32262295|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref>

For the visit of relegation threatened [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] there was a minute's silence for the 30th anniversary of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]]. Stoke made an awful start to the match as Sunderland took the lead inside the first minute through [[Connor Wickham]] after Begovic failed to hold on to a low cross. Stoke dominated from the restart and Adam fired Stoke level after 27 minutes. A jittery Stoke defense provided Sunderland with their best chances of taking three points but they were unable to capitalise and the match ended 1–1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 1-1 Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32363041|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> [[Peter Odemwingie]] made his come back from injury playing for the first time since August.<ref>{{cite web|title=Odemwingie Return A boost - Hughes|url=http://www.stokecityfc.com/news/article/odemwingie-return-a-boost-hughes-2423588.aspx|website=Stoke City|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref>

The Potters faced Tottenham Hotspur the following week at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke made a strong start and scored through a header from Adam after 21 minutes via a defensive mistake from [[Jan Vertonghen]]. City doubled their lead after another Spurs defensive mishap, a cross-field ball by Adam ended up with [[Hugo Lloris]] and [[Eric Dier]] getting in each other's way and Nzonzi was able to fire the ball into an empty net. It got worse for Tottenham as [[Vlad Chiricheș]] was sent-off of two bookable offences and Diouf scored late on to seal a 3–0 victory and move stoke on to 50 points. It was also the first time Stoke had completed the double over Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke 3-0 Tottenham|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32561784|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> The Premier League dubious goals panel later ruled Diouf's goal as a Jan Vertonghen own goal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dubious goals panel takes Tottenham strike off Mame Diouf|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Dubious-goals-panel-takes-strike-Mame/story-26502578-detail/story.html?|website=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

==FA Cup==
{{Main|2014–15 FA Cup}}

Stoke were drawn at home against [[Conference Premier]] side [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] in the [[FA Cup]] third round. Stoke put in a disappointing display against the non-league side and fell behind after 73 minutes to a [[Mark Carrington (footballer)|Mark Carrington]] header. However Stoke avoided an embarrassing exit as a close range tap-in from [[Marko Arnautović]] and a brace from [[Stephen Ireland]] in the final ten minutes saw the Potters progress 3–1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stoke v Wrexham|url=http://www.stokecityfc.com/fixtures-results/match-report/index.aspx?MatchId=3794853|website=Stoke City F.C|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> In the fourth round Stoke came up against League One [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] at [[Spotland Stadium|Spotland]]. Bojan volleyed Stoke into an early lead before he went off injured. From then on Rochdale had the better of the first half but were unable to beat [[Jack Butland]]. After half-time Stoke scored through [[Stephen Ireland]], [[Victor Moses]] and [[Jonathan Walters]] with [[Rhys Bennett]] getting a consolation for the Dale.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rochdale v Stoke|url=http://www.stokecityfc.com/fixtures-results/match-report/?matchid=3799242&tcmuri=2189117|website=Stoke City F.C|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> Stoke faced Championship side [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the fifth round and despite [[Peter Crouch]] scoring an early goal Stoke crashed to a 4–1 defeat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackburn 4-1 Stoke|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31423138|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref>

Stoke were drawn at home to [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in the second round of the League Cup.
