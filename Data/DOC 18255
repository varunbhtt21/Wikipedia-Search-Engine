'''Bad Oeynhausen Süd''' (south) station is located in the [[Westphalia]]n  spa town of [[Bad Oeynhausen]] in [[Minden-Lübbecke]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. It is on the [[Elze–Löhne railway]] and is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a [[German railway station categories|category 6 station]].<ref name =categories/>
		
== Conditions ==

[[File:Bahnhof Bad Oeynhausen Süd Gebäude.jpg|thumb|Former station building]]

Bad Oeynhausen Süd station is located south of the town centre and the [[spa]] park. [[Bad Oeynhausen station]], colloquially referred to as the ''Nordbahnhof'' (north station) or [[Hauptbahnhof]] (main station) is connected by the 800 metre-long Bahnhofstrasse (station street). It is located in the neighbourhood of the North Rhine-Westphalia Heart and Diabetes Centre of the [[Ruhr University Bochum]], the local site of the Mühlen district hospitals (''Mühlenkreiskliniken'') as well as the Bali-Therme thermal spa.

The station was regularly used by long-distance traffic from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1970s. After some restoration work, it has only one platform on a through track and it is thus formally classified as a ''Haltepunkt'' (halt). The platform is accessible for the disabled. The underpass that previously connected to another platform was closed. The grade II heritage-listed former station building now houses various service providers.

The station is linked with the southern part of the town and Lohe via Weserstraße and Detmolder Straße.  Because the town’s bus service is focused on Bad Oeynhausen station and the central bus station there are no direct bus connections at the south station.

== Operations==

The station is served hourly (every two hours on weekends) by [[Regionalbahn]] service RB 77, called the [[Weser-Bahn]], ([[Bünde station|Bünde]]–[[Löhne station|Löhne]]–[[Rinteln station|Rinteln]]–[[Hamelin station|Hamelin]]–[[Hildesheim Hbf]]–Bodenburg).<ref name=station>{{cite web| url= http://nrwbahnarchiv.bplaced.net/bf/8000733.htm| title= Bad Oeynhausen Süd station |work=NRW Rail Archive |publisher= André Joost |accessdate=30 April 2014 |language=German}}</ref> It is operated by [[NordWestBahn]], using [[Alstom Coradia LINT]] diesel railcars.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://nrwbahnarchiv.bplaced.net/linien/RB77.htm| title= RB77: Weser-Bahn |work=NRW Rail Archive |publisher= André Joost |accessdate=30 April 2014 |language=German}}</ref>
