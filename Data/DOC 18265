*'''Weak delete'''.  Not much found in the usual searches, other than listings in camp directories and very local news.  [[Peter Fonda]] [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=okIjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5969%2C2897292] and [[Enrique Iglesias]] [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22670460.html] both attended this camp, and Iglesias said in an interview that it's where he first learned about "Anglo music".  One of the owners was interviewed for a 1997 ''New York Times'' article about camps.[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/02/nyregion/calling-all-campers.html?src=pm&pagewanted=3]   But despite the camp's age I didn't come up with much to show its particular significance in the [http://themainemag.com/play/recreation/2229-maine-camps-listing.html wide world of Maine summer camps].  The associated Kawanhee Inn gets positive mentions in travel sources (see GBooks for examples), and maybe an argument could be made that it's Wikipedia-notable as a hotel, but I didn't find enough to make that argument strongly. There might be enough to justify a mention of the inn and camp in the article for [[Weld, Maine]] as significant features of the town. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 14:58, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as above. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 03:26, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''.  The article has two assertions of notability, that it is one of the oldest continuously operating summer camps in Maine and that it achieves the highest return rate of any camp in the U.S.  These assertions should be specifically supported, but that is a matter of calling for improvement in editing by tagging and commenting at Talk page, not for AFD.  I added a bit to the article, too, including quoting from a New York Times article that included a fair amount about the camp (which was referred-to above), plus another New York Times article that was exclusively about a significant fire at the camp that killed one of its founders, plus [[Guidestar]]-provided information about the financials of the camp. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 16:06, 10 May 2014 (UTC) --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 00:39, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak Delete''' - Given the celebrities who went there and the age I'm surprised there's not more out there, but I'm not having luck sourcing it either. An organization's article can claim whatever fantastic statistic or historical import a Wikipedian decides to write, but if it's not backed up by reliable sources it can't be considered for these purposes (especially, as with the current example, if people are searching for sources to back up those statements and can't find any). --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 06:26, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
::Umm, i did a little looking, and found some sources, mentioned above.  I think there were more, and others could find more, too.  I am not motivated to devote a lot of energy to this.  Don't know if anyone else has, so you may be wrong with your implication are searching and can't find anything.  And, there could be extensive off-line sources.  This is one of a series of summer camp articles nominated for deletion, where [[wp:BEFORE]] seems not met.  Others are: [[wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camp Modin]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sitka Fine Arts Camp]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Forest Lake Camp]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camp Ondessonk]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Falling Creek Camp]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camp Rockmont for Boys]].  Most or all are heading for Keep decision, IMHO, because notability was already obvious or was more clearly established.  I don't think we have to respond in detail to every one of many AFDs nominated in the same style.  Disclosure: The deletion nominator has accused me of [[wp:canvass]] at some of these, for mentioning others in the series, which is nonsense IMHO, as what canvassing is about, is selectively posting to user talk pages.  This is not selective, it is posting where random editors having many opinions show up, and it is relevant, and it not being broadcasted widely. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 18:25, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Your continued, ''partisan'' canvassing, about which you have been warned previously, remains unacceptable. The closer of the various AfDs should take it into account. It is not for you to refdefine what canvassing means; WP:CANVASS is clear (my emphasis): {{tq|"canvassing which is done with the intention of influencing the outcome of a discussion in a particular way is considered inappropriate"; in one case, it is a further breach of your Arbcom restriction. This is because it compromises the normal consensus decision-making process, and therefore is generally considered '''''disruptive behavior'''''... Users with a prior history of disruptive canvassing, which they have previously been asked to discontinue, may be blocked immediately without further warning, if such an action is deemed to be necessary.}}  <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 19:36, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Total rubbish.  Read the detail of [[wp:CANVASS]] and see that it is about selectively posting to Talk pages, which i did not do.  I linked between multiple parallel AFDs, where there have been both positive voters and negative voters who are equally informed.  Pigsonthewing even [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doncram&diff=prev&oldid=607825807 had to edit the accusation of canvassing at my Talk page after posting it], because the text so clearly did not apply.  Don't threaten me, please, this seems personal, seems like a [[wp:NPA|personal attack]], seems [[wp:distruptive|to be disrupting]] the AFD discussion. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 20:57, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::Commenting on your clearly-apparent partisan canvassing is not a personal attack; but take it to WP:ANI if you disagree. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 21:03, 17 May 2014 (UTC) 
::::I don't have a comment on the canvassing issue, but without looking at the other AfDs I don't see any reason to assume bad faith on the part of the nominator.
::::I did factor in the sources you mentioned when I made my comments, though. I searched myself, as well. As the unspecific possibility of off-line sources is not a compelling argument to me, I remain in the delete camp on this one. --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 22:05, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
