*'''Keep'''. Covered in multiple scholarly books [http://books.google.com/books?id=3_V2lcwyrFwC&lpg=PA275&dq=%22camp%20modin%22&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=%22camp%20modin%22&f=false][http://books.google.com/books?id=ubZvJPO8naEC&lpg=PA33&dq=%22camp%20modin%22&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q=%22camp%20modin%22&f=false][http://books.google.com/books?id=4oTbp8gv_usC&lpg=PA167&dq=%22camp%20modin%22&pg=PA166#v=onepage&q=%22camp%20modin%22&f=false] and more evident at GBooks.  "As the first Hebrew-speaking camp, Modin became the prototype for camps sponsored by every branch of the community, from socialist Zionists to Orthodox Jews."

**Those appear to be minor mentions, not the ''significant coverage'' required by WP:GNG. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 13:49, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - The sources provided by Arxiloxos, particularly the last two, does demonstrate significant enough coverage passing [[WP:GNG]].--[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 19:20, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
**Really? The second of those two says of Camp Modin, {{tq|"An ad in the February 12, 1926 issue of the ''Jewish Chronicle'', for Camp Montrey, for boys, and Camp Owaissa, for girls, exhorted readers to, 'Entrust your Children with a Newark Educator'"}}, and nothing more. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 19:25, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
***Just because one source of several provided is an andvert, that doesn't disqualify the others.  I didn't feel like typing out "except the advert one" because usually editors understand that but it seems I need to in this case.  But in this case, it's not even an ad but a secondary source adding commentary about an historic ad of this topic, yet another acceptable source. --[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 21:43, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
****Sorry, the GBooks link didn't focus on the correct page and may have caused some confusion.  There's more substantive discussion about Camp Modin on the next page (p. 167), where it talks about the camp as an early model of a private Jewish-oriented summer camp, noting that it was "both kosher and Zionistic" and that one counselor was the distinguished rabbi and teacher [[Milton Steinberg]]. This link might work better: [http://books.google.com/books?id=4oTbp8gv_usC&lpg=PA167&dq=%22camp%20modin%22&pg=PA167#v=onepage&q=%22camp%20modin%22%20steinberg&f=false]  Anyway, I think the other links are significant and substantive as well. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 23:09, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 13:49, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', per several Keep arguments above.  Is the nominator going through some list or category of summer camps and nominating them all for deletion, indiscriminately?  [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camp Kawanhee for Boys]] is one other where I voted "Keep", too. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 00:38, 10 May 2014 (UTC) --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 21:52, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
