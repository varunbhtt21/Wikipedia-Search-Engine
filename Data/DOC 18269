A '''[[neutral density filter]]''' is a [[photographic filter|filter]] that reduces or modifies the intensity of all [[wavelength]]s or [[color]]s of light equally, giving no changes in [[hue]] of color rendition. The filter reduces the amount of light entering the lens, allowing the photographer to select combinations of [[aperture]], [[shutter speed|exposure time]] and [[Film speed|sensor sensitivity]] to avoid overexposed pictures. It would normally be attached to the [[camera lens|lens]], but is hand-held here to illustrate the effect.
