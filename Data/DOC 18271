Badré holds a master's degree in History from La Sorbonne, after graduating from the renowned business school [[HEC Paris]] in 1989. He also attended the prestigious ENA ([[École nationale d'administration]]) and [[Sciences Po]]. Badré began his career in 1989 at BFI-Ibexsa, a Franco-American company that is now part of [[Avnet]]. From 1995 to 1999, he worked at the [[French Ministry of Finance]], where he led a number of control, audit and consultancy missions for the French National Audit Office, "Inspection Générale des Finances."

In 1999, Badré joined [[Lazard]], where he became Vice President in the London office, Director in the New York office, and Managing Director in the Paris office. He led several mergers, acquisitions, disposals, and restructuring projects, including the successfully restructuring of Eurotunnel.

In 2002, Badré was a member of the World Panel on Financing Water Infrastructure chaired by [[Michel Camdessus]], a panel of financial experts to assess ways of attracting resources to the water field.

In 2003, Badré joined President [[Jacques Chirac]]’s office in Paris as Advisor and Deputy Africa Personal Representative. In this capacity he supported the organization of the Evian G8 Summit including the G8 Water plan and G8-Nepad partnership. His participation in key international summits (AIDS, Water, UN General Assembly) contributed to designing the financial concept and structure leading to the Iffim/GAVI preliminary discussions. Badré was also involved in drafting the “Landau Report”, which enabled the creation of UNITAID with over 2B$ raised through a small levy on plane tickets.

In 2007, Badré became Group Chief Financial Officer of [[Crédit Agricole]] Group. He played a critical role in crisis management throughout the global financial crisis and the Eurozone crisis. In particular, he ensured the timely initiation of a 5.9Bn Euros rights issue prior to the Lehman bankruptcy and refused to increase the Greek debt exposure in 2008-09. He led intense communication with authorities, clients, shareholders, mutual stakeholders; and reshuffling of financial communication. During his time at [[Crédit Agricole]], Badré also served as Vice Chairman of SFEF, the vehicle created by the government to support banks and financing of the Economy in 2008. Badré was elected Financial Sector CFO of the year in 2011 and number 3 all categories (#1 for CAC 40) in 2010.

Between 2012 and 2013, Badré held the office of Group Chief Financial Officer of [[Société Générale]] Group. He directed treasury, planning and control, accounting, strategy and M&A in a peak crisis period.

In 2013, Badré was appointed Managing Director and CFO of the [[World Bank Group]], becoming G7 and G20 Finance Deputy and a Member of Financial Stability Board. His tenure oversaw a balance sheet optimization, the creation of a finance and risk committee, as well as the complete restructuring of planning process. Badré is particularly known for leading WBG efforts on Financing for Development. He contributed to the breakthrough joint [[International Monetary Fund]]/EIB/[[Multilateral development bank]] “Billions to Trillions” report, focusing on developing countries’ capacity to mobilize public and private resources and on public/private cooperation.

He also co-chairs the Global Future Council of the [[World Economic Forum]] on Sustainable Development, Public Private Cooperation and International governance which promotes the same ideas.

Badré is known for his commitment to delivering both financial value and sustainable growth aligned to the SDG targets. In 2016, Badré founded BlueOrange, which seeks to connect investors interested in combining market level financial returns with measurable social, economic and environmental returns.

He is a young leader of the [[French-American Foundation]] and an alumnus of the [[German Marshall Fund]] of the US.
