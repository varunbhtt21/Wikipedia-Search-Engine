*'''Keep'''-I think it still should pass-it seems good enough from the looks of it. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:34, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. This seems to be legitimately notable as both a former military installation and as a notable geographic location within a national recreation area.  Examples of coverage [http://books.google.com/books?id=8BlSh1UHnRwC&lpg=PA199&dq=%22kirby%20cove%22%20%22battery%20kirby%22&pg=PA198#v=onepage&q=%22kirby%20cove%22%20%22battery%20kirby%22&f=false][http://books.google.com/books?id=DRdKAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA140&dq=%22kirby%20cove%22%20%22battery%20kirby%22&pg=PA140#v=onepage&q=%22kirby%20cove%22%20%22battery%20kirby%22&f=false][http://books.google.com/books?id=s9LRS_xiAfgC&lpg=PA149&dq=%22battery%20kirby%22&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q=%22battery%20kirby%22&f=false] --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 17:25, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**Those appear to be tourist directories, and not the ''significant coverage'' required by [[WP:GNG]]. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 13:44, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per the coverage supplied by Arxiloxos.  WP:GNG makes no discrimination of coverage from travel books.  As long as the coverage is independent of the subject and significant, it suffices.--[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 19:22, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
**"''As long as the coverage is... significant''"- precisely; in this case, it is not. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 19:31, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
***And that coverage is significant.  The primary example [[WP:GNG]] gives to ''non''-significant coverage is a "one sentence mention" in a piece about another topic.  The travel books sources are far beyond a "one sentence mention" and go very into detail of this topic.  That's significant by both WP:GNG and common standards. --[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 21:49, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Arxiloxos, as the site of a former military installation. One could argue for a rename to [[Battery Kirby]], with the park info added to it, but thats another matter, as it wouldnt require deletion.[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 16:47, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
