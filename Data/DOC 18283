==History==
The project's development began in 1993.<ref name=BivinsInfluence/> It was developed in a joint venture between Sueba USA and [[Hypo Bank]] of [[Munich]]. It was built in an area that was originally supposed to have a {{convert|563|acre|ha|adj=on}} office park. That office park, which had been developed for about $70 million,<ref name=Stuart/> was not built due to the [[1980s oil glut|1980s oil bust]]. Michael Baldwin of Sueba stated that originally, the buyers of houses in Parkway Village were retirees.<ref name=Feser>Feser, Katherine. "Unusual luck created cluster of gated villages." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Sunday August 24, 2003. Retrieved on April 30, 2014. Available from the [[Houston Public Library]] [http://houstonpubliclibrary.org/newspapers newspaper service], accessible with a library card number and PIN.</ref> The original plan called for 464 lots.<ref name=Stuart/> From February to October 1993, the first 43 houses in the development were sold.<ref name=Stuart/>

Ralph Bivins of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote that this subdivision "was key to Sueba's winning the Developer of the Year award from the Greater Houston Builders Association."<ref name=BivinsInfluence/> By 2002 the building of houses was almost complete. In 2002 Bivins stated that Lakes of Parkway was "one of the largest communities to be developed inside city limits in recent years."<ref name=BivinsInfluence/> Development of houses in the subdivision ended in 2003.<ref name=SuebaUSA/>
