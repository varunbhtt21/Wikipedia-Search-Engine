Title : Master stability function
Text : {{orphan|date=May 2014}}
In mathematics, the '''master stability function''' is a tool used to analyse the [[stability theory|stability]] of the synchronous state in a [[dynamical system]] consisting of many identical [[oscillator]]s which are coupled together, such as the [[Kuramoto model]]. 

The setting is as follows. Consider a system with <math> N </math> identical oscillators. Without the coupling, they evolve according to the same [[ordinary differential equation|differential equation]], say <math> \dot{x}_i = f(x_i) </math> where <math> x_i </math> denotes the state of oscillator <math> i </math>. A synchronous state of the system of oscillators is where all the oscillators are in the same state.

The coupling is defined by a coupling strength <math> \sigma </math>, a matrix <math> A_{ij} </math> which describes how the oscillators are coupled together, and a function <math> g </math> of the state of a single oscillator. Including the coupling leads to the following equation:
:<math> \dot{x}_i = f(x_i) + \sigma \sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} g(x_j). </math>
It is assumed that the row sums <math> \sum_j A_{ij} </math> vanish so that the manifold of synchronous states is neutrally stable.

The master stability function is now defined as the function which maps the complex number <math> \gamma </math> to the greatest [[Lyapunov exponent]] of the equation
:<math> \dot{y} = (Df + \gamma Dg) y. </math>
The synchronous state of the system of coupled oscillators is stable if the master stability function is negative at <math> \sigma \lambda_k </math> where <math> \lambda_k </math> ranges over the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix <math> A </math>.
