The '''Beta 1''' was  a  non-rigid [[airship]] constructed for experimental purposes in the United Kingdom by the [[Royal Aircraft Factory|Army Balloon Factory]] in 1910.  Reconstructed as '''Beta II''', it was used successfully by the British Army and then by the Royal Naval Air Service as '''HMA No.17''', and was finally struck off charge in 1916.

==Beta 1==

===Design and development===
Beta 1 used the [[gondola (airship)|gondola]] of the British Army Airship No.3 ''Baby'', with a new [[airship#envelope|envelope]] of rubberised fabric.  Rectangular horizontal stabilisers were fitted either side of the tail together with a fixed fin with a rudder mounted on the trailing edge below the tail. A long uncovered framework suspended below the envelope held the 35&nbsp;hp [[Green Engine Co|Green]] water-cooled engine, which drove a pair of 5&nbsp;ft&nbsp;9&nbsp;in (1.75&nbsp;m) diameter two-bladed propellers.  An [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] was mounted on the front of this structure to provide pitch control.<ref name= Lewis/>  As first built, the engine drove a pair of propellers which could be swivelled to provide [[vectored thrust]],<ref name=Fl_30_April_10/> but this arrangement was later replaced with a more conventional chain drive to fixed propellers.

===Operational history===

First flown in April 1910 at Farnborough, after which the engine was removed to make some handling experiments, during which its gondola was damaged.<ref name=Fl_30_April_10>

After repairs a second flight lasting 70 minutes was made on 8 April,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]  |title=Army Airship Out Again |date=16 April 1910|page= 290 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200292.html}}</ref> and on the night of 3â€“4 June 1910 it made a flight from Farnborough to London and back, setting off at 11:39&nbsp;pm and returning at dawn the following morning<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200446.html|title= British Army airship Sails to London|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|date= 11 June 1910}}</ref>
<ref>{{cite newspaper The Times |date=6 June 1910 |articlename= The Army Airship: Night Voyage Over London|issue=39291 |page_number=10|section=News|column=A}}</ref>  A second flight to London was made on 12 July under the command of Captain W. P. L. Brooke-Smith, setting off from Farnborough at 3:40&nbsp;pm and, flying against a {{convert|12|mph|kph|abbr=on}} headwind, reaching central London at about six o'clock. After circling [[St Paul's Cathedral]] it returned to Farnborough, making a short diversion to demonstrate the machine to the King and Queen, who were at [[Aldershot]].<ref>{{cite newspaper The Times |date= 13 July 1910 |articlename= The Army Dirigible Beta|issue= 39323|day_of_week= Wednesday|page_number=12|column= D |section=News}}</ref> 
    
Under the command of Colonel [[John Capper]], Beta was flown in the British Army manoeuvres on Salisbury Plain in September, proving its utility by observing troop dispositions and dropping a sketch map of their dispositions to General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] <ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=British Army Airship "Beta" at Work|date=17 September 1910  |page= 731 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200762.html }}</ref>

In 1911 the first trials with radio communication were made after a return flight from Farnborough to [[Portsmouth]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200094.html|title=Beta and Wireless Telegraphy|date= 4 February 1911|page= 96 }}</ref>   Although two-way radio contact was established, practical communication was made difficult by the noise of the engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/rfc_centenary/british-military-aviation-1862-1912/airships.aspx|publisher=Royal Air Force Museum  |title=Airships|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>

==Beta II==
The airship was rebuilt during 1912 and given a new enlarged envelope of [[goldbeater's skin]].  Its length was increased to {{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}} and its capacity to {{convert|50000|ft3|m3|abbr=on}}. The  gondola was also rebuilt and the engine was replaced by a {{convert|50|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Clerget driving a pair of four-bladed propellers.<ref name=Lewis/>

Beta II made many successful flights. It took part in the 1912 army manoeuvres, fitted expementally with a machine gun.

On 20 June 1913 the [[Edward VIII|Prince of Wales]] was taken for a half-hour flight in Beta II, under the command of [[Edward Maitland (RAF officer)|Major E. M. Maitland]]<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%200700.html|title=No.1 (Airship) Squadron, Farnborough|date=5 July 1913|page=726  }}</ref>
[[File:Army airship Beta RAE-O724.jpg|thumbnail|Beta II moored to a portable mast at Farnborough]]
It was used for the first experiments in mooring airships at a  mast at Farnborough,<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200804.html|title=The Mooring of Airships |author= Scott, G. H.|authorlink=George Herbert Scott  |date=1 December 1921|page= 804}}</ref> and was also used for experiments with aerial photography; during a royal inspection of Farnborough in 1913 a photograph was taken of the royal party from the air, the [[photographic plate|plate]] parachuted to the ground and developed and printed in a mobile darkroom.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=The King's Visit To Aldershot|section= News|day_of_week=  Saturday|date=10 May 1913|page_number=6| issue=40208|column=A}}</ref>

When all airships were taken over by the RNAS in  January 1914 Beta II became HMA No.17. During  December 1914 and January 1915 it was  based at [[Firminy]] near [[Dunkirk]] as part of the Dunkirk Squadron and was used for artillery spotting.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=An Airship Pioneer|section= News|day_of_week= Thursday|date= 25 August 1921|page_number=10|issue=42808|column=B }}</ref>  It was then  used for training at [[RNAS Kingsnorth]].  It was struck off charge in 1916.

The gondola of the Beta II is in the collection of the [[Science Museum, London]], but is not currently on display.
