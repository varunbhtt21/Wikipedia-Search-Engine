'''Qvwm''' is a simple, lightweight [[window manager]], which is intended to be a reimplementation of the [[Windows 95]] interface for [[Linux]] systems. Released in 1996 under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GNU GPL), it features a [[start menu]], a [[taskbar]] incorporating a system tray, and [[Alt-Tab|Windows-like task-switching]]. The project's name comes from wordplay references to Japanese  words and Roman numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/2850/1|title=From the Desktop: Q Stands For QVWM and Quality Sarcasm|last=Proffitt|first=Brian|work=[[LinuxPlanet]]|date=2001-01-02|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> In 2000, ''[[Linux Format]]'' called Qvwm "an unusually impressive imposter".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.tuxradar.com/content/archives-best-window-managers-2000|title=From the archives: the best window managers of 2000|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Linux Format]]|issue=2|date=2009-03-10|origyear=First published in 2000|accessdate=2014-04-30|via=[[TuxRadar]]}}</ref>

Unlike Windows 95's [[Windows registry|registry]], Qvwm uses a textual configuration file. Qvwm includes [[virtual desktop]]s, a feature lacking in Windows 95. One reviewer criticized this practice as "against qvwm's stated purpose."<ref>http://www.gilesorr.com/papers/otherwm2003/x542.html</ref> Apart from standard X libraries, the only [[software library]] it depends on is [[X PixMap]] (libxpm). The developers had intended to develop a full class library called ''libqv'' but this never occurred.

The original author of Qvwm, Kenichi Kourai, no longer maintains it, but in 2006 the project was picked up by Ivan Kurmanov, who applied patches made by the [[Debian]] project and added features of his own.

Qvwm was included in Debian since 1999<ref>{{cite web|title=Debian Package Tracking System - qvwm|url=https://packages.qa.debian.org/q/qvwm.html|website=Debian Package Tracking System|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref> but was removed in early 2009 because of the lack of updates as well as using deprecated libraries.<ref>{{cite web|title=#508232 RM: qvwm -- RoM; buggy, depends on deprecated libs|url=https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=508232|website=Debian Bug report logs|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref>
