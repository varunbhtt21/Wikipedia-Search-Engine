[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] According to DYK check, the article is classified as a stub. You'll need to try dividing it into more sections and expanding slightly. It's long enough (character-wise), new enough, no paraphrasing issues, etc., it just needs to be unstubbified.

:Ah, sorry about that. It ''was'' a stub in its previous incarnation before I expanded it. I've removed the stub rating from the talk page, as that related to the pre-expansion version. I'd say it would probably count as a B-class article now but I'll let someone else assess it. There really isn't much room to expand it further - I used every source I could find.
