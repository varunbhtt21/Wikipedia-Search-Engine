The '''Abijah Richardson Sr. Homestead''' is a historic house on Hancock Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built c. 1795 by Abijah Richardson, a veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]] who moved here from [[Woburn, Massachusetts]].  When built it had basic late Georgian/early Federal styling; the current Greek Revival features were probably added by Richardson's son Malachi.  The house was in the Richardson family until 1980.  A number of other 19th-century Richardson family properties survive in the area.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004070}}|title=NRHP nomination for Abijah Richardson Sr. Homestead|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.<ref name="nris"/>
