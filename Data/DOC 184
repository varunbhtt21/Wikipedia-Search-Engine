The '''Boxers Tour''' was a concert tour by Morrissey, taking place in February 1995. Lasting barely a month, the tour was organized in support of Morrissey's latest single, "Boxers", and the upcoming compilation, "World of Morrissey", as both releases featured boxers prominently. To further highlight the tour's name, Morrissey applied fake bruises and cuts to his face, and used a backdrop of Cornelius Carr, the boxer featured in the single's music video and the sleeve art for the compilation. Worthy to note, it was also Morrissey's first tour in more than two years. Along with a new bassist, who was replacing the former Gary Day, the band stormed through a slew of dates in the UK. 

Out of the tour, two concerts were recorded and released as two official recordings. Two nights, Sheffield and Blackburn were filmed by James O'Brien, and was released the next year, under the title, "Introducing Morrissey". It first aired earlier in late 1995 on British television. The final show, a concert at London's Drury Lane Royal Theatre, was recorded by the BBC for later broadcast. The full concert was rarely aired, most of the broadcasts including only seven songs or less, including commercials. "Billy Budd", "Why Don't You Find Out for Yourself", "Now My Heart Is Full" from the recording were first released on "The Boy Racer" single later in the year. "We'll Let You Know" and "Now My Heart Is Full" was later released on the 2012 single Mael mix of "Suedehead" as b-sides. The full concert, minus encore "Shoplifters of the World Unite" was later released as a second disc on the 20th Anniversary Edition of "Vauxhall & I".
