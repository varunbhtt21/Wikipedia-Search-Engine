:'''delete''' The only thing that is mildy notable is "In 2005, was selected by the National Endowment for the Arts as one of 25 exceptional summer arts programs in the country." and that is backed up by a goverment site announcing an award (I assume, the link is dead), not a [[WP:THIRDPARTY]] source discussing the camp and the award, if this camp is truly notable that should be easy to find.[[User:CombatWombat42|CombatWombat42]] ([[User talk:CombatWombat42|talk]]) 15:20, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I'm finding substantial coverage in reliable independent sources for this camp and will add some of them to the article. The awards and recognitions it has received also help establish notability. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 13:57, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
::Also, the camp's buildings and campus are historic. They were once [[Sheldon Jackson College]], the oldest higher ed school in Alaska. So that really makes it a slam dunk for notability. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 14:13, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''.  Is the nominator going through some list or category of summer camps and nominating them all for deletion, indiscriminately?  I asked this question in another one of the similar AFDs, and the nominator didn't answer the question. [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camp Kawanhee for Boys ]] is one other, out of 5 or more ongoing summer camp AFDs, where I have voted Keep. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 00:36, 10 May 2014 (UTC) --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 21:54, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Delete''' as lacking in depth coverage in independent sources. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 22:47, 11 May 2014 (UTC)</s>
*'''Keep'''.  More sources found and added to the article.  The institution has received statewide coverage in reliable sources (and even a little bit outside Alaska).--[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 20:56, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''merge and redirect''' to [[Sheldon Jackson College]] since much of the coverage is related to this entity. (change of !vote) [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 21:37, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
