The '''International Society for Autonomic Neuroscience''' is a [[scientific society]] of researchers studying the [[autonomic nervous system]]. The society organizes scientific meetings, publishes a [[scientific journal]], and supports students through awards and travel grants. It is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] and [[non-governmental organization]].

== History ==
The society was founded in 1995,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the society |url=http://autonomicneuroscience.info/ISAN/History.html |work=Official website |publisher=International Society for Autonomic Neuroscience |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Incorporated Associations Search, Registration Number: A0031130J |url=https://online.justice.vic.gov.au/cav/br-search-criteria?mode=iaextr |publisher=Consumer Affairs, Victoria |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> because it was felt that the key international society covering [[neuroscience]], the [[International Brain Research Organization]], was not sufficiently representing research on this part of the nervous system. The first president was [[Geoffrey Burnstock]]. Elsewhere, it has been claimed that the society originated because of the ''Journal of Autonomic Neuroscience'',<ref>{{cite journal| last=Koizumi |first=K. |author2=Vassalle, M.  |title=Chandler McCluskey Brooks |journal=Biographical Memoirs |volume=91 |series=Office of the Home Secretary, National Academy of Sciences, National Academies Press |page=67 |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/brooks-chandler-mcc.pdf}}</ref> presumably because discussions amongst the early editors identified lack of scientific exchange, at an international level, amongst researchers in the field.

Initially, scientific meetings were organized every 3 years, before settling into a biennial pattern. Meetings have been held in Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, France, Brazil, Germany and Italy.

== Journal ==
The official journal of the society is ''[[Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical]]''. This journal publishes the congress abstracts and supports student poster and presentation prizes.

== Collaboration with regional societies ==
The society collaborates with several autonomic regional societies, having similar aims, in organizing joint meetings. These societies include: 
* [[American Autonomic Society]]
* [[European Federation of Autonomic Societies]]
* [[Japan Society of Neurovegetative Research]]
