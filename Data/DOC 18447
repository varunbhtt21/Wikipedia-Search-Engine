== Biography ==

Born as Mayra Alejandra Rodríguez Lezama, she was raised in a home of artists and was for sure bound to have some of the same passions. Her father, Charles Barry (born Carlos Rodríguez), was a [[humourist]] and founding member of the long-standing ''[[Radio Rochela#History|Radio Rochela]]'' comedy show, while her mother, Ligia Lezama, was a [[Screenplay#Television|teleplay writer]] and also an able actress. Besides, Mayra's family included her brother Juan Carlos Barry, a humourist like his father, and their uncle Miguel Ángel Barry, a [[Tenor#Lyric tenor|lyric tenor]].<ref name=RCTV>{{cite web |url=http://www.rctv.net/Biografias/VerBiografia.aspx?BiografiaId=142 |title=RCTV.net – Mayra Alejandra biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110044449/http://www.rctv.net/Biografias/VerBiografia.aspx?BiografiaId=142 |archivedate=2005-11-10 |df= }} (Spanish)</ref><ref>[http://www.venezuelaa.com/biografias/23.asp Venezuela.com – Charles Barry entry] (Spanish)</ref><ref>[http://sopotocientos.blogspot.com/2008/04/ligia-lezama-dicta-taller-prctico-de.html Sopotocientos.Blogspot.com – Ligia Lezama entry]</ref><ref>[http://www.venevision.net/estrella/juan-carlos-barry Venevision.net – Juan Carlos Barry biography] (Spanish)</ref>

For most of her career, a Mayra character coped with the unfortunate turn of events that were inevitable in TV melodramas and movies by conveying a tense or worried expression. Her fits of tears or temperament were short and sweet, and it underscored the projected inner strength of her characters that proved a pictorial sense of feminism. Her technique was  spontaneous and effective, but her acting genius and rhetoric relied on her expressive eyes and the graceful stylings of her hands.

After attending high school, Mayra made her debut in the [[RCTV|Radio Caracas Television]] [[telenovela]] ''Valentina'' (1975). Then, her first starring role was in ''Angélica'' (1976), where she played a character created especially designed for her by her mother Ligia Lezama. Later, the young actress excelled in ''La hija de Juana Crespo'' (1977), an effective drama from [[Salvador Garmendia]] and [[José Ignacio Cabrujas]].<ref name=iMDB/>

Mayra next appeared in another hit, ''[[Luisana Mia]]'' (1981), but she is best remembered for her strong performance in ''[[Leonela]]'' (1983), where she played the role of a rape victim falling in love with her rapist. She also appeared in sympathetic parts in ''[[Bienvenida Esperanza]]'' (1983), ''[[Marta y Javier]]'' (1983) and ''[[La Mujer Prohibida]]'' (1991).<ref name=iMDB/>

Nevertheless, Mayra only needed two films to create a perennial image of [[femme fatale]] inside Venezuelan cinema.

In 1978 she portrayed the ill-fated ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]''  of [[Prosper Mérimée]], as sensual as unprejudiced, dragged itself to tragedy, in [[Román Chalbaud]]'s adaptation ''Carmen la que contaba 16 años''.<ref name=iMDB/>

Eight years later she repeated her success as a troubled woman, but perhaps more fragile, more lover and friendly that Carmen, while characterizing the seductive and promiscuous [[Manon Lescaut]] of [[Antoine François Prévost|Abbé Prévost]]. In ''Manón'', a reasonably faithful adaptation made by Chalbaud, Mayra projected an unforced dignity that bolstered her image and established herself as a reliable actress.<ref name=iMDB/>

Eventually, she appeared in a bunch of [[TV series]] and  [[Stage (theatre)|stage]].<ref name=UNIVERSAL>{{cite web |url=http://www.eluniversal.com/arte-y-entretenimiento/091220/mayra-alejandra-yo-no-vivo-del-pasado |title= El Universal – Mayra Alejandra : 2009 interview (Spanish)}}</ref>

In contrast to her controversial characters, Mayra lived a quiet life and was devoted to God and family values, but never thought of herself as a sex symbol.<ref name=UNIVERSAL/>

In the 1990s, she took this time at the height of her popularity to go on sabbatical to take care of her child. Motherhood was part of her public image, and her own children frequently was featured in fan magazine articles and photographs.<ref name=UNIVERSAL/>

Still beautiful at 45, Mayra went back to work in 2000, appearing as a guest star in the [[Venevisión]] telenovela ''[[Hechizo de Amor]]''. In her later collaborations, she had become typed as a mother, usually playing the parent of grown-up children, appearing as characters that were older than herself, thus acquiring an older image that belied her actual age. Adapting to her new support role, she made significant appearances in ''[[Estrambótica Anastasia]]'' (2004)  and ''[[Harina de Otro Costal|Harina de otro costal]]'' (2010), a contemporary and correct version of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.<ref name=UNIVERSAL/>

During her career, Mayra starred alongside leading men as [[Miguel Ángel Landa|Miguelángel Landa]], both in television and films, as well as with [[Carlos Olivier]], [[José Luis Rodríguez (singer)|José Luis Rodríguez]] and [[Jean Carlo Simancas]]. Twice married and divorced, she was the mother of Aaron Salvador Pineda, born from her relationship with Mexican actor [[Salvador Pineda]].<ref name=iMDB/><ref name=RCTV/>

In 2012, Mayra Alejandra announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer. She subsequently received [[chemotherapy]] treatment, being able to regain a level of normalcy in her life. She suffered a relapse in early 2014, and died in Caracas on April 17 at the age of 58.<ref>[http://www.noticierodigital.com/2014/04/fallecio-tambien-mayra-alejandra-rodriguez/ Noticiero Digital – Obituary]</ref>
