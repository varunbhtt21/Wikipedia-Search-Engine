'''Nalapat Narayana Menon''' (October 7, 1887 – October 31, 1954) was a [[Malayalam language]] author from [[Kerala|Kerala state]], [[South India]].<ref>[http://www.keralasahityaakademi.org/sp/Writers/Profiles/Nalappat/Html/NalappatPage.htm "Nalapat Narayana Menon"]. [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi]]. Retrieved April 30, 2014.</ref> His oeuvre consists of poems, plays and translations. His best known works include ''Paavangal'', a translation of [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'', and the elegy ''Kannuneerthulli''.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Punnayurkulam]], [[Ponnani taluk]] in [[North Kerala|South Malabar]] on 7 October 1887. He obtained English education from [[Kunnamkulam]], [[Trichur]] and  [[Calicut]]. While he was 18, he met poet [[Vallathol]] and became his chief companion.

==Literary career==
Vallathol's influence is obvious in his early poems. He was also influenced by [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] and was an atheist for most of his youth. Later he developed strong interest in [[Indian philosophy]] and religion and was influenced by the ideas of [[Dayananda Saraswati]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]]. Most of his early prose works were on subjects related to [[Indian philosophy]]. His most famous poem ''Kannuneerthulli'' (Tear Drop) was an [[elegy]] written after the death of his wife. ''Paavangal'', a translation of [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'', was a milestone in the history of [[Malayalam literature]] and it set off a social reformation of sorts in Kerala. Despite being a translation, it gifted Malayalam a new prose style. Literary critic [[M. Leelavathy]] notes: "The translation was an extraordinary phenomenon as it prepared the ground for the Communist movement to take roots in Kerala. With its philosophy of human equality, the heart-wrenching tale of the oppressed left a profound impact in our society. For E.M.S. Namboodiripad, this was Nalapatan's best work. Its influence was both sociological and philological."<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/how-paavangal-enriched-kerala/article3447976.ece "How Paavangal enriched Kerala…"]</ref>

==Personal life==
Nalapat was the uncle of poet [[Balamani Amma]] and the grand uncle of renowned writer [[Kamala Surayya]] (Madhavikutty or Kamala Das)  and Dr. Suvarna Nalapt, writer and music therapy researcher. He is fondly referred to as ''Valiyammavan'' by Madhavikutty in her books such as ''Neermathalam Pootha Kaalam''.  ''Lokantharangalil'' was an elegy by Balamani Amma on the death of Nalapat Narayana Menon.<ref name=hindu_sep04>{{cite news|title=A prolific writer|url=http://hindu.com/2004/09/30/stories/2004093011150400.htm|accessdate=April 30, 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date= September 30, 2004}}</ref>
