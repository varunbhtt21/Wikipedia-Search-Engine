In interviews Van de Leest indicated that her priorities are aimed at strengthening privacy rights and opposing [[cashless society|abolishing cash]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w89C0jZmJ-Y|title=Boris van de Ven interviewt Ancilla Tilia; Over privacy en veiligheid |author=Cafe Weltschmerz|publisher=Cafe Weltschmerz}}</ref> She foresees a development in which high costs are imposed on entrepreneurs who use cash in order to stimulate [[digital currency]]. This she sees as a privacy undermining development in which a person can be followed on the basis of their payment history. In addition to privacy rights in general, the party specifically focuses on strengthening privacy in the relationship between the government and its citizens, as the government poses a greater risk than corporations of infringing their fundamental rights. In September 2016 she stood up for the victims of a data breach in the town of [[Almelo]].

On 6 April 2017, Ancilla announced<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ncilla/vertrek-bij-de-piratenpartij-62f7f4b98113|title=Vertrek bij de Piratenpartij|date=2017-04-06|website=Ancilla van de Leest|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> that she would be leaving the Pirate Party as front-runner and would instead focus on her own projects. She will be a passive member and is going to continue to give advice to future party members.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}
