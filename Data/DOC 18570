While being a doctor is notable to many, not quite for Wikipedia, the links are basically for resumes for this guy and it basically looks like a classic advertisement when it is all said and done. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:30, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::*'''Comment'''-Now I do see he has written some stuff-but as another article came up saying that was under an afd that was similar (actually it had a lot more info even) it is not considered notable still. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:33, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Far too little impact on literature yet. Far too early. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 02:39, 1 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Delete'''. An h-index of only 6. Much too early. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.89.120|101.117.89.120]] ([[User talk:101.117.89.120|talk]]) 04:21, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
