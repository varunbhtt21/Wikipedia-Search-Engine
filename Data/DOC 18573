[[File:Wikipedia Gender Gap Revisited journal.pone.0065782.t002.png|thumb|upright=2|A [[peer reviewed]] analysis of survey responses found that less than 25 % of English Wikipedia editors from USA are female]]

'''Gender bias on Wikipedia''' reflects the fact that a dominant majority of volunteer Wikipedia editors, particularly on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language site]], are male. This has led to Wikipedia having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

It figures among the most frequent [[criticism of Wikipedia|criticisms of Wikipedia]], and part of a more general criticism about [[systemic bias in Wikipedia]]. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which runs Wikipedia, agrees with these criticisms and has made an ongoing attempt to increase female editorship of Wikipedia. [[Edit-a-thon]]s have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.<ref name=tnw>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/tech/2019/03/19/physicist-has-written-over-500-biographies-female-scientists-wikipedia/|website=thenextweb.com|first=Cara|last=Curtis|year=2019|title=This physicist has written over 500 biographies of women scientists on Wikipedia|publisher=[[The Next Web]]}}</ref><ref name=indy500>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/science-women-wikipedia-biography-sexism-academia-physics-a-level-a8773631.html|website=independent.co.uk|title=This is why I’ve written 500 biographies of female scientists on Wikipedia|first=Jessica|last=Wade|year=2019|publisher=[[The Independent]]|authorlink=Jess Wade}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that Wikipedia's female participation rate may be in line with other "public thought-leadership forums".<ref name=Cohen110130 /> In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.<ref name=Clubhouse>{{cite web |url = http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lam/papers/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf |title = WP:Clubhouse?

In the English Wikipedia and five other language editions that were studied by researchers, the ratio of articles about women to articles about men was higher than in three other databases. However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to overuse words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the "null gender" (in other words, that "male" is assumed unless otherwise specified, an example of [[male as norm]]).<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |title = Computational Linguistics Reveals How Wikipedia Articles Are Biased Against Women |last = arXiv |first = Emerging Technology from the |work = MIT Technology Review |access-date = 21 August 2017 }}</ref> Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about "what matters". To illustrate this point they noted that [[List of pornographic actresses by decade|the page listing pornographic actresses]] was better organized than [[List of women writers|the page listing women writers]].<ref name=GuardianAugust2014>''[[The Guardian]]'' 2014 (London) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth The Guardian view on Wikipedia: evolving truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212758/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth |date=November 12, 2016 }}</ref>

In 2010, [[United Nations University]] and [[UNU-MERIT]] jointly presented an overview of the results of a global Wikipedia survey.<ref name=WPSurvey2010>{{cite web |title = Wikipedia Survey: Overview Results |url = http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |last1 = Glott |first1 = Ruediger |last2 = Schmidt |first2 = Philipp |last3 = Ghosh |first3 = Rishab |date = March 2010 |website =  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |archivedate = 14 April 2010 |accessdate = 11 August 2014 }}</ref> A 30 January 2011, ''New York Times'' article cited this [[Wikimedia Foundation]] collaboration, which indicated that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women.  [[Sue Gardner]], then executive director of the foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia "as good as it could be". Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the "obsessive fact-loving realm", associations with the "hard-driving hacker crowd", and the necessity to be "open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists".<ref name=Cohen110130>{{cite news |last = Cohen |first = Noam |date = 30 January 2011 |title = Define Gender Gap?

In February 2011, ''The New York Times'' followed up with a series of opinions on the subject under the banner, "Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?"<ref name=WhereAretheWomen>{{cite news |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date = 2 February 2011 |title = Where Are the Women in Wikipedia? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 9 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715112226/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Susan Herring|Susan C. Herring]], a professor of information science and linguistics, said that she was not surprised by the Wikipedia contributors' gender gap. She said that the often contentious nature of Wikipedia article "talk" pages, where article content is discussed, is unappealing to many women, "if not outright intimidating".<ref name=Herring110204>{{cite news |last = Herring |first = Susan C. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Communication Styles Make a Difference |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724050237/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |archivedate = 24 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Joseph Reagle|Joseph M. Reagle]] reacted similarly, saying that the combination of a "culture of hacker elitism", combined with the disproportionate effect of high-conflict members (a minority) on the community atmosphere, can make it unappealing. He said, "the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used (a) to suppress concerns about inappropriate or offensive speech as "censorship" and (b) to rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of their personal preference and choice."<ref name=Reagle110204>{{cite news |last = Reagle |first = Joseph M. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = 'Open' Doesn't Include Everyone |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113229/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Justine Cassell]] said that although women are as knowledgeable as men, and as able to defend their point of view, "it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one’s position is often still seen as a male stance, and women’s use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations."<ref name=Cassell110204>{{cite news |last = Cassell |first = Justine |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Editing Wars Behind the Scenes |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227113525/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |archivedate = 27 February 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The ''[[International Journal of Communication]]'' published research by Reagle and Lauren Rhue that examined the coverage, gender representation, and article length of thousands of biographical subjects on the English-language Wikipedia and the online ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. They concluded that Wikipedia provided better coverage and longer articles in general, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than ''Britannica'' in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women were more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to ''Britannica''. That is, Wikipedia dominated ''Britannica'' in biographical coverage, but more so when it comes to men. Similarly, one might say that ''Britannica'' is more balanced in whom it neglects to cover than Wikipedia. For both reference works, article length did not consistently differ by gender.<ref name="Reagle-Rhue">{{cite journal |last1 = Reagle |first1 = Joseph |last2 = Rhue |first2 = Lauren |title = Gender Bias in Wikipedia and ''Britannica'' |url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |year = 2011 |journal = International Journal of Communication |volume = 5 |publisher = Joseph Reagle & Lauren Rhue |pages = 1138–1158 |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322081809/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631 |archivedate = 22 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

In April 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation conducted its first semi-annual Wikipedia survey. It suggested that 9% of Wikipedia editors are women. It also reported, "Contrary to the perception of some, our data shows that very few women editors feel like they have been harassed, and very few feel Wikipedia is a sexualized environment."<ref name=WES2011>{{cite web |url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |title = Wikipedia Editors Study: Results From ''The Editor Survey, April 2011'' |date = April 2011 |website = [[Wikipedia]] |accessdate = 18 May 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141226041321/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |archivedate = 26 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> However, an October 2011 paper at the [[WikiSym|International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration]] found evidence that suggested that Wikipedia may have "a culture that may be resistant to female participation".<ref name=WPClubhouse>{{cite conference |last1 = Lam |first1 = Shyong K. |last2 = Uduwage |first2 = Anuradha |last3 = Dong |first3 = Zhenhua |last4 = Sen |first4 = Shilad |last5 = Musicant |first5 = David R. |last6 = Terveen |first6 = Loren |last7 = Reidl |first7 = John |date = October 2011 |title = WP:Clubhouse?

A study published in 2014 found that there is also an "Internet skills gap" with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely Wikipedia contributors are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the "skills gap" exacerbates the gender gap among editors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Hargittai |first1 = Eszter |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |title = Mind the skills gap: the role of Internet know-how and gender in differentiated contributions to Wikipedia |journal = Information, Communication & Society |date = 4 November 2014 |pages = 424–442 |doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2014.957711 |volume = 18 |issue = 4 }}</ref> During 2010–14, women made up 61% of participants of the college courses arranged by the Wiki Education Foundation program that included editing Wikipedia as part of the curriculum. Their contributions were found to shift the Wikipedia content from pop-culture and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] towards social sciences and humanities.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |title = Wikipedia grows up on college campuses |author = Bruce Maiman |date = 23 September 2014 |website = [[The Sacramento Bee]] |accessdate = 23 September 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140923224639/http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |archivedate = 23 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2016, Wagner et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Wagner |first1 = Claudia |last2 = Graells-Garrido |first2 = Eduardo |last3 = Garcia |first3 = David |last4 = Menczer |first4 = Filippo |title = Women through the glass ceiling: gender asymmetries in Wikipedia |journal = EPJ Data Science |date = 1 March 2016 |doi = 10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0066-4 |volume = 5 |number = 5|arxiv = 1601.04890 }}</ref> found that gender inequality manifests itself in Wikipedia's biographical content in multiple ways, including unequal thresholds for determining a subject's notability, topical bias, linguistic bias, and structural inequalities. The authors found that when editors determine if a subject is notable enough to include on Wikipedia, they hold women to a higher standard of notability, resulting in women on Wikipedia being slightly more notable than men on Wikipedia. As for topical bias, biographies about women tend to focus more on family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics. This is especially true for biographies of women born before 1900. The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.

A 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]]. The study concluded that:<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Shane-Simpson |first1=Christina |last2=Gillespie-Lynch |first2=Kristen |title=Examining potential mechanisms underlying the Wikipedia gender gap through a collaborative editing task |journal=[[Computers in Human Behavior]] |date=January 2017 |volume=66 |pages=312–328 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.043|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01612306/document }}</ref> {{quote |text = ...visible female editors on Wikipedia and broader encouragement of the use of constructive feedback may begin to alleviate the Wikipedia gender gap.

A study by Ford and Wajcman observes that research on the gender bias continues to frame the problem as a deficit in women. In contrast, their central argument states that infrastructure studies in [[feminist technoscience]] allows the gender analysis to be taken to a further level. It looks at three issues within the infrastructure: content policies, software, and the legalistic framework of operation. It suggests that progress can be made through altering that culture of [[knowledge production]] through encouraging alternate knowledge, reducing the technical barriers to editing, and addressing the complexity of Wikipedia policies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Ford |first1 = Heather |last2 = Wajcman |first2 = Judy |title = 'Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia and the gender gap |journal = Social Studies of Science |date = 2017 |url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228081909/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |archivedate = 28 December 2016 |df = dmy-all | doi = 10.1177/0306312717692172 |pmid = 28791929 |volume=47 |issue = 4 |pages=511–527}}</ref>

In February 2018, in the Pipeline of Online Participation Inequalities, Shaw and Hargittai concluded from their studies that to solve the problems of participation inequality including gender bias requires a boarder focus on subjects other than inequality.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Aaron|last2=Hargittai|first2=Eszter|date=2018-02-01|title=The Pipeline of Online Participation Inequalities: The Case of Wikipedia Editing|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=68|issue=1|pages=143–168|doi=10.1093/joc/jqx003|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> A focus on encouraging participants of all education and skill level, and age groups will help Wikipedia to improve.

In October 2018, when [[Donna Strickland]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], numerous write-ups mentioned that she did not previously have a Wikipedia page.

Several causes for this gender disparity have been suggested. A 2010 study revealed a Wikipedia female participation rate of 13 percent, observed to be close to the 15 percent overall female participation rate of other "public thought-leadership forums".<ref name=Cohen110130 /><ref name="Signpost-2013-07-31">{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2013-07-31/Recent_research |title = Recent research&nbsp;— Napoleon, Michael Jackson and Srebrenica across cultures, 90% of Wikipedia better than Britannica, WikiSym preview |last = Yasseri |first = Taha |last2 = Liao |first2 = Han-Teng |last3 = Konieczny |first3 = Piotr |last4 = Morgan |first4 = Jonathan |last5 = Bayer |first5 = Tilman |date = 31 July 2013 |work = [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost|The Signpost]] |publisher = [[Wikipedia]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150617074727/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2013-07-31/Recent_research |archivedate = 17 June 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Wikipedia research fellow Sarah Stierch acknowledged that it is "fairly common" for Wikipedia contributors to remain gender-anonymous.<ref name="DailyDotStierch">{{cite web |url = http://www.dailydot.com/society/wikipedia-gender-gap-sarah-stierch/ |title = The women of Wikipedia: Closing the site's giant gender gap |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150703203120/http://www.dailydot.com/society/wikipedia-gender-gap-sarah-stierch/ |archivedate = 3 July 2015 |df = dmy-all |date = 24 January 2013 }}</ref> A perceived unwelcoming culture and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap.<ref name="CSM-misogyny">{{cite journal |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2013/0801/In-UK-rising-chorus-of-outrage-over-online-misogyny |title = In UK, rising chorus of outrage over online misogyny |journal = Christian Science Monitor |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704200524/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2013/0801/In-UK-rising-chorus-of-outrage-over-online-misogyny |archivedate = 4 July 2015 |df = dmy-all |date = August 2013 }}</ref> According to a 2013 study,<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url = http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/morgan_cscw2013_final.pdf |title = Tea & Sympathy: Crafting Positive New User Experiences on Wikipedia |author = Jonathan T.

Former Wikimedia Foundation executive director [[Sue Gardner]] cited nine reasons why women don't edit Wikipedia, culled from comments by female [[Wikipedia community|Wikipedia editors]]:<ref name=Gardner110219>{{cite web |last = Gardner |first = Sue |date = 19 February 2011 |title = Nine Reasons Why Women Don't Edit Wikipedia, In Their Own Words |url = http://suegardner.org/2011/02/19/nine-reasons-why-women-dont-edit-wikipedia-in-their-own-words/ |type = blog |website = suegardner.org |accessdate = }}</ref>

Though the proportion of female readership to male readership on Wikipedia is roughly equal (47%), females are less likely to convert themselves to editors (16%). Several studies suggest that there may be a formed culture in Wikipedia that discourages women from participating.<ref name="WPClubhouse3">{{cite conference|last1=Lam|first1=Shyong K.|last2=Uduwage|first2=Anuradha|last3=Dong|first3=Zhenhua|last4=Sen|first4=Shilad|last5=Musicant|first5=David R.|last6=Terveen|first6=Loren|authorlink6=Loren Terveen|last7=Reidl|first7=John|authorlink7=John T.

Collier and Bear in 2012 summarized the reason for working barriers of women in Wikipedia in three words: conflict, criticism and confidence. Conflict means [[online harassment]], [[trolling]] and competition which women generally do not like; Criticism refers to women's unwillingness to edit someone else's work and to let their work be edited by someone else; Confidence shows that women are often not too confident about themselves's expertise and ability in editing and contributing to a certain work.<ref name=":04" /> Wikipedia's free to edit policy gives Internet users an open platform, while also unconsciously breed a competitive and criticism environment that limits women's incentives to work.

Through examining the power infrastructure of Wikipedia, Ford and Wajcman pointed out another cause that may reinforce Wikipedia's gender bias. Editing on Wikipedia requires "particular forms of [[Sociotechnical system|sociotechnical]] expertise and authority that constitute the knowledge or [[epistemological]] infrastructure of Wikipedia".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Heather|last2=Wajcman|first2=Judy|date=August 2017|title='Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia's infrastructure and the gender gap|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=47|issue=4|pages=511–527|doi=10.1177/0306312717692172|pmid=28791929|issn=0306-3127|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/1/Wajcman_Anyone%20can%20edit_Final_2017.pdf}}</ref>  People who are equipped with these expertise and skill are more likely to position with power in the Wikipedia. The other, however, are left out, which a large part are women.

Studies also look the gender bias on Wikipedia through a historical perspective. Konieczny and Klein indicated that Wikipedia is just a part of our biased society which has a long history of [[gender inequality]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Konieczny|first=Piotr|last2=Klein|first2=Maximilian|date=December 2018|title=Gender gap through time and space: A journey through Wikipedia biographies via the Wikidata Human Gender Indicator|journal=New Media & Society|volume=20|issue=12|pages=4608–4633|doi=10.1177/1461444818779080|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> As Wikipedia records daily activities by individual editors, it serves as both "a reflection of the world" and "a tool used to produce <our world>".<ref name=":12" /> Even though gender bias is slowly progressing, it remains an existing problem.

== Reactions ==

The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that "in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia. 'Women see technology more as a tool they use to accomplish tasks, rather than something fun in itself.{{'"}}<ref name=Huang130811>{{cite news |last = Huang |first = Keira |date = 11 August 2013 |title = Wikipedia fails to bridge gender gap |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |newspaper = South China Morning Post |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160115195821/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |archivedate = 15 January 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Wikistorm2013>{{cite web |url = http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |title = Wikistorming |date = Fall 2013 |website = FemTechNet |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150717034630/http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |archivedate = 17 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> In 2011, the Foundation set a target of having 25 percent of its contributors identifying as female by 2015.<ref name=Cohen110130 /> In August 2013, Gardner said, "I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation."<ref name=Huang130811 />

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2011, [[Heather Mac Donald]] called Wikipedia's gender imbalance a "non-problem in search of a misguided solution." Mac Donald asserted, "The most straightforward explanation for the differing rates of participation in Wikipedia—and the one that conforms to everyday experience—is  that, on average, males and females have different interests and preferred ways of spending their free time."<ref>{{cite web |last = Mac Donald |first = Heather |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/02/wikipedia_is_maledominated_that_doesnt_mean_its_sexist.html |title = Wikipedia Is Male-Dominated.

In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] announced in a BBC interview the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s plans for "doubling down" on the gender content gap at Wikipedia. Wales said the Foundation would be open to more outreach and more software changes.<ref name="BBC">[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 Wikipedia 'completely failed' to fix gender imbalance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004148/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 |date=29 December 2016 }}, [[BBC]] interview with [[Jimmy Wales]], 8 August 2014; starting at 45 seconds.</ref>

== Efforts to increase female editorship ==
[[File:Giants in the field of Women in the Arts 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Attendees at the 2013 Women in the Arts edit-a-thon in Washington, DC]]

Dedicated [[edit-a-thon]]s have been organized to increase the coverage of women's topics in Wikipedia and to encourage more women to edit Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |title = Closing Wikipedia's Gender Gap — Reluctantly |work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 11 February 2014 |accessdate = 27 August 2014 |author = Stoeffel |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140902160836/http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |archivedate = 2 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> These events are supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which sometimes provides mentors and technology to help guide newer editors through the process. Recent edit-a-thons have given specific focus to topics such as Australian female neuroscientists and women in Jewish history.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2015/05/wikipedia-has-colossal-problem-women-dont-edit-it |title = The Wikipedia wars: does it matter if our biggest source of knowledge is written by men? |work = newstatesman.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150602222518/http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2015/05/wikipedia-has-colossal-problem-women-dont-edit-it |archivedate = 2 June 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

[[VisualEditor]], a project funded by the Wikimedia Foundation that allows for [[WYSIWYG]]-style editing on Wikipedia, is said to be aimed in part at closing the gender gap.<ref name="Slate Middleton">{{cite web |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/13/kate_middleton_s_wedding_gown_and_wikipedia_s_gender_gap_.html |title = Kate Middleton's wedding gown and Wikipedia's gender gap. |date = 13 July 2012 |accessdate = 4 December 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141203174753/http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/13/kate_middleton_s_wedding_gown_and_wikipedia_s_gender_gap_.html |archivedate = 3 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The [[Wikipedia:Teahouse/About|Wikipedia Teahouse]] project was launched with the goal to provide a user-friendly environment for newcomers, with a particular goal of boosting women's participation in Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://dub.washington.edu/pubs/364 |title = Tea & Sympathy: Crafting Positive New User Experiences on Wikipedia |website = washington.edu |publisher = Proc.

In July 2014, the [[National Science Foundation]] announced that it would spend $200,000 to study systemic gender bias on Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/|title=Government-Funded Study: Why Is Wikipedia Sexist?|author=Elizabeth Harrington|date=30 July 2014|work=[[Washington Free Beacon]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801062009/http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/|archivedate=1 August 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Many [[WikiProject|Wikiprojects]] are committed to promoting editors' contribution on gender and female studies, which include "WikiProject women, WikiProject feminism, WikiProject gender studies, and the WikiProject countering systemic bias/gender gap task force".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1= K. |year=2017|title = Why women should be editing Wikipedia|journal= Women's Studies Journal|volume= 31|issue=1|pages= 94–99|oclc= 14929028|issn=0112-4099}}</ref>

An early-2015 initiative to create a "women-only" space for Wikipedia editors was strongly opposed by Wikipedians.<ref>Paling, Emma, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ How Wikipedia Is Hostile to Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021174625/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/how-wikipedia-is-hostile-to-women/411619/ |date=21 October 2015 }}", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', 21 October 2015 {{Subscription or advertising}}</ref>
