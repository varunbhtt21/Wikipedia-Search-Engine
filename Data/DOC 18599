'''Héctor Garza Lozano Vela''' (January 9, 1917 &ndash; November 2, 1969), better known under the [[ring name]] '''Tonina Jackson''', was  a  Mexican actor and professional wrestler. He was nicknamed ''Cara de niño'' ("Baby face") and worked under such names as '''Héctor Lozano''', '''Gordo Lozano''' and '''Pancho Morales''' in the southern United States. He is not related to a wrestler known as "Tonina Jackson Jr." who made his debut in the 21st century.

The height of his success was in the 1950s and early 1960s where he even had a soft drink named after himself, the "Tonina". He also appeared in a number of [[lucha films]], including the first four films of the ''[[Huracán Ramírez (film)|Huracán Ramírez]]'' series.

==Professional wrestling career==
Lozano's first recorded match as a professional wrestler took place in 1940 where he defeated Ray Zavalza at show in [[Tampico, Tamaulipas]], using the [[ring name]] Tonina Jackson.<ref name=CageMatches>{{cite web | url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=16535&page=4 | title=Tonina Jackson > Matches | accessdate=February 7, 2017 | work=CageMatch}}</ref> In subsequent years Lozano worked for various professional wrestling promotions across the United States under a number of different names. In 1942 he used the ring name "Great JoJo" while competing in New York.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bilanzen&wrestler=15414&jahr=1942&monat=2 | title=Match Statistics for Tonina Jackson > February 1942  | work=WrestlingData}}</ref>

In 1945 he began working for the [[NWA Mid-America|Roy Welch promotion]] in Alabama, becoming a mainstay for the promotion under the name "Garza Lozano". While working for Roy Welch he often teamed up with Jack Purdin. The duo defeated Herb and Roy Welch to win the Welch promotion's [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version)|World Tag Team Championship]] on April 30, 1945.<ref name=WorldTag/> Months later it was reported that the duo won the promotion's  [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship|Southern Tag Team Championship]], defending it against Nick Carter and Sailor Watkins on November 26, 1945.<ref name=SouthernTag/> Records are unclear as to whether or not it was the same championship belts that were used with a slightly different name.<ref name=WorldTag/><ref name=SouthernTag/> It is unclear when the two lost either championship.<ref name=WorldTag/><ref name=SouthernTag/> In 1949 he began working for the Kansas City-based [[Central States Wrestling]],<ref name=CageMatches/> and would later work for them under the name "Great Tonino".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.f4wonline.com/other-wrestling/daily-pro-wrestling-history-1128-crusher-wins-awa-world-title-202606 | title=Daily Pro Wrestling History (11/28): The Crusher wins AWA World Title | date=November 28, 2015 | accessdate=February 7, 2017 | work=Wrestling Observer Figure Four Online | first=Brian | last=Hoops}}</ref>

In the early 1950s he began working regularly in Mexico as well, becoming headliner for [[Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL). At some point he defeated Indio peon in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match", forcing Indio peon to have all his hair shaved off as a result.<ref name=AztecaDeportes/> During this time he developed a long running, intense storyline feud with masked wrestler [[Médico Asesino]], propelling Jackson to the main event position and making him very popular with the fans as he fought against the "evil" Médico Asesino. On July 26, 1952, Jackson was forced to have his hair shaved off as he lost a ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match to Médico Asesino<ref name="EncyMedicoAsesino"/> In 1955 Lozano, billed as Great Tonina, worked for several southern California promotions, including several matches against [[Nick Bockwinkel]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/ResultsArchive/Wrestlers/bockwinkel.html| title=Nick Bockwinkel | work=Slam Wrestling | publisher=Canoe.com | accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> He later worked for Southwest Sports in Texas, splitting his time between the US and Mexico.<ref name=CageMatches/>

On April 20, 1960, Jackson lost his third and last ''Lucha de Apuestas'' match on record when he was defeated by the masked [[Torbellino Blanco]] and once again had to have his hair shaved off.<ref name="EncyTorbelino"/> His last known match took place on July 3, 1968, in Florida.<ref name=CageMatches/>
