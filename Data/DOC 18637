== History ==

It was founded in 1930 as The Day School for the [[Church of the Heavenly Rest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] church located on [[Fifth Avenue]] at 90th street. In 1997, the school was renamed in honor of the late Paul Trevor, an early Board President.<ref name=history/>

In 1991, the school took over the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew L. |last=Yarrow |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Slump Not Exclusive, Private Schools Find |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/18/nyregion/slump-not-exclusive-private-schools-find.html |date=February 18, 1991}}</ref> (which itself was a merger of two schools, [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden]] and [[New Lincoln School|New Lincoln]])<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Education Week]] |title=Private Schools |url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1988/06/22/x39pris.h07.html |date=June 22, 1988}}</ref> and acquired the Goodman Building at 1 West 88th Street. It refurbished the building and until May 2015 used it to house the Upper School opened for sixth through twelfth grades. The Goodman Building is now home to the Lower School for Pre K through fifth grade.

Recently, Trevor Day bought 312 East 95th Street by Ken Kal LLC, which would now be the home for the upper school. The new building, which opened in May 2015, is approximately 101,243 square-feet and 12 stories high.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trevor.org/page/about-us/facilities--virtual-tours|title=Trevor Day School NYC - Manhattan Private School Tour|website=www.trevor.org}}</ref> The new building uses a sustainable [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] heating and cooling system that reduces energy consumption. Trevor Day School is the first school in Manhattan to use geothermal technology.<ref>
