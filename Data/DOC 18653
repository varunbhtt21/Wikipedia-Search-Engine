The '''Joliet Area Historical Museum''' is a historical museum located in [[Joliet, Illinois]].  The museum documents the history of Joliet and surrounding [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]].

==Description and history==
The museum adaptively reuses an urban space formerly occupied by the Ottawa Street Methodist Church, which was designed by Joliet architect G. Julian Barnes and built in 1909.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofjoliet.info/index.aspx?page=414 |title=Joliet - Local Landmarks: Ottawa Street Methodist Church |accessdate=July 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141005165238/http://www.cityofjoliet.info/index.aspx?page=414 |archivedate=October 5, 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://jolietlibrary.org/local-history/joliet-remembers-1910s-ottawa-street-church |title=Joliet Remembers, the 1910s: the Ottawa Street M.E.

This newer part of the museum also connects to the historic Joliet Chamber of Commerce Clubhouse next door (now known as the Renaissance Center of the City Center campus of [[Joliet Junior College]]) and to the JJC Renaissance Center's main dining room, which is staffed by the college's hospitality and culinary school students and open to the public.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jjc.edu/about/community-interests/renaissance-center/Pages/default.aspx |title=JJC Renaissance Center |accessdate=July 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812015216/http://jjc.edu/about/community-interests/renaissance-center/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=August 12, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

During the late 20th century, formerly rural Will County townships grew rapidly, while properties in central city Joliet were threatened.  In 2002, the former church's urban space was reconfigured as a historic museum.  A separate wing is home to an exhibit about the Joliet-raised NASA engineer and JJC graduate [[John C. Houbolt]], honored as the chief conceptualizer of the [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous|lunar orbit rendezvous]] segment of the U.S. [[Apollo program]] and the use of a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] to shuttle astronauts to and from the surface of the [[Moon]].<ref name="JAHM">{{cite web |url=http://www.jolietmuseum.org/|title=Joliet Area Historical Museum |work=Joliet Area Historical Museum |accessdate=2014-04-30 }}</ref>    

The museum is located at 204 Ottawa Street in central Joliet.  An admission fee is charged.<ref name="JAHM"/>

{{asof|2014}}, the museum is seeking to establish guided tours of the landmark former [[Joliet Correctional Center|Collins Street Prison]] for [[U.S. Route 66 in Illinois|Route 66]] travelers and other interested tourists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwherald.com/2014/04/24/proposal-could-open-old-joliet-prison-for-tour/awreoq1/|title=Proposal could open old Joliet prison for tour|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref>
