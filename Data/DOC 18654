'''Birrificio Angelo Poretti''' is an Italian [[Brewery|brewing company]] located in [[Varese]].

The brewery was founded in 1877 by Angelo Poretti in [[Induno Olona]]. In 1939, the company passed to the Bassetti family, who owned the [[Splügen Pass|Splügen]] brewery in [[Chiavenna]]. In 1982 the [[Carlsberg Group]] bought 50% of the shares from the company, followed in 1998 by a further 25%. In 2002, the Danish group acquired the remaining 25% and thus obtained full ownership of the company from Induno Olona.
