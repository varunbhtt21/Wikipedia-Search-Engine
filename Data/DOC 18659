The death of '''Clayton Darrell Lockett''' occurred on April 29, 2014, when he suffered a [[heart attack]] during an [[capital punishment|execution]] by [[lethal injection]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oklahoma]]. Lockett, aged 38, was convicted in 2000 of murder, rape and kidnapping.

Lockett was administered an untested mixture of drugs that had not previously been used for [[Capital punishment in the United States|executions in the United States]].<ref name=guardian/> Although the execution was stopped, Lockett died 43 minutes after being sedated. He writhed, groaned, convulsed,<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/01/oklahoma-clayton-lockett-execution/8570625 Clayton Lockett execution] by Michael Winter, ''USA Today'', May 1, 2014; accessed May 7, 2014.</ref> and spoke during the process and attempted to rise from the execution table fourteen minutes into the procedure, despite having been declared unconscious.<ref name=nytimes/>

==Background==

===Early life===
Clayton Lockett was born in 1975 to a drug-using mother. She abandoned him when he was three years old, and he was then raised by his father who severely physically abused Lockett throughout his childhood, gave him drugs starting at age 3, and encouraged him to steal and not get caught.<ref>{{cite news| author =| title =The Life of Clayton Lockett| quote =| newspaper =[[Medium (service)|Medium]]| date = April 30, 2014| url =https://medium.com/@briantedjones/the-life-of-clayton-lockett-ed75055589cd| accessdate = June 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| author =Ralph W.

===Criminal history===
In 1992, at the age of sixteen, Lockett pleaded guilty in [[Kay County, Oklahoma|Kay County]] to burglary and knowingly concealing stolen property. He received a seven-year prison sentence. Earlier that year, he pleaded no contest to two counts of intimidating state witnesses.

While imprisoned at age 16 at the [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]], a prison for adults, Lockett was [[gang rape|gang]] [[prison rape|raped]] by three adult male prisoners.<ref>{{cite news| author =| title =The Life of Clayton Lockett| quote =When Clayton was 16, he was incarcerated at a correctional center meant for adults.

In 1999, Lockett kidnapped, beat, and shot Stephanie Neiman, a nineteen-year-old high school graduate, friend of Lockett's other victims, and a witness to his crimes. He beat her and used duct tape to bind her hands and cover her mouth. Even after being kidnapped and driven to a dusty country road, Neiman did not back down when Lockett asked if she planned to contact police. After she stated she would go to the police, Lockett decided to bury her alive.<ref name="tulsaworld"/> Lockett ordered an accomplice to bury her while she was still breathing. She died from two wounds from a shotgun fired by Lockett.<ref name=tulsaworld>{{cite news|last=Branstetter|first=Ziva|title=Death row inmate killed teen because she wouldn't back down|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/courts/death-row-inmate-killed-teen-because-she-wouldn-t-back/article_e459564b-5c60-5145-a1ce-bbd17a14417b.html?mode=story|accessdate=April 30, 2014|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|date=2014-04-20}}</ref> In 2000, he was convicted of murder, rape, forcible sodomy, kidnapping, assault and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] and sentenced to death. Previously Lockett was sentenced to four years in prison for a conviction in 1996 in Grady County for conspiracy to commit a felony.<ref name="lookup"/>

At his 1999 murder trial, DNA from the dead victim, fingerprints from the duct tape used to bind the victim, and eye-witness testimony led to his murder conviction.<ref name="lookup"/>

===On lethal injections===
From 1890 to 2010, the rate of botched{{efn|Professor [[Austin Sarat]] of [[Amherst College]] defines a "botched" execution as one where "the executioners departed from official legal protocol or standard operating procedure".<ref name=bbc-botch />}} [[lethal injection]]s in the United States was 7.1%, higher than any other form of execution, with [[execution by firing squad|firing squads]] at 0%, the [[electric chair]] at 1.9%, [[hanging]] at 3.1%, and the [[gas chamber]] at 5.4%.<ref name=bbc-botch>{{cite web|last1=Siegelbaum|first1=Debbie|title=America's 'inexorably' botched executions|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28555978|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 August 2014|date=2014-07-31}}</ref>

In 2011, [[Hospira]] announced that it would stop manufacturing [[sodium thiopental]], due to use by American prisons for executions. "Virtually all" death rows in the US were left without a steady supply of the drug, which is used to numb the pain of [[potassium chloride]] stopping the heart. Some states bartered supplies of execution drugs, while other states were accused of illegally buying drugs from [[India]] and other sources. The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] seized supplies of sodium thiopental from several states in spring and summer 2011, questioning how they were imported.<ref name=newsweek>{{cite web|last=Ericson|first=John|title=Botched Execution Shows Perils of Lethal Injection Drug Shortage|url=http://www.newsweek.com/states-go-great-lengths-find-lethal-injection-drugs-249154|work=Newsweek|accessdate=April 30, 2014|date=2014-04-30}}</ref>  Other manufacturers have also refused to provide pharmaceutical drugs for the purpose of execution, and a European export ban added to problems obtaining the necessary drugs.<ref name=theatlantic>{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Matt|title=Can Europe End the Death Penalty in America?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/can-europe-end-the-death-penalty-in-america/283790/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014|date=2014-02-18}}</ref><ref name=bloombergview>{{cite web|last=Bershidsky|first=Leonid|title=Slow Death in Oklahoma Was Europe's Doing|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-30/slow-death-in-oklahoma-was-europe-s-doing|work=[[Bloomberg View]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014|date=2014-04-30}}</ref>

Due to the supply issues, Oklahoma used an untested mixture of [[midazolam]] (to make the victim fall unconscious), [[vecuronium bromide]] (to paralyse), and [[potassium chloride]] (used to stop the heart) for Lockett's execution.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|last=Fretland|first=Katie|title=Oklahoma execution: Clayton Lockett writhes on gurney in botched procedure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/oklahoma-execution-botched-clayton-lockett|accessdate=April 30, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2014-04-30}}</ref> While Florida had previously used the same three drugs in a 2013 execution,<ref name=mojo>{{cite web|last=Mencimer|first=Stephanie|title=Does This Secret Drug Cocktail Work To Execute People?

In a recent Florida case experts testified that midazolam would not cause unconsciousness.  Instead of sedating some patients, midazolam can make them violent.  Dennis McGuire took 25 minutes to die; he gasped and snorted.  The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled that if the first drug does not make the inmate unconscious there is an unacceptable risk of suffocation and pain from the two following drugs.  Potassium chloride causes severe pain if used without an anesthetic.  Pharmacology professor, Craig Stevens of [[Oklahoma State University]] asked why [[anesthesiology]] or [[pharmacology]] experts were not consulted. "Midazolam has no analgesic properties. It's a whole different drug class than sodium thiopental or barbiturates," Stevens said.  Stevens described dying from the other two drugs without anesthetic as "horrific".<ref>[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/secrets-still-shroud-clayton-lockett-s-execution/article_5513ea6b-1f24-519e-9340-66c42b109502.html Secrets still shroud Clayton Lockett's execution]</ref>  The drug combination used is considered too painful to euthanise animals.

[[Governor of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Governor]] [[Mary Fallin]] had strongly pushed for the execution to take place despite the lack of standard drugs, initially issuing an executive order to proceed despite a stay by the [[Supreme Court of Oklahoma]].  Republican allies of Fallin started [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] proceedings against the justices who tried to delay the execution;<ref name=Bouie>[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/mary_fallin_is_responsible_for_clayton_lockett_s_botched_execution_the_oklahoma.html Oklahoma Gov.

Is this going to cause horrible pain?" and "I know he's scared.

==Failed execution==

Lockett's failed execution occurred at [[Oklahoma State Penitentiary]] in [[McAlester, Oklahoma]], on April 29, 2014, after he had been [[taser]]ed by staff and attempted to cut himself earlier that day.<ref name="Guardian01/05/2014">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/01/oklahoma-clayton-lockett-tasered-before-botched-execution Oklahoma inmate Tasered by prison staff on day of botched execution]</ref> A paramedic tried twice to put an [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] needle into Lockett's left arm but failed.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/06/execution-clayton-lockett/392069/|title=The Cruel and Unusual Execution of Clayton Lockett|last=Stern|first=Jeffrey E.|date=June 2015|website=|publisher=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref>  She then tried to insert the needle into his [[Brachial veins|brachial vein]] in his biceps but also failed.  She asked for help from a doctor in attendance, Johnny Zellmer, who tried three times to get the IV into the [[jugular vein]] in Lockett's neck but failed.  He then tried the [[subclavian vein]] adjacent to Lockett's collar bone but failed again. The paramedic tried two veins in the left foot but failed. Zellmer then inserted the needle into the [[femoral vein]] in the groin. 

The execution began at 6:23&nbsp;p.m [[Central Time Zone|CDT,]] when the first drug [[midazolam]] (sedative), was administered. After Lockett was declared unconscious at 6:33&nbsp;p.m, the next two drugs, [[vecuronium bromide]] (paralytic) and [[potassium chloride]] (to stop the heart beating), were injected. However, at 6:36, three minutes after being declared unconscious, Lockett started to struggle violently and was able to raise his head and speak saying, "Oh, man", "I'm not..." and according to some sources<!--Read correction at bottom of ref--> "something's wrong".<ref name=nytimes/><ref name=HRW>{{cite web|title=Oklahoma: End Barbaric Lethal Injections|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/04/30/oklahoma-end-barbaric-lethal-injections|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> He attempted to rise from the table at 6:37&nbsp;p.m. and loudly exhaled.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Eckholm|first=Erik|title=One Execution Botched, Oklahoma Delays the Next|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/oklahoma-executions.html|accessdate=April 30, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2014-04-29}}</ref> A lawyer for Lockett reportedly said, "It looked like torture."<ref name=Williams/> [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]] Director Robert Patton said one of the doctors present stopped the execution when it became clear Lockett had a "vein failure".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kfor.com/2014/04/27/debate-over-two-death-row-inmates-is-over-execution-set|title=UPDATE: Chaos after Oklahoma botched lethal injection with never-before used drug|publisher=[[KFOR-TV]]|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> The execution was halted at 6:56.<ref name=":0" /> Lockett was declared dead at 7:06&nbsp;p.m. due to a heart attack.<ref name=cnn>{{cite web|title=Oklahoma's botched lethal injection marks new front in battle over executions|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/30/us/oklahoma-botched-execution/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014|author=Josh Levs, Ed Payne, Greg Botelho|date=2014-04-30}}</ref>

A subsequent investigation found that all three drugs had been properly administered to Lockett. However, it was a cloth, which had been placed over Lockett's groin to prevent witnesses from viewing the area, that had stopped staff from spotting that the IV connection in the groin had failed because of the collapsed vein.<ref name="Guardian01/05/2014"/> After an attending doctor stated that Lockett had not received enough of the drugs to cause death and there were not enough of the drugs left to attempt to continue, the execution was halted after 33 minutes.

According to the Department of Corrections, the time for an inmate to be pronounced dead was 6 to 12 minutes in the previous 19 executions before Lockett.<ref name=kjrh/>

==Aftermath==
Following Lockett's death, a fourteen-day stay of execution was granted for Charles Frederick Warner, an Oklahoma convict who had been scheduled for execution two hours after Lockett with the same combination of drugs. [[Governor of Oklahoma]] [[Mary Fallin]] also requested a review of the execution process involved in Lockett's death.<ref name=nytimes/>  Fallin's intervention led to the execution which possibly violated [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] within the state.<ref name=Bouie/>

Dean Sanderford, Lockett's lawyer, witnessed the execution and expressed concern that "the planned review would not be independent". Sanderford feared "investigation by state employees or agencies would not restore confidence in the execution process".<ref name=Bouie/><ref name="Guardian30/04/2014"/> Lawyers representing the next set of prisoners scheduled to be executed called for a moratorium on all executions. Madeline Cohen, an attorney for Warner, condemned the way Lockett was executed, noting that "Clayton Lockett was [[torture]]d to death," also denouncing the state's refusal to disclose "basic information" about the drugs for the lethal injection procedures.<ref name="Guardian30/04/2014">{{cite news|last=Pilkington, Swaine and Fretland|first=Ed, Jon and Katie|title=Botched Oklahoma execution 'fell short of humane standards' – White House|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/oklahoma-clayton-lockett-botched-execution-explanation|accessdate=May 1, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>  [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state representative, [[Joe Dorman]] called for outside investigation into how Lockett died.

A timeline issued by Robert Patton, director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, revealed that Clayton Lockett was tasered after refusing to be restrained and escorted to a medical room for an X-ray exam as part of the protocol leading up to his execution. During his medical exam officials found a cut on his right arm, but staff determined that sutures were not needed. The timeline also revealed that Lockett refused a food tray twice. Patton also recommended in the letter to governor Mary Fallin that the state conduct a complete review of execution protocols, indefinitely suspend all executions, and investigate the circumstances surrounding the execution.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web|url=http://www.news9.com/story/25405591/doc-releases-timeline-of-clayton-locketts-execution|title=DOC Releases Timeline Of Clayton Lockett's Execution|publisher=News9.com|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref>

Media coverage portrayed the execution as "botched", ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' calling it "barbarism" and "inappropriate in a civilized society", noting "the idea of actually spectating while the victim is killed surely clashes with basic humanity."<ref name="Guardian30/04/2014"/><ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=Alice|title=Botched Oklahoma execution: 'America is missing the point over death penalty'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10798426/Botched-Oklahoma-execution-America-is-missing-the-point-over-death-penalty.html|accessdate=May 1, 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

The executive director of the [[Death Penalty Information Center]], Richard Dieter, said the attempted execution of Lockett was a “torturous action” and might "lead to a halt in executions until states can prove they can do it without problems".<ref name=Telegraph/> He said the death penalty advocates should be “concerned about whether the state knows what it is doing”.<ref name="Guardian30/04/2014"/>

The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] suggested that the execution may have been "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment" according to [[international law]] and may have been [[cruel and unusual punishment]] under the [[Constitution of the United States]].<ref name="Guardian2/5/2014">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/un-human-rights-condemns-oklahoma-execution-clayton-lockett UN human rights chief condemns Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett]</ref> The [[HM Government|government]] of the [[United Kingdom]] issued a statement reiterating its opposition to capital punishment through its [[UK embassy in Washington|embassy in Washington]]. It said "its use undermines [[human dignity]], there is no conclusive evidence of its [[deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] value, and any [[miscarriage of justice]] leading to its imposition is irreversible and irreparable" and called on the United States to cease its use.<ref name="Guardian30/04/2014"/>

[[Human rights organization]]s also condemned the killing and called on the government to end using it. Ryan Kiesel, the executive director of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Oklahoma, said that by using a “science experiment” to cause Lockett to "die in pain" over the course of more than 40 minutes, the state had “disgraced itself before the nation and world”.<ref name="Guardian30/04/2014"/> US advocacy director of [[Human Rights Watch]] Antonio Ginatta said "people convicted of crimes should not be test subjects for a state’s grisly experiments" and that the "botched execution was nothing less than [[state-sanctioned]] torture".<ref name="HRW"/>

A month after the execution Oklahoma state had not released the official log of the incident.  [[Oklahoma State University]] professor and freedom of information campaigner Joey Senat said, “They’re not complying with the law by this kind of delay.” <ref>[http://www.edmondsun.com/local/x1934103453/Execution-log-for-Lockett-case-still-under-wraps Execution log for Lockett case still under wraps]</ref>

Lockett's lawyers released the preliminary results of an independent autopsy on Lockett, conducted by forensic pathologist Joseph Cohen and commissioned by Lockett's legal team.  It suggested that the execution team failed to ensure the IV had been properly inserted.  According to Cohen, the execution team made several attempts to insert IVs into Lockett's arms and groin before inserting an IV in his femoral vein.  However, they failed to ensure the IV went in all the way, resulting in the drugs being absorbed into Lockett's muscle.  The report also challenged the official claim that Lockett's veins failed, saying that his veins were perfectly healthy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://kfor.com/2014/06/13/bombshell-executed-oklahoma-inmates-attorneys-release-shocking-findings-from-autopsy|title=Bombshell: Executed Oklahoma inmate’s attorneys release shocking findings from autopsy|author1=Kimberly Querry|author2=Meg Alexander|publisher=[[KFOR-TV]]|date=2014-06-13}}</ref>
