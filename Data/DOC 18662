Biography of a person of questionable notability. The sources are trivial listings, mere mentions, connected sources, and a NYT piece apparently written by the subject or his wife. Fails [[WP:BIO]]. - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 15:52, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''', without prejudice to recreation in the event he can be shown to actually be notable.  As far as I can tell from the article, its sources, and my own brief search, there's no hint that he meets [[WP:GNG]].  The only reference actually ''about'' the subject is the NYT piece, which is a profile of couples who have made it to 25 years of marriage, hardly a basis for notability for Wikipedia purposes.  (Now, notability in ''my'' family, that would be a different matter!)  Given the claim that he founded the "Center for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery", " negotiated the release of prisoners", was involved (in some unidentified way) with the film (''[[Daughter from Danang]]''), and "helped train [again, in some unidentified way] the first group of Peace Corps Volunteers", I would expect there to be some significant coverage of him that I'm simply not able to find.  If such sources surface, I would not object to the article being recreated with appropriate specificity and sourcing. [[User:TJRC|TJRC]] ([[User talk:TJRC|talk]]) 21:28, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' not mentioned or credited in the article on the award winning documentary. Lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent stories. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 14:17, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
