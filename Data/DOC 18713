'''Jane Dickson''' (born 1952) is an American painter. Dickson received her B.A. at [[Harvard University]] (1976) and a Studio Diploma from the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] (1976).

Dickson is known for her dark iconic images that examine "the constructed world, and its psychological freight, the social structuring of desire and its disruption by the uncanny".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kabat|first=Jennifer|title=Jane Dickson: A Walk on the Dark Side|url=http://www.theweeklings.com/jkabatart/2012/09/02/jane-dickson/|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2 September 2012}}</ref> Deploying unusual materials such as [[AstroTurf]], vinyl, sandpaper, felt and carpet, which resonate with their particular subject, Dickson's paintings express her "fascination with the power of artificial light, as well as...surreal and sexually transgressive environment[s]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kussatz|first=Simone|title=April 2011, Art, Access & Decay: New York 1975-1985|url=http://www.whitehotmagazine.com/articles/decay-new-york-1975-1985/2270|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=April 2011}}</ref> Often depicting the spectacle in her work, her subjects include [[Times Square]] (where she lived and/or worked from 1978 to 2008), [[demolition derby|demolition derbies]], carnivals, suburban homes, and highways, among others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frizzell|first=Deborah|title=Whose World is This? Jane Dickson & Charlie Ahearn|date=2012|publisher=William Paterson University Galleries|location=Wayne, NJ|url=http://www.wpunj.edu/dotAsset/98d24ca2-e0c9-46fb-9fcf-07da68997a16.pdf}}</ref>  In addition to her large body of paintings, the artist organized “Messages to the Public”, a [[Public Art Fund]] series which presented monthly artists’ projects created for Spectacolor's 1 Times Square Billboard. The project ran from 1982 to 1990 and the artists presented include [[Keith Haring]] and [[Jenny Holzer]]. In her most recent contribution to Times Square, Dickson designed 67 mosaics of New Year's Eve revelers that were installed within the [[Times Square – 42nd Street / Port Authority Bus Terminal (New York City Subway)|Port Authority 42nd Street]] and Times Square subway stations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Ralph|title=Artist of the Interstate Jane Dickson Has Played a Role in Times Square's Revival|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304014504579248411246446056|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 9, 2013}}</ref> Commissioned by the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) in 2008, the mosaics are composed of Murano glass, and as art historian [[Janetta Rebold Benton]] describes, the figures with their party hats and horns "seem able to elevate the moods of the actual people who hurry along the corridor."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rebold Benton|first=Janetta and Robert DiYanni|title=Arts and Culture: An Introduction to the Humanities: Combined Volume|date=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Boston|pages=598–99|edition=4th|chapter=Diversity in Contemporary Life}}</ref>

Dickson was associated with the artists collective Collaborative Projects, or [[Colab]].<ref>Jeannie Hopper, [http://clocktower.org/show/colab-the-real-estate-show-and-abc-no-rio-a-history|Colab, The Real Estate Show, and ABC No Rio: A History].  Retrieved March 2, 2015.</ref>

Her work has been exhibited throughout the United States and is included in major museum collections such as The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], The [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], and The [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. She received The Joan Mitchell Painters and Sculptors Grant in 2013. She is married to American film director, [[Charlie Ahearn (director)|Charlie Ahearn]].
