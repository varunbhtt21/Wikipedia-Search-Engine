The term is receiving increased attention based on recent White House statements about sexual assault on college campuses.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steinhauer|first=Jennifer|title=Behind Focus on College Assaults, a Steady Drumbeat by Students|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/sexual-assault-on-university-campuses.html?_r=0|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2014-04-29}}</ref>  The term is also used by the [[Our Harvard Can Do Better]] student group at Harvard University.  Recent debate about how colleges respond to sexual assault by students has brought this issue renewed media attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/scientists/names.html|title=Scientists to AAU member university presidents|website=dynamic.uoregon.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/25/rape-uva-campus-policies_n_6214896.html|title=Though Under Fire For Its Own Rape Response, UVA Advises Other Schools Nationwide|first=Tyler|last=Kingkade|date=26 November 2014|publisher=|via=Huff Post|newspaper=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/7/college-campus-sexualassaultsafetydatawhitehousegender.html|title=OPINION: Official campus statistics for sexual violence mislead|publisher=}}</ref>

Institutional betrayal can occur within families, governments [[Military sexual trauma|and the military]], organizations, workplaces, religious institutions, or any organizational system in which people are dependent on systemic protection.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freyd|first=Jennifer and Pamela Birrell|title=Blind to Betrayal: Why we fool ourselves we aren't being fooled|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons.|isbn=978-0-470-60440-3|url=http://sites.google.com/site/betrayalbook/}}</ref> Individuals who have experienced extensive trauma appear to be both less satisfied with police responses in the face of an [[intimate partner violence]] incident and more distrustful of police.<ref>Tamaian, A. & Klest, B. (2014). [http://uregina.ca/~schtlab/assets/Tamaian%20&%20Klest%20CPA%20poster%202014.pdf Rate of revictimization exacerbates both dissatisfaction and distrust with the police in survivors of intimate partner violence]. Poster to be presented at the Canadian Psychological Association 75th Annual Convention, Vancouver, British Columbia, June 5–7, 2014.</ref> Therefore, these individuals may experience feelings of institutional betrayal due to a perceived failure of the police to prevent further [[revictimization]]. Individuals who have been frequently retraumatized are also the ones most likely to utilize health care and mental health services. Institutional betrayal in the medical system is currently being investigated in the [[Canadian health care system]].  It is hypothesized that institutional betrayal in the medical system will explain symptoms of [[PTSD]], [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] above and beyond the effects of general tendencies to trust others or the [[patient satisfaction]] with the care received.<ref>Tamaian, A.
