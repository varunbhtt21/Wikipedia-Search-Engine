'''Anne L'Huillier''' (born 1958 in [[Paris]]) is a [[France|French]] [[physicist]], and professor of [[atomic physics]] at [[Lund University]].

==Life==
L'Huillier first pursued an education and was awarded a [[Master of Science]] in [[theoretical physics]] and [[mathematics]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.academia-net.org/profil/prof-anne-lhuillier/1135203|title=Prof. Anne L'huillier - AcademiaNet|website=www.academia-net.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> but switched for her PhD to experimental physics at the French nuclear research center of the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives]] in [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]]. Her dissertation was on multiple ionization in laser fields of high intensity.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.upmc.fr/en/university/history_and_famous_people/doctors_honoris_causa/dhc_2013/anne_l_huillier.html|title=Anne L'Huillier|last=UPMC|first=Université Pierre et Marie Curie -|date=2013-12-12|work=|access-date=2017-04-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=}}</ref>

As a post-doctoral student, she was in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]] and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]]. From 1986, she was permanently employed at the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre. In 1992, she took part in an experiment in [[Lund]], where one of the first titanium-sapphire solid-state laser systems for [[femtosecond]] pulses in Europe had been installed. In 1994 she moved  to Sweden, where she served at [[Lund University]] as a lecturer in 1995 and a professor in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atomic.physics.lu.se/research/attosecond_physics/group_members/anne_lhuillier/|title=Anne L'Huillier|work=Atomic Physics, Faculty of Engineering, LTH|accessdate=2014-05-05}}</ref>

She leads an [[Attophysics|attosecond physics]] group which studies the movements of [[electron]]s in real time, which is used to understand the chemical reactions on the atomic level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zeiss.com/corporate/int/innovation-and-technology/research-award-winners.html|title=Carl Zeiss Research Award|last=|first=|date=|website=ZEISS International|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> In 2003 she and her group beat the world record with the smallest laser pulse of 170 [[attosecond]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund: i tid och rum|last=|first=|publisher=Fysiska institutionen i samarbete med Gidlunds förlag|year=2016|isbn=9789178449729|editor-last=Forkman|editor-first=Bengt|location=Lund|pages=371, 374|language=Swedish|editor-last2=Holmin Verdozzi|editor-first2=Kristina}}</ref> 
 
L'Huillier was on the [[Nobel Committee for Physics]] between 2007-2015,<ref name=":0" /> and has been a member of the [[Swedish Academy of Sciences]] since 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kva.se/sv/nyheter/nya-ledamoter-2|title=Nya ledamöter|last=|first=|date=2004-04-19|website=Kungl.

In 2013, she was awarded the {{ill|Carl-Zeiss Research Award|de}}, the Blaise Pascal Medal and an Honorary Degree at [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]] (UPMC), Paris.<ref name=":1" /> She was elected a foreign associate of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2018.
