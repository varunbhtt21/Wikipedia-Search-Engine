Entirely non-notable painting. [[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 17:02, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''delete''' - no evidence of notability. [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 18:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Perhaps a significant piece of art as it relates to the history and music of [[Hole (band)|Hole]] but for those purposes it is adequately covered at [[Pretty on the Inside#Packaging and artwork]]. No showing of separate notability as an artwork. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 18:47, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
