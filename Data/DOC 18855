== Early life ==
Principe was born in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]] and raised in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].<ref name="Yahoo!">{{cite web|last=Shirey|first=Eric|title=Interview with 'Laid to Rest's' Chromeskull Himself - Nick Principe|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/interview-laid-rests-chromeskull-himself-nick-8459509.html?cat=40|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140430173045/http://voices.yahoo.com/interview-laid-rests-chromeskull-himself-nick-8459509.html?cat=40|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 30, 2014|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Already having a black belt in [[kenpō]], and experienced in [[mixed martial arts]] fights, he started studying how to become a stuntman.<ref name="IoF" />

Three months after moving to Los Angeles, Principe was working in a [[Record shop|music store]] and noticed a film production crew across the street. He approached a crew member, and was asked if he was a "PA", or [[production assistant]]. Ignorant of the term's meaning, Principe said that he was, and started working on the set. He ended up talking to the [[stunt coordinator]] and started doing stunt work in the film industry.<ref name="IoF" />
