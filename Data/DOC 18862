Title : File:Don Henderson actor.jpg
Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
|Description = British character actor Don Henderson
|Source = '''Original publication''': unknown<br/>
'''Immediate source''': http://www.tvrage.com/person/id-126760/Don+Henderson
|Author = unknown
|Article = Don Henderson
|Purpose = for visual identification of the person in question, at the top of his/her biographical article
|Replaceability = Person born in 1931, and only began working in film/television in the 1960s and 1970s, so unlikely to be any representative files that have fallen out of copyright, and deceased since 1997, so no newer images available.
|Minimality = This file is already low resolution, and would be used in a standard infobox size (300px or fewer). It would be the only image of the subject on the article page. It contains only a depiction of the subject himself, and does not reveal any more of the work than is necessary.
|Commercial = File would seem to be a publicity shot from an unidentified television series most likely not screened in the 21st century nor commercially available on disc, so unlikely to harm any commercial interests, nor conflict with a commercial use.
|Other information = The subject of the photograph has been deceased since: 1997
