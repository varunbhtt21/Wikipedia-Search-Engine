''Aware'' of the importance of developing and implementing without delay a programme of concrete action for the Decade,

''Considering'' further its decision to convene in 1980 a world conference to review and evaluate progress made and, where necessary, readjust existing programmes in the light of new data and research available,

''Noting'' with satisfaction the Programme for the United Nations Decade for Women as adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its twenty-sixth session and transmitted to the General Assembly by the Economic and Social Council at its resumed sixty-first session,/71

3. ''Calls upon'' Governments to take measures to ensure equal and effective participation of women in political, economic, social and cultural life and in policy-making at local, national, regional and international levels, thereby increasing their role in international co-operation and in the strengthening of peace;

5. ''Recommends'' further that Governments, in co-operation with the Secretary-General, the specialized agencies, the regional commissions, appropriate regional and international research centres and institutes as well as appropriate intergovernmental bodies, should undertake the organization of training courses and seminars whereby officials responsible for the formulation and implementation of national development plans would study multidisciplinary techniques and methods which can be utilized in effectively integrating women in development;

6. ''Invites,'' as a matter of priority, Governments and organizations and bodies of the United Nations system as well as all governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned and the mass media to undertake massive public information programmes with a view to making all sectors of the population aware of the need to implement fully the Programme for the Decade;
