Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''redirect to [[Diary of Dreams]]'''. While participation here is very low, both the nomination suggests redirection as an option and the sole !vote also does so.
