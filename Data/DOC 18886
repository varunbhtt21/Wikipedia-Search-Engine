<s>Been unreferenced for 3 years now-nothing has happened either. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:41, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</s> '''Withdrawn by nominator'''-Well I'm withdrawing this-actually as odd as it sounds, the AFD probably actually helped instead of having it rot too long.

*'''speedy keep'''. It was unreferenced, but was not tagged so. Notability is asserted. You have to give people a chance to fix it before slaughterhouse. [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 18:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''comment'''-Well it has been unreferenced for over 3 years now-and I have seen AFD's go up when stuff like that has happened. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:18, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-also I did put a deletion tag on it-but I then thought since this has been around so long this might actually get it done faster to link it or something. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:19, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Another comment'''-Sorry I feel kind of bad for putting an AFD now-I was just unsure of what to say about the page that was unreferenced for over 3 years-I had it at deletion but yeah as I said...[[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:23, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-withdrawing. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:40, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
