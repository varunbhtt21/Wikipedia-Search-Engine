[[WP:ORG|Non-notable corporation]].  This company name has existed for a long time (as Computer Vision Systems Lab), but it was only in 2013 that the company was bought out (essentially for its pre-existing position on the OTC markets) and completely repurposed to begin building a micro-enterprise network.  Coverage that is available is mainly in the form of self-published press releases (although their bringing [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] on as a board member generated a blip of notice).  Evidence of significant third-party coverage is lacking. <font color="green">[[User:WikiDan61|WikiDan61]]</font><font color="green" size="5px"></font><sup>[[User talk:WikiDan61|ChatMe!]]</sup><sub>[[Special:Contributions/WikiDan61|ReadMe!!]]</sub> 15:32, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-It's tough sorting through all the cruft. On a HighBeam search I found several Close-Up media articles (appears to be some sort of online trade journal?), but not sure how reliable we consider that source. I also found this [http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/15/us-blyth-cvsl-idUSBRE9AE15F20131115 Reuters story], which doesn't appear to be a straight-up press release. Beyond that, I had trouble finding more than just blurbs.[[User:EBstrunk18|EBstrunk18]] ([[User talk:EBstrunk18|talk]]) 23:28, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I think it's marginally notable. I would merge [[Agel Enterprises]] into this article because I don't think that subject is independently notable. The basket maker company appear to be. It's a holding company, and it seems to have gotten some coverage (for instance the sources cited in the Agel article).
