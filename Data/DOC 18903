The '''Domagnano Treasure''' is an important [[Ostrogothic]] hoard found at [[Domagnano]], [[Republic of San Marino]] in the late nineteenth century. The treasure is now divided between various institutions, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi <ref>[http://www.smtvsanmarino.sm/video/cultura/reperto-san-marino-nel-louvre-abu-dhabi-28-11-2017 Un reperto di San Marino nel Louvre di Abu Dhabi]</ref>, although the bulk of the hoard is currently held by the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] and the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in [[Nuremberg]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_domagnano_treasure.aspx British Museum  Highlights]</ref>

==Discovery==
The treasure was apparently discovered in 1892-1893 at the Lagucci farm near Domagnano in the [[Republic of San Marino]]. The exact circumstances of its discovery remain unclear, but it is thought that the hoard was part of one or more [[grave]]s. The Domagnano Treasure is largely composed of a set of [[jewellery]] from the 5th or 6th centuries that may have belonged to an Ostrogothic [[princess]] or noble lady of high rank.

==Description==
The Domagnano Treasure seems to have been made for a royal client as the purity of the precious metals used in its manufacture and the quality of the craftsmanship is very high. The design of some of the jewellery incorporate [[Christianity|Christian]] motifs and also reflect contemporary fashions from the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Gothic period]]. The treasure is now divided among various museums, as follows:

*[[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in Nuremberg: A fibula in the shape of an eagle, an earring, five pendants from a necklace and a cicada fibula (in the shape of an insect).<ref>[http://objektkatalog.gnm.de/objekt/FG1608 Germanisches Nationamuseum]</ref>

*[[British Museum]] : An earring, three pendants from a necklace, a large and small mount, a pair of knife sheaths, a finger ring, a gold hair pin with flat disk head and a chain necklace.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=27289&plaA=27289-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref>

*Museo di Stato di San Marino: A small mount.
*[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York: A pendant from a necklace.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.190.698 Metropolitan Museum]</ref>

*Louvre Abu Dhabi: A fibula in the shape of an eagle
