The '''{{USBill|113|hr|3329}}''' is a bill that would direct the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] to revise certain regulations related to small [[bank holding companies]] (BHCs).<ref name="cbo3329"/><ref name=TuesdayHouse6>{{cite news|title=Tuesday: House reforms Dodd-Frank, Senate debates energy bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/205264-tuesday-house-reforms-dodd-frank-senate-debates-energy-bill|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=6 May 2014|author=Cristina Marcos|author2=Ramsey Cox}}</ref> Current regulations allow BHCs with assets of less than $500 million that satisfy other tests to incur higher amounts of debt than larger institutions in order to acquire other banks.<ref name="cbo3329"/> H.R. 3329 would apply the less-stringent standard to more BHCs by raising the asset limit to $1 billion, and the bill also would allow savings and loan holding companies to qualify.<ref name="cbo3329"/>

The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
In the United States, the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] ({{usc|12|1841(a)(2)(A)}} ''[[wiktionary:en:et seq.|et seq.]]'') broadly defines a bank holding company as "any company that has control over a bank".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6000-300.html#6000sec.2 | title = Bank Holding Company Act | publisher = FDIC }}</ref>  The law requires all bank holding companies in the U.S. to register with the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]].

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=3329sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3329 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3329|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> 

The bill would direct the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] to publish in the [[Federal Register]] proposed revisions to the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement on Assessment of Financial and Managerial Factors applying such policy to [[bank holding companies]] and savings and loan holding companies having pro forma consolidated assets of less than $1 billion and which: (1) are not engaged in nonbanking activities involving significant leverage, and (2) do not have a significant amount of outstanding debt held by the general public.<ref name="3329sum"/>

The bill would retain the board's authority, however, to exclude either a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company from such policy statement if exclusion is warranted for supervisory purposes.<ref name="3329sum"/>

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on November 14, 2013. This is a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=cbo3329>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 3329|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45134|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> 

H.R. 3329 would direct the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] to revise certain regulations related to small bank holding companies (BHCs). Current regulations allow BHCs with assets of less than $500 million that satisfy other tests to incur higher amounts of debt than larger institutions in order to acquire other banks. H.R. 3329 would apply the less-stringent standard to more BHCs by raising the asset limit to $1 billion, and the bill also would allow savings and loan holding companies to qualify.<ref name="cbo3329"/>

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that H.R. 3329 would have no significant budgetary effect because the agency expects that workloads for affected financial regulators (the Federal Reserve System, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], and the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] among others) would not be significantly affected by the new requirements. Enacting H.R. 3329 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.<ref name="cbo3329"/>

H.R. 3329 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.<ref name="cbo3329"/>

==Procedural history==
H.R. 3329 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on October 23, 2013 by [[Blaine Luetkemeyer|Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R, MO-3)]].<ref name=3329allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3329 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3329/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]].<ref name="3329allactions"/> The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.<ref name=HouseExIRS>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}</ref>

==Debate and discussion==
The [[American Bankers Association]] (ABA) wrote a letter in support of H.R. 3329.<ref name=ABAletter>{{cite web|last=Ballentine|first=James|title=Support for H.R. 3329|url=http://www.aba.com/Advocacy/LetterstoCongress/Documents/CommunityBankRegRelief-HR3329Memo-111213.pdf|publisher=American Bankers Association|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=12 November 2013}}</ref> The ABA said that the legislation "would provide much needed regulatory relief for hundreds of community banks and thrifts."<ref name="ABAletter"/> They argued that under an increased BHC threshold, "more banks and thrifts will qualify for coverage under the BHC and will be exempt from certain capital and regulatory guidelines that do not provide materially more safety and soundness protection in the context of these community banks."<ref name="ABAletter"/>

The [[Independent Community Bankers of America]] (ICBA) also wrote a letter of "strong support" for H.R. 3329 to the House Financial Services Committee.<ref name=ICBAletter>{{cite web|last=Fine|first=Camden R.|title=ICBA Letter of Support for H.R. 3329|url=http://www.icba.org/files/ICBASites/PDFs/ltr110813.pdf|publisher=Independent Community Bankers of America|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=8 November 2013}}</ref>  The ICBA argued that "increasing the eligibility threshold to $1 billion to account for inflation, industry consolidation, and asset growth will help an additional 515 bank and savings and loan holding companies raise capital for additional consumer and small business lending, leading to job creation and community development."<ref name="ICBAletter"/>
