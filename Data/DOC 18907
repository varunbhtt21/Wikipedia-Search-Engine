He attended Secondary School No. 48 (1969–1977) and Technical High School No. 178 (1977–1979) and holds two university degrees: one in Economic Cybernetics from the [[National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine|Ukrainian Agricultural Academy]] (1985) and the other from [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] (Scriptwriting, prof.

==Literary work==
Stanislav Tsalyk specializes in documentary/nonfiction writing. His primary field of interests is the history of Kyiv, the history of ethnic minorities and unknown pages of the [[History of Ukraine|Ukrainian history]]. He explores daily life at different historical times rather than political or military conflicts and actively works with published and verbal memoirs, archived documents, newspapers, and photos.

He developed his unique literary style – finding exciting or unknown pages of the past, exploring understudied aspects, giving the exact chronology, and presenting unexpectedly convincing parallels and cascades of events. Full of various intriguing facts and surprising details, his publications are thrilling detective stories built on the principles of dramatic composition.
