Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''keep'''. Of the two reasons given by the nominator, one has been addressed and the other is a reason for cleanup, not deletion. [[User:Olaf Davis|Olaf Davis]] ([[User talk:Olaf Davis|talk]]) 12:48, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

Falls under too soon, from what I can tell this is not even being filmed yet-also the intro is a bit too promotional [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:34, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' per meeting [[WP:NFF|WP:NFF (paragraph 3)]] through its ongoing production and filming receiving the requisite coverage under that guideline... before and after it was titled.  Sorry {{u|Wgolf}}, but [http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-14/the-title-of-the-new-jayam-raja-jayam-ravi-film-is.html "The shoots of the film have been done in places such as Mahabalipuram, Bangalore and Hyderabad so far"] and we can allow this new sourced stub article to remain and grow and be improved through regular editing.... that is, unless someone convinces me that a merge and redirect to filmmaker [[M. Raja]] is a solution that somehow better serves the project.

* '''Keep''' The article has a source which says that the principal photography has started.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 03:50, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-for some reason I didn't see it say that it started-it just felt a bit too promotional though as well. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 03:54, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:*'''Response:''' I found that citation and added to the article through some minor post-nomination clean-up.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thani_Oruvan&diff=605854574&oldid=605618905] I would offer that a sense of any article feeling a "bit too promotional" would be a valid reason to tag it for editorial attention ( IE:<nowiki> {{tone}}</nowiki> ), but not necessarily one for calling for a flat-out deletion of something that could be corrected through regular editing.
