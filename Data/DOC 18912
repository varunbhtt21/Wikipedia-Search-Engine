Fails [[WP:GNG]]/[[WP:CORP]]. The article's only reliable reference is a story about the company being purchased by [[Intuit]] in 2005; however, Intuit is the subject, not MyCorporation (I would suggest a merge, but the topic is already covered in the Intuit article). I've found multiple mentions of the company, but none pass [[WP:CORPDEPTH]]. The company's CEO, who seems to have created the article, writes a lot of content and has been interviewed multiple times, but I don't think that lifts the company to encyclopedic standards.

*'''Delete'''.  I looked for other sources, found a few columns by the company's CEO and a few other article where she was quoted briefly in connection with some issue of corporate filing practice, but nothing substantive ''about'' the company except in press releases.  Since the company no longer belongs to Intuit a redirect there would probably not be appropriate. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 18:04, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Not finding substantial coverage in reliable sources, just lots of press releases such as [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mycorporation-breaks-down-start-business-090000320.html], [http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2014/03/05/LA77007]. There's [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/intuit-to-pay-20m-for-private-business-services-firm this source] which is lacking in terms of substantial coverage, but additional searches for more sources (e.g. under "My Corporate Business Services Inc.") are also not yielding substantial coverage. Does not meet [[WP:WEBCRIT]]. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 16:40, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
