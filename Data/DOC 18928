==Member of Parliament and Public Service==

The Welby family were part of the minor landed gentry in Lincolnshire during the middle of the eighteenth century.<ref>Burke (1833), p. 597</ref> Welby himself was Lord of the Manor of Denton, near [[Grantham]].<ref>Port (1986)</ref> By the late 1760s, Welby had become established in high society circles, marrying the daughter of Sir John Glynne, from an old land-owning family, the [[Glynne baronets]]. The year after his marriage, he and his wife were painted by the fashionable portrait artist [[Francis Cotes]]; the painting was described as one of Cotes's masterpieces when it was sold in 2012 by the auction house Christies for £457,000.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/francis-cotes-ra-portrait-of-william-earle-5584814-details.aspx |title = Francis Cotes, R.A. (London 1726–1770), Portrait of William Earle Welby (C. 1734–1815), of Denton, Lincolnshire and his first wife, Penelope (1737–1771), playing chess, before a draped curtain (Sale 5602 Lot 36 ) | publisher = Christie's |accessdate= 30 April 2014}}</ref> The next twenty years of his life were not spent in public office, though, as a Lord of the Manor, he would have been concerned with the management of his estates. After his first wife's death in 1777, Welby remarried to an heiress, supplementing his wealth; indeed, he was able to send all of his sons from that marriage to [[Cambridge University]].<ref>See the notes above for his sons and compare with Venn (1954), pp. 397–8.</ref>

His first entry into official office came in 1796-7, when he served as [[High Sheriff of Lincolnshire]]<ref>Port (1986)</ref> (being succeeded by John Cracroft<ref>White and Armytage (1897), p. 23, footnote 1. This Mr Cracroft was the head of the Cracroft family of Hackthorn Hall, Lincolnshire, who are covered in Burke's ''Landed Gentry'', 1847, vol. 1, and later editions.</ref>), but it would be another six years before his entry into Parliament. During that time, he was created a Baronet, in 1801.<ref>Burke (1833), p. 597 ; Courthope (1835), p. 289 ; {{cite web |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/15372/page/619 |title=''The London Gazette'', 2 June 1801 issue no. 15372, p. 619 |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> His entry into the House came in [[1802 United Kingdom general election|1802]], when the [[John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland]] and [[Brownlow Cust, 1st Baron Brownlow|Lord Brownlow]], who were the principal land-owners around Grantham, were resisting attempts by [[William Tollemache, Lord Huntingtower (1766–1833)|Sir William Manners, Bt.]], to purchase the borough and establish himself as its Member of Parliament. Although Welby claimed to stand independent of any patronage, he essentially represented the gentlemen of the borough opposed to Manners and was thus supported by Rutland and Brownlow. Despite Manners's efforts, Welby finished second with 434 votes.<ref>Port (1986) ; Port and Thorne (1986)</ref>

As a member of parliament, Welby was largely quiet and is not known to have made any speeches in the House. He silently supported [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]] and then [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]], although he appears an infrequent voter and his loyalty to the Government could not easily be counted on. He voted against the Censure of Lord Melville in 1805. In 1806, after serving a four-year term, Welby declined to stand again.<ref>Port (1986)</ref>

==Later life==

He remained out of public office until his death in 1815, aged about 82.<ref>Gentleman's Magazine (1815, pt. ii), p. 637</ref> He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son.<ref>Courthope (1835), p. 289</ref>
