== Medical uses ==
Ceritinib is an [[anaplastic lymphoma kinase]] (ALK)-positive inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC.<ref name="pharma.us.novartis.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/sites/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/files/zykadia.pdf |title=Proscribing data |website=www.pharma.us.novartis.com |format=PDF |access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> Previously, it was only indicated for patients who had developed resistant to crizotinib, another ALK-positive inhibitor, but has since had its usage expanded to serve as a primary option for metastatic NSCLC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/fda-ceritinib-nsclc|title=FDA Expands Ceritinib Approval for Lung Cancer|date=27 June 2017|website=National Cancer Institute}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Ceritinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In normal physiology, ALK functions as a key step in the development and function of nervous system tissue. However, chromosomal translocation and fusion give rise to an oncogenic form of ALK that has been implicated in progression of NSCLC. Ceritinib thus acts to inhibit this mutated enzyme and stop cell proliferation, ultimately halting cancer progression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Analplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene positive non-small cell lung cancer|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer|website=UpToDate|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref> Because ceritinib is considered a targeted cancer therapy, an FDA-approved test is required to determine which patients are candidates for ceritinib. This test, developed by Roche, is the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay and is used to identify ALK-positive NSCLC patients who would benefit from ceritinib treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://diagnostics.roche.com/global/en/news-listing/2017/roche-announces-fda-approval-of-companion-diagnostic-to-identify.html|title=Roche announces FDA approval of companion diagnostic to identify ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients|website=diagnostics.roche.com}}</ref>

=== Adverse effects ===
Serious adverse effects include gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, prolonged QT syndrome, hyperglycemia, [[bradycardia]], and pancreatitis.<ref name="online.lexi.com">{{cite web|url=https://online.lexi.com/lco/action/login|title=Login|website=online.lexi.com}}</ref>

The most commonly reported side effects were diarrhea, nausea, elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, decreased appetite, and constipation.<ref name="pharma.us.novartis.com"/>
Due to the risk of elevated liver enzymes, liver function tests should be performed every two weeks for the first 9 weeks of treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anapestic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene positive non-small cell lung cancer|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H1224312810|website=UpToDate|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref>

Finally, ceritinib is both a substrate and potent inhibitor of the enzyme CYP3A4, so medications should be monitored carefully that may interact with ceritinib.<ref name="online.lexi.com"/>

===Dose===
Ceritinib is available as a 150&nbsp;mg capsule with a one-time daily dosing requirement of 450&nbsp;mg with food.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hcp.novartis.com/products/zykadia/alk-nsclc/dosing-administration/|title=ZYKADIA® (ceritinib) Dosing & Administration {{!}} HCP|website=www.hcp.novartis.com|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref>

== Research and development ==
Researchers first identified the ALK fusion gene in 1994. Several years later, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, began working towards development of targeted ALK inhibitors. In April 2014, the FDA granted accelerated approval for ceritinib when used for ALK-positive NSCLC patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib (Xalkori, Pfizer, Inc.). This rapid approval was determined from a multi-center clinical trial in which 163 patients who had disease progression or were intolerant to crizotinib received oral ceritinib 750&nbsp;mg once daily. This trial demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 44% and a median duration of response (DOR) of 7.1 months, both of which were favorable compared to the worsening or failed use of crizotinib.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khozin|first1=Sean|display-authors=et al|title=FDA Approval: Ceritinib for the Treatment of Metastatic Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase–Positive Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer|journal=Clinical Cancer Research|date=June 1, 2015|volume=21|issue=11|pages=2436–2439|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-3157|url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org.ezproxy.uky.edu/content/21/11/2436.long|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>

In February 2017, the FDA accepted a supplement New Drug Application for ceritinib and granted Priority Review for expanded use of ceritinib. Specifically, it became a first-line therapy option for metastatic NSCLC with ALK-positive tumors. Additionally, the FDA also gave Breakthrough Therapy designation to the drug for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC that has metastasized to the brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-drug-zykadia-receives-fda-priority-review-first-line-use-patients-alk|title=Novartis drug Zykadia receives FDA Priority Review for first-line use in patients with ALK+ metastatic NSCLC|website=Novartis}}</ref> This new designation resulted from the ASCEND-4 clinical trial, which was a randomized, phase III study that compared the use of ceritinib to standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy treatments. Median progression-free survival was 16.6 months for ceritinib (n=189) versus 8.1 months in the chemotherapy-treated patients (n=187).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Soria|first1=Jean-Charles|display-authors=et al|title=First-line ceritinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (ASCEND-4): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study.|journal=The Lancet|date=March 4, 2017|volume=389|issue=10072|pages=917–929|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(17)30123-x}}</ref>

There are currently no generic options available for ceritinib.
