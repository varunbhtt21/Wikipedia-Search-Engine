The entire article is original research. Aside from a link to a small startup [https://app.secxbrl.info/], Google returns no relevant results. None of the sources used in the article talk or event mention the term [[User:McSly|McSly]] ([[User talk:McSly|talk]]) 18:05, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

I don't understand how to add comments to discuss why this article should not be deleted.  Is this correct, add edits to this page?  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:CharlesHoffman|CharlesHoffman]] ([[User talk:CharlesHoffman|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/CharlesHoffman|contribs]]) 13:50, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Delete''' It is mostly [[WP:OR]]. There is very little in the way of secondary and primary sources to support the article. Even your website article posts back to this WP article page, with only 3 other Google page hits supporting both this term and the concept, also linking to this page. In addition to that, the article also advances a narrow field, specific to certain financial reporting products. It also focuses on XBRL. Why? There is many more reasons.  I hope it doesn't put you off. [[User:scope_creep|scope_creep]] [[User talk:scope_creep|talk]] 18:48  4 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I can't find any evidence that this [[WP:NEO|neologism]] represents a [[WP:N|notable]] framework or class of OLAP systems, much less a [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Online_analytical_processing&diff=606628026 "global standard"], and conversation with the article creator on [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/NOLAP|this discussion's talk page]] confirms the impression that the article is indeed [[WP:OR|original research]]. ~ [[User:Ningauble|Ningauble]] ([[User talk:Ningauble|talk]]) 16:16, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
