Fails notability both as an artist and as a musician [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 18:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''.  Arguably passes [[WP:MUSICBIO]] #6 as a member of both [[Hole (band)|Hole]] and [[Mazzy Star]].  But so far not finding any RS coverage about her. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 18:40, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**Reply: Notability is not inherited. Even being a non-fan, I can list tens of random musicians which popped up here or there without real influence.  [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 22:28, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
***That is not what "[[WP:INHERIT|Notability is not inherited]]" means, exactly. [[WP:BAND]] specifically states that if a musician is a member of two or more bands that are themselves notable, that can be taken as conferring notability. We'd still need reliable sources though. So far, I'm not seeing much beyond occasional mentions that confirm that she was the bassist of Hole but little beyond that. &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 03:17, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
**Comment on musicbio#6. As stated in tha allmusic bio, mazzy star is Roback and Sandoval "with backing musicians" so I'd suggest Emery doesn't count as a "reasonably-prominent member" of Mazzy Star. [[User:Duffbeerforme|duffbeerforme]] ([[User talk:Duffbeerforme|talk]]) 02:57, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
***Well . . . I thought I had run across something (in a non-RS source) that implied she had more of substantial role in that band for a while, but I can't find it now and anyway no one has come up with any substantive RS material, so I'm inclined to agree with you on that point. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 03:15, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[Hole (band)]] per lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. Relevant bits can be noted there. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 14:23, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' as above.  This subject would warrant an article if it was fully sourced, due to involvement in a few notable acts.  A reference to liner notes, is barely enough to avoid [[WP:BLPPROD]], but not enough for a stand-alone article.  --[[User:Thivierr|Rob]] ([[User talk:Thivierr|talk]]) 00:11, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
