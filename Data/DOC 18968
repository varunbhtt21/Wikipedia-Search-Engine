Contested PROD. Concern was ''Article about a footballer who fails [[WP:GNG]] and who has not played in a fully pro league.'' PROD was contested by an IP without providing a reason. The article's creator also objected based on youth and cup appearances. [[WP:NSPORT]] explicitly excludes youth football as a source of notability, and his one cup appearance was against a lower division club and therefore does not confer notability either.

*'''Weak delete''' - He may not be notable enough today; but he is still young and I guess will soon come back to Wikipedia with more notability. --[[User:Why should I have a User Name?|Why should I have a User Name?]] ([[User talk:Why should I have a User Name?|talk]]) 18:31, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
