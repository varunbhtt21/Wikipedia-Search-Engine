== History ==

In 1991 New Visions for Public Schools (originally named "The Fund for New York City Public Education"), in conjunction with then-Chancellor Joseph Fernandez,<ref>{{cite news|last=Berger|first=Joseph|title=Cutting the Big High School Down to Size; Fernandez Joins the Movement to More Emphasis on Individual Teen-Agers|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 7, 1992}}</ref>  issued an RFP asking community groups to submit proposals for innovative schools.<ref name="Journal of Negro Education">{{cite journal|authors=Haven Henderson and Mary Anne Raywid|title="Small" Revolution in New York Cityu|journal=Journal of Negro Education|date=Winter 1994|url=http://www.maslowtoffler.com/1994-Small.Revolution.In.New.York.City}}</ref>  The proposal for The Renaissance School was submitted by "The Committee of Concerned Educators" and Community School District 30; it was one of 16 accepted proposals from nearly 300 submissions.  The proposal for the school was written in fictional narrative form chronicling a tour of the school by prospective parents.<ref name="Proposal">{{cite web|url=http://edglocit.homestead.com/The_Value_Creation_School.docx|title=The Value Creation School|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

The school opened with 130 students, grades 4–7, in September 1993, in one wing of JHS 204 in [[Long Island City]]. In 1995, it expanded to grades K and 6–9, and moved to the site of the St. Patrick's parish school which had closed the prior year.<ref name="macaulay.cuny.edu 201403"/> In 1996, it expanded to grades K–10 and moved into a permanent leased space on 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights, then became the Renaissance Charter School, one of the first five charter schools in New York, in 2000.<ref name="macaulay.cuny.edu 201403">{{cite web|url=http://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/siegel2014/2014/03/13/jackson-heights/|title=Jackson Heights|website=macaulay.cuny.edu|date=2014-03-13|accessdate=2015-05-15}}</ref>
