The result was    '''delete'''. Arguably an A7 to begin with. <span style="color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|<span style="color:#00CA00">FreeRangeFrog</span>]]</span><sup>[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]</sup> 05:22, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' Borderline speedyable, as it doesn't even ''make claims'' of notability. <b>[[User:Ohnoitsjamie|OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font>]] [[User talk:Ohnoitsjamie|<sup>Talk</sup>]]</b> 21:47, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Searches under this subject's name (R. Sivalingam) and under his works as listed in the article are not providing coverage in reliable sources (e.g. [https://www.google.com/search?q=Eppothu+Azhiyum+Indha+Ulagam%3F&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1], [https://www.google.com/search?q=Eppothu+Azhiyum+Indha+Ulagam%3F&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1#q=Indha+Unmaigal+Ean+Marikkapaduginrana%3F&tbm=bks]). Appears to not meet [[WP:BASIC]] for an English Wikipedia article. I found a passing mention [http://books.google.com/books?id=ivFuK_asOzcC&pg=PA69&dq=%22R.+Sivalingam%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=THJiU9zcJY-TyATp3IDIDw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22R.%20Sivalingam%22&f=false here], but it's unclear if it's about the same subject as in the article.
