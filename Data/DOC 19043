The '''2019 Thai general election''' was held in [[Thailand]] on 24 March 2019. It was the first election since the [[2014 Thai coup d'état]] that installed coup leader General [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]] as prime minister, and the first held in accordance with the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand|2017 constitution]], which was drafted under the ruling military junta. The elections selected the five hundred members of the new [[House of Representatives (Thailand)|House of Representatives]], the previous House having been dissolved by the coup.

Seventy-seven parties contested the elections, including the two major parties, [[Pheu Thai Party|Pheu Thai]] (which supported former prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] and held a majority of seats prior to the coup) and the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] (the main opposition party prior to the coup). They were joined by several new parties, which mostly campaigned on a pro- or anti-junta stance. The former included the Prayut-aligned [[Palang Pracharath Party]], while the latter included the [[Future Forward Party]], which catered to young voters, as well as several Pheu Thai–aligned parties.

The elections were held using a new mixed-member apportionment system, in which voters cast a single vote for both a constituency candidate and a nationwide party list, with the nationwide list used as [[leveling seat]]s to achieve proportional representation. Under the new constitution, the prime minister need not be an elected member of the House, and will be chosen by the full [[Parliament of Thailand|Parliament]], which also includes 250 members of the [[Senate of Thailand|Senate]], rather than only members of the House as previously.

The elections were widely seen as a skewed race in which Prayut—who previously announced his entry into electoral politics—had an unfair advantage, as the 250 sitting members of the appointed Senate were to be selected by the junta. The [[Thai Royal Family|Royal Family]], which is normally regarded to be above politics, also became involved in unusual ways. The Pheu Thai–aligned [[Thai Raksa Chart Party]] named Princess [[Ubol Ratana]], the elder sister of King [[Vajiralongkorn]], as its candidate for prime minister, leading to condemnation by the King and the party's dissolution by the [[Constitutional Court (Thailand)|Constitutional Court]]. In a move criticised on social media with a [[hashtag]], the King also issued a statement on the night prior to the election urging the people to remember a quote from his father the late king to support "good people".<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" />

Overseas voting took place from 28 January to 19 February, and advanced voting took place throughout the country on 17 March. The main election took place from 08:00 to 17:00 on 24 March. Rights groups and election monitors criticized the election for its biased environment, and the [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]] for many errors and irregularities. The announcement of the results was repeatedly delayed; unofficial results were announced on 28 March, four days after the election. Official results were announced on 8 May.

Although Palang Pracharath received the most votes and won 116 seats, Pheu Thai emerged as the largest party with 136 seats. Most of the remaining seats were won by the Future Forward, Democrat and Bhumjaithai parties. Pheu Thai and Future Forward announced a seven-party alliance soon after the election, but were unable to form a government. Parliament [[2019 Thai parliament|convened on 24 May]] and on 5 June voted to make Prayut prime minister.

==Background==
Early [[2014 Thai general election|general elections]] were held on 2 February 2014 after [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]] [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] asked King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] to dissolve [[National Assembly of Thailand|parliament]] more than a year early due to a [[2013–14 Thai political crisis|political crisis]]. The leaders of the [[People's Democratic Reform Committee|anti-government protests]] objected to the polls, instead demanding that there be "reform before elections" and the Yingluck government be replaced with a royally-appointed "reform council".<ref name="suthep_people's_revolt">{{cite news|title=Suthep declares 'people's revolt'|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/382361/suthep-declares-people-revolt|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=30 November 2013}}</ref> The elections were thus boycotted by the main opposition party, the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]], and disruption by protesters meant that voting in some constituencies had to be delayed until a later date, while absentee voters in urban areas were unable to vote.<ref name=Doubt_over_poll_outcome>{{cite news|title=Doubt over poll outcome|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Doubt-over-poll-outcome-30225888.html|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[The Nation (Thailand)]]|date=3 February 2014}}</ref>

In April 2014 the Constitutional Court ruled that the election was unconstitutional because the vote had not taken place on the same day nationwide.<ref name=BBC/> Following an agreement between the Election Commission and Yingluck's government, the fresh elections were set for 20 July.<ref name=BBC>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-27216911 Thailand to hold fresh election on 20 July] ''BBC News'', 30 April 2014</ref> However, the elections were cancelled after a [[2014 Thai coup d'état|coup d'état]] in May deposed the elected government and installed a [[Military junta|military government]] known as the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO), led by General [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]], then-[[Commander in Chief of the Royal Thai Army]]. The NCPO, on taking power, declared its intention to hold general elections after carrying out reforms and promulgating a new [[Constitution of Thailand|constitution]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/world/asia/thai-junta-expects-to-rule-for-more-than-a-year.html|title=Junta Sets Year’s Goals for Its Rule in Thailand|last=Fuller|first=Thomas|date=30 May 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=13 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25149484|title=Why is Thailand under military rule?|date=22 May 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=13 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===Delays===
The date of the 2019 Thai general election had been subject to much speculation, given the uncertainty of Prayut and the junta since taking power in the May 2014 coup.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Shortly after the 2014 coup, Prayut said that elections would likely be held "by the end of 2015". By late 2014, however, several government officials had said publicly that elections would not be held until 2016, around mid-year.<ref name=BBC_Elections_2014>{{cite news|last1=Yueh|first1=Linda|title=Thailand's elections could be delayed until 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30218621|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[BBC World News]]|publisher=BBC|date=26 November 2014}}</ref>

In May 2015, Deputy Prime Minister [[Wissanu Krea-ngam]] said that elections would now be held "around August or in September" 2016, after the government announced its intention to hold a referendum on its draft constitution, which would likely be held sometime in early 2016.<ref name=FT_postpone_elections>{{cite news|last1=Peel|first1=Michael|title=Generals postpone Thailand elections for at least six more months|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a01892a6-fe33-11e4-8efb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3chSttKG7|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=19 May 2015|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In June 2015, Prayut said that he was willing to stay in office for another two years if people "wanted him to", following a push by the National Reform Council (NRC), a government body established by the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO), to hold a vote on whether or not the government's reforms should be completed before elections were held. This would mean general elections might potentially not be held until early 2018, but a few days later distanced himself from the NRC's initiative after facing backlash for his remarks, saying "I'm not interested. It's all about the roadmap. Stop asking me [about the matter]."<ref name="PM_backpedals_on staying_on">{{cite news|title=PM backpedals on staying on|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/PM-backpedals-on-stayed-on-30261912.html|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=The Nation|publisher=Nation Multimedia Group|date=9 June 2015}}</ref><!-- This, however, left the door open to the "completion of the reforms" under another government that would also see elections further postponed, if the NRC's initiative succeeded.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}-->

In October 2017, Prime Minister Prayut pledged that a general election would be held sometime in November 2018. However, the selection of an election date gave way to rumours that Prime Minister Prayut would attempt to stay in power after the next election through a military-backed political party. While this was the case, in January 2018 Thailand's parliamentary body voted to postpone enforcement of a new election law by 90 days, further dragging out the timing of an election. At the time, the deputy prime minister said the parliament's decision could delay the election until February–March 2019.<ref name="Thailand's PM Prayut Chan-o-cha says he needs more time in office to prepare for election">{{cite news|last1=Peel|first1=Michael|title=Thailand's PM Prayut Chan-o-cha says he needs more time in office to prepare for election|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailands-pm-prayut-chan-o-cha-says-needs-a-little-more-time-in-office-to-prepare-for|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Straits Times|date=30 January 2018}}</ref>

On 3 January 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam told that the election will be delayed citing the royal coronation ceremony as the cause of the delay. In response, former EC commissioner Somchai Srisutthiyakorn said the coronation doesn't affect the election and the previously promised 24 February date is still possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1605514/ec-to-government-your-move|title=EC refuses to set date unless government moves first|last=Limited|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|website=The Bangkok Post|access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>

Although the election date has to be set by the Election Commission, they cannot do so until the government issues a royal decree formally announcing the election. The government did not issue a royal decree on 3 January as previously planned and has declined to say when they will do so.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1608898/ec-feb-24-now-impossible|title=EC: Feb 24 now impossible|last=Limited|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|website=The Bangkok Post|access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>

On 10 January, the ''Bangkok Post'' reported that 24 February date for the election is no longer possible because the government has not published a royal decree and the EC would need at least 45 days to prepare the election.<ref name=":3" /> The following day, Wissanu Krea-ngam announced that the royal decree will be released sometime in January, paving way for an election "no later than March."<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/breakingnews/30362023|title=Election no later than March, Wissanu assures|website=The Nation|language=en|access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
Changes to the voting system, introduced by the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand|2017 constitution]], were first implemented in this election. Whereas previous general elections in Thailand since 2001 used a [[parallel voting]] system, with voters marking two ballots, one for their constituency and one for a nation-wide party list, the new system, referred to as "mixed-member apportionment", uses a single vote for both the constituency and the party list, in a variant of the [[mixed-member proportional]] system. The 350 constituency seats are won by [[first-past-the-post voting]] as in previous elections. However, the 150 party list seats act as [[levelling seat]]s, and are allocated so as to give each party a total number of seats proportional to the nationwide number of votes they received.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Bangkok Pundit |title=The effects of Thailand’s proposed electoral system |url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2016/02/the-effects-of-thailands-proposed-electoral-system/ |accessdate=24 March 2019 |work=Asian Correspondent |date=10 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kendall |first1=Dave |title=Explainer: New rules for the House of Representatives |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1605898/explainer-new-rules-for-the-house-of-representatives |accessdate=24 March 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=6 January 2019}}</ref>

Other changes introduced by the new constitution are the removal of the requirement that the prime minister be selected from among the elected members of the House of Representatives. Instead, each party may name, in advance, up to three candidates to nominate as prime minister if they achieve a majority. Also, the prime minister will be voted on by the combined [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]], which also includes the 250 members of the [[Senate of Thailand|Senate]], Thailand's upper house, rather than only by the House of Representatives, as was previously done.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

As the entire sitting Senate will be appointed by the NCPO, commentators say that the change opens up the strong possibility that Prayut will become Thailand's next prime minister despite pro-Prayut parties being predicted to win fewer seats in the House of Representatives.<ref name=":1" /> With the assumption that all 250 senators will support Prayut, pro-Prayut parties would only need to win 126 seats for him to be selected as prime minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thaksin-linked-pheu-thai-party-slated-to-win-163-seats-in-thailands-first-election|title=Pro-junta party wins most votes in Thai election but opposition may win most seats|date=9 May 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1674708/thanathorn-reiterates-calls-for-senate-switch-off</ref><!-- However, commentators predict that it would be unlikely that the [[Palang Pracharath Party]] and other pro-junta parties would win a combined 126 seats and would need the support of the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} -->

===Constituency boundary controversy===
Under the new constitution, the number of constituencies was reduced from 400 to 350.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/politics/30359473|title=EC completes redrawing of constituencies  - The Nation|work=The Nation|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en}}</ref> In 2018, the [[Election Commission of Thailand|Election Commission]] (ECT) was tasked with drawing up new district boundaries. However, shortly before the ECT were about to announce the new boundaries, Prime Minister Prayut invoked [[2014 interim constitution of Thailand#Section 44|Section 44]] of the constitution to issue an order pushing back the deadline and delaying the announcement. The order also exempted the ECT from complying with existing districting laws and allowing them to draw constituency boundaries in any manner they wished.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The move sparked outrage from the [[Pheu Thai Party|Pheu Thai]] and [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]] parties and the watchdog organisation Open Forum for Democracy Foundation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1578186/watchdog-demands-govt-stop-meddling-with-ec|title=Watchdog demands govt stop meddling with EC|last=Limited|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|work=bangkokpost.com|access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref> They argued the purpose of the delay was to enable the ECT to draw constituency boundaries that favoured Prayut's [[Palang Pracharath Party]]. Some journalists and commentators compared this to [[gerrymandering]], while others opined that the changes meant that the elections were a foregone conclusion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/politics/30359125|title=EC under microscope for gerrymandering over designing of boundaries  - The Nation|work=The Nation|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/opinion/30359420|title=Election has already been won, so what now?  - The Nation|work=The Nation|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1577702/new-ec-boundary-ruling-under-fire|title=New EC boundary ruling under fire|last=Limited|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|work=bangkokpost.com|access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref>

Election Commission chairman Ittiporn Boonpracong denied the allegations, citing his eye surgery as the cause of the delay.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1580470/govt-didnt-meddle-with-constituencies|title=Govt 'didn't meddle' with constituencies|last=Limited|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|work=bangkokpost.com|access-date=29 November 2018}}</ref> The EC completed and released the new district constituencies on 29 November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/politics/30359473|title=EC completes redrawing of constituencies|website=The Nation|language=en|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref> Following the release, political parties and watchdog organisations stated that they had found several instances of gerrymandering that would benefit the Palang Pracharat Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/politics/30359551|title=Parties accuse EC of bias in constituency mapping|website=The Nation|language=en|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2018/11/30/parties-fume-over-gerrymandered-electoral-map/|title=Parties Fume Over New 'Gerrymandered' Electoral Map|last=Rojanaphruk|first=Pravit|last2=Writer|first2=Senior Staff|date=30 November 2018|website=Khaosod English|language=en-US|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref>

==Campaigning==
In total, seventy-seven parties contested the elections. Among them are the two major parties of the previous elected house, [[Pheu Thai Party|Pheu Thai]] (the majority) and the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] (the opposition), as well as the smaller long-standing players [[Bhumjaithai Party|Bhumjaithai]], [[Chartthaipattana Party|Chartthaipattana]] and [[Chart Pattana Party (2007)|Chart Pattana]].<ref name="Dummies">{{cite news |last1=Thaitrakulpanich |first1=Asaree |title=Thai Election for Dummies: Guide to the Parties |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2019/02/27/thai-election-for-dummies-guide-to-the-parties/ |accessdate=25 March 2019 |work=Khaosod English |date=27 February 2019}}</ref>

Several new parties also ran for the first time. The [[Palang Pracharath Party]] directly supported Prayut, and included several of his cabinet members. Other smaller pro-Prayut parties include the [[Action Coalition for Thailand]], led by 2013–2014 protest leader [[Suthep Thaugsuban]], and the [[People Reform Party]], headed by Paiboon Nititawan.<ref name="Dummies" />

On the opposing end, many parties took an anti-junta stance. These include several Pheu Thai–aligned parties, as well as other groups. As the election laws and regulatory bodies were seen as stacked and biased against their favour, Pheu Thai split off into a network of several smaller affiliated parties in order to distribute their risk from legal intervention. These parties were [[Thai Raksa Chart Party|Thai Raksa Chart]], [[Puea Chat Party|Puea Chat]] (consisting of several [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]] leaders), and [[Prachachart Party|Prachachart]].<ref name="Dummies" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Charuvastra |first1=Teeranai |title=Pheu Thai Splintering to Win in 2019: Jatuporn |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2018/11/15/pheu-thai-splintering-to-win-in-2019-jatuporn/ |accessdate=25 March 2019 |work=Khaosod English |date=15 November 2018}}</ref>

The other anti-military parties include the [[Future Forward Party]], which is led by multimillionaire businessman [[Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit]] and campaigned on a strong liberal stance catering to young voters, and the [[Thai Liberal Party]], led by former police commissioner [[Seripisut Temiyavet]].<ref name="Dummies" />

==Royal interventions==
On the night of 8 February, the day Princess [[Ubolratana]] was nominated as prime minister candidate by [[Thai Raksa Chart Party]], her younger brother King [[Maha Vajiralongkorn]] made a televised announcement condemning her bid as "defy[ing] the nation's culture".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47175604|title=Thailand's king condemns bid by sister to become PM|date=8 February 2019|accessdate=24 March 2019|publisher=BBC|website=BBC}}</ref> The party was later dissolved by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thai-king-urges-support-for-good-people-hours-before-polls-open|title=Thai king urges support for 'good people' hours before polls open|date=23 March 2019|accessdate=24 March 2019|website=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings}}</ref>

On the night of 23 March, just hours before the polls opened, King Maha Vajiralongkorn again made a televised announcement that he would like to warn people by citing a speech given by his father, [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], 30 years ago, saying good people should be supported to govern so they can prevent bad people from creating trouble.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1649920/kings-message-support-good-people-to-govern|title=King's message: Support good people to govern|date=23 March 2019|accessdate=24 March 2019|website=Bangkok Post|publisher=Bangkok Post|location=Bangkok|author=Online Reporters}}</ref> This made the hashtag "#โตแล้วเลือกเองได้" ("We are grown up, we can choose by ourselves") trending at number 1 on Twitter soon afterwards.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-47681835|title=เลือกตั้ง 2562: ร.10 โปรดเกล้าฯ อัญเชิญพระบรมราโชวาท ร.9 "ส่งเสริมคนดีปกครองบ้านเมือง และควบคุมคนไม่ดี ไม่ให้มีอำนาจ"|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|location=Bangkok|date=23 March 2019|accessdate=24 March 2019|language=th}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://prachatai.com/journal/2019/03/81668|title=#โตแล้วเลือกเองได้ ขึ้นอันดับ 1 เทรนด์ในทวิตเตอร์คืนก่อนวันเลือกตั้ง|author=ประชาไท|publisher=ประชาไท|website=ประชาไท|language=th|location=Bangkok|date=23 March 2019|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://themomentum.co/trend-hashtag-before-election/|title=ชาวโซเชียลฯ ดัน #โตแล้วเลือกเองได้ ขึ้นเทรนด์อันดับหนึ่งทวิตเตอร์ช่วงเที่ยงคืนก่อนวันเลือกตั้ง|language=th|location=Bangkok|date=23 March 2019|accessdate=24 March 2019|website=The Momentum|publisher=Day Poets|author=The Momentum Team}}</ref> During the election hours, the royal announcement was repeatedly re-broadcast on television and the Election Commission president stated to the press urging the Thais to make their choices by "taking the royal announcement into account".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/thai/live/thailand-47637739|quote=8:05 อัญเชิญพระบรมราโชวาท ร.9 "ส่งเสริมคนดีปกครองบ้านเมือง" มาเผยแพร่ซ้ำทาง ทรท. ฯลฯ / 10:37 ปธ.กกต. ขอคนไทยใช้สิทธิ “โดยคำนึงถึงประกาศสำนักพระราชวัง” ฯลฯ|language=th|location=Bangkok|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=24 March 2019|accessdate=24 March 2019|title=พลังประชาชนกำหนดอนาคตประเทศไทย 24 มี.ค.}}</ref>

==Eligible Prime ministerial candidates==
{{Main|2019 Thai prime ministerial candidates}}

Prior to the [[Constitution of Thailand|2017 Thai Constitution]], any elected House of Representative member could be voted upon and selected as prime minister.

Under the new constitution, political parties can name up to three candidates for prime minister prior to the election. These candidates do not have to be members of the House of Representatives or even members of a political party as long as they meet the legal qualifications.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The candidates for the main contending parties are [[Sudarat Keyuraphan]], [[Chadchart Sittipunt]] and [[Chaikasem Nitisiri]] for Pheu Thai, [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] for the Democrats, [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]] for Palang Pracharat, and [[Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit]] for Future Forward.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Note: The Rangsit University poll is often criticised for its alleged bias towards Prayut and Palang Pracharat. Sangsit Phiriyarangsan, who leads the polling effort, is a staunch public supporter of Prayut's and sceptics accuse him of artificially inflating Prayut and Palang Pracharat's poll numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://workpointnews.com/2018/12/29/%e0%b8%aa%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%87%e0%b8%a8%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%95-%e0%b8%9b%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b0%e0%b8%81%e0%b8%b2%e0%b8%a8%e0%b8%a2%e0%b8%b8%e0%b8%95%e0%b8%b4%e0%b8%97%e0%b8%b3%e0%b8%a3%e0%b8%b1%e0%b8%87/|title="สังศิต" ประกาศยุติทำรังสิตโพลล์ หลังผล "ประยุทธ์" นำถูกหาว่าไม่เป็นกลาง|last=News|first=Workpoint|website=Workpoint News|language=th|access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref>

After the publication of the December poll, Sangsit announced that he will no longer publish polls under the university's name to protect the institution from criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thaipost.net/main/detail/25382|title=รังสิตโพลพ่นพิษ!'สังศิต'ประกาศไม่ทำแล้วหลังเผยคะแนนนิยม'บิ๊กตู่'นำตลอด|website=Thai Post {{!}} อิสรภาพแห่งความคิด|language=en|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> However, in February, Sangsit and Rangsit University released another poll.<ref name=":5" />

===Preferred Prime Minister===
Traditionally, political parties support their party leader as the prime minister. However, in this election, multiple parties have declared support for [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]] as the next prime minister.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2018/03/02/dozens-new-parties-register-election-commission/|title=Dozens of New Parties Register For Next Election|date=2 March 2018|work=Khaosod English|access-date=30 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Prayut is not an official member of any political party, however, several of his cabinet ministers and advisors are leaders of the [[Palang Pracharath Party]]. Palang Pracharat is widely acknowledged as the political vehicle for Prayut to return as prime minister in a democratic regime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1546578/pm-allows-ministers-to-back-parties|title=PM allows ministers to back parties|website=[[Bangkok Post]]|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> On 8 February, Prayut officially became Palang Pracharat's candidate for prime minister, although he still remains an independent.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In a December 2018 interview, Satitra Thananithichoti, an academic with expertise in polling and analysis, raised concerns with prime minister candidate polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.voicetv.co.th/|title=Voice TV 21|last=Ltd.Thailand|first=VOICE TV|website=VoiceTV|language=th|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> He revealed that from the polling data he has seen, a significant number of people said their preferred prime minister candidate was Prayut but also stated that their preferred political party was Pheu Thai, which does not support Prayut. Satitra pointed out that this could explain why Prayut regularly wins PM polls while Palang Pracharat often loses in party polls.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Conduct==
The election was widely seen as unfair, both due to its rules and biased environment. The Election Commission, which was appointed by the junta-appointed National Legislative Assembly, was widely criticized for perceived biases and incompetency. [[Human Rights Watch]] cited political repression, media censorship, unequal media access, the role of the military-appointed Senate, and lack of independence and impartiality of the Election Commission as factors preventing a free and fair election.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Human Rights Watch |title=Thailand: Structural Flaws Subvert Election |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/03/19/thailand-structural-flaws-subvert-election |website=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=26 March 2019 |language=en |date=19 March 2019}}</ref> Election monitors have also criticized the election process. The Asian Network for Free Elections commented on the environment being tilted to benefit the junta, and the confused vote-counting process that created mistrust.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tanakasempipat |first1=Patpicha |last2=Kittisilpa |first2=Juarawee |title=Monitor says Thai election campaign 'heavily tilted' to benefit junta |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-election/monitor-says-thai-election-campaign-heavily-tilted-to-benefit-junta-idUSKCN1R70I3 |accessdate=26 March 2019 |work=Reuters |date=26 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The People Network for Elections in Thailand (P-NET) released a statement that the election was not free and fair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/breakingnews/30366537|title=Election not free or fair, says poll monitor|website=The Nation|language=en|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref> They cited prevalent and rampant cases of vote-buying in the North, Northeast, and Central regions. P-NET blamed the Election Commission for turning a blind eye to many of these violations. P-NET also stated that many local government officials used their authority to give an advantage to certain parties since this election had no volunteer observers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The Election Commission drew much criticism for problems with the election. These include issues with overseas voting, where poorly designed envelope labels led to mailed ballots being rejected or mis-delivered by postal services, and information pamphlets contained unclear or incorrect information.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Achakulwisut |first1=Atiya |title=Poll agency does fine job of not inspiring trust |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1647132/poll-agency-does-fine-job-of-not-inspiring-trust |accessdate=26 March 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=19 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Yuda |first1=Masayuki |title=Thai election regulator comes under fire for irregularities |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Thai-election/Thai-election-regulator-comes-under-fire-for-irregularities |accessdate=26 March 2019 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=13 March 2019}}</ref> On election day, it became apparent that 1,500 ballots from New Zealand were misplaced during air cargo transfer and could not be delivered to counting centres in time to be considered valid.<ref>{{cite news |title=Late ballots from NZ delayed for days at air cargo warehouses |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1651380/late-ballots-from-nz-delayed-for-days-at-air-cargo-warehouses |accessdate=26 March 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=26 March 2019}}</ref> The polling process saw many reports of irregularities,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Charuvastra |first1=Teeranai |title=EU, UK Urge Thailand to Resolve ‘Election Irregularities’ |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2019/03/26/eu-uk-urge-thailand-to-resolve-election-irregularities/ |accessdate=26 March 2019 |work=Khaosod English |date=26 March 2019}}</ref> and the counting process and initial results were very confused, as the live figures released by the EC contained large amounts of errors.

==<span id="Preliminary results"></span>Results==
{{main|List of MPs elected in the 2019 Thai general election}}
Partial preliminary results showed Pheu Thai and Palang Pracharath close in the two leading positions, followed by Future Forward. The results were a major upset for the Democrat Party, which came in fourth place, and Abhisit promptly resigned as party leader on election night.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Kay |title=Former Thai PM Abhisit resigns as head of Democrats after election... |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-election-abhisit/former-thai-pm-abhisit-resigns-as-head-of-democrats-after-election-loss-idUSKCN1R50L1 |accessdate=30 March 2019 |work=Reuters |date=24 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

The Election Commission originally scheduled a press conference at 20:00 on election day, which would announce unofficial preliminary results at 95% of the vote counted. However, this was postponed until 21:30, and the EC chairman only announced several voter statistics. He said unofficial results would not be announced until the following day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Abhisit Resigns From Democrat Party: Live Blog |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2019/03/24/live-blog-thailand-2019-election-day/ |accessdate=24 March 2019 |work=Khaosod English |date=24 March 2019}}</ref>

The Election Commission announced the unofficial results of 350 constituencies on Tuesday 26 and released full unofficial results in a press conference on Thursday 28. However, the figures contained many discrepancies, and led to further confusion.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Charuvastra |first1=Teeranai |title=Election Results Removed After Media Spot Discrepancies |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2019/03/28/election-commission-releases-voting-results/ |accessdate=30 March 2019 |work=Khaosod English |date=28 March 2019}}</ref> Party list seats would not be announced until the Election Commission officially endorsed the results, which was expected to happen near the deadline of 9 May, after the [[coronation of King Vajiralongkorn]]. Following the announcements, political parties began talks to form a coalition government. The Pheu Thai, Future Forward, Thai Liberal, Puea Chat, Prachachart, Thai People Power and New Economics parties announced an alliance at a press conference on 27 March.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pheu Thai unveils alliance set to form post-election coalition |url=https://www.thaipbsworld.com/pheu-thai-unveils-alliance-set-to-form-post-election-coalition/ |accessdate=9 May 2019 |work=Thai PBS World |date=27 March 2019}}</ref> Despite Pheu Thai winning the most seats, Palang Pracharath also claimed it was entitled to form government, as it won more votes.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Charuvastra |first1=Teeranai |title=Phalang Pracharath Insists on Leading Coalition, Won’t Name Allies |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2019/03/27/phalang-pracharath-insists-on-leading-coalition-wont-name-allies/ |accessdate=30 March 2019 |work=Khaosod English |date=27 March 2019}}</ref>

Due to the ambiguous way the election law was written, calculations by the media based on different interpretations of the law initially led to different sets of election results being reported. However, the calculations were widely questioned, and the Election Commission, heavily criticized for not making its calculation methods public, deferred the matter to the Constitutional Court on 11 April.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bangprapa |first1=Mongkol |title=Doubts cast on May 9 poll results |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1660300/doubts-cast-on-may-9-poll-results |accessdate=12 April 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=12 April 2019}}</ref> The Constitutional Court dismissed the request, and in a separate ruling ruled that the election law did not contradict the constitution.<ref>{{cite news |title=List-MP calculation method is constitutional, court rules |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1674040/list-mp-calculation-method-is-constitutional-court-rules |accessdate=8 May 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=8 May 2019}}</ref>

The Pheu Thai and Future Forward parties contested the calculation formula adopted by the ECT, as it resulted in Future Forward receiving seven less seats than expected from their alternative interpretation of the law, and their alliance securing 245 instead of 255 seats, just short of a majority. As such, they appeared unlikely to be able to form a government. The results also favoured several small parties which one seat each, who were expected to join a Palang Pracharath-led coalition.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sattaburuth |first1=Aekarach |last2=Bangprapa |first2=Mongkol |title=Pheu Thai govt hope on ropes |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/1674208/pheu-thai-govt-hope-on-ropes |accessdate=9 May 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=9 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Suhartono |first1=Muktita |last2=Ramzy |first2=Austin |title=Thailand Election Results Signal Military’s Continued Grip on Power |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/world/asia/thailand-election-results.html |accessdate=9 May 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=9 May 2019}}</ref> The new house convened on 24 May, and Prayut was voted prime minister in a joint session on 5 June.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ellis-Petersen |first1=Hannah |title=Thailand's military-backed PM voted in after junta creates loose coalition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/thailand-military-backed-pm-prayuth-chan-ocha-voted-in-after-junta-creates-loose-coalition |accessdate=5 June 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=5 June 2019}}</ref>
