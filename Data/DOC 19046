:: [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Though the article is new and long (2.155 KB); the reference says so; however, negative nature of the hook (NPOV) is worrying; especially in the Indian election season. [[User:Redtigerxyz|<font color = "red" >Redtigerxyz</font>]] <sup> [[User talk:Redtigerxyz|Talk]] </sup> 18:55, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::{{Ping|Redtigerxyz}} actually this person is famous for his negative behaviour. In this case NPOV cannot work because the hook is not said by us instead it was supported by a source. And he is not an election candidate for Lok Sabha general election of 2014, so nothing to worry about.   '''[[User:Jim Cartar|<span style="color:#F00">J</span><span style="color:#F46">i</span><span style="color:#FA0">m</span> <span style="color:#282">Carter</span>]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Jim Cartar|<span style="color:#9ACEFE">talk</span>]])</sup> 05:52, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:::: [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] However, I will suggest that this article should not be featured on main page till 12 May, as Lok Sabha elections will go on in West Bengal till then. Mandal's party is contesting elections there. [[User:Redtigerxyz|<font color = "red" >Redtigerxyz</font>]] <sup> [[User talk:Redtigerxyz|Talk]] </sup> 13:23, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

::::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Temporarily putting approval on hold until after the Lok Sabha elections are over, so the nomination isn't promoted prematurely. I'd also like to get a second opinion on the NPOV issue for after then. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 04:58, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] At first glance, I also thought the article was overly negative, but after reading numerous news headlines about him, it appears that this politician is famous for his controversial speech and behaviour. GTG now that the elections are over. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 04:25, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] The other aspects have already been reviewed by the first reviewer. But if you insist, here we go again: article is new enough, long enough, neutral, and thoroughly referenced to RS. Hook is interesting and verified. No copyvio detected (checked with Dup Detector). QPQ performed. Good to go. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 04:19, 16 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
