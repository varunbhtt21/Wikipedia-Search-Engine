'''''The Roy Rogers Show''''' was a 30-minute [[Western (genre)|Western]] radio program in the [[United States]]. It began in 1944, ended in 1955,<ref name="phillips">Phillips, Robert W. (1995).

== Format ==
Like the television program of the same name, the show centered on [[Roy Rogers]], one of the most popular singing-cowboy movie stars. Initially, the radio show differed in format from ''[[The Roy Rogers Show]]'' on TV, with the radio version being more oriented toward music. Toward its end, however, it moved more toward the adventure featured in the TV show. Radio historian [[John Dunning (radio historian)|John Dunning]] wrote: <blockquote>"[T]he early shows followed the pattern set by ''[Gene] [[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch|Autry's Melody Ranch]]'' ... Rogers' show featured Roy and the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] in such fine Western favorites as "[[Tumbling Tumbleweeds]]," "[[Cool Water (song)|Cool Water]]," and "[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]." Much of the show was campfire banter and song, with Roy and songstress [[Pat Friday]] doing vocal solos, [[Perry Botkin Sr.|Perry Botkin]] leading the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] orchestra and Verne Smith announcing. Dramatic skits were offered, but leaned to lighter material than what the show used in late years. Ultimately, it became primarily a Western thriller show.<ref name="dunningtiy">Dunning, John. (1976). ''Tune in Yesterday: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, 1925-1976''. Prentice-Hall, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-932616-2}}. Pp. 525-527.</ref></blockquote>

The show's music, like that featured in Rogers' movies, had a lasting effect on the music business. A 1986 article in [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] magazine endorsed membership for Rogers in the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]]. It said, in part, "Two generations of Americans grew up with Rogers on the silver screen, TV, and radio -- and the impact he had on the present success of country music would be hard to estimate and easy to underestimate."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Gerry|title=Nashville Scene|journal=Billboard|date=August 16, 1986|volume=98|issue=33|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT31&dq=%22Roy+Rogers%22+radio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ryJhU4jyG6jK8wHZuoDgDA&ved=0CH8Q6AEwDw#v=onepage&q=%22Roy%20Rogers%22%20radio&f=false|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> Although Rogers was already in the Hall of Fame as a member of the Sons of the Pioneers when that article was written, he was inducted as an individual in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roy Rogers|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/Inductees/InducteeDetail/roy-rogers|work=Country Music Hall of Fame|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

The music's appeal endured enough that, in 1999, the [[Rhino Entertainment]] company brought out a four-CD box set of Rogers' music. The 94-song set was described in a newspaper article as "heavy on transcriptions of old radio show broadcasts, auditions and live performances that have never before been released."<ref>{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=John|title=Company releases box set in tribute to Roy Rogers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1906&dat=19990522&id=ReMfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bdkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5467,1247186|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=The Fort Scott Tribune|date=May 22, 1999}}</ref>

The triumph of good over evil was a continuing thread throughout the program's existence. A 1954 newspaper article noted that Rogers' radio and TV shows featured "entertainment ... in which justice triumphs." It added: "A steady parade of badmen forever appear to plague the law-abiding, justice-loving Roy Rogers and to present to Roy and his friends a constant challenge. Embezzlers, swindlers, poachers, bank robbers, horse-thieves and diamond smugglers ... each to be vanquished in turn by the hard-riding cowboy."<ref>{{cite news|title=Vitrue Always Triumphs Over Evil As Roy Rogers Rides On|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2294&dat=19540404&id=v8wmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bgIGAAAAIBAJ&pg=3296,4876425|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=Wilmington Sunday Star|date=April 4, 1954}}</ref>

==Cast==
The main actors in the program were familiar to fans of Rogers' movies. He was the star, with wife [[Dale Evans]] and sidekick [[George "Gabby" Hayes|Gabby Hayes]]. Initially, the Sons of the Pioneers were the featured musical group; in 1948, they were replaced by [[Foy Willing]] and the [[Riders of the Purple Sage (band)|Riders of the Purple Sage]]. In the show's later years, [[Pat Brady (actor)|Pat Brady]] replaced Hayes.<ref name="dunningtiy"/> Hayes was Rogers' "grizzled sidekick from the movies," whereas Brady "was a different sort of sidekick, younger and more useful, although still comical." <ref name="atoz">Reinehr, Robert C. and Swartz, Jon D.
