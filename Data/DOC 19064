Fails [[WP:BIO]]. External notice is necessary for [[WP:FRINGE]] subjects, and while many creationists trumpet this person, we need [[WP:FRIND|independent sources]] to establish notability on the basis of fringey-ness. He is not a notable [[WP:AUTHOR]] either. [[User:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|jps]] ([[User talk:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|talk]]) 18:57, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. There's nothing wrong with this short article as far as I can see. Refs are fine. WP:FRINGE is about ''theories'', not individuals, possible misreading of actual policies I'm afraid.

::Why is he [[WP:GNG|notable]]? [[User:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|jps]] ([[User talk:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|talk]]) 19:20, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Seems he has an MA, taught elementary school for awhile and is a substitute teacher. He is a ''book reviewer'' for Amazon ... seems anyone can write reviews for Amazon so how is that remotely notable? Seems he has three books published by the Institute for Creation Research and "several" articles for that institute and ''Answers in Genesis'' ... where have those works been reviewed? Tell me again how this good man is notable ... [[User:Vsmith|Vsmith]] ([[User talk:Vsmith|talk]]) 19:36, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''; the lack of reliable independent sources in a fringey area makes it very difficult to write neutral content. In this case, we have a choice between a substantial article based on creationist sources, or cut it down to a microstub about an otherwise non-notable individual, or deletion. The latter is the best way to meet wikipedia's standards. Other sites which don't require neutrality or notability may find it easier to sustain an article on this person, but not wikipedia.

*'''Delete''' No deep third-party coverage in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to support notability criteria. <b>[[User:Ohnoitsjamie|OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font>]] [[User talk:Ohnoitsjamie|<sup>Talk</sup>]]</b> 21:46, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as non notable. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 00:17, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. He has a few mainstream journal articles under his own name, from his time at Northeastern Illinois University (see Google Scholar), plus the Creationist books under the "John Woodmorappe" pseudonym (these have received multiple reviews, mostly negative). He gets a brief mention in Robert P. Vande Kappelle's ''Beyond Belief: Faith, Science, and the Value of Unknowing'' and in the Tom McIver book already cited in the article. There is also some minor media coverage. Altogether, I think that puts him over the notability line. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.57.204|101.117.57.204]] ([[User talk:101.117.57.204|talk]]) 01:13, 1 May 2014 (UTC) <small>— [[Special:Contributions/101.117.57.204|101.117.57.204]] ([[User talk:101.117.57.204|talk]]) has made [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|few or no other edits]] outside this topic. </small>
