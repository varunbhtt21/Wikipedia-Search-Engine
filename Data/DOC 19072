Title : G-less cassette
Text : The '''G-less cassette''' transcription assay is a method used in [[molecular biology]] to determine [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] strength ''in vitro''. The technique involves quantification of an mRNA product with the use of a plasmid.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reverse Transcriptase-Coupled Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis of Cell-Free Transcription on the Chromatin-Assembled p21 Promoter |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=3160311 | pmid=21886803 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023617 |volume=6 |journal=PLOS ONE |pages=e23617 | last1 = Park | first1 = JH | last2 = Magan | first2 = N}}</ref> The G-less cassette is part of a pre-constructed vector, usually containing a [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS) upstream of the cassette. For this reason, promoters of interest can be inserted directly into the MCS to ultimately measure the accuracy and efficiency of a promoter in recruiting transcription machinery.

'''(a)''' A pre-made plasmid with a 365-nt G-less sense strand is subjected to promoter insertion. '''(b)''' The promoter is cloned into the multiple cloning site (MCS) immediately upstream of the transcription start site. A polymerase is used transcribe the G-less cassette. Once the cassette has been transcribed and first guanosine triphosphate in the sense strand beyond the cassette is detected, transcription is prematurely terminated. A radiolabeled 365-nt transcript is released. The transcripts produced in a G-less cassette assay may be subjected to gel electrophoresis to confirm their length and autoradiography to determine relative promoter strength.]]

==Method==
The G-less cassette is a [[reporter gene]] that encodes a transcript lacking [[guanine]] nucleotides in the [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]] strand of the DNA (hence "'''G'''-less").<ref name="Baniahmad2002">{{cite book|author=Aria Baniahmad|title=Thyroid Hormone Receptors: Methods and Protocols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDuqWMe_6xEC&pg=PA211|year=2002|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-174-9|page=211}}</ref> A plasmid containing such a gene  is located downstream of a MCS. After the promoter is inserted into the MCS, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] proceeds with the addition of radiolabeled UTP, CTP, and ATP (as well as non-radiolabeled/cold nucleotides) and continues until the end of the G-less cassette is reached and guanine residues are once again apparent in the sense strand of the DNA. The absence of GTP ''in vitro'' results in transcription being prematurely terminated at the first guanine residue in the sense strand following the cassette. [[Gel electrophoresis]] is performed on the transcription products and the amount of radioactivity is quantified by [[autoradiograph]]y or [[Phosphorimager|phosphorimaging]] to determine the strength of the promoter of interest.

==Application==
The G-less cassette technique is used to determine promoter strength beyond basal levels of transcription (i.e. in the presence of [[transcription activators]] or [[transcription factor]]s<ref>{{cite journal|title=Poly(A) signal-dependent degradation of unprocessed nascent transcripts accompanies poly(A) signal-dependent transcriptional pausing in vitro |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=2802029 | pmid=19926725 |doi=10.1261/rna.1622010 |volume=16 |journal=RNA |pages=197–210 | last1 = Kazerouninia | first1 = A | last2 = Ngo | first2 = B | last3 = Martinson | first3 = HG}}</ref>). For example, to measure the effects of a [[TATA box]] [[consensus sequence]] modification in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' in the presence of [[TFIID]], G-less cassettes were implemented to measure the relative strength of each promoter.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Minimal components of the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus determine the consensus TATA box |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=2396422 | pmid=18385157 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn130 |volume=36 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |pages=2906–16 | last1 = Bjornsdottir | first1 = G | last2 = Myers | first2 = LC}}</ref>

==Advantages==
The G-less assay can be performed on a circular plasmid to measure levels of transcription. A circular plasmid provides a more efficient template in many systems when compared to other assays such as runoff transcription, in which a cleaved end is required. This method generates radiolabeled transcripts very efficiently because it bypasses the unnecessary process of performing other indirect mRNA product measurements. The promoter is inserted into a circular plasmid containing the G-less cassette, which will generate a transcript of a certain length that omits random and nonspecific transcription throughout the plasmid. Most crude systems, such as HeLa nuclear extracts, are used because they contain low amounts of contaminating GTP that lead to background transcription and may occasionally cause random transcription to read through the G-less cassette.<ref>{{cite journal|title= G-less cassette in vitro transcription using HeLa cell nuclear extracts|date=2014-11-12 |pmid=20194456 | doi=10.1101/pdb.prot5387 |volume=2010 |journal=Cold Spring Harb Protoc |pages=pdb.prot5387 | last1 = Carey | first1 = MF | last2 = Peterson | first2 = CL | last3 = Smale | first3 = ST}}</ref>
