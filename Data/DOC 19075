'''''Grön eld''''' (''Fire in Green'') is a glass sculpture by [[Vicke Lindstrand]] at [[Järnvägstorget, Umeå|Järnvägstorget]], which is located in front of [[Umeå Central Station]], in [[Umeå]], Sweden. It was, at nine meters, the tallest glass sculpture in the world at the time of its inauguration in 1970.<ref name="Vicke">{{cite web|title=Skulptören Vicke Lindstrand |url=http://www.vickelindstrand.com/skulptor.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525145518/http://www.vickelindstrand.com/skulptor.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

== History ==
[[Sven Wallander]], the head of [[HSB (Sweden)|HSB]], commissioned the sculpture after he had seen the glass sculpture ''Prisma'' by Vicke Lindstrand in [[Norrköping]]. HSB donated ''Grön eld'' to [[Umeå Municipality]], which paid for the foundation.<ref name="Vicke"/> 

Lennart Johansson, who assembled the sculpture in 1970, told the press in December 2013 that he had hidden an image of [[Mao Zedong]] in one of the glass flames of the sculpture.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mao Zedong gömd i svenskt konstverk |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/mao-zedong-gomd-i-svenskt-konstverk |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Sindra Grahn |title=Mao gömd i känd Umeå-skulptur |url=http://www.svt.se/kultur/mao-gomd-i-svenskt-konstverk |newspaper=[[SVT]] |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>

== The sculpture ==
''Grön eld'' consists of three twisted glass pillars that grow thinner at the top. The glass pillars are constructed of three thousand, nine millimeter thin, plates of glass made by [[Emmaboda glasverk]] in Sweden. The glass pieces are glued together with [[epoxy glue]] in order to cope with the harsh climate. The nine meter high sculpture weighs 45 [[ton]]s and is standing on a heavy concrete [[pedestal]] with a [[piled foundation]].<ref name="Vicke"/>
