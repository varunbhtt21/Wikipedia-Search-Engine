It is not a red thread that runs through the white pages of your book, but a wide, black band that stands out defiantly against the bloody pages."<ref name=simonyan /> [[Malachia Ormanian]], the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]], described the narrative as "the most complete and perfect work" on the events in Adana.<ref name=simonyan />
