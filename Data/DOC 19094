He holds a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Montevallo]] in [[Montevallo, Alabama|Montevallo]] in [[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby County]], Alabama.

==Political life==

In 1978, Amari was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[Alabama House of Representatives]] from District 34. After one four-year term in the House, he was elected for a one-year term in the [[Alabama State Senate]] from District 12. In 1983, he won a [[special election]] for the newly established Senate District 15, which he filled until 1999. By 1990, Amari had switched to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] affiliation and was from 1995 to 1999 the Senate Republican Leader. In 1998, he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama|lieutenant governor]]. He lost to his state Senate colleague, [[Steve Windom]] of [[Theodore, Alabama|Theodore]] in [[South Alabama]], 178,065 (52.8 percent) to 159,006 (47.2 percent). Windom then barely defeated the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, the state Senate President Pro Tempore Dewayne Freeman of [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], 652,465 (50.3 percent) to 644,818 (49.7 percent). In 2002, Amari challenged state Senator [[Steve French (Alabama politician)|Steve French]] to reclaim the District 15 seat that he had vacated four years earlier to run for lieutenant governor. French easily prevailed with 12,469 votes (60.1 percent) to Amari's 8,274 (39.9 percent).<ref name=campaigns>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=42377|title=Amari, John|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

In 2006, Amari ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for the Place 2 seat on the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]], vacated by Democrat-turned-Republican [[George Wallace, Jr.]], who ran instead but without success for lieutenant governor. Amari lost the nomination, 58-42 percent, to former state Representative [[Perry O. Hooper, Jr.]], of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], a son of former [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]] In the 2006 campaign, Hooper called Amari a "[[Republican in Name Only|RINO]], a Republican in name only." Amari replied that Hooper "might have been born in a Republican family, but [by] his conduct ... he has 'left his raising' as they say."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/060716/loyalty.shtml|title=Candidates in GOP runoff for PSC 2 question loyalty |publisher=''Decatur Daily'', [[Decatur, Alabama]], July 16, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> Hooper was thereafter defeated in the general election by the Democrat [[Susan Parker]], a former state auditor.

In 2008, Amari defeated an appointed Republican, Norman G. "Norm" Winston,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://10jc.alacourt.gov/NGW.html|title=The Honorable Norman G. "Norm" Winston|publisher=10jc.alacourt.gov|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> for the civil judgeship of the District 10 Circuit Court, which he still holds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://10jc.alacourt.gov/jea.html|title=The Honorable John E. Amari|publisher=10jc.alacourt.gov|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

Amari calls himself "Pro-Life, Pro-Family, and Pro-Business." He was named seven times by his colleagues as "Legislator of the Year". He is a former chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus. He was a delegate pledged to [[George W. Bush]] at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]] held in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=campaigns/>

Amari's son, also named John Amari (born 1981), unsuccessfully sought a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives in 2014, losing in the Republican primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/11/amari_announces_campaign_for_a.html|title=Amari announces campaign for Alabama House District 44, November 19, 2013|publisher=blog.al.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>
