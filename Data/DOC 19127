Before I attempt to prune some frankly absurd content out of this newly created disambiguation page - do we need it all? No one refers to Ottawa as downtown Canada, nor do we refer to our downtowns that way. Which leaves us with a joke-name in the South Park series, or how Detroit residents ''may'' refer to Windsor, Ontario -- or so it is [[WP:WEASEL]]ishly and [[WP:OR|tenuously]] claimed, "...since some people consider."

*'''Delete''' Completely pejorative and useless, and no, Detroiters don't usually refer Windsor as this, but as either "Windsor", "Canada", "Ontario", "across the river" or any of a number of other appropriate ways to refer to it. <font face="Myriad Web">'''[[User:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:royalblue4">Nate</span>]]''' <span style="color:dark blue">•</span> <small>''([[User_talk:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:darkgoldenrod">chatter</span>]])''</small></font> 00:37, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' The place does not exist.  The term is not commonly used. [[Special:Contributions/209.90.140.72|209.90.140.72]] ([[User talk:209.90.140.72|talk]]) 21:46, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. There ''is'' a scholarly book entitled ''Downtown Canada: Writing Canadian Cities'', viewable at Amazon.com [http://www.amazon.com/Downtown-Canada-Writing-Canadian-Cities/dp/0802086683#reader_0802086683 here] and reviewed [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/university_of_toronto_quarterly/v076/76.1dawson.html here].  However, my search through the Amazon text of the book didn't reveal any suggestions that the phrase is commonly used, and I find no other indications to this effect. The ''South Park'' gag is not sufficient to convey notability on the phrase. No prejudice, of course, toward recreating an article of this name about the book if it can be shown to be notable. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 03:25, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*This has got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen on Wikipedia in my entire time here — and that's saying a lot given that I've been around here for a decade. The only usage here that's even ''remotely'' valid for this title is the ''[[South Park]]'' reference, and a throwaway joke in a single episode of a TV series is not a topic that warrants a Wikipedia article or a disambiguation page. '''Delete with fire'''. No prejudice against subsequent repurposing of this title as an article about the Edwards/Ivison book instead, if there's enough [[WP:RS|reliable source]] coverage about it to support one — but even if we can justify that, we can do it from a redlink and don't need ''this'' nonsense hanging around in its edit history.
