*'''Keep''' as subject has drawn sufficient coverage in reliable sources to cross the verifiability and notability thresholds. Notability is not a competition. - [[User:Dravecky|Dravecky]] ([[User talk:Dravecky|talk]]) 06:26, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::*'''Comment''' sufficient coverage? The 3 references on her article are all about her husband with just mentions of her. Which by our [[WP:GNG|general notability guidelines]], the subject needs '''"Significant coverage addressing the topic directly and in detail, so that no original research is needed to extract the content. Significant coverage is more than a ''passing mention'' but it need not be the main topic of the source material'''. 

:::Also, for Notability (people), it stays for entertainers and actors that
:# '''Has had significant roles in multiple notable films, television shows, stage performances, or other productions.''' - She doesn't.
:# '''Has a large fan base or a significant "cult" following.''' - She doesn't.:
:# '''Has made unique, prolific or innovative contributions to a field of entertainment.''' - She doesn't.  - <small><span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #09F,-4px -4px 15px #9F0;">[[User:Lady Lotus|LADY LOTUS]]</span> • <span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #F90,-4px -4px 15px #F09;">[[User talk:Lady Lotus|TALK]]</span></small> 11:27, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Reply''' Why some invest so much passion and energy in seeking deletion of the marginally notable instead of creating new content or improving existing articles has always been a puzzlement to me. - [[User:Dravecky|Dravecky]] ([[User talk:Dravecky|talk]]) 16:50, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:::I improve articles '''IF''' they can be improved, (ex: [[Hayley Hasselhoff]], [[Maude Apatow]], [[Diem Brown]]) but if someone is only notable because of their spouse and shouldn't have their own article, then I nominate them. <small><span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #09F,-4px -4px 15px #9F0;">[[User:Lady Lotus|LADY LOTUS]]</span> • <span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #F90,-4px -4px 15px #F09;">[[User talk:Lady Lotus|TALK]]</span></small> 17:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to her husband. Insufficient independent notability (ie. lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent sources).
