==Club career==
===A.F.C. Leopards===
On 13 June 2014, Mieno joined A.F.C. Leopards from Sofapaka for a reported [[Kenya shilling|Ksh.]] 1.2 million (approx. [[United States dollar|US$]]13,690 or [[Pound sterling|£]]8,100).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/mieno-officially-joins-ingwe |title=Mieno officially joins Ingwe |date=13 June 2014 |author=Jeff Kinyanjui |publisher=Futaa.com |accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/june-transfers-fiston-the-most-expensive-so-far |title=June Transfers: Fiston the most expensive so far |date=18 June 2014 |author=Vincent Opiyo |publisher=Futaa.com |accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>

===Tusker===
After only almost seven months with ''Ingwe'', Mieno's transfer to [[Tusker F.C.|Tusker]] was announced on 27 January 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/humphrey-mieno-confirmed-at-tusker |title=Humphrey Mieno confirmed at Tusker |date=27 January 2015 |author=Mercy Njueh |publisher=Futaa.com |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> Criticised on social media for allegedly being lured away from A.F.C. Leopards purely for money and never being guided by his ambitions and contractual obligations, Mieno defended his move to his new club, saying that A.F.C. Leopards failed to pay him his wages for more than three months. He added that it was the same reason he left Sofapaka as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/mieno-hits-out-at-critics |title=Mieno hits out at critics |date=5 February 2015 |author=Vincent Opiyo |publisher=Futaa.com |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>
