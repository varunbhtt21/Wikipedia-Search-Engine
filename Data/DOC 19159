'''The Bundles''' is the only studio album by [[The Bundles|the supergroup of the same name]], released on March 9, 2010 on [[K Records]].

==Background and recording==
Fellow [[anti-folk]] artists [[Jeffrey Lewis]] and [[Kimya Dawson]] first met in 2001, and created their first five songs that year. Lewis' brother, [[Jack Lewis (musician)|Jack]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]-based musician [[Karl Blau]] and drummer [[Anders Griffen]] soon joined them in the songwriting and recording process.<ref name=Paste/> Half of the songs on ''The Bundles'' were previously released on the Lewis-Dawson collaboration "AFNY Collaborations Volume I" in 2002, but the versions on that album differed significantly from those on ''The Bundles'' because on the latter record, unlike on the former, they were recorded with The Bundles' new band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/kimya-dawson-and-jeffrey-lewis-to-release-album-as/35786/ | title=Kimya Dawson And Jeffrey Lewis To Release Album As The Bundles | work=Prefix | date=19 December 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2014 | author=Hoven, Michael}}</ref>
