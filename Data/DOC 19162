Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''speedy close''' as this is the wrong venue for this matter. [[WP:RM]] is the proper venue, though you are correct that if this move is carried out as you propose the current [[Interstate 540]] dab page would have to be deleted, but under [[WP:CSD#G6|G6]]. I also see on [[Talk:Interstate 49 in Arkansas]] that there is no consensus yet to merge [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)]] into that article. Please continue those discussions and use [[WP:RM]] if there is a consensus. Non-admin closure. &mdash;<span style="color:#808080">[[User:Kuyabribri|'''KuyaBriBri''']]</span><sup><span style="color:#008080">[[User_Talk:Kuyabribri|''Talk'']]</span></sup> 00:01, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

Only one of these highways is still Interstate 540; the one in North Carolina. To update the dis-ambiguation, we must:

*Delete this dis-ambiguation page (as long as there are no other Interstate 540's)
*Move [[Interstate 540 (North Carolina)]] to [[Interstate 540]]
*Merge [[Interstate 540 (Arkansas)]] into [[Interstate 49 in Arkansas]]
*Add a dis-ambiguation link at the top of the new [[Interstate 540]] article (currently titled [[Interstate 540 (North Carolina)]]) saying <nowiki> {{the current I-540 in North Carolina|the former I-540 in Arkansas|Interstate 49 in Arkansas}} </nowiki> [[User:Georgia guy|Georgia guy]] ([[User talk:Georgia guy|talk]]) 19:54, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
