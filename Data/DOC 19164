PP 31-34</ref> He was originally a poor fox hunter, but Sher Shah spotted his potential and elevated him to the position of a general. According to historical accounts he was born of a slave woman to a household of Lohani Marwats.

After victory in the [[Battle of Sammel]], Khawas Khan Marwat took possession of Jodhpur and occupied the territory of Marwar from Ajmer to Mount Abu in 1544. When Hamayun fled from Agra towards Multan, Sher Shah dispatched Khawas Khan and the greater part of his army to pursue him and drive him beyond the borders of Hindustan.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The Mughal division which had quit Hamayun and was marching toward Kabul, encountered Khawas Khan and not being strong enough, fled leaving their drums and standards behind.<ref>Mughal Empire in India: A Systematic Study Including Source Material, Volume 1, page 124</ref> He then rejoined Sher Shah. Sher Shah built Rohtas Fort in Jehlum to keep down Gakkars and to block Emperor Humayun's return to India, and appointed Khawas Khan the administrative head of the fort.<ref>http://tribune.com.pk/story/310971/khwas-khan-of-rohtas/</ref>

==Revolt against Islam Shah and Death==
Khawas Khan along with eminent nobles like Qutb Khan Naib, Isa Khan Niazi and Jal Khan Julwani stood against [[Islam Shah Suri]] in support of Adil Khan.  Adil Khan revolted and, accompanied by Khawas Khan, proceeded to attack Agra, but he was defeated in a battle outside the town. He fled to Panna and was not heard of again. Khawas Khan also fled towards Sarhind.

Islam Shah tried to kill all those nobles who were supposed to be in sympathy with Adil Khan. [[Haibat Khan Niazi]] revolted against the Sultan. Khawas Khan also came and joined him. Islam Shah went himself to suppress this revolt. He met the rebels near [[Ambala]] (1547 A.D.). Khawas left Haibat Khan on the eve of the battle because he wanted to fight in the name of Adil Khan while Haibat Khan was fired with the ambition to be crowned. The Niazis were defeated and Islam Shah pursued them up to the bank of the Jhelum River. He left an army to suppress the fugitives and himself returned to Agra. Subsequently, Khawas Khan who had taken refuge in Kumaun was lured into a trap and killed by Islam Shah. (A.D. 1552)
