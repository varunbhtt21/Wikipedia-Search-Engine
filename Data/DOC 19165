The '''''Judith Ann''''' is a [[riverboat]] that historically plied the [[Stikine River]] in southern [[Alaska]] and western [[British Columbia]].  Built in 1950, the wooden-hulled boat operated on the river between 1950 and 1970, was the last boat to offer scheduled service on the river, and is the only surviving service watercraft to ply the river.  She operated between [[Wrangell, Alaska]] and [[Telegraph Creek]], British Columbia.  She is now owned by the Stikine River Historical Foundation,<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=04000658}}|title=NRHP nomination for Judith Ann (riverboat)|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2004.<ref name="nris"/>
