'''''Ganga Bruta''''' (literally translated as "Brutal Gang";<ref name=johnsonstam/> also known as ''Rough Diamond''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001103/110379eo.pdf |title=Memory of the World: National Cinematic Heritage |date=September 1995 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=April 30, 2014 |page=15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QqzGvZ13?url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001103/110379eo.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref name=nagib/>) is a 1933 Brazilian [[drama film]] directed by [[Humberto Mauro]]. Starring Durval Bellini and Déa Selva, it follows a man who, after killing his wife on their wedding night, moves to a city where he becomes part of a love triangle. It was produced between 1931 and 1932 for [[Adhemar Gonzaga]] at his studio [[Cinédia]]. 

On its initial release, the film was highly criticized and its poor viewing figures resulted in financial losses for the distribution company, but later critics and film directors expressed praise for it. [[Cinema Novo]]'s [[Glauber Rocha]] considered it to be one the best Brazilian films of all time, a title that [[Abraccine Top 100 Brazilian films|would be recognized by the Brazilian Film Critics Association]] in 2015.

==Plot==
Marcos, a rich engineer, discovers on his wedding night that his bride was not a virgin and murders her in the bridal chamber. Despite the sensation caused in the media by the resultant case, Marcos is acquitted and moves to Guaraíba in an attempt to put the affair behind him. He finds a job managing the construction of a factory and becomes a co-worker of Décio, who lives with his paralyzed mother and Sônia, his adoptive sister. Sônia, who is engaged to Décio, is attracted to Marcos and although he is initially unaware of her feelings, he eventually acknowledges that he has fallen in love with her. After discovering that Marcos has seduced Sônia, Décio swears to kill him, but a fight culminates in Décio's death instead. At the end of the film, Marcos and Sônia get married.
