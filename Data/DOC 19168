Desired outcome:  Forced-redirect to [[Smuggler (production company)]] with the edit history left intact for possible later use in the '''Smuggler''' article or other related articles.  Reason: There is little or no notability outside of his work with that company. The opening section is pretty much all about '''Smuggler''' and its work. Even the one film with an article mentioned outside of the first section, [[Greetings from Tim Buckley]], is a '''Smuggler''' production.  The page has been redirected to [[Smuggler (production company)]] but reverted.  Note:  I made some recent edits to remove some but not all of the overt promotional-ism in this article.  If this AFD fails then further cleanup will be required.  The page about the other co-founder, {{noredirect|Brian Carmody}}, was redirected to the '''Smuggler''' page the day after it was created and that edit has not been reverted (yet).
