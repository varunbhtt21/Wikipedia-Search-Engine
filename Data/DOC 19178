Otherwise, he better stick to the Telugu industry where he is a celebrated figure!"<ref>Srinivas, Siddarth (2 September 2014).

==Critical reception==
[[Baradwaj Rangan]] for [[The Hindu]] called ''Vanmam'' "just about the vilest thing I've sat through in recent times. The emotional beats are buried so deep they're hardly discernible, and what's on the surface is a generic mix of love and drama and sentiment and action. There's not a thing that's new".<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/vanmam-review-so-indifferently-made-its-shocking/article6621929.ece?secpage=true&secname=entertainment</ref> [[The Times of India]] gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "The worrying bit about the film is that nothing feels really at stake. The director, who nicely captures milieu, hasn't done so when it comes to characters and plot. The result is that the film often seems like a morality drama turned into a rural masala".<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/Vanmham/movie-review/45233301.cms</ref> [[Sify]] wrote, "It is a story that has been told from time immemorial, and there is nothing fresh in presentation or treatment. And terrible screenplay aggravates the misery" going on to call it a "clichéd long and boring movie".<ref>http://www.sify.com/movies/vanmham-review-tamil-15058645.html</ref> [[Rediff]] wrote, "Director Jai Krishna’s ''Vanmham'' is just another ordinary, highly predictable and melodramatic revenge drama that seriously tests your patience".<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-vanmham-is-an-uninspiring-revenge-drama-south/20141121.htm</ref>

In contrast, [[The New Indian Express]] wrote, "Weaving a fairly engaging tale and moving his narration with focus and assurance, the director establishes his credentials in his very first effort".<ref>http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/2014/11/23/Big-Treat-for-Fans-of-Sethupathi/article2536742.ece</ref>
