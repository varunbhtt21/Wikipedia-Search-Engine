The '''''Kad'yak''''', also known as '''''Kadyak''''' and '''''Kadiak''''', was a wooden-hulled sailing merchant ship belonging to the [[Russian-American Company]].  Purchased by the company in 1851, she was used to transport personnel and supplies among its settlements in [[Russian Alaska]], and to transport trade goods to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].  On April 2, 1860, she struck a rock near the port of [[Kodiak, Alaska]] while carrying a load of ice and trade goods destined for San Francisco, and sank near [[Spruce Island (Alaska)|Spruce Island]] after drifting for three days.<ref name=newsletter>{{cite web|url=http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Publications_AHN_Vol32_No3_Fall2004.pdf|title=Alaska History News, Fall 2004|publisher=Alaska Historical Society|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>
