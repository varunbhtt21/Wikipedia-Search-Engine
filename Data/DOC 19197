Born in [[Gama, Federal District|Gama]], [[Federal District (Brazil)|Distrito Federal]], Nunes only made his senior debuts in the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]], playing for lowly [[Independente Futebol Clube|Independente de Limeira]]. After being an important midfield unit for the side which was promoted in 2011, he joined [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] on 20 November 2011.<ref>[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/gremio/noticia/2011/11/gremio-confirma-contratacao-do-meia-felipe-nunes.html Grêmio confirma a contratação do meia Felipe Nunes (Grêmio confirms signing of midfielder Felipe Nunes)]; Globo Esporte, 20 November 2011 {{pt icon}}</ref>

Initially assigned to the youth side, Nunes made his first-team debut on 2 February 2012, coming on as a late [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a 1–0 home win against [[Esporte Clube São Luiz|São Luiz]] for the [[Campeonato Gaúcho]] championship.<ref>[http://globoesporte.globo.com/jogo/gaucho-2012/02-02-2012/gremio-sao-luiz.html Grêmio se recupera antes do Gre-Nal com vitória simples sobre o São Luiz (Grêmio recovers itself before ''Gre-Nal'' with a simple victory over São Luiz)]; Globo Esporte, 2 February 2012 {{pt icon}}</ref> He only appeared in three further more matches in that year, all from the bench.

On 3 January 2013 Nunes joined [[Figueirense Futebol Clube|Figueirense]] on loan.<ref>[http://www.figueirense.com.br/noticia/grson-magro-e-felipe-nunes-foram-apresentados-no-cft Gérson Magrão e Felipe Nunes foram apresentados no CFT (Gérson Magrão and Felipe Nunes were presented in CFT)]; Figueirense's official website, 3 January 2013 {{pt icon}}</ref> However, he returned to [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] in May, after being released from ''Figueira''.<ref>[http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2013/05/14/craque-da-web-e-dispensado-pelo-figueirense-e-volta-ao-gremio-em-baixa.htm 'Craque da web' é dispensado pelo Figueirense e volta ao Grêmio em baixa ('Online ace' is released by Figueirense and returns to Grêmio downwards)]; [[Universo Online|UOL Esporte]], 14 May 2013 {{pt icon}}</ref>
