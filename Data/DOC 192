'''Little Saigon''' in [[Orange County, California]], is the largest [[Little Saigon]] in the United States.  [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] is the former name of the capital of the former [[South Vietnam]], where a large number of first-generation Vietnamese [[immigrants]] originate.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJ8-45FCBVV-3&_user=4335213&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000000150&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4335213&md5=00f22f0b580203f9f030904e02c637e0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123095345/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJ8-45FCBVV-3&_user=4335213&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000000150&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=4335213&md5=00f22f0b580203f9f030904e02c637e0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-01-23|last=Mazumdar|first=Sanjoy|author2=Shampa Mazumdar |author3=Faye Docuyanan |author4=Colette Marie McLaughlin |title=Creating a Sense of Place: The Vietnamese-Americans and Little Saigon|journal=[[Journal of Environmental Psychology]]|volume=20|issue=4|pages=319–333|date=December 2000|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0170}}</ref>

==History==
The oldest, largest, and most prominent Little Saigon is centered in [[Orange County, California]], where over 189,000 [[Vietnamese American]]s reside.<ref name=Entrepreneurs>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-new-little-saigon-20151108-story.html|title=Not your grandmother's Little Saigon: Entrepreneurs expand enclave's horizons|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= November 9, 2015|first=Anh |last=Do}}</ref> With the other five counties (listed below) that make up the bulk of the [[Southern California]] mega-region, this region constitutes the largest Vietnamese American (VA) population outside of Vietnam.

The community originally started emerging in [[Westminster, California|Westminster]], and quickly spread to the adjacent city of [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]]. Today, these two cities rank as the highest concentration of Vietnamese-Americans of any cities in the United States at 37.1% and 31.1%, respectively (according to the 2011 American Community Survey). With its original roots along the bustling Bolsa and Brookhurst corridors, the borders of Orange County’s Greater Little Saigon community has grown to nearby cities.

[[Image:Phuoc Loc Tho.jpg|thumb|300px|Phước Lộc Thọ, known in English as Asian Garden Mall, the first Vietnamese-American business center in Little Saigon, Orange County]]

About {{convert|45|mi}} south of Los Angeles, [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] was once a predominantly [[White people|White]] [[middle-class]] suburban city of Orange County with ample farmland, but the city later experienced a decline by the 1970s. Since 1978, the nucleus of Little Saigon has long been Bolsa Avenue, where early pioneers [[Danh Quach]] and [[Frank Jao]] established businesses. During that year, the well-known [[Nguoi Viet Daily News]] also began publishing from a home in Garden Grove.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-col1-viet-newspaper-20190321-htmlstory.html|title=In Little Saigon, this newspaper has been giving a community a voice for 40 years|last=Do|first=Anh|date=March 21, 2019|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> Other new Vietnamese-American arrivals soon revitalized the area by opening their own businesses in old, formerly white-owned storefronts, and investors constructed large shopping centers containing a mix of businesses. The Vietnamese community and businesses later spread into adjacent Garden Grove, [[Stanton, California|Stanton]], [[Fountain Valley, California|Fountain Valley]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], and [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]].

In 1988, a [[freeway]] offramp sign was placed on the Garden Grove Freeway ([[California State Route 22|State Route 22]]) designating the exits leading to Little Saigon.

Bolsa Avenue in Westminster's eastern neighbor, [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], has also been designated a Little Saigon, but there are fewer businesses in the area than in either Westminster or Garden Grove. In 2003, some controversies emerged in Santa Ana over a proposed Little Saigon sign to promote its burgeoning Vietnamese commercial area with a design incorporating Vietnamese [[translation]] and a South Vietnamese flag. The sign was approved, but redesigned and placed on Euclid Street and First Street (Bolsa Avenue).

==Layout and services==
In Orange County, Little Saigon is now a wide, spread-out community dotted with a myriad of suburban-style strip malls containing a mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese Vietnamese businesses. It is located southwest of [[Disneyland]] between the State Route 22 and [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]]. However, the main focus of Little Saigon is the Bolsa Avenue center (where Asian Garden Mall and Little Saigon Plaza are considered the heart), which runs through Westminster and the street has been officially designated Little Saigon by the [[city council]] of Westminster in the late 1980s. The borders of Little Saigon can be considered to be Trask and McFadden on the north and south and Euclid and Magnolia on the east and west, respectively. About three-quarters of the population in this area are Vietnamese.<ref>

It is lined with numerous huge shopping centers and strip malls. As with many other Vietnamese American communities, competing mom-and-pop restaurants that serve Vietnamese cuisine, especially ''[[phở]]'', are abundant. There are approximately 200 restaurants in the area of Little Saigon and spilling over to Garden Grove, Fountain Valley, Santa Ana and Huntington Beach. In addition, there are quite a number of Vietnamese supermarkets, small Vietnamese delis and bakeries in Little Saigon specializing in French-style [[coffee]] and [[baguette]] sandwiches - indeed, a legacy of Vietnam's turbulent colonial past. Restaurants serving Chinese cuisines such as [[Teochew cuisine|Teochew]] and [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] are also available but in smaller numbers. Adding to growth of Vietnamese markets in the area, the rapidly expanding Vietnamese supermarket superstore chain [[Shun Fat Supermarket]] (called in Vietnamese, ''Siêu thị Thuận Phát'') opened its doors in Westminster in 2005. Catering to the large Vietnamese population in the area are also professional offices of doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, etc. who speak Vietnamese. The first pharmacies to open in the area were Dong Nai and Aloha Pharmacy. Food and authentic Vietnamese cuisine remains the forefront of attractions amongst non-Vietnamese visiting Little Saigon. The community's history of food and cuisine is captured in a recent cookbook by Ann Le,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lalunchbox.com |title=Internap - Intelligent IT Infrastructure solutions that deliver unmatched performance and platform flexibility |publisher=Lalunchbox.com |date=2014-02-17 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}</ref> "The Little Saigon Cookbook: Vietnamese Cuisine and Culture in Southern California's Little Saigon."<ref>{{cite web|author=借金返済にかかる時間 |url=http://www.littlesaigoncookbook.com |title=借金返済の道のり |publisher=Littlesaigoncookbook.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}</ref>

[[Image:Businesses in Little Saigon (Orange County).jpg|thumb|300px|Various professional offices in another area of Little Saigon in Westminster]]
In 1984, the major [[Chinese American]] supermarket chain [[99 Ranch Market]] (initially called 99 Price Market) had its first start in Little Saigon of California. However, unable to compete with many of the Vietnamese markets in the area, the flagship store has since closed and been replaced by another supermarket.

The two-story enclosed Asian Garden Mall was developed by the well-known and influential Little Saigon founder and developer Frank Jao (an ethnic Chinese born in [[Haiphong]], Vietnam) and bankrolled by [[Chinese Indonesian]] and [[Taiwan]]ese investors. Asian Garden Mall was opened in 1987. Owing to its fame, it tends to have the highest costs of rent in Little Saigon. Jao also developed another heavily frequented Vietnamese shopping center across the street, called Asian Village Center, and this center once contained a long court of [[Confucius]] statues as motifs, but frequently vacant storefronts in the rear of the plaza were cleared to make way for housing developments. Today, a few of the original statues remain, along with a mural of the Trung Sisters.

==Banks==
The [[First Vietnamese American Bank]] in Westminster is the first to serve co-ethnic clientele (as well as reaching out to Korean and Hispanic clientele) in the United States. Saigon National Bank, located on Brookhurst Street is the first nationally chartered bank organized and owned by Vietnamese Americans in the United States. In addition, in attempting to attract Vietnamese clientele, several [[Chinese American]] banks also operate Vietnamese-speaking branches in Little Saigon, including [[Cathay Bank]], [[East West Bank]], and [[Chinatrust Bank]]. Major banks—such as [[Bank of America]] and [[Wells Fargo]]—also have branches with mostly Vietnamese-speaking staff and with Vietnamese signs to attract customers.

==Plans of a tourist economy==
There have been plans to turn Westminster's Little Saigon (Bolsa Avenue) into an ethnic [[tourist attraction]], to draw tourists, particularly from [[Disneyland]]. Plans were proposed by Jao for a pedestrian-friendly area and a 500-foot bridge - with a projected cost of nearly $3 million - connecting several Vietnamese shopping centers as well as envisioning it to resemble historic Saigon. However, in 1996, a small committee made up of local ethnic Vietnamese residents decried the design of the bridge as being too heavily Chinese-influenced. The concept has since been scrapped.

==Media and entertainment center==
[[Image:Tet Festival Little Saigon.jpg|thumb|Tet Festival in Little Saigon, [[Orange County, California]]]]
Westminster is generally considered the main cultural center of the Vietnamese American community with several Vietnamese-language television stations, radio stations, and newspapers originating from Little Saigon and adjacent areas (for example, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana). For example, there are the newspapers of ''[[Nguoi Viet Daily News|Nguoi Viet]]'', ''[[The Little Saigon News]]'' and ''[[Vien Dong Daily News]]''. Many Little Saigon newspaper offices are based on Moran Street in Westminster and Vien Dong Daily News also has its own auditorium. There are also the broadcasts of [[Little Saigon TV]], [[SBTN]] TV (owned by the Vietnamese music and entertainment company [[Asia]], [[VietFace]] TV (owned by the Vietnamese music and entertainment company [[Thuy Nga]], also based in Westminster), VNATV, [[Saigon TV]], [[Little Saigon Radio]] (Southern California: [[KVNR]] AM 1480), and [[Radio Bolsa]] (Southern California: [[KALI-FM]] 106.3 FM). At least one radio station broadcast 24 hours a day in Vietnamese and 4 television substations broadcasting in Vietnamese 24 hours a day as of 2009.  In addition, many advertisements in Los Angeles area Vietnamese-language programming and publications invariably refer to businesses in Westminster. Many stories about the Vietnamese American community in Orange County are regularly featured in ''[[The Orange County Register]]''.

Little Saigon has also emerged as the prominent center of the Vietnamese [[pop music]] industry with several recording studios, and with a recording industry many times larger than in Vietnam itself.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/10/entertainment/et-vietmusic10|author=Quyen Do|title=A big Little Saigon Star|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 10, 2008|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}</ref> Vietnamese music recorded in Westminster are distributed and sold in Vietnamese communities throughout the United States and in [[Australia]], [[France]], and [[Germany]] as well as illegally in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite news

Garden Grove Park is the location of an annual [[Tết|Vietnamese Lunar New Year]] festival held in late January - early February known as [[Tết]]. Small amusement park rides, dances, and contests are held in [[Garden Grove Park]] which is across the street from [[Bolsa Grande High School]] grounds and is hosted by the Union of Vietnamese Student Association (UVSA).

==Politics==
[[Image:Asian Garden Little Saigon.jpg|thumb|300px|Asian Garden Plaza, note the [[Flag of the Republic of Vietnam|flag of the former South Vietnam]]]]
Many in Westminster's Little Saigon are vehemently [[capitalist]] and [[anti-communist]]. Even with the [[United States–Vietnam relations|normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations]] in 1995, older Vietnamese are more emotional with a strongly held point of view on the [[Vietnam war]] and its aftermath.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-vietnamese-americans-return-20150430-story.html|title=Returning to homeland, Vietnamese Americans make their mark|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= April 30, 2015|first=Scott|last=Harris}}</ref> Five Vietnamese editors were killed from 1981 to 1993 in what authorities  around the country have deemed a series of political attacks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/12/local/me-radio12|title=Shock Jock's Listeners Aren't All Talk|date=March 12, 2004|author=Mai Tran|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

==Anti-Ho Chi Minh protest of 1999==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Before the [[Tết]] (Vietnamese Lunar New Year) celebrations of 1999, a Vietnamese-American video store owner named [[Truong Van Tran]] caused controversy when he displayed in his store a portrait of Vietnamese [[communist]] revolutionary leader [[Ho Chi Minh]]. This stirred and created anger and passions in the local Vietnamese American community, many of whom were [[war veteran]]s (of South Vietnamese military), [[refugee]]s and [[immigrant]]s from the former [[South Vietnam]] - a curious irony since Tran himself was among the refugees who fled the country. Others that participated were some Vietnamese Americans from [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Mass vigils with wavings of South Vietnamese flags and demonstrations (sometimes peaceful and sometimes coming close to a riot), in front of the store ensued. For example, an egg was tossed at Tran as he was entering his store. In a [[coup de grâce]], the owner was then arrested by Westminster city [[police]] on the charge of illegally renting and copying videos (predominantly Vietnamese entertainment videos, i.e. [[Thuy Nga]]'s [[Paris By Night]] series and [[Asia Entertainment]] videos). Since the incident, the video store has disappeared. The event also raised some controversial issues about constitutional [[free speech]] in the United States. This incident was also branded as the ''Hi-Tek Incident'', Hi-Tek being the name of the store.

Despite such anti-communist fervor in Little Saigon, however, remittance services (which allow Vietnamese Americans to send money to family members in Vietnam) still remain popular and grocers stock merchandise imported from Vietnam.

==''Saigon, USA''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Westminster's Little Saigon was also the subject for the 2004 documentary ''Saigon, U.S.A.'', which was co-produced by the local Orange County [[PBS]] member station [[KOCE-TV]]. This documentary is tied to the aforementioned video store incident and profiles the lives of some local Vietnamese American residents - including refugees and American-born generations - and community leaders. It gained some controversy when one of the Vietnamese American interviewees claimed that the 1999 anti-Ho Chi Minh protests in Little Saigon did not solve anything. The film is shown throughout the United States on PBS stations.

==Political representation==
Vietnamese Americans, due to their large numbers, have exercised considerable political power in Westminster and Garden Grove. Many have won public offices in these two cities. In the 2007 special election to replace the county supervisor serving the district containing Little Saigon, the top two candidates were Vietnamese Americans, garnering almost half the votes in a crowded field of 8 candidates. While comprising 25% of the district's registered voters, Vietnamese Americans accounted for nearly half of all the absentee votes cast.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/opinion/homepage/article_1570441.php|publisher=[[Orange County Register]]|date=February 9, 2007|accessdate=September 20, 2007|title=Election analysis: many firsts in the 1st}}</ref> The winner would become the first Vietnamese-American county supervisor in the nation. Several Vietnamese Americans serve in the Garden Grove and Westminster city councils. They have pressured the Westminster city council to recognize the former South Vietnamese flag and the Garden Grove city council to controversially designate it a "no-communist zone." In 2003, they helped raise money for a [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Westminster commemorating American and South Vietnamese soldiers. In 2004, [[Van Tran]] became the first Vietnamese American to be elected to a state legislature, representing parts of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. Vietnamese Americans attend many city council meetings.

==Generational divide==
Orange County is the [[wikt:heartland|heartland]] of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics in Southern California. Most Vietnamese Americans in Little Saigon are registered Republicans and it was once anathema to be a Democrat. Hoping to gain the support of Vietnamese American Republicans, Republican presidential candidate (and Vietnam War [[POW]]) [[John McCain]] once made a campaign stop at the Asian Garden Mall. McCain also drew the ire of some younger Vietnamese Americans when he called his North Vietnamese captors "gooks" (a derogatory term for Asians in general). But other Vietnamese Americans in Orange County, especially U.S.-born, are also [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] as the younger generations become more concerned with the rights of the blue-collar population in the United States, rather than the old-world politics of Vietnam. However, the registration rates for Republicans still outnumber Democrats with 55% registered Republicans and only 22% registered Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocblog.net/ocblog/2007/02/postelection_sp.html/ |title=OC Blog: Post-Election Spinning |accessdate=February 9, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014061134/http://ocblog.net/ocblog/2007/02/postelection_sp.html/ |archivedate=October 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

==Future of the community==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
The Vietnamese American population has now begun to diffuse from Little Saigon to traditionally working-class Hispanic cities, such as Santa Ana and southward to professional middle-class predominantly white cities such as Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley.

Over the years, the vibrant community of Little Saigon has experienced frequent openings and closures of small mom-and-pop Vietnamese businesses, resulting in sights of some abandoned strip plazas. There is however a resurgence of young and exciting developments which will begin to shape the future of the area. Recently, a Pho restaurant in the area won the James Beard award, signaling a change in the perception of Vietnamese culture and identity in the region. <ref>https://www.ocregister.com/2019/01/30/pho-79-is-the-first-orange-county-restaurant-to-win-a-prestigious-james-beard-foundation-award/</ref>The changing landscape of the Vietnamese American population would bring a more multicultural flavor to [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], but as with [[Chinatown]]s, could potentially eliminate its identity as a "Little Saigon" as the population of foreign-born Vietnamese old-timers declines and more younger generations of Vietnamese American families attune to mainstream American culture (especially with a preference for fashionable malls over the Vietnamese ethnic malls in Little Saigon) and move on to affluent communities further away from the Little Saigon area.

Little Saigon has seen a surge in coffee shops "Quan Ca-Fe" which are the equivalent to American coffee shops, where Vietnamese men go to spend time with male friends and drink coffee. With such a proliferation in coffee shops, the city of Westminster has limited the number of new coffee shop business licenses.
