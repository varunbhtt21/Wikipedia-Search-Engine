The game features additional work by Studio Gobo and [[Ninja Theory]]. It is the sequel and successor of the 2013 video game ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' and was announced on April 8, 2014. The game was released on September 23, 2014 in North America, September 19, 2014 in the United Kingdom, September 18, 2014 in Australia and the rest of Europe for [[iOS]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii U]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]],{{ref|1|1}} and for [[PlayStation Vita]] on May 9, 2015.

Featuring original story material by [[Brian Michael Bendis]], ''Marvel Super Heroes'' includes three plots and includes characters from both [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] properties. The main campaign is divided into three stories. The first storyline follows the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as they prevent the [[Norse mythology|Norse God]] [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] from rebuilding the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]]. The second storyline centers on [[Spider-Man]] and features him and his team tasked with the objective to stop [[Green Goblin]]'s [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion. The third and final storyline concentrates around the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], in a plot heavily inspired by the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' film, where the Guardians must protect [[Knowhere]] from [[Ronan the Accuser]].

''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes'' expands ''Disney Infinity''{{'}}s array of tools to use in the Toybox mode, an open world sandbox. Additionally, the ability to personalize individual characters has been added, using a Skill Tree. ''Marvel Super Heroes'' adds on the previous game's community sharing options, including the sharing of personal creations.

It was also the first Marvel-licensed game to be published by Disney Interactive Studios, due to [[Sega]]'s contract with Marvel expiring after the release of ''[[Captain America: Super Soldier]]'' in 2011, and [[Activision]]'s contract expiring after the release of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', released a few months prior to the release of ''Marvel Super Heroes''. A sequel, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', was released on August 28, 2015 in Europe and August 29, 2015 in North America.

''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes'' features similar gameplay to ''Disney Infinity''. Each character can equip a "Pack" or a "Tool." Packs are items that are worn and can be equipped on a character's back, occasionally shown as some sort of [[backpack]]. Tools are items, such as rifles, that can be equipped in a character's hand. Some aspects of the game, however, have been changed.

==Development==

===Concept===
''Disney Infinity'' was originally described to be a "platform that's always growing and will ultimately have something for everyone,"<ref name=Project/> and that the ''Infinity'' platform is open to expanding. When ''Disney Infinity'' was yet to be released, [[Avalanche Software]] CEO, John Blackburn stated that discussions about the inclusion of ''[[Star Wars]]'' and Marvel characters in the game, took place.<ref name=Polygon2>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/15/3880346/disney-infinity-star-wars-marvel|title=Disney Infinity developer says Star Wars, Marvel characters under discussion, but not decided|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=January 15, 2013 <!-- at 6:06PM --> |accessdate=May 3, 2014|publisher=Polygon}}</ref> On that subject Blackburn said "I hope so! As a developer, I so want that. When Disney bought [[Lucasfilm]], I was like, 'Holy crap! This is awesome!' But at this point in time, there's been some discussions about that, there's just been no decisions made."<ref name=Polygon2/> In February 2014, [[Avalanche Software]] began hiring game testers for a potential ''Disney Infinity'' sequel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Andy|title=Job Listing Suggests Date And Platforms for 'Disney Infinity 2'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2014/02/04/disney-infinity-2-release-date-xbox-one-ps4/|website=forbes.com|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> ''Star Wars'' characters and playsets would eventually be added in the following expansion, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''.

Avalanche Software started working with Marvel Entertainment, after it was acquired by Disney in 2009, about developing a game featuring Marvel superheroes, in 2011.<ref name=News2/> The conception of the game started immediately after the acquisition, as ''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes''{{'}}s executive producer, John Vignocchi commented "As soon as the acquisition happened we started having conversations about Marvel. I giggle that I know the date, because I checked in via [[Foursquare]] at Marvel. So that's how I knew, that was the first time we sat down with [[Joe Quesada]]."<ref name=News2/> Avalanche developed a demo in October 2013, which featured the Marvel superhero Iron Man flying through a rudimentary city.<ref name=News2/> The demo was later released to the public almost a year later.<ref name=News2/>

Since the game was set to include Marvel characters, [[Brian Michael Bendis]], a comic book writer, was brought on to write original story material. This would allow the game's developers to provide more deep and immersive story lines.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Nintendo]]|title=Nintendo @ E3 - Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes|url=http://e3.nintendo.com/games/wiiu/disney-infinity-marvel-super-heroes-2/|website=nintendo.com|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=6 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912103222/http://e3.nintendo.com/games/wiiu/disney-infinity-marvel-super-heroes-2/|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=}}</ref> With a more complex combat system, [[Ninja Theory]] was brought on the development team in February 2014, to fulfill the concept.<ref name=NTK>{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mike|title=Disney Infinity 2.0 Gets Combat Support From Ninja Theory|url=http://kotaku.com/disney-infinity-2-0-gets-combat-support-from-ninja-theo-1629073576|website=kotaku.com|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=NTP/><ref name=NTG/>

===Design===
[[File:Black Widow Character Design Stages in Disney Infinity Marvel Super Heroes.jpg|thumb|right|The design stages of the ''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes'' character [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].]]
The art style from ''Disney Infinity'', in which every character and object is designed to look like a [[toy]] and was co-designed by [[Pixar]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoggins|first1=Tom|title=Disney Infinity: John Vignocchi interview|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/10106113/Disney-Infinity-John-Vignocchi-interview.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> was carried over to ''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes''. Developers re-imagined Marvel characters in art style. John Vignocchi said on the redesigns, "it was a really interesting process. Working with Joe Quesada and the creative team and Marvel -- getting them to understand what the visual aesthetic of 'Disney Infinity' is, that is, they're not the characters themselves, but toy versions of those characters, and reimagining some of Marvel's most iconic superheroes in that art style was a daunting, but very fun task for this team."<ref name=Wonder/> Each character goes through multiple stages of development, including how they will look in the game and what their figurine's pose will be.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=735097293207662&set=a.490454497671944.128846.417514228299305&type=1&theater|title=Disney Infinity Facebook - Timeline Photo May 18, 2014|date=May 18, 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]]|author=Disney Infinity}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=729454677105257&set=a.490454497671944.128846.417514228299305&type=1&theater|title=Disney Infinity Facebook - Timeline Photo May 7, 2014|date=May 7, 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]]|author=Disney Infinity}}</ref> The developers specifically designed the Venom character to be on par with Hulk when it came to size and mass. On Venom's design John Vignocchi said "we hulked him out a bit. in fact, the character is the only one that comes close to the Incredible Hulk in the game (designers wanted another brute to offer) and when fully powered up, stands on equal footing with the green beast."<ref name=Herald/>

No "Crystal" variants of characters have been designed for ''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes'', unlike the first game.<ref name=Wonder/> The ''Disney Infinity'' team wanted to focus on a more diverse array of characters, as said by John Vignocchi "we're not planning on doing the crystal characters again. Our focus this time around – rather than create a whole series of chase characters, we wanted to make sure that we had a wider variety of characters," he said. "What we decided to do instead was really put our horsepower into creating different characters as opposed to variants. We think our fans appreciate having a character like Star-Lord or Rocket Raccoon as opposed to another version of [[Mickey Mouse]]."<ref name=Wonder/> The game has been designed to be less violent, in order to appeal to a wider audience.<ref name=Nerdist/> Despite this, a Crystal variation of [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Sorcerer's Apprentice]] Mickey Mouse will be released.<ref name=CMM>{{cite web|last1=Hare|first1=Chris|title=Crystal Micky Mouse Coming to Disney Infinity 2.0|url=http://connecteddigitalworld.com/2014/08/18/crystal-micky-mouse-coming-disney-infinity-2-0/|website=connecteddigitalworld.com|publisher=Connected Digital World|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>

When designing the game, Avalanche Software focused not only on the inclusion of the [[near field communication|NFC-enabled]]<ref name=NFC/> Marvel figurines, but improving the Toybox mode (especially for younger players) as well.<ref name=Joystiq>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/04/30/disney-infinity-2-0-edition-featuring-marvel-super-heroes-coming/|title=Disney Infinity 2.0: Marvel Super Heroes coming this fall; PS4 and Xbox One joining the fight|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=April 30, 2014|last=de Matos|first=Xav|publisher=Joystiq}}</ref> Jimmy Pitaro, president of [[Disney Interactive Studios]] stated "we wanted to take everything that worked so well and make it epic."<ref name=CTV/> Each character was picked based on how they would fit in the game, as said by TQ Jefferson, "what you're going to see as we roll out and reveal more characters, is that they're going to be more characters that you've known forever and they make sense," Jefferson said. "And the other characters, you may not know them as well, but once you see them in-game, you're going to understand why we made the choices that we made. These characters bring a certain narrative strength with them and, just as important, they bring a unique bit of gameplay with them ... [these are the] characters that are the most fun to play ... that have the most impact on story. Once you see the full spectrum of characters, it's not just an Avengers game. It's very much a Marvel super heroes game."<ref name=RAM/>

The development team tried to appeal to the game's target audience (children) by making changes to environments, with one being to disregard physics.<ref name=Webs/> Matt Solie, of Disney Interactive Studios, when asked about the topic stated "I had my nephews, who are eight and five, try ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', which is the epitome of physics-based, buildings attached—[it's] not really fun for them. They didn't understand, 'Why can't I swing?'" Solie said. "It just made sense for a kids and family game."<ref name=Webs/> Also basing the game around its target audience, John Blackburn part of the game's development team, looked to his 6 year old nephew, Logan, to see what younger audiences wanted out of the game.<ref name=News2/> The procedural editing options were added, after Blackburn noticed that Logan was building very simple things in the Toybox.<ref name=News2/>

Though ''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes'' is heavily inspired by ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'', ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] in terms of design, the possibility of the [[Alternate versions of Thor#Thor|female Thor]] from the comics joining the game has not been ruled out.<ref name=Female>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Liam|title=Disney Infinity 2.0 'not ruling out inclusion of female Thor'|url=http://www.digitalspy.ca/gaming/news/a584603/disney-infinity-20-not-ruling-out-inclusion-of-female-thor.html#~oNT3FyghNPokSB|website=digitalspy.ca|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> On the possibility of the game's artists possibly designing a toy-like female Thor, John Vignocchi stated "The Thor that we have inside of Infinity is based on the animated series Avengers Assemble. Infinity being a platform that evolves over time, that certainly doesn't rule out the possibility of creating a new version of Thor.
