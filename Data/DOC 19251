:({{Find sources|Document Layout Requirements}})
A mere definition, and not a very clear one, for I do not see any direct  connection between laying out a  document and capturing business requirements, except in the very broad sense that if you wish to retain information you must have a way to do so.  CSD and Prod tags were removed. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 20:33, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''—I can't find any evidence of special usage beyond simply the different things that these three words mean when used together, for example requirements for how a document of some kind must be laid out, or writing up what the layout requirements are for some purpose, etc.  I can't find anything to suggest a legitimate [[WP:NEO|neologism]] here, in other words, an encyclopedic topic.

* '''Delete''' This was a spam article which should have been speedily deleted as such, but the spam has been removed, leaving a trivial unsourced article on an expression with no notability. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 13:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
