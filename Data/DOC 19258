==Biography==
Jacobs was born in [[Tawas City, Michigan]].  He took his Bachelor's degree from Michigan State Normal College (now [[Eastern Michigan University]]); his Master's degree from the [[University of Michigan]]; and his PhD from the [[Ohio State University]] ("OSU"). He taught elementary, junior high and high school in rural [[Michigan]], and was an elementary school principal.  He also taught at OSU in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and trained numerous future teachers of literature in [[Leonia, New Jersey]] before he was hired by [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1952, from which he retired with the rank of [[Professor Emeritus]].During 22 years on the faculty, Dr. Jacobs developed literature as a major part of early education. He encouraged pupils to read literature for their own development. He wrote and edited many books and articles on language arts, reading and teaching pupils.<ref name="Dr. Leland Jacobs, 85, Educator And Columbia Professor Emeritus">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/07/nyregion/dr-leland-jacobs-85-educator-and-columbia-professor-emeritus.html |title= Dr. Leland Jacobs}}</ref>
