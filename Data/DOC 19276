'''Elmcrest Hospital''', later '''St. Francis Care Behavioral Health''', was a small psychiatric facility in [[Portland, Connecticut]].  Opened in 1942, the campus incorporated three historic mansions, including a childhood home of 1800s businesswoman [[Elizabeth Jarvis Colt]].  The facility was purchased by [[Saint Francis Hospital & Medical Center|Saint Francis Hospital]] in 1997, and in 1998, the hospital underwent increased scrutiny when an 11-year-old patient died while being restrained by an employee.  In 2003, inpatient services at the campus were discontinued, and patients were relocated to the [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Hartford)|Saint Francis Mount Sinai]] campus.<ref name=elm>SEAY, GREGORY, [http://articles.courant.com/2003-08-02/news/0308021891_1_mount-sinai-unit-moves-campus "Former Elmcrest Hospital Moving Patients"], ''The Hartford Courant'' August 02, 2003.  Accessed April 30, 2014</ref>

Also in 2003, the Portland campus was sold to [[Hartford Hospital]], who continued operating the [[outpatient]] and [[partial hospitalization]] services for children and teens at the site<ref>Waldman, Hilary, and Staff W. Courant. "A MAJOR SHIFT AT ST. FRANCIS ; TO SELL ITS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES." Hartford Courant: 0. Sep 19 2003. ProQuest. Web. 2 May 2014 .</ref> through its affiliate the [[Rushford Center]]. Rushford discontinued operations at the site circa 2006.  In 2006, developers proposed building condos and a shopping center anchored by a supermarket.<ref>Hamilton, Jesse, and Staff W. Courant.

The plan was active through at least 2009, however as of 2014, the campus remains vacant and no demolition has occurred.<ref>Mills, Jeff, [http://www.middletownpress.com/general-news/20140418/portland-residents-call-for-town-to-remedy-blighted-elmcrest-property "Portland residents call for town to remedy blighted Elmcrest property"], ''The Middletown Press'', April 14, 2014, Accessed April 30, 2014</ref>

In August 2014, the town of Portland received a $50,000 grant from the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, under its Vibrant Cities Initiative.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hesselberg|first1=Erik|title=Elmcrest Manor Property In Portland Gets Historic Preservation Grant|url=http://articles.courant.com/2014-08-29/community/hc-portland-elmcrest-manor-20140829_1_elizabeth-jarvis-colt-grant-application-fouad-m|publisher=The Hartford Courant|accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref>  In early 2015, the town used the grant to hire a consultant to help guide development with a hopeful goal of rehabilitating the historical structures as part of an economically viable redevelopment.  Community groups such as the Elmcrest Campus Advisory Committee has been and the Portland Historical Society have also been working to encourage redevelopment that preserves the structures.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hesselberg|first1=Erik|title=Portland Hires Consultant To Find Ways To Rescue Elmcrest Manor|url=http://www.courant.com/community/portland/hc-portland-elmcrest-0119-20150118-story.html|publisher=The Hartford Courant|accessdate=24 February 2015}}</ref> On February 1, 2018, the Portland Planning and Zoning Commission voted unanimously to approve the '''Brainerd Place''' development for the site, expected to include a mix of apartments and retail, while preserving two historic homes in place and relocating the Hart-Jarvis house to a site on the property overlooking the [[Connecticut River]] and [[Arrigoni Bridge]].

==Historic assets==
The following structures are contributing structures of the Marlborough Street Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
*Brainerd House and carriage house (1851)
*Hart-Jarvis House (1829â€“30)
*Sage House (1884)

==Brainerd Place==
In 2015, developer Daniel Bertram introduced a conceptual plan for the property, known as '''Brainerd Place''', that would preserve two of the historic homes in place and relocate the Hart-Jarvis to the rear of the property facing the [[Arrigoni Bridge]]. The proposed site plan would include 238 residential apartments on the east side of the property in two multistory buildings, and up to 75,000 square feet of commercial space visible from [[CT Route 66]] and Main Street.  Bertram, a participant in the study sponsored by Vibrant Communities grant, applied for a text amendment to the Portland zoning regulations that would allow a higher number of residential units within mixed-use developments. The proposed regulations, passed in July 2016, would allowed the increased number of units under the condition that the site plan would preserve significant historical assets, a priority of the Portland Plan of Conservation and Development.  The regulations would also prohibit occupancy of the residential units until a substantial portion of the commercial structures were constructed.{{refn|{{cite web|url=https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Portland-pursues-impact-study-of-zoning-change-11771550.php|title=Portland pursues impact study of zoning change for Elmcrest|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2018|publisher=The Middletown Press}}|}}{{refn|{{cite web|url=https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Tempers-fly-as-Portland-selectmen-pass-Elmcrest-11765368.php|title=Tempers fly as Portland selectmen pass Elmcrest text amendment|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2018|publisher=The Middletown Press}}|}}.
