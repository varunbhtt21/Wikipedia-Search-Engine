'''Liberty Park''' is a {{convert|1|acre|m2|spell=in|adj=on}} [[Elevated park|elevated]] [[public park]] at the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], overlooking the [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum]]. It is located above the [[Vehicular Security Center]] and opened on June 29, 2016. The [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church|St. Nicholas National Shrine]] is located within the park, as well as ''[[The Sphere]]'', the iconic sculpture salvaged from the [[World Trade Center site]]. Another statue, ''[[America's Response Monument]]'', is also located in the park.

==Description==
[[File:Liberty Park Sep 2018 25.jpg|left|thumb|The sapling from the Anne Frank tree]]
The park has a capacity of 750 people and is the roof of the Vehicular Security Center. A "living wall", measuring {{Convert|336|ft|m}} long and {{Convert|20|ft|m}} tall, is located on the park's northern [[facade]] adjoining Liberty Street.<ref name="The New York Times 2016" /> It contains 826 panels, upon which are attached "periwinkle, Japanese spurge, winter creeper, sedge and Baltic ivy",<ref name="tribecacitizen" /> A walkway from the pedestrian bridge curves along the park. Egresses include three stairways, the pedestrian bridge, and a straight ramp down to [[Greenwich Street]]. One of these stairs, a wide staircase is located on the east side of the park, between Greenwich Street to the east and the back of the church to the west. There are wood benches and a small [[amphitheater]]-like elevated space at the western end of the park, facing [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]]. Finally, there is a "continuous overlook" along much of Liberty Street in addition to "a gently curving balcony" at the church's foot.<ref name="tribecacitizen">{{cite web|url=http://tribecacitizen.com/2013/10/29/first-look-santiago-calatravas-design-for-st-nicholas-church/|title=First Look: Santiago Calatrava’s Design for St. Nicholas Church|date=October 29, 2013|work=Tribeca Citizen|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref> A sapling from the [[Anne Frank tree]] is located alongside the ramp at the southeastern corner of Liberty Park.<ref name="The New York Times 2016">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/nyregion/touches-of-whimsy-at-world-trade-centers-liberty-park.html|title=Touches of Whimsy at World Trade Center’s Liberty Park|date=June 28, 2016|website=The New York Times|access-date=September 16, 2018}}</ref>

===Location of ''The Sphere''===
[[File:The Sphere in Liberty Park 2 vc.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Sphere]]'', November 2017]]
''[[The Sphere]]'', a large cast bronze sculpture by German artist [[Fritz Koenig]], had stood in  [[Austin J. Tobin]] Plaza between the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers in [[Manhattan]].  Recovered from the rubble after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, intact but visibly damaged, ''The Sphere'' faced an uncertain future and was dismantled and stored. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), which owns ''The Sphere'', considered placing the sculpture in Liberty Park, which will be located between the 90 West Street building and the [[World Trade Center Memorial]] site. Construction on Liberty Park did not start until 2013, so a location was needed to place ''The Sphere'' until Liberty Park was completed. {{As of|February 2011}}, PANYNJ had not made an official final decision on where to place the sculpture once Battery Park construction commences, forcing the sculpture to move. Until Liberty Park opened, ''The Sphere'' was to go into storage.<ref name="Shapiro">{{cite web|last=Shapiro|first=Julie|title=9/11 Family Members Start Petition to Save World Trade Center Sphere|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/20110228/downtown/911-family-members-start-petition-save-world-trade-center-sphere|work=DNAinfo New York Associates|accessdate=February 28, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301190115/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110228/downtown/911-family-members-start-petition-save-world-trade-center-sphere|archivedate=March 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Chung">{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Jen|title=World Trade Center Sphere's Uncertain Fate Worries 9/11 Families|url=http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/world_trade_center_spheres_uncertai.php|work=Gothamist|accessdate=February 28, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228170040/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/world_trade_center_spheres_uncertai.php|archivedate=February 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On July 23, 2008, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] reached a deal with the leaders of the [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]] for the Port Authority to acquire the {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|adj=on}} lot that the church had occupied, for $20 million, $10 million of which is coming from the Port Authority and the other $10 million of which is coming from [[JPMorgan Chase]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25825608/ |title=Church surrenders ground zero lot |author=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=July 23, 2008}}</ref><ref name="squareone"/>
