Only limited local coverage from his town; no evidence this meets [[WP:BAND]]. <b>[[User:Ohnoitsjamie|OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font>]] [[User talk:Ohnoitsjamie|<sup>Talk</sup>]]</b> 20:55, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Keep''' Josh is one of the top Creative Commons artists. Many of the notability criteria don't apply, since he's not really a traditional artist, but he's got a larger audience than many major label bands. I can't speak for all of the criteria, but I know he won the top Jamendo artist, on a site with millions of users out of hundreds of thousands of tracks. He's also been the featured performer twice on WBGU's PBS concert series. He's definitely had significant radio airplay - I found out about him when I was living in Germany and he was on the radio (and later the in-house music at my grocery store). I agree that the article is a little lightweight, but this page is still useful. It's getting hundreds of Wikipedia hits a week, which shows I'm not alone.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2607:FCC8:E4E1:9300:58E4:F434:DBA4:36EF|2607:FCC8:E4E1:9300:58E4:F434:DBA4:36EF]] ([[User talk:2607:FCC8:E4E1:9300:58E4:F434:DBA4:36EF|talk]]) 21:51, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot--><small>— [[Special:Contributions/2607:FCC8:E4E1:9300:58E4:F434:DBA4:36EF|2607:FCC8:E4E1:9300:58E4:F434:DBA4:36EF]] ([[User talk:2607:FCC8:E4E1:9300:58E4:F434:DBA4:36EF|talk]]) has made [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|few or no other edits]] outside this topic. </small>
::'''Comment''' Creative Commons artists don't get their own notability criteria; [[WP:MUSIC]] still applies.

*'''delete''' Fails WP:MUSIC. [[User:Staszek Lem|Staszek Lem]] ([[User talk:Staszek Lem|talk]]) 22:01, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete:''' Put it down to my experience lacking on this but I've been pretty 'on the fence' about this one. My Delete vote is on the basis that 2 of the sources are his website and thus self published, one is a blog, one is YouTube (unreliable per RS if I'm not mistaken), the other three are what make as wonder. I call them as no good on the basis that they have nothing to back them up and so they cannot be judged as reliable. <!-- (I went through adoption school and was taught if it has a source backing the source it's reliable okay?) --> [[User:Matticusmadness|MM]] [[User talk:Matticusmadness|<font color="cyan">(''I did the who in the whatnow?'')</font>]] [[Special:Contributions/Matticusmadness|<sup><font color="Gold">(''I did this!

*'''Delete'''. It'd be nice if we could keep him, but unfortunately he just doesn't pass notability guidelines. There's little to no coverage about him, very few reviews in reliable sources, and while popularity can help gain coverage it's never a guarantee of notability. Someone can be [[WP:POPULAR]], but that in and of itself is not notability. As far as [[WP:BAND]] goes, it really all comes down to coverage in reliable sources. We can say that someone is a significant example of something, but without actual coverage in reliable sources (Pitchfork, AllMusic, Rolling Stone, etc) we can't actually ''prove'' that someone is a significant example. When it comes to the contest, the problem with this is that few contests/awards are so notable that they'd give absolute notability on that basis alone. I always say that only about 5% of any awards ever given (and this would be every award everywhere) would actually extend any notability and of those, less than 1% actually give that absolute notability. Since [[Song Fight!]] is held weekly, I don't think it'd really give any notability when you get down to it and  As far as the sourcing in the article goes, a few of them are usable but they don't really show a huge depth of coverage. I'd say that maybe the Findlay Living article and certainly The Courier would be usable, but that's about it. It's a shame that there hasn't been more coverage, but the problem is that it just isn't out there. We can't even really count the podcast expose when we get down to it, because that wouldn't be considered a national rotation. (Meaning that you'd hear it at least 2-3 times a day on at least one radio station.) He's more notable than some of the other indie musicians out there, but right now he just falls short of notability guidelines. I have no problem with someone userfying the data if they so want, but I'd really recommend that they get a lot of help from [[WP:MUSIC]] before re-adding it to the mainspace.
