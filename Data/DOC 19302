'''Paul Martin Laurence Weston''' (born 1965) is a British [[Far-right politics|far-right]] politician<ref name=tele>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10792895/Election-candidate-arrested-over-Churchill-speech.html|title=Election candidate arrested over Churchill speech|author=Martin Evans|date=28 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> and a member of the [[Pegida UK]] leadership team. An activist and blogger, Weston joined the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) in 2010 and stood as a Parliamentary candidate for [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]].  In 2011, Weston left UKIP and joined the now-defunct [[British Freedom Party]] with members of the [[English Defence League]] (EDL) and former members of the [[British National Party]] (BNP).<ref name=ind111125>{{cite news|title=English Defence League prepares to storm local elections |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= 25 November 2011 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/english-defence-league-prepares-to-storm-local-elections-6267740.html}}</ref> He was the chairman of [[Liberty GB]] before the party was dissolved in December 2017, recommending its members to join [[For Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://libertygb.org.uk/news/closure-liberty-gb|title=The Closure of Liberty GB - Liberty GB|website=libertygb.org.uk}}</ref>

For Liberty GB, he was a candidate for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] in the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014 European election]]<ref name=profile>{{cite web|title=Paul Weston | publisher=Liberty GB | url=http://www.libertygb.org.uk/content/paul-weston}}</ref> and for [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]]. He obtained 158 votes (0.4%).<ref name=BBC15>''BBC News Election 2015'': [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000801 Luton South]. Accessed 12 May 2015</ref>

He married a Romanian after meeting her in [[Romania]].<ref name=tele/><ref name=p100505>{{cite news|title= Interview with Paul Weston | date=5 May 2010 | url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2010/5/5/interview-paul-weston|author=Marina Kim|website=politics.co.uk|publisher= }}</ref> He was the President of the English branch of the [[International Free Press Society]] founded in 2009.<ref name="Hope Not Hate Profile: Paul Weston">{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad/country/UK#id-135|title=UK has biggest audience for online jihadist propaganda in Europe |date=20 September 2017|publisher=HOPE not hate|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>

==First partisan forays==
When interviewed in 2010 as a member of UKIP, Weston described himself as a "natural Conservative" and described immigration as the "[[ethnic cleansing]] of the [[English people|English]]".<ref name= p100505/> At the time Weston was standing as the UKIP candidate for [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]] in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|UK general election of 2010]]. With a 1.8% share of the vote Weston finished in fifth place. The Conservative candidate, [[Mark Field]], won the seat with 19,264 votes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/b11.stm "Cities of London and Westminster 2010 election results"], ''BBC News''</ref>

Soon after leaving UKIP, in 2011 Weston became the chairman of the [[British Freedom Party]] (BFP) the same year after he had been asked to do so by the activists who had broken away from the BNP in October 2010 to found a new party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad/country/UK#id-106|title=UK has biggest audience for online jihadist propaganda in Europe – HOPE not hate|date=20 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref> Over the years, Weston has attended and addressed numerous gatherings and rallies for such groups as [[Bloc Identitaire]] in France, [[Freedom (German political party)|Die Freiheit]] in Germany and the [[Jewish Defence League]] in Canada.<ref name="Hope Not Hate Profile: Paul Weston"/> As chairman of the BFP, Weston attended an international conference of [[Counterjihad|counter-jihadists]] in September 2011. Yet in an interview, Weston cited a poll conducted by ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'', which had found that 48% of the British public would support an [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant party]], so long as the party did not take on explicitly [[fascist symbolism|fascist regalia]] and was non-violent, as evidence for an electoral basis for the BFP.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/27/support-poll-support-far-right "Searchlight poll finds huge support for far right 'if they gave up violence'"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 February 2011</ref> This was in the midst of a crisis within the BNP and Weston held meetings with [[Andrew Brons]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], and longstanding figure on the far-right, who was vying for the leadership of the party. Ultimately, Weston left the BFP saying, "I joined the British Freedom Party in late 2011, but became disillusioned with the direction it was taking, over which I had little control."<ref name=profile/>

In November 2012, the BFP officially announced that it had agreed to enter into a formal political alliance with the [[English Defence League]]. In October 2012, the party failed to hand-in its annual registration form and pay the fee of £25 and, in December of the same year, was deregistered by the [[Electoral Commission]]. The deregistration was statutory rather than voluntary.<ref name=truth>Sonia Gable, [http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/british-freedom-party-deregistration-the-truth-%E2%80%93-exclusive "British Freedom Party deregistration: the truth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231134443/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/british-freedom-party-deregistration-the-truth-%E2%80%93-exclusive |date=31 December 2012 }}, ''Searchlight''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/WS9hx.png|title=Extract from Register of Political Parties|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref> ''Searchlight'' speculated that Weston let the party's registration lapse because [[Jim Dowson]] of [[Britain First]] had initiated legal action against the BFP for [[defamation]] over claims made against Britain First's leadership on the BFP website.<ref name=truth/>

==Liberty GB==
{{main|Liberty GB}}
Early on, the group was criticised as "old fascist rubbish" in an article by Sonia Gable published in ''Searchlight''.<ref name="Sonia Gable">{{cite web |newspaper=[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]] |author=Sonia Gable |title=Liberty it isn't |date=12 March 2013 |url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/liberty-it-isn%E2%80%99t |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503134607/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/liberty-it-isn%E2%80%99t |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Gable ranked the group alongside the [[British Democratic Party (2013)|British Democratic Party]], [[Britain First]] and the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].<ref name="Sonia Gable"/> Weston responded and accused his critics at ''Searchlight'' of being "a [[Communist front (epithet)|communist front operation]] disguised as an [[anti-fascist]] organisation". Weston has characterized himself as an "Islamo-realist" and is against Muslim people being able to hold [[public office]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name=smaller>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2015 |title=Election 2015 smaller parties: Liberty GB |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32236889 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}</ref> He has made a video in which he says "I am a racist".<ref name=smaller/> In an interview, the [[BBC]]'s [[Andrew Neil]] brought up the subject of this video and asked him, "Do you regard yourself as a racist?" Weston responded, "No I don't, no." Weston explained that he was indignant about the gang rape that [[Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal|took place in Rotherham]] [[Rochdale sex trafficking gang|and Rochdale]] and the fact that people sometimes fear being labeled racist. He then said, "If you watch the entire video, it is actually making the point that you cannot be quiet about what's going on because you're afraid of one word. It is better to speak out and be honest."<ref name=smaller/>

The other Liberty GB candidates in the [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] 2014 election were Enza Ferreri and [[Jack Buckby]]. In 2012, Buckby founded the "National Culturists" while at university in [[Liverpool]].<ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/jack-buckby-is-proud-to-be-britains-next-nick-griffin "Jack Buckby is proud to be Britain's next Nick Griffin"], ''Vice''</ref> At the time, Buckby was a member of the BNP and received support from [[Nick Griffin]] after he and his group were prevented from advertising themselves at the freshers' fair by [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist demonstrators]].<ref>[http://liverpool.tab.co.uk/2012/10/01/controversial-society-meets-violent-resistance-at-freshers-fair/ "'Nazi Society' Hounded off Campus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230338/http://liverpool.tab.co.uk/2012/10/01/controversial-society-meets-violent-resistance-at-freshers-fair/ |date=3 May 2014 }}, ''Liverpool Tab''</ref> Buckby was later invited to speak at the [[Alliance of European National Movements]] and introduced by Griffin.

At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Weston contested [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] for Liberty GB and polled 158 votes (0.4%).<ref name="BBC15"/>

===Arrest===
[[File:WinGuild30Je6-4864.jpg|thumb|Steps of Winchester Guildhall on which Weston was arrested.]]
On 26 April 2014, Weston was arrested on the steps of the [[Winchester]] Guildhall for failing to comply with a dispersal notice issued under section 27 of the [[Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006]] as he was reading out a passage from [[Winston Churchill]]'s 1899 book ''[[The River War]]'' that is critical of Islam. He had been reported to the police by a member of the public after they had asked him if he had permission to give the speech and he replied that he did not. At the police station Weston was then rearrested for a racially aggravated offence under section 4 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], compounded with a [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] section 31 [[Fear or provocation of violence|racially aggravated public order offence]], and was bailed to return to Winchester Police on 24 May.<ref name=tele/>

===Aftermath of arrest===
In the days after, the story was picked up by news outlets. In ''The Telegraph'', [[Daniel Hannan]], an MEP for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]], whom Weston was running against at the time, asked: "Why should it fall to me to defend him? Where are the lion-hearted liberals who are so quick to denounce political arrests in distant dictatorships? I realise that 'political arrest' is a strong phrase, but it's hard to think of any other way to describe a candidate for public office being taken into police custody because of objections to the content of his pitch."<ref>Daniel Hannan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701051722/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100269400/britain-has-just-witnessed-a-political-arrest-where-is-the-liberal-outrage/ "Britain has just witnessed a political arrest. Where is the liberal outrage?"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 April 2014</ref>

[[Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner]] [[Simon Hayes (police commissioner)|Simon Hayes]] responded to the media coverage on the Hampshire Police and Crime Commission website:

<blockquote>It has been wrongly suggested that Mr Weston was arrested for reciting passages written by Winston Churchill. I understand he was not welcome outside the Winchester Guildhall, the Police were called and he was asked to move on. I also understand that he was not prepared to move on and was arrested for this reason.

Members of the public are of course at liberty to debate issues of importance to them in private or public spaces. However, there must be a level of decorum and decency.

Hampshire Constabulary has an obligation to ensure action is taken if decency or safety is put at risk and, if there is any reason to suspect they have intervened unnecessary {{sic}}, this will be investigated.

As far as I am aware, this is not so in this case. With the local and European elections coming up, it is important to register that there is a great deal of politically motivated spin going on at the moment which it {{sic}} is having a significant impact on local policing – both in terms of vital frontline rescourse {{sic}} and reputation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Response to the Arrest of Paul Weston |author=Hampshire Police Commissioner Simon Hayes |url=http://www.hampshire-pcc.gov.uk/Your-Commissioner/Commissioners-point-of-view/Response-to-the-arrest-of-Paul-Weston.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503133051/http://www.hampshire-pcc.gov.uk/Your-Commissioner/Commissioners-point-of-view/Response-to-the-arrest-of-Paul-Weston.aspx |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>
