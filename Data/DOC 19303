==Marriage to Samuel Colt==

In 1861, Samuel Colt died from complications associated with [[gout]] and left Elizabeth a pregnant widow. Seven months after his death, the baby was [[stillborn]].<ref name="Boynton2014"/>

==At the helm of Colt==
Following her husband's death in 1862, Mrs. Colt inherited a controlling interest in the manufacturing company (worth $3.5&nbsp;million at the time and closer to ${{Inflation|US|3.5|1862|r=0}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), and played a key role in rebuilding the main armory following arson in 1864.<ref name="Smith2004">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Anthony|title=Machine Gun: The Story of the Men and the Weapon That Changed the Face of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTNvqbkvpo4C&pg=PA52|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-93477-4|pages=52–53}}, although the book claims the 2002 value was $200&nbsp;million</ref> Her brother, [[Richard Jarvis]] took over as president of the company in 1865, following the death of [[Elisha K. Root]], and the two transitioned the company from the end of the [[American Civil War]] through the early 20th century, seeing the evolution from [[percussion cap|percussion]] [[revolver]]s to cartridge [[revolver]]s to [[semiautomatic pistol]]s and [[machinegun]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title =The Colt legacy: the Colt Armory in Hartford, 1855-1980 |first= Ellsworth S.|last= Grant |pages=22, 58|publisher= Mowbray Co.|year= 1982|ISBN =978-0-917218-17-0 }}</ref>

Colt served for 22 years as the president of the Union for Home Work, an organization that provided daycare for the children of working mothers. She became the first President of the Hartford Soldiers Aid Society and, in 1869, organized the first [[Suffragette]] convention in Connecticut. For these actions, she was dubbed "The First Lady of Hartford".<ref name="Boynton2014"/>

In 1867, she had an Episcopal church designed by [[Edward Tuckerman Potter]] built as a memorial to her husband and the three children they lost. The church's architecture contains guns and gun-smithing tools sculpted in marble to commemorate her husband's life as an arms maker. In 1896, a parish house was built on the site as a memorial to their son, Caldwell, who died in 1894. In 1975, the [[Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House]] was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=75001925}}|format=pdf|title=Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House |publisher=US Department of the Interior|page=2|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref>

==Retirement and death==
She sold her interest in Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1901.

Colt died of paralysis in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] on August 23, 1905.

In her will, Elizabeth Colt left a collection of nearly 1,000 objects, artworks, firearms and documents to the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] as well as a fund to build the Colt Memorial.
