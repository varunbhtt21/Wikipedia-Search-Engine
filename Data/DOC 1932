== History ==

EDSA was founded in 1960 by American landscape architect Edward Durell Stone, Jr., who collaborated with his father, architect [[Edward Durell Stone]], Sr. to found EDSA.  Stone, Jr. died in 2009 and Douglas C. Smith, who joined the firm in 1987, now serves as president of the company.<ref>[[Edward Durell Stone, Jr.]]</ref>

In the 1960s, EDSA became an instrumental player in the travel and [[tourism]] industries, leading resort and recreation assignments primarily in the [[Caribbean]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Southeastern United States]]. During this time, EDSA adopted an environmentally-based design philosophy, which was a relatively obscure notion that takes inspiration from each project's local heritage. A village center form became the framework for housing, amenities, and commerce in order to conserve resources and foster social diversity. This approach became a hallmark of EDSA resorts and communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edsaplan.com/homepage.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050605012408/http://www.edsaplan.com/homepage.html |archivedate=2005-06-05 |title=About EDSA}}</ref>

In 1971, EDSA began to receive national recognition when Stone, Jr. was appointed to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] in Washington, D.C. by President [[Richard Nixon]]. He served in the position for 12 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tclf.org/pioneer/edward-stone-jr |title=Edward Stone, Jr. &#124; The Cultural Landscape Foundation |publisher=Tclf.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref> Simultaneously, EDSA's reach was growing on an international level as the firm expanded within the global marketplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive-com.com/page/2069145/2013-05-12/http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.showbriefdetail&newsid=1916 |title=World Architecture News: EDSA expands into Asia with Shanghai office |publisher=Archive-com.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref> Assignments in the Middle East, Europe, and South America further imbedded the values of sensitivity to local cultures and the importance of collaboration with local professionals.

EDSA broadened its urban design practice with two influential public commissions that reinvigorated Fort Lauderdale's neglected urban waterfronts: The Fort Lauderdale Beach Revitalization in 1986 and Riverwalk Linear Park which was completed in 1994.<ref name="miamiherald1"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cityviewfortlauderdale.com/archived-articles/2-uncategorised/277-the-death-of-spring-break-by-rob-dressler |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-24 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140424160050/http://www.cityviewfortlauderdale.com/archived-articles/2-uncategorised/277-the-death-of-spring-break-by-rob-dressler |archive-date=2014-04-24 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>

In the 1990s, EDSA embarked on planning for several academic institutions including the [[College of Staten Island]] and [[Nova Southeastern University]] as well as cultural venues like the Florida Nature Cultural Center. A branch office in Orlando began to thrive with several assignments for the [[Disney Corporation]] and the new [[Orlando International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northstarpubs.com/articles/lab/linquist-appointed-principal-at-edsa |title=Linquist Appointed Principal At EDSA &#124; Northstar Publishing |publisher=Northstarpubs.com |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2014-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053732/http://www.northstarpubs.com/articles/lab/linquist-appointed-principal-at-edsa |archive-date=2014-08-08 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>
In 1994, Joseph Lalli became President of EDSA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landscapeonline.com/research/article/12027 |title=Article : Global Reach, Village Comfort; Profile: Joseph Lalli, FASLA, President and Managing Principal of EDSA |publisher=LandscapeOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref>  Under his leadership, EDSA Orient became the first joint venture landscape architectural office in [[Beijing]], China.
