The result was    '''merge to [[Vancouver#Transportation]]'''. The non-keep arguments cite that [[WP:N|it does not meet the notability guidelines]] or if it does, [[WP:V|the article fails our policy of verifiability]] (it is unsourced and thus does cannot demonstrate notability). The keep arguments, while asserting its status, otherwise fail to refute or address these issues with policy-or-guideline-based arguments; however, should sourcing be added to the article to help assuage the aforementioned concerns, the eventual redirect is free to be reversed and another discussion can occur at AfD over its notability as demonstrated by those sources should someone feel it necessary to start one.

No proof of notability. [[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 16:00, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' This is a major thoroughfare in Vancouver. I believe the prevailing consensus is that major thoroughfares in major cities are notable while sidestreets are generally not (excepting for ones with substantial independant coverage).

::  I don't see any special exceptions for streets in [[Wikipedia:Notability]] --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 04:11, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:: Numbered highways in national or state/provincial systems are what are considered notable. Simple streets pass GNG or die. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 21:46, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Not only is this a major thoroughfare in a major city, but it's the location and namesake for the [[King Edward Station]] in the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system.  Such investment is only made at locations that are considered vital in a major transportation system.--[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 22:09, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:: I don't an assumption about investment makes it notable by Wikipedia standards. --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 04:11, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:: [[WP:NOTINHERITED|Notability is not inherited]] from the SkyTrain station, either from its location or its naming (people who have ships named after them, for instance, do ''not'' become notable for that). - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 21:46, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:::It would be impossible for there not to be extremely extensive government reports with analysis, traffic and pedestrian patterns and the impact on the area of this street by having a station on this street, thus passing even WP:GNG.  There is far too much investment and civic importance for such reports not to be done.--[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 23:23, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::I don't think those are secondary sources, for one. --[[User:OKNoah|OKNoah]] ([[User talk:OKNoah|talk]]) 03:20, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Internal government reports are [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCES|primary sources]]. The notability of a road is demonstrated by ''media'' coverage in ''secondary'' sources, not internal bureaucratic analysis. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 21:13, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge and redirect''' to [[Vancouver#Transportation]]. We do not give streets, even major thoroughfares, a pass on notability; they must pass [[WP:GNG]]. This is a plain, common, unremarkable road with no evidence of passing [[WP:GNG]]. However, there may be some here that can be added to the section of the city's article regarding transportation, and redirects are cheap. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 21:46, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' as it's a major thoroughfare in Vancouver... [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 20:35, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::As has been noted repeatedly above, simply being a major thoroughfare in a city is ''not'', in and of itself, a sufficient claim of [[WP:N|notability]] to qualify a street for an [[WP:RS|unsourced]] article. The notability of a city street is demonstrated by the use of reliable sources which demonstrate that the street has been the subject of substantial coverage in multiple independent sources, and ''not'' just by being able to prove that the street ''exists''. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 21:11, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
*City streets, as a rule, are ''not'' entitled to an automatic presumption of notability just because they exist, or even because they're "major thoroughfares", if the article in question does not actually cite any [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to demonstrate that the road warrants coverage in an ''encyclopedia''. This article, as written, ''only'' describes the road's ''physical'' characteristics — thereby failing [[WP:ROADOUTCOMES]], which explicitly states that ''an article that explains and provides valid relevant citations for the social, cultural, historical or political context of a road in depth is more likely to survive AfD than one which merely describes the road's physical characteristics.'' So while I suppose it might be ''possible'' that an article ''could'' be written about this road which actually satisfied our inclusion rules for roads, ''this'' article as written ain't it. '''Delete'''; no prejudice against future recreation if somebody can write and source a ''good'' new article about it which gives any ''real'' context for why the road should be considered notable.
