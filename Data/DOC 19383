'''Caleb McDuff''' (born 20 January 2008) is a British [[go-kart]] racer. McDuff is [[profoundly deaf]], after losing 90% of his hearing as a toddler, believed to be as a result of a series of ear infections. McDuff currently uses [[cochlear implant]]s to hear, though these can not be used whilst he wears a crash helmet for racing. McDuff is currently the world's youngest deaf racing driver on a professional career path.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

McDuff currently races in the [[Super 1 National Kart Championships]], driving for AllStars Racing Team, managed by [[Luke Hines]].

McDuff was born 20 January 2008 in [[Abergavenny]], [[South Wales]], and currently resides in [[Pontypool]]. Although he passed the new-born hearing tests, it was sometime prior to his second birthday that he lost approximately 90% of his hearing, leaving him classed as profoundly deaf. It is believed that McDuff's hearing loss was caused by chronic ear infections.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

As a toddler, McDuff was surgically implanted with [[cochlear implant]]s. As a result of the implants, he has been able to adapt to the simulated hearing the implants give, and as such has developed aural communication, as well as use of [[British Sign Language]].

McDuff attends a mainstream school which has a specialist hearing impaired unit for support. He uses both spoken English and British Sign Language combined to communicate, in the form of [[Sign Supported English]].

In 2014 McDuff joined the Bambino Kart Tour, a race series created by Darren Beavers to encourage children aged six to eight to enter go-kart racing. The tour takes place at seven tracks around the United Kingdom during the course of the year. McDuff raced on a [[zip chassis]], powered by a 50cc [[two-stroke engine]] which reaches speeds in excess of 40 mph, whilst racing in Bambino class. McDuff moved to Honda powered Zip chassis for the 2018 Super One British Championship.

Whilst racing, McDuff is unable to wear the processors for his cochlear implants that allow him to hear. This means that he races in complete silence, and this inspired the team name he races under of 'Silence Racing'. McDuff relies fully on sign language and lip reading once his processors are off, and has learnt to adapt other senses to compensate for this, and 'feels' the go-kart and its engine rather than hearing it.<ref>{{cite web|author=15 January 2014 10:25 |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/deaf-caleb-mcduff-6-becomes-6509265 |title=Deaf Caleb McDuff, 6, becomes top young racing driver with dreams of Formula One |publisher=Wales Online |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/update/2013-12-20/pontypool-pupil-hopes-to-be-first-deaf-racing-car-driver/ |title=Pontypool pupil hopes to be first deaf F1 driver &#124; Wales - ITV News |publisher=Itv.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>
