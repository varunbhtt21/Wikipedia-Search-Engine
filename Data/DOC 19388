Non-notable activist and author. No significant coverage that is primarily about Dan Barnabic in independent, reliable sources, online or offline. Footnotes are all press releases, forum discussions, and COI publications. [[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 21:35, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Delete''' Looks like a vanity bio to me; no evidence of [[WP:BIO]] whatsoever. <b>[[User:Ohnoitsjamie|OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font>]] [[User talk:Ohnoitsjamie|<sup>Talk</sup>]]</b> 21:43, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
