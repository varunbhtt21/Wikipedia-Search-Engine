==History==
A. Darrell Harris founded Furnitureland South with his wife Stella on South Main Street in [[High Point, North Carolina]] in 1969, offering a small selection of market samples.<ref name=Row/><ref name=Online>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triad/print-edition/2012/11/30/furnitureland-south-grows-presence.html
|title=Furnitureland South grows presence with online shopping|last=Evans|first=Matt|work=[[Triad Business Journal]]|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> Over the next two decades, the small operation grew in size, profits and prestige; in 1986, the original store had $18 million in annual sales. Harris built a furniture distribution center on 50 acres in Jamestown at [[Interstate 85 Business (North Carolina)|Interstate 85 Business]] and Riverdale Drive, in an area that was mostly farms.<ref name="Row">{{cite news|title=Furniture Row: An Area off Interstate 85 Near Jamestown Is Becoming a Popular Spot for Furniture Retail Stores|last=Firesheets|first=Tina|work=[[Greensboro News & Record]]|date=January 24, 2005|page=B1}}</ref> Corporate offices moved to the Jamestown site in 1988.<ref>{{cite news|title=Furnitureland South Opens Huge Store|last=Nash|first=Betty Joyce|work=Greensboro News & Record|date=September 30, 1990|at=Furnitureland South, p. 2}}</ref> A $10 million, three-story 228,000-square-foot retail store opened October 1, 1990, an event earning coverage from ''[[USA Today]]''; the original, 78,000-square foot High Point store became a clearance center.<ref>{{cite news|title=Furnitureland South Slated to Open Retail Store Today|work=Greensboro News & Record|date=October 1, 1990|at=Triad Business Weekly, p. 3}}</ref>

During the 1990s, annual sales increased exponentially from $20 million to $129 million,<ref>{{cite news|title=Furniture Business Building 80-Foot Armoire|last=Temple|first=John|date=November 26, 1997|work=Greensboro News & Record|page=B1}}</ref> and the store grew physically along with its growing income; by 1996, Furnitureland South billed itself as "The World's Largest Home Furnishings Showplace."<ref name="Thomasville">{{cite news|title=Furnitureland South to Open Showroom Without Thomasville|last=Andron|first=Scott|date=August 5, 1996|work=Greensboro News & Record|page=B6}}</ref> A 342,000-square-foot expansion in 1994 to the corporate headquarters and distribution center provided more space for showrooms. A $22 million, 500,000-square-foot addition completed in 1998 gave the store over twice the space it had before. Around the end of the decade, approximately 80 percent of customers were from outside the state. A [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] location was planned, but scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|title=Furnitureland Opens Its Doors to the Triad|last=Nagy|first=John A.|work=Greensboro News & Record|date=July 29, 1994|page=BG6}}</ref>

The ever-heightening profile of Furnitureland South reached a symbolic zenith in 1999 when an 85-foot-tall [[highboy]] situated at the showroom entrance became the largest item of furniture in the High Point area.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bureau at a crossroads: High Point landmark for sale|last=Lopez|first=Robert|work=Greensboro News & Record|date=November 13, 2011|page=D1}}</ref>

Expansion continued into the new millennium.

==Criticism==
In 1996, [[Thomasville Furniture]] stopped selling its products at Furnitureland South because the store apparently violated Thomasville's policy of not quoting prices over the phone.<ref name=Thomasville/>

In 1999, when asking for rezoning for expansion, Furnitureland South agreed to switch from [[Water well|well]]s to municipal water. People in the area had wells go dry and had blamed Furnitureland South, which used several wells.<ref>{{cite news|title=Board OKs Furniture Warehouse Expansion: Furnitureland South Decides Not to Seek Tax Incentives for the Project|last=Feller|first=Ben|work=Greensboro News & Record|date=December 17, 1999|page=B1}}</ref>

After 45 years of selling furniture, Scott Knox filed a complaint with the North Carolina Attorney General regarding the practice of exclusive deals for manufacturers to only sell their product in one area store. Knox was no longer able to sell products from some companies which had deals with Furnitureland South, and he could not afford a lawsuit. The attorney general's office said this practice was not normally a problem.<ref name=Knox>{{cite news|title=Retailer objects to furniture deals|last=Dodd|first=Kory|work=Greensboro News & Record|date=December 19, 2006|page=A1}}</ref>

==Furniture Row==
In the mid-1990s, Boyles Furniture bought 65 acres near Furnitureland South. Boyles chief operating officer Rick Grant said, "We knew when we bought the land that our vision was to make this a furniture destination."<ref name=Row/> Boyles only needed eight acres for its store, which it moved from downtown, which the company believed was not doing well. The new location allowed Boyles to expand more than they could have at the former site. Ziba Fine Oriental Rugs started with space in the Boyles store on built a separate location in 2001.<ref name=Row/>

Also in the mid-1990s, Abu Khan saw significant potential because of the size of Furnitureland South, and he bought a building for his Abu Oriental Rug and Home, which he later expanded.

In 2003, [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] developer Jay Chambers announced plans to develop the site into "Furniture Row", in an area he called "Gateway to the Furniture Capital of the World." During the next several years, [[Drexel Heritage]], [[Thomasville Furniture]] and [[Klaussner Furniture]] built stores on Furniture Avenue, and Furniture Galleries, with six tenants, was announced by [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] developer R.W. Hamlett, Jr. Chambers wanted hotels and restaurants to locate in the area to make it convenient for people traveling long distances to buy furniture. Most of the area, but not Furnitureland South itself, was in the High Point city limits, though an agreement between High Point, Jamestown and Greensboro gave High Point the right to later annex the area.<ref name=Row/>

As of 2005, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau, 200,000 people came to High Point each year to buy furniture, from locations as far away as [[Chicago]]. The [[High Point Market]] has many locations in downtown High Point, but they are not open to consumers. People coming to High Point to shop for furniture have a difficult time finding a store downtown where they can shop, so a central location for retailers would provide a benefit to tourists.<ref name=Row/>
