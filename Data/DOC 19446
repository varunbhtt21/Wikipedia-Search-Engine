Booth said on his blog:
{{quote|We wanted to show an interesting character whose homosexuality is part of him, not something that’s hidden. Sure there are gay people who you wouldn’t know are gay right off the bat, but there are others who are a more flamboyant, and we thought it would be nice to actually see them portrayed in comics. Did we go over the top, I don’t think so.<ref>{{cite web|first=Caleb |last=Goellner |date=September 18, 2011 |title=Openly Gay Superhero To Join DC’s Relaunched ''Teen Titans'' |url=http://comicsalliance.com/teen-titans-openly-gay-superhero/ |publisher=comicsalliance.com |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115065444/http://comicsalliance.com/teen-titans-openly-gay-superhero/ |archivedate=November 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
Bunker first appeared as a member of the Teen Titans in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 4, #1, as part of [[The New 52]], a reboot of DC's continuity and timeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/06/13/scott-lobdell-talks-teen-titans-to-bleeding-cool/ |title=Scott Lobdell Talks Teen Titans to Bleeding Cool |first=Rich |last=Johnston |work=Bleeding Cool |date=June 13, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67HGgMkl3?url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/06/13/scott-lobdell-talks-teen-titans-to-bleeding-cool/ |archivedate=April 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

Raised in the small Mexican village called 'El Chilar', Miguel Jose Barragan had grown up in a loving and supportive community, and found acceptance as an openly gay teenager. When Miguel manifested the meta-human ability to create psionic energy constructs, the extroverted idealist sought out [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] in an attempt to become a full-fledged superhero.
 
Miguel – who adopts the code-name “Bunker” – then becomes a target of N.O.W.H.E.R.E., a mysterious organization abducting super-powered youths for their own nefarious purposes. Red Robin makes contact with Bunker, and soon organizes a group of targeted teenagers into a meta-human resistance force known as the 'Teen Titans'. Together, they are able to liberate the living weapon known as [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] and dismantle N.O.W.H.E.R.E.’s secret complex in the Antarctic.

In July 2012, Lobdell announced that he was going to reveal Bunker's boyfriend, "who will be heading to the US from Mexico after coming out of a coma and learning that his boyfriend had run off to become a superhero".<ref>{{cite web|first=Joey |last=Esposito|date=July 13, 2012|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/07/14/comic-con-dc-new-52-panel-recap|title=Comic-Con: DC New 52 Panel Recap |publisher=uk.ign.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

In issue #23, Bunker leaves the team for a short while.<ref>{{cite web |first=James |last=Ashelford|date=September 3, 2013 |title=Why I will miss Bunker (and why Titans won't)  |url=http://alessthanreputablesource.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/why-i-will-miss-bunker-and-why-titans.html|publisher=alessthanreputablesource.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> The ''Teen Titans'' series then concluded, with #30 along with an annual in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Gerding|date=January 16, 2014| title=DC Comics Cancels ''Teen Titans'' with Issue #30|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50317|publisher=comicbookresources.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> It was then announced that the series would be relaunched in July 2014 with a new issue 1, written by [[Will Pfeifer]] and art by [[Kenneth Rocafort]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Joshua |last=Yehl|date=April 8, 2014|title= DC Comics Will Relaunch ''Teen Titans'' in July|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/08/dc-comics-will-relaunch-teen-titans-in-july|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

In the annual, during an epilogue, Bunker is shown being funded by [[The Green Team (comics)|the Green Team]] to create the 'Spectacular Internationale'.<ref>{{cite web|first=Martin|last=Gray|date=May 7, 2014|title=''Teen Titans Annual'' #3 review|publisher=blogspot.co.uk|url=http://dangermart.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/teen-titans-annual-3-review.html|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bunker has the ability to create energy constructs with his mind, often creating brick-like walls and pummeling fists. His constructs manifest as purple bricks. He has full control over their density, being able to make them soft to cushion impacts or falls, or hard as rock to inflict damage. He can create a wide variety of shapes including pillars, shields, body armor, platforms to levitate himself and others, etc. He has also been shown launching his bricks as projectiles. 

[[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] in ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' (Vol 1 #16) said "This Bunker reminds me of me in a way. He acts like he doesn't take any of it too seriously. But a wall like that doesn't come out of thin air. He's got more going on than anyone gives him credit for. You watch-- he'll be in the [[Justice League]] before he's twenty."

==In other media==
Bunker appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', as one of the background students at Super Hero High.

==Merchandising==
In 2013, a [[HeroClix]] figure of Bunker was produced as part of the Teen Titans set.<ref>{{cite web|date=April 24, 2013|title=DC HeroClix Teen Titans: Bunker|url=http://heroclix.com/heroclix/preview/dc-heroclix-teen-titans-bunker/#axzz318Z752bl|publisher=heroclix.com|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}</ref>
