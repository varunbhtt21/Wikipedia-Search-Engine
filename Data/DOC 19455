Title : Grid-Enabled Measures
Text : '''Grid-Enabled Measures''' ('''GEM''') is an initiative of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI). GEM is a web-based [[collaboration|collaborative]] platform and [[database]] enabling [[research]]ers to exchange harmonized data about behavioral [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]s, measures, and datasets.<ref name=Moser>{{cite journal|last=Moser|first=Richard P.|last2=Hesse, Bradford W.; Shaikh, Abdul R.; Courtney, Paul; Morgan, Glen; Augustson, Erik, Kobrin, Sarah; Levin, Kerry; Helba, Christina; Garner, David; Dunn, Marsha; Coa, Kisha|title=Grid-Enabled Measures: Using Science 2.0 to Standardize Measures and Share Data|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|date=2011|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1532–1534}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rabin|first=Borsika A.|author2=Purcell, Peyton |author3=Naveed, Sana |author4=Moser, Richard P. |author5=Henton, Michelle D. |author6=Proctor, Enola K. |author7=Brownson, Ross C. |author8= Glasgow, Rusell |title=Advancing the application, quality and harmonization of implementation science measures|journal=Implementation Science|volume=7|pages=1–11|doi=10.1186/1748-5908-7-119}}</ref>

GEM has two goals:
# "Promote use of standardized measures which are tied to theoretically based constructs" and 
# "Facilitate sharing of harmonized data resulting from the use of standardized measures".<ref name="Moser" />

GEM has been proposed as part of the solution to the problem of tracking constructs in electronic medical records<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glasgow|first=Russell E.|author2=Kaplan, Robert M. |author3=Ockene, Judith K. |author4=Fisher, Edwin B. |author5= Emmons, Karen M. |title=Patient-Reported Measures Of Psychosocial Issues And Health Behavior Should Be Added To Electronic Health Records|journal=Health Affairs|date=March 2012|volume=31|issue=3|pages=497–504|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.1295|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/3/497.short}}</ref> and for control of construct proliferation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Kai R.|author2=Voronovich, Zoya A. |author3=Cook, Paul F. |author4= Pedro, Leli W. |title=Addicted to constructs: science in reverse?|journal=Addiction|year=2013|volume=108|issue=9|pages=1532–1534|doi=10.1111/add.12227 |pmid=23718564}}</ref>
