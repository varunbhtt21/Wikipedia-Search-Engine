== Biography ==
Ruth Buendía was born in the Asháninka community of [[Cutivireni]] in [[Satipo Province]] in 1977. After living a hard childhood, in which her father was killed by his own people for being regarded as a member of the terrorist group [[Shining path]], she ran away with her mother and brothers to Satipo in 1991. She spent some years working as waitress in [[Lima]] and Satipo until 2003, when she decided to join the organization [["Central asháninka del Río Ene" (Care)]]. After some years of political and environmental activity, she became the President of the organization in 2005, and was re-elected in 2009 and 2013.<ref>http://incomindios.ch/es/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2.-Articulo_Ruth_Buendia-espanol..pdf</ref>

== Pakitzapango and international recognition ==
In 2009 and 2010, Ruth Buendía and CARE led the protests against the construction of a hydroelectric dam in [[Pakitpazango]], a project that endangered the welfare of the Asháninka community in the [[Ene River]] watershed. As a result of this, the [[Government of Peru|Peruvean Government]] was forced to rescind the grants from the company responsible for the construction, Pakitzapango Energía S.A.C., blocking the project until the present day. Buendía, as representative of the CARE, received the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2014, as well as other awards which made her regarded as one of the most important environmentalists in South America.<ref>http://www.vigilamazonia.com/uploads/files/6e661f8ff472873834ac0fc8af578c27.pdf</ref><ref>https://landportal.info/sites/landportal.info/files/libro_mujer_rural.pdf#page=189</ref>
