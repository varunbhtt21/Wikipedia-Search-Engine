'''Great Torrington School''' is a [[Mixed-sex education|mixed]] [[secondary school]] located in [[Great Torrington]] in the [[English county]] of [[Devon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gts.devon.sch.uk/ |title=Great Torrington School |publisher=Gts.devon.sch.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

Previously a [[foundation school]] administered by [[Devon County Council]], Great Torrington School was converted to [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] on 1 August 2011. However the school continues to coordinate with Devon County Council for admissions. Pupils are normally admitted from Beaford Primary School, Buckland Brewer Primary School, Dolton CE Primary School, Great Torrington Junior School, Horwood & Newton Tracey Primary School, Langtree Community School, Monkleigh Primary School, Shebbear Community School, The Clinton CE Primary School and West & East Putford School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gts.devon.sch.uk/information/feederSchools.html |title=Feeder schools |publisher=Gts.devon.sch.uk |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

Following a summer 2018 protest in which male pupils wore [[Skirt|skirts]] and female pupils supported them by wearing [[trousers]], accompanied by a petition set up by schoolboy Bradley Smart, the school agreed in 2019 that pupils would be permitted to wear [[shorts]] during the summer term, while still requiring them to adhere to other aspects of the school's [[School uniforms in England|uniform policy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-48055725|title=Devon skirt demo boys can now wear shorts|last=|first=|date=25 April 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref>
