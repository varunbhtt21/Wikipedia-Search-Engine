'''David Owen Blanchard''' is an American meteorologist, photographer, and storm chaser. He was a significant collaborator in seminal research on [[tornadogenesis]], specifically the importance of baroclinic boundaries, the [[rear-flank downdraft]] (RFD) and its [[Atmospheric thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Rasmussen |first = Erik |authorlink = Erik N.

==Background==
Blanchard studied [[meteorology]] at [[Florida State University]] (FSU) where he earned a B.S. and at [[Colorado State University]] (CSU) where he earned a M.S. in 1983 with the thesis ''Variability of the Convective Field Pattern in South Florida and its Relationship to the Synoptic Flow'' and a Ph.D. in 1994 with the dissertation ''Jet-induced Inertial Instabilities and the Growth of Mesoscale Convective Systems''. From 1978-1980 Blanchard worked at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[National Hurricane and Experimental Meteorology Laboratory]] (NHEML) in Coral Gables, Florida after which he moved to the [[Office of Weather Research and Modification]] (OWRM) in Boulder, Colorado until 1982 when he worked at the [[Weather Research Program]] (WRP) until 1988. Blanchard was at the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) in Boulder from 1998-1994, the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR) from 1994-1995, and returned to NSSL Boulder from 1996-1999. Since 1999 he has been a meteorologist at [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs).<ref>{{cite web|title=David O.

Blanchard participated as a team leader for [[VORTEX projects|Project VORTEX]] in 1994-1995<ref>{{cite web |title = VORTEX |work = Field Projects |publisher = UCAR Earth Observing Laboratory |date = 
|url = https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/vortex |accessdate = 2014-04-30 }}</ref> and was co-[[principal investigator]] (PI) of subVORTEX during 1997-1998. Blanchard is a [[Certified Consulting Meteorologist]] (CCM) by the [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS), served on the AMS Severe Local Storms Committee, an associated editor of ''[[Monthly Weather Review]]'', and on the Atmospheric Dynamics Committee of the [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU).{{cn|date=June 2019}}
