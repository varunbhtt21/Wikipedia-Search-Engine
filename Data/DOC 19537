Title : J. Cheever Goodwin
Text : '''John Cheever Goodwin''' (1850 – December 1912) was an American musical theatre librettist, lyricist and producer. Goodwin was born in [[Boston]] and graduated from [[Harvard University]].  He began a career in journalism before turning to writing for the stage. He often worked with composers [[Edward E. Rice]] and [[Woolson Morse]]. Goodwin was one of the earliest American writers dedicated to musical theatre librettos and lyrics. His first successful libretto was ''[[Evangeline (1874 musical)|Evangeline]]'' in 1874, and his last new work was produced in 1903.<ref name=Boy>Hischak, Thomas S.

Of ''Lost, Strayed or Stolen'', a critic commented: "Cheever Goodwin, clever at adaptation, at times a most dexterous manipulator in stagecraft, has been singularly successful in this latest venture.  Starting of a delightfully humorous set of complications, woven logically together, he has made an honest translation and obtained a genuinely absurd farce which he carries through four acts, sustaining the interest to the end."<ref>"''Lost, Strayed or Stolen''", ''The Illustrated American'', November 14, 1896, p. 662</ref>
