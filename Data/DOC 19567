Lewis and Dawson formed the Bundles when they first met in 2001, and went on to meet back up sporadically over the next eight years, before recording the songs that appeared on their studio debut in February 2009. Prior to the recording, they were joined by Jack Lewis, Griffen, and Blau, who helped them perform their first songs live and, later on, contribute to songwriting.<ref name="Paste">{{cite web | url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/12/kimya-dawson-jeffrey-lewis-more-releasing-album-as.html | title=Kimya Dawson, Jeffrey Lewis, More Ready Album as The Bundles | work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] | date=4 December 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2014 | author=Lee, Christina}}</ref> In May 2010, after their eponymous album was released, they went on a tour, first in their hometown of New York City and then to Europe.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/05/anti-folk_super.html | title=anti-folk supergroup The Bundles (Kimya, Jeff Lewis, etc) have an album, playing Cake Shop w/ SECRET GUEST & other dates | work=[[Brooklyn Vegan]] | date=5 May 2010 | accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref>
