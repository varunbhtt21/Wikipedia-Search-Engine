==Life==
Ras Woldemichael was born into one of the traditional ruling families of Medri Bahri, the House of Hazega. Upon the death of Emperor [[Tewodros II]] in 1868, then ruler of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] (and later Emperor), [[Dejazmatch]] [[Yohannes IV]] appointed his ally Woldemichael the Governor of [[Hamasien]] and [[Serae|Seraye]]. In doing so, Tewodros' former appointee Dejazmatch [[Hailu Teweldemedhin]] of the rival House of [[Tsazega]] was replaced. 

Under the leadership of now Emperor Yohannes IV, Woldemichael fought in the Battle of Gundet against Egyptian forces under Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]], who sought to bring the entire [[Nile River Basin]] under his rule. The Khedive entrusted the Danish mercenary Colonel [[:da:Adolph Arendrup|Adolf Arendrup]] to annex Hamasien and Seraye, and then proceed towards [[Adwa]]. Following some minor skirmishes, the forces of the Khedive met the Abyssinian forces at Gundet on the morning of 16 November 1875. [[Ras Alula|Shaleka Alula]] took command of the left flank, the forces of Yohannes on the right, with Woldemichael taking command of the center and rear in light of his greater knowledge of the area. The Egyptians were tricked into a narrow and steep valley and were wiped out by the Abyssinian gunners surrounding the valley from the surrounding mountains. Virtually the entire Egyptian force, along with its many officers of European and North American background were killed. News of this huge defeat was suppressed in Egypt for fear that it would undermine the government of the Khedive.

However, Woldemichael resented the nature of the Emperor's interference in the semi-autonomous [[Medri Bahri]] and feared that Yohannes intended to re-appoint Woldemichael's rival Hailu as Governor. Before the [[Battle of Gura]] ensued, he rebelled against Yohannes and sided with the Egyptians. Following the defeat of the Egyptians at Gura, Woldemichael went into open revolt against Yohannes, vowing to destroy his rival Hailu in the process, culminating in the defeat of Hailu during the [[Battle of Weki Duba]]. 

Unable to consolidate power in the northern provinces, Yohannes sent messengers to Woldemichael offering to forgive his past crimes if he submitted to him. Woldemichael adamantly refused, leading to Yohannes' appointment of loyalist Ras [[Baryaw Gebretsadiq]] as Governor of [[Hamasien]]. Ras Baryaw's governorship was however shortlived, with Woldemichael confronting and soundly defeating him at Biet Mekae near [[Asmara]]. Yohannes then appointed [[Ras Alula]] as Governor, tasking him to end Woldemichael's revolt. When Ras Alula became aware of the difficulties fighting Woldemichael, once again a truce was offered to Woldemichael, with Ras Alula swearing on [[The Bible]] that he would not attack. On this occasion, Woldemichael agreed to peace terms and travelled to [[Axum|Axum, Ethiopia]] to sign a peace treaty. However, Alula broke his promise and imprisoned Ras Woldemichael, allowing Alula to rule Hamasien with little opposition afterwards. Woldemichael lived in forced retirement in Axum until his death in 1906.
