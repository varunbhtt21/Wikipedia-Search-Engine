== Wikipedia font size larger than on other sites ==

[[File:///C:/Users/Roger/Desktop/WikiOldNew.jpg|thumbnail]]

While all other programs appear at the same font size as before, Wikipedia now comes up annoyingly larger. The two windows on this screenshot are exactly the same size, but contain different amounts of information. Here is the information you asked for:

Google Chrome version 36.0.1985.125 m
Samsung monitor with settings: display 1. S24B240, resolution 1920 x 1080
Gateway computer running Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1
Font size in Google Chrome is set to medium.

Thank you.

The font size is too small, please provide a mechanism to increase font.

== Font size is so tiny ==

 I barely am able to read the feedback screen.  I only experience this tiny font on your website.
Please enlarge font.

== Wikipedia Font Size ==

Suddenly yesterday font on site went to size 32, which causes severe overlapping, even at full screen. All other websites, including other Wikimedia sites have not changed. Wikipedia has become useless.
Win 7 Pro, Sp 1
Firefox Ver 36 Settings:
-Font Size 16
-"Allow sites to choose font size" checked. Unchecking makes no difference in Wikipedia font size.
Monitor is 23" 1920x1080
Thanks for any help,
John

== new layout fonts are too small for me. old layout fonts are better to read, they are little bit bigger. ==

 browser name and exact version number
MozillaFirefox 37.0.2
screen resolution and size: 1440x900; 19.1"
Operating system: Windows XP Pro, Service pack 3
 font size settings in browser: Arial 18

== Arabic font ==

Hello

Please change the current Arabic font to something easier to read.

Sincerely,

== Debian / Iceweasel  report ==

'''Browser:''' Iceweasel 38.3.0

'''Screen Res:''' 1920 x 1200, About 20.5 x 12.75 (24" diagonal)

'''Op Sys & Vers:''' Debian 8.2

'''Font Settings:''' Proportional is 16, and Mono-space is 12

'''The images:''' http://s1376.photobucket.com/user/clifcox/library/

The new font is obviously bigger.

== Bogus advice - font is too small in BOTH instances ==

In spite of your claim that the font size hasn't changed, you're still left with facts...  Both the old and new instances you provided, the text is minuscule.  It appears to be an 8 point font, on a 100% display.  No other website I've visited displays this problem, only Wikipedia.  I am using:
Browser name & Exact version:  Firefox 42.0
Screen resolution and size: 1920 x 1080 27"
Operating system name and version number:  Windows 10 Home 64 bit
Font settings in browser:  Default Font Times New Roman 12pt
Font settings on monitor: 100%

== Firefox 43.01 on Mac OSX Yosemite Tiny Fonts ==

Like many others, I have the tiny font problem with this browser. However, I noticed that Firefox reduced the page zoom to 80 percent on the Wkikpedia page while leaving it at the default 100 percent I use for everything else. Resetting it to 100 percent gave me fonts that appear smaller than the old Wiki but not dramatically. Could a problem with page zoom be an issue for others (including those reporting huge fonts)?

== Font size ==

Sorry to disturb you but I got some troubles with Wikipedia the last time I logged on; the font size appears now MUCH smaller than before; how to change and readjust such size? Many thanks in advance

== Wikipedia's big font fault extends to MS Edge. ==

Greetings, 

Sadly Wikipedia's big font fault extends to MS Edge, with text at 2-3x the size of any other site: 

Device - Microsoft Lumia 950 XL Dual SIM
Screen - 5.7in, WQHD (2560 x 1440)
Browser - Microsoft Edge 38.14393.67.0, Microsoft EdgeHTML 14.14393
OS - Window 10 Mobile, version 10.0.14393.67
Font size settings in browser - The only font setting available in MS Edge is for its reading view, which Wikipedia does not make available. 

And I can see no reason whatsoever to release my IP address. Please resist the temptation to do so.

== Font VERY hard to read in Chrome ==

Wikipedia is so difficult to read using Chrome that I've started avoiding using it.
This started around 9/23/15 I'd guess, but it could have been a week before that
Wikipedia looks good on Firefox  (48.0.2 and 49.0.1, font = 100%) and Edge (font readable if at any size I tried)

* Windows 10 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3194496) - installed 9/30/2016 (But problem predates that by at least 5 days, which was the date of the prior auto update)
* Chrome Version 48.0.2564.116 m
* Hardware - GTX 950, 2 displays (1680 x 1050 and 1280 x 1024), Intel i5-5400
* Font Size = 100% - VOILA! Bumping it to 110% makes it usable

So I've figured out my solution. But maybe you should know - something is obviously wrong, IMO.

Thanks. I don't expect to hear from you, and I wouldn't even know how to check and see if this posting got a reply. But I love Wiki, and I want you to continue being fabulous.

== How many more fucking years until you morons fix that ridiculous font issue?  ==

While the page loads on Android, font size conforms to what is set up in the device settings (e.g. large) -- then, when the page finishes loading, font size snaps back to that fixed microscopic size. 

I take it as proof for exceptionally idiotic moronism that this can't seem to be fixed for years and years with one of the premier sites of the entire web. 

Fuck you suckers, until this is fixed!

== Horrible small font size on Android Chrome  ==

Hello, 

I've been a supporter of Wikipedia and I have had a serious problem for the past year or more.

I have an Android Samsung Note 3 device and have the font size set to extra large for readability. However Wikipedia is one of the only websites I visit where the text is so small it displays at half the standard size or smaller. It's simply unreadable. This is while using Chrome on Android. 

I have tried a different browser and it displayed properly but Chrome is my favorite so I want to stick with it. 

There are no other large media  websites that have this issue in Chrome so I wonder what's going on. 

Thanks

== Editbox font becomes small ==

OS: Windows 10

Browser: MS Edge

Font inside the editbox is very small. Font renders fine on rest of the page. Is there a setting or css snippet I can add to vector.js to make it 'normal'?

Thanks

== Font too small ==

For some unknown reason you have reduced the font on my wiki pages to a point where it is almost unreadable. 

This 'user experience' change you made is unacceptable and arrogant.

You need to come up with an easy way to undo what you have done. 

This type of incompetence is why I never have and never will respond to your begging for money!

== Mechanism for removing notifications needs to be clearer ==

I only discovered by accident that I could remove notifications by clicking on them individually. There is nothing in the UI to indicate this. Consider putting in a 'X' or 'Delete' button in the upper right or left corners of the individual notifications.
Thanks,
Matt

== Small font size with new layout in Ubuntu Firefox ==

All of the text is in a very small font size.<br>
In the old layout the font size is much bigger.<br>
I am using Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (64 bit)<br>
The browser is Mozilla Firefox Quantum 61.0.1 (64 bit)
Screen resolution is 1280 x 1024.
This problem occurs only for Wikipedia in combination with Firefox.
All other sites have normal font sizes in Firefox.
I tried Opera.
In this browser the fonts have normal sizes.
I am also using Firefox on Android and IOS.
On these devices everything is normal.
'''Problem solved'''<br>
I changed the size for the default font from 10 to 16.

== How to change the font size ==

I can barely read the articles in Wikipedia.  Apparently this is a problem for a lot of people.
Here is the information you ask for.

Google Chrome version 73.0.3683.103
Macbook 13.3 inch 2560x1600
MacOS MOJAVE 10.14.4
Font setting: Medium
