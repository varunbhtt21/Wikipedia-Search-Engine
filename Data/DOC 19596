:''The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the template below. <span style="color:red">'''Please do not modify it.'''</span>  Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the template's [[Help:Using talk pages|talk page]] or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).  No further edits should be made to this section.''

The result of the discussion was an obvious '''keep'''. I know I technically shouldn't close this as I've !voted here which makes me [[WP:INVOLVED]]; however, as 1) the outcome is [[WP:SNOW|beyond doubt]] (''13'' keep !votes, 2 neutral !votes, 1 merge !vote and 0 delete !votes), 2) the 7 day period has passed and 3) users are recommending for this to not remain open any longer, I see no harm done in closing it. Feel free to revert my closure if you disagree with it, though I highly doubt that it's going to happen. <!-- Tfd top --> [[User:Satellizer|<font color="#00B7EB">'''''Satellizer'''''</font>]] [[User talk:Satellizer|<font color="magenta">(´・ω・`)</font>]] 06:36, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect/Merge''' to {{tl|Infobox character}} in that case. [[User:XXSNUGGUMSXX|XXSNUGGUMSXX]] ([[User talk:XXSNUGGUMSXX|talk]]) 03:47, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': If we decide to merge/whathaveyou this, it will also be worth looking at {{tl|Infobox animanga character}} (and maybe some others too, though they tend to be a bit more varied compared to the standard infobox). – '''[[User:Bellum Stellarum|Bellum]]'''  <small>([[User talk:Bellum Stellarum|talk]]) ([[Special:Contributions/Bellum Stellarum|contribs]])</small> 13:38, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Too many unique fields that while could be replicated in the infobox character template, it would be too much work.  I would recommend, however, that we rebuild the Vg character template as a wrapper around the infobox character one that would provide the appropriate fields (like Mocap) that match to the general character template. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 22:42, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', err... So we gonna ignore unique field there? Both have specific function per Masem and Bellum.--<font style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #FF0000; color: #ffffff;">[[User:Aldnonymous|AldNon]]</font><sup>[[User_talk:Aldnonymous|Ucallin?☎]]</sup> 23:31, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Not redundant to infobox character. - [[User:Bilby|Bilby]] ([[User talk:Bilby|talk]]) 01:02, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Neutral''', but I'm going to [[WP:Ignore all rules]] here and mention that [[WP:Other stuff exists]], the reason being that we ought to merge the various character types simultaneously, if at all, since some characters appear to significant degrees in multiple forms of media and it'd be strange for some character articles, but not others, to get messed up until they're fixed. [[User:Tezero|Tezero]] ([[User talk:Tezero|talk]]) 01:49, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Neutral''', I would be happy if we merged the various sub-templates into a single class, but I would also not like to see the whole thing drag on and stutter. This needs careful preparation and planning. However, if the movement is to keep the template, I'm fine with that too. --[[User:ProtoDrake|ProtoDrake]] ([[User talk:ProtoDrake|talk]]) 08:50, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - The "Infobox video game character" template has fields relevant to video games that "Infobox character" template lacks. That's hardly "redundant." –[[User:Prototime|Prototime]] ([[User_talk:Prototime|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Prototime|contribs]]) 18:12, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', per Bilby and Prototime. <span style="border:3px solid#00FFFF;color:gray;">[[User:Satellizer|<span style="color:gray;">'''''satellizer''''']] [[User talk:Satellizer|<span style="color:gray;">(talk]] - [[Special:Contribs/Satellizer|<span style="color:gray;">contributions)]]</span> 23:13, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Blatantly false nomination''' Someone close it already, it's annoying. --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 08:12, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': There's some redundancy, yes, but there's enough uniqueness to this one to necessitate a difference from <nowiki>{{Template:Infobox character}}</nowiki>, along the same lines as [[User:Prototime]] and [[User:Masem]].

* '''General reply''' In such cases, we usually merge any required parameters into the more generic template. In this case, the template's documentation is poor, but extra parameters seem to be: {{para|designer}}, {{para|motion capture}} and four ''actor'' parameters (all six of which could all apply to non-videogame characters); {{para|likes}}, {{para|dislikes}} (which both seem like in-universe cruft); {{Para|firstgame}}, and {{para|inuniverse}}, which is for the inclusion of modules. Such few specialised parameters do not justify a separate template. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 20:15, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
**There's no "|likes=, |dislikes=". Stop imagining things. There is only:| name            = | series          =| image           = | caption         = |'''firstappearance''' = (useful in the cases such as [[Strider Hiryu]])| '''firstgame'''       = | creator         = | '''artist'''          = | voiceactor      = | '''japanactor'''      = | '''motionactor'''     = | '''liveactor'''       = | '''inuniverse'''      = (for specialised sub-templates). And no, non-video game characters outisde of anime have no use for a Japanese voice actor. And the rest of the huge pile of crap at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_character (children, spouses, significant others, uncles, grandfathers and what else) at is completely useless for vg characters. What is needed is in the vg chara template , and the effect looks, for example, like that: [[Jill Valentine]] *without) and [[Taki (Soulcalibur)]] with a sub-template ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Fighting_game_character fighting game] in this case). --[[User:Niemti|Niemti]] ([[User talk:Niemti|talk]]) 20:57, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
***Before you accuse me, falsely, of imagining things, perhaps you could have a look at the code and/ or documentation of {{tld|Infobox video game character}}. What, do you think, are parameters numbered (in the code) 10 and 11? As with all optional templates in all infoboxes, parameters in {{tld|Infobox_character}} need not be used in cases where they do not apply. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 21:42, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
***Actually looking at the history, someone who is now indef blocked just over a month ago added such parameters without documenting them [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_video_game_character&diff=602076957&oldid=575301450].

*'''Keep''' : Reason :- This template has meaningful modules. And i also strongly oppose this nomination [[User:TheBlackSnow|TheBlackSnow]] ([[User talk:TheBlackSnow|talk]]) 08:17, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Has at least four distinct fields from the general character infobox. —<B>[[User:Torchiest|Torchiest]]</B> <sup>[[User talk:Torchiest|talk]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-3ex;">[[Special:Contributions/Torchiest|edits]]</sub> 13:38, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - The VG template serves a distinct purpose; there's nothing "redundant" about it at all. This nomination is farcical.

*'''Keep''' - I don't really see any reason for it to be removed/merged. As a side note, I'd like to see {{para|lastappearance}} and {{para|lastgame}} as parameters, though I realise there is also reason to exclude them. -- [[User:Rhain1999|<span style="color: #008;">''Rhain''1999</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Rhain1999|talk to me]])</sup>
