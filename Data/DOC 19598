* '''[[:Liberty GB]]''' – Overturn A7 deletion, unsalt, list at AfD.  There's a lot of different opinions here, but the common thread is that most people felt the A7 speedy deletion and salting were not correct.  I'm going to put this back on AfD to let the community form a clean consensus – -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 23:43, 7 May 2014 (UTC) <!--*-->

:{{DRV links|Liberty GB|xfd_page=|article=}}
Page has been deleted twice. First time because created by a banned user. Fair enough. Person deleting was contacted when I wanted to create (I was not aware a deletion had previously been made) and raised no objection to me creating the page - I supplied a draft. On trying to create, it had been deleted again, so I contacted second person who deleted. I reproduce below records of both conversations which I believe cover my points. What I want to create is this: [[User:Emeraude/temp]]

'''''From [[User talk:Sphilbrick#Liberty GB]]'''''

:'''Liberty GB'''

:I want to create a page on Liberty GB or Liberty Great Britain. However, I note form the page creation details that you have previously deleted such a page ("13:32, 6 February 2014 Sphilbrick  deleted page Liberty GB (G5: Creation by a banned or blocked user in violation of ban or block)") and that "If you are creating a new page with different content, please continue. If you are recreating a page similar to the previously deleted page, or are unsure, please first contact the deleting administrator." Obvious at it may seem, I have absolutely no way of knowing if what I want to do is similar or not since it has been deleted. I would guess that it is, though, the same subject. I have no idea who the previous creator was and, naturally, therefore have no connections with them. A draft of what I am proposing is on my own page - [[User:Emeraude/temp]] - perhaps you'd take a look and give an opinion . Thanks. Emeraude 13:33, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::User:Emeraude - Thanks for contacting me, and sorry for the delay, I have been out of town for two days and just returned. I only glanced at the draft, I was more interested in looking at who was creating it. The concern is to make sure that some sockpuppet isn't trying to force some material by creating a new account and starting it over again. While I'm not aware that we have crossed ppaths before, it is abundantly obvious you are not a sockpuppet, so I'm fine with the draft page.--[[User:Sphilbrick|<span style="color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">S Philbrick</span>]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|<span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span>]] 21:02, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Many thanks. Emeraude(talk) 08:50, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''LibertyGB'''
:Appears that somebody has recreated [[Liberty GB]] after deletion on the back of a single not notable election period headline grabber. I'll redo the deletion thing as soon as, but like YOURVoice from earlier this month, we're looking at a micro grouplet looking for publicity in the run up to next month's elections... [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 21:10, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::Regarding the multiple deletions and [[WP:SALT|salting]] of [[Liberty GB]] and the likely deletion of [[Paul Weston (politician)]], may I suggest that the pages be redirected to [[British Freedom Party]] instead? Cheers. [[User:Ivanvector|Ivanvector]] ([[User talk:Ivanvector|talk]]) 21:59, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:Cheers RHaworth. [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 07:53, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:::I don't think that's good enough. The original was deleted by [[User:Sphilbrick]] because and only because it was created by a banned user. I only found out when I tried to create the article myself. As per procedure, I contacted him to get approval to recreate the article, having no idea who the original editor was or what the article said ( see [[User talk:Sphilbrick#Liberty GB]]). I supplied a link to my draft version ([[User:Emeraude/temp]]). Sphilbrick agreed that the article was only deleted because of who it was created by and there was no reason why I could not do it. But when I came to do so, I see that you have deleted another attempt (though I do not know what it said). [[User:Doktorbuk|Doktorbuk]] is close when he describes Liberty GB as a grouplet; but so what. The party has attracted widespread coverage with what is probably a well-rehearsed stunt, but it is nevertheless a party contesting an election at national (or rather, international) level. In years to come, the articles on the European 2014 election, on the South East constituency and others are going to mention Liberty GB, and readers will have no way of knowing what they are/were and no way of finding out from this Encyclopaedia. I write as a (retired) political scientist; I am frequently frustrated by Wikipedia's and other sources' coverage of politics, elections especially, where I have no way of knowing what the parties mentioned stand for or who was involved. The fact is, there is very little to say about this group, but it needs to be said somewhere, and to suggest it is redirected to British Freedom Party rather misses the point that this is not the British Freedom Party! I request that you reconsider. Emeraude (talk) 09:12, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:::* I deleted [[Liberty GB]] for lack of notability. It receives only passing mention in the BFP article so there is no justification for a redirect. If you disagree, raise the matter at [[WP:DRV|DRV]]. &mdash; [[User:RHaworth|RHaworth]] ([[User talk:RHaworth|talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/RHaworth|contribs]]) 09:24, 1 May 2014 (UTC) 

(I'm not sure I really understand that last mention of redirect.) [[User:Emeraude|Emeraude]] ([[User talk:Emeraude|talk]]) 10:02, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::{{ec}}The mention of redirect is {{ul|RHaworth}}'s response to my request that the page be made a redirect to [[British Freedom Party]], because the founder of the former was a member (and also founder?) of the latter. See just above {{ul|Doktorbuk}}'s second comment. This is mentioned on BFP's page (in passing) so I believe this would be an appropriate redirect. I don't really think Liberty GB is notable by our standards to the point of having its own page. [[User:Ivanvector|Ivanvector]] ([[User talk:Ivanvector|talk]]) 18:40, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I understand what you wrote: I don't understand why RHaworth says ''here'' there is no justification for a redirect when I didn't suggest there should be. [[User:Emeraude|Emeraude]] ([[User talk:Emeraude|talk]]) 10:00, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:A lot of parties are mentioned at election time, but candidature does not mean automatic notability. For quite obvious reasons, we don't exist as a Politics Wikia, here to provide every outfit with a free advertising space. Far from being a significant part of these elections, Liberty GB only come with publicity related to one person's arrest. The attempted article had bullet points lifted directly from their own website, no third party evidence of importance, and no proof of notability beyond one event. There's no reason to presume otherwise this side of polling day. If future politics students want to know about the party they'd not be very good students relying on Wikipedia. [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 19:04, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

The group is the news (BBC, Telegraph, Daily Mail, Fox News etc. etc.) I can see no reason why it is fully protected? At the very least it should be redirected to the group's chairman or to the prior party he founded. As noted above, we're an encyclopedia and it's frustrating that information on an active political group in an upcoming election is being censored. They have three candidates in the election. There's an article on the prior group the chairman founded. I can see how there might be some debate as to how BEST to cover the group, but obliterating it out of all existence and fully protecting the page is just an abuse. Another of the candidates in the party has an entire article on him in Vice. And I believe the third candidate has also been covered in the media. I get that the party is anti-immigration, anti-Islamic, and anti-European union, but we cover lots of unsavory topics. We're not ostriches and we're not SUPPOSED to be censored. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 18:19, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::I might add that it seems that there is a move to delete the article on the party's leader as well. I can live with that: candidates are never as prominent as the party. But regardless that there is involvement in the upcoming European election (and may also be in by elections and next year's general election) where is the information in ten years' time for students trying to understand the elections of today if it never gets here in the first place? [[User:Emeraude|Emeraude]] ([[User talk:Emeraude|talk]]) 18:35, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Notability is supposed to be enduring, if you are suggesting that in 10 years no one else will actually care and have eradicated any information, then you are concluding they are really non-notable. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, if the secondary sources aren't covering this for those students, then wikipedia isn't usable anyway. --[[Special:Contributions/86.2.216.5|86.2.216.5]] ([[User talk:86.2.216.5|talk]]) 06:24, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::: An excellent contribution. I have been using Wikipedia during various elections over ten years or more. We get this sort of thing often; parties wanting an article as part of their publicity and campaigning. If they get results or make a significant social impact, they'll get a page. [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 06:33, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::::There is some misunderstanding or misrepresentation of what is being said. Firstly, it is not the party wanting an article - it's me! (And I have no connection.) Secondly, I am not trying to reinstate what has been deleted - I haven't even seen it because, surprise, surprise, it was deleted! Thirdly, I am not suggesting that in ten years time no one else will actually care - quite the opposite, or at least, in ten years time there will be no way to find out what Liberty GB is when you read the name in other Wikipedia articles or are attempting research on the 2014 Euro elctions or analysing the history of the crumbling of fascist and right wing groups. Fourthly, this whole issue is about Wikipedia eradicating the information. Sixthly(?), I am not asking for the original(s) to be reinstated; I am quite clearly asking that the ban on the title be removed so that [[User:Emeraude/temp|the article I have written]] can be put in. (Has anyone read it? ) &ndash; [[User:Emeraude|Emeraude]] ([[User talk:Emeraude|talk]]) 10:00, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Endorse''' my deletion. Fielding a candidate in any UK election is simply not evidence of notability. Even the [[User:Emeraude/temp|new version]] is too thin on independent references (pun intended). &mdash; [[User:RHaworth|RHaworth]] ([[User talk:RHaworth|talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/RHaworth|contribs]]) 10:13, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::WHAT?? ''Searchlight'', Electoral Commission, ''The Independent'', ''The Telegraph'', UK Polling Report, ''BBC News''. Not independent sources??? [[User:Emeraude|Emeraude]] ([[User talk:Emeraude|talk]]) 11:11, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::: Sources for a one off event, the arrest, but nothing to prove the substantial nature of the party. [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 11:38, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::::WHAT?? AGAIN!! ''Searchlight'' and Electoral Commission predate this stunt by more than a year; ''The Independent'' by more than two years. UK Polling Report predates it; neither it nor the Liberty GB page cited mention it. ''The Telegraph'' and ''BBC News'' are about it, but only the latter is cited in connection with it. [[User:Emeraude|Emeraude]] ([[User talk:Emeraude|talk]]) 11:03, 3 May 2014 (UTC) 

*'''Overturn''' and '''Allow recreation''' for the obvious reasons passes GnG and npov. Whatever issues existed prior has been resolved. The userfied version follows the proper manual of style. DRV in my opinion is a cleaner better place for such debates. Even though the close was proper this article should not be barred from recreation.

*''temporarily restored for discussion at Deletion Review ''~
*'''Overturn incorrect speedy-- AfD optional'''. The A7 speedy was not valid . A political party in any country that actually fields candidate has at least a reasonable claim to significance or importance, so it passes A7. Whether or not it passes AfD needs to be determined at AfD, not here. Contrary to what is asserted above, I think a political party fielding candidates will always be notable --those rejected at AfD have been ones that do not actually get to that stage.  But this is for the community to decide, not an individual admin. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 16:46, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Overturn deletion and [[WP:SALT|desalinize]]'''; replace content with [[User:Emeraude/temp|Emeraude's version]] which treats the group properly for our purposes. I agree with DGG's assessment of the group's notability but the deleted content was hardly sourced at all except to the group's own website, which is inappropriate. Probably the group is only newsworthy because of the recent arrest of its leader but it is nonetheless fielding candidates in a national election, which based on our [[List of British far right groups since 1945]] seems to satisfy our community precedent for inclusion. With much due respect to RHaworth, A7 was inappropriate here as the page clearly asserts the group's notability. [[User:Ivanvector|Ivanvector]] ([[User talk:Ivanvector|talk]]) 21:56, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Disallow recreation''' – note that this is separate from ''Endorse''. I would probably argue for a merge into Weston's biography given that the party is pretty much a vanity party for him and independent notability is very thin on the ground. Also note: The Roman Party, which also don't have an article, have fielded one more European candidate than Liberty. '''[[User:Sceptre|Sceptre]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Sceptre|talk]])</sup> 02:13, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::[[WP:OTHERCRAPDOESNTEXIST]] is never a valid argument we look at RS and GNG.

::Actually, The Roman Party. Ave! appears to have only one candidate, a bus driver who has run before [http://www.folkestoneherald.co.uk/Roman-Party-AVE/story-21034899-detail/story.html article].

*'''Overturn''' there are sources that count toward [[WP:N]] so A7 does not apply. Such sources are an assertion of importance. [[User:Hobit|Hobit]] ([[User talk:Hobit|talk]]) 23:52, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
