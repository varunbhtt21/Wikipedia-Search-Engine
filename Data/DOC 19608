Captain '''Richard Saher de Quincey''' ("the Captain") (b.1897, [[Surbiton]], Surrey{{cn|date=April 2014}} - d.1965, Hertfordshire) was a noted British cattle breeder.

De Quincey fought in World War I as a fighter pilot in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] but was invalided out of the service as result of the effects of flying at high altitude.

De Quincy's father bought The Vern - a farm at [[Bodenham]] - in 1922. The farm came with a herd of [[Hereford cattle]] which the younger de Quincey successfully improved, his bulls winning many prizes and export markets.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bodenham Parish Plan | work= | date= | url=http://www.alphadocs.co.uk/bpc/noticeboard/CLP-ActionPlan(Final).pdf | format=pdf | accessdate= 30 April 2014}}</ref>
