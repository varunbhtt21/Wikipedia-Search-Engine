On August 26, 1978, the hospital's board of directors voted to phase out the hospital due to financial problems. On August 30, the Public Health Department asked the hospital not to admit any new patients, perform any non-emergency surgeries, and discontinue emergency operations due to numerous deficiencies, including deficiencies in the hospital's nursing care.<ref name=Closing>{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=Jean|title=Saugus Hospital is closing|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 31, 1978}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19803547BR347_1249.xml/IN%20RE%20SAUGUS%20GENERAL%20HOSPITAL,%20INC.|title=In Re Saugus General Hospital, Inc.|publisher=Leagle|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> On September 1, the hospital filed for bankruptcy.
