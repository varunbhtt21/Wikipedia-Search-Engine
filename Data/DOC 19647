Apparently non-notable writer, does not meet [[WP:ARTIST]]. Like many writers, she has written books; like many of those, she has been published. Neither in itself constitutes notability.

*'''Keep''' The LA Times article is one exapmle of the very substantial coverage of this and her work. The award is also significant (perhaps not enough on its own, but it adds to notability).

*'''Keep ''' Per [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]]. The [[Agatha Award]] is prestigious and significant.  With the LA Times her notability has been established.  [[User:JSFarman|JSFarman]] ([[User talk:JSFarman|talk]]) 17:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Meets 4(c) of [[WP:ARTIST]] as the recipient of an Agatha Award. [[User:Gobonobo|<font face="DejaVu Sans" color="333300">gobonobo</font>]] [[User_talk:Gobonobo|<sup>+</sup>]] [[Special:Contributions/Gobonobo|<sup>c</sup>]] 02:33, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
