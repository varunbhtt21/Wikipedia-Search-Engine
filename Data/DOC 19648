'''Welicoruss''' is a Russian [[Symphonic black metal|symphonic black metal music]] band from [[Novosibirsk|Novosibirsk, Russia]], formed in 2005. Welicoruss is often confused with a Pagan bands but they have nothing relative to pagan nor paganism! Their lyrics are amongst the lines of Theosophy, [[Philosophy]] the [[Western esotericism|Esoteric subjects]] and the [[Occult]]. The band's activity increased in 2015 right when the 3rd album ''"Az Esm'"'' was released, after the move to Europe.

==Concept==

Welicoruss delivers dark, intense and mystic sound that demonstrates how to impressively unite the contemporary metal with the dim and distant ethereal, combined with epic classical/orchestrated music. Their music recreates the icy cold atmosphere, expressing both natural feelings and personal perception of the Ancient Philosophies through their lyrics. Welicoruss reflects in their compositions their admiration of [[nature]] and search for the hidden mysteries of the secret Powers that rule the Universe.

==Biography==
===Formation===
Initially founded as a solo project by Alexey Boganov in 2002, several demos were self-produced early on before becoming a full band in 2005. The first full-length album, called "''WinterMoon Symphony''",<ref name="CD-Maximum, (WMS)">[http://www.cd-maximum.ru/index.php?hid=46278 Label website #01], Catalog listing for "WinterMoon Symphony".</ref> was released in 2008 and their second album, ''"Apeiron"'',<ref name="CD-Maximum, (Apeiron)">[http://www.cd-maximum.ru/index.php?hid=46807 Label website #02], Catalog listing for "''Apeiron''".</ref> followed shortly after in 2009. Both albums were released on the major Russian label CD-Maximum, before the band broke the contract with their label in 2009.

===The Early Years===
Welicoruss was one of the first Symphonic Black Metal to roam in Siberia, Russia. Being pioneers at Symphonic Black Metal in Russia, Welicoruss grew extremely fast reaching out throughout the whole of Russia. The first album "''WinterMoon Symphony''", made such a huge impact in the scene that Welicoruss got invited to play on one stage with many bands like [[Gorgoroth]], [[Samael (band)|Samael]], [[Moonspell]], [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]], etc.

The band received a huge recognition from all the Metal Magazines and was featured in many issues (examples: issue #47) of the Russian print publication ''Dark City Magazine'', gaining them further recognition.<ref>"WelicoRuss – «великорусское» блэк-просвещение". ''Dark City Magazine'', Issue #47, November/December, Pg. 62</ref> In 2009 the band did their first Headlining tour throughout a huge part of Russia, making Welicoruss one of the first Symphonic Black Metal bands to tour Russia, if not ''one of the first'' bands in this genre that toured Russia. The tour was named ''"WinterMoon Symphony Tour"'' and the tour was a little bit over 11.000&nbsp;km long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metal-radio.ru/sp/143|title=WELICORUSS - WINTERMOON SYMPHONY TOUR|website=metal-radio.ru|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref> Right after the tour the band also performed with the legendary [[Norway|Norse]] [[Viking metal|Viking black metal]] band, [[Helheim (band)|Helheim]] in 2009.

Little bit later the band was contacted by a big list of labels from Europe (mostly German and Austrian) & America too. But the band decided not take any offers as they didn't find the offers appealing and it didn't make much sense for the band to switch to other label. In 2009 Welicoruss released their 2nd album entitled ''"Apeiron"'' which shown a completely different feeling than the previous album. On the second album Welicoruss digs really deep in the Melodic, Epic and also a [[Death metal|Death Metal]] vibe. Some magazines were also writing that the second album had a lot of [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Sonata Arctica]] feeling to it. Naturally the album ''"Apeiron"'' did feel more death, melodic/death and power, while still resonating that Welicrouss symphonic epic sound.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stormbringer.at/reviews/5277/welicoruss-apeiron.html|title=|last=Manuel|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-25|language=de-de}}</ref>

As the success was growing in Russia, you can find people and different artists across the whole of Russia using Welicoruss music for theatrical, ballet and other kind of cultural performances. The symphonic element that Welicoruss delivers didn't only capture the metal-heads but also all the other music listeners out there. One of those videos can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHXpFNT5BKk here]. Not only that but the leader of the band Alexey Boganov was invited to the Nation Russian TV to introduce his band and to inform the public more about Black Metal and how the scene is taking place in the whole of Russia. The video with the interview can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O7yAqnhpfU here].

On July 31, 2011 the band released an EP entitled "''Kharnha''", which consisted of four new songs and an orchestral version of the track Kharnha. As soon as this release has seen the light of the day it was clear that the band's sound was getting a tighter grip and slowly forming into something that Welicoruss has been developing for years. Right after the EP release labels didn't rest and continued to write Welicoruss and after all the offers the band decided in October 2011 to sign a '''[[distribution deal]]''' with the America-based record label [[Domestic Genocide Records]].<ref name="Domestic Genocide Records">[http://domesticgenocide.bandcamp.com/album/wintermoon-symphony Welicoruss Signs With Domestic Genocide Records], News.</ref> The band thought it would be a great start to expand its horizons to America and also start to look for new fans outside of Russia too.

On December 12 of 2011 Welicoruss presented their new music video for [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne_Y5hLNOlc "''Kharnha''"] at "Rock City Club" in [[Novosibirsk]]. The video was shot by Imperium Studios under the direction of Alexander Tsurupa and Alexander Semko and features classic Russian-Scandinavian themes with the participation of the [[Historical reenactment|historical reconstruction]] group "Steel Fist" and model Sofia Sonador.

In November 2012 the new videoclip [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgdmxBFgJQA&list=PLXqdAcohQnuqarkrn6SxadFMOhlTu1PDu “''Sons of the North''”] was published, directed by Alexey Boganov and shot by “''EYE Cinema''” studio.

===Move to Europe===
After sometime Welicoruss gained a pioneer reputation in Russia, Alexey Boganov started considering moving to Europe and creating a new life for Welicoruss. Such opportunity appeared only because Welicoruss has reached its peak in the Symphonic Black Metal scene in Russia. The band had literally nowhere to grow and if it did want to see a bigger future, the only possibility was to move to Europe. After a long discussion the band members came to no agreement and none of them wanted to leave Russia.

Right at his arrival to Prague, In the autumn of 2013 he meet the Serbian guitarist Gojko Marić. Gojko was found at pretty much the same situation with his band and also other personal life situations, where he decided to move to Central Europe and form a band of his own in the style of Symphonic Black Metal and start touring all over Europe. After some talking, the two decided to work together continuing the project of Welicoruss. Where by the beginning of 2014, the two have already found rest of the band members and formed the band once again, in its new form.

During the preparation of the new long-awaited album that was postponed due to the band's move to Europe, the band came to a minor change. Where Alexey Boganov has left the guitar out as his performing duty to focus on singing and stage performance and at the same time having one guitar would allow the band to created a perfect sonic clarity they were looking to deliver.

In the middle of 2014, Welicoruss was invited to play their first European shows with [[Arkona (band)|Arkona]]. In 2014 the band was not that active live but they a very little number of shows as they were finalizing, recording, mixing & mastering their third up-coming album ''"Az Esm'"''.

The band was unfortunately completely unknown in Europe but its uniqueness and distinct Symphonic style infused with Black Metal started to pull peoples attention and they got invited to participate on the [http://www.madeofmetal.cz/kapely.html “''Made of Metal''”] as a very special act and [http://www.facebook.com/UnderDarkMoon “''Under the Dark Moon''”] as a co-headliner act in [[Czech Republic]].

== Road To Success ==
[[File:Welicoruss Wave-Gotik-Treffen 2017 15.jpg|thumb|374.965x374.965px|Welicoruss performing as one of the headliners on the [http://www.wave-gotik-treffen.de/english/ Wave Gotik Treffen Festival] . ]]
Starting new, ready and fresh Welicoruss on the 31st of January releases their new, long-awaited album ''"Az Esm'"'' which in ancient Russian means "I am". The band also decided that this time, for the first time they will release an album without a label. Due to a lot of '''distrust''' and '''dissatisfaction''' they went completely DIY. Also due to that fact the promotional campaign was not done the correct & experienced way but rather in an indigent and absolutely underground way.

=== 2015 ===
The band was working hard and booked around 60 shows in 2015, playing as many as towns as possible. The band started quite fast to gain popularity in the underground scene and invited to play in [[Serbia]] on the Legendary [[Exit (festival)|Exit Festival]]. This was the band's first live show performed with fire on stage. Welicoruss also got invited to play on the [https://www.wolfszeit-festival.de/ Wolfszeit Festival] to present their new album "Az Esm'", which echoed hugely among the German fans. They were invited to play on the Slovakian [http://www.gothoom.com/festival/ Gothoom Festival]. By the end of the 2015, Welicoruss managed to share stage with bands such as:  [[Septicflesh|Septic Flesh]], [[Insomnium]], [[Agalloch]], [[Napalm Death]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Root (band)|Root]], [[Therion (band)|Therion]], [[Haggard (band)|Haggard]], [[Ensiferum]], [[Alestorm]], [[Amaranthe]], [[Heidevolk]], [[Dream Evil]], [[Sirenia (band)|Sirenia]], and many more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.cz/search?q=made+of+metal+2014&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivme3jvtTaAhURmbQKHe5GB8MQ_AUICigB&biw=1680&bih=919#imgrc=zh4dHH8ukTU8GM:|title=made of metal 2014 - Google Search|website=www.google.cz|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>

The band looked for other ways to expand their popularity and promote themselves further! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeZuWonySng Here] is one of the TV commercial which was rotating on the Czech Television and Welicoruss's constant appearance on the Radio's across the whole Europe was unstoppable. And as a chary on the top the band released their new video clip entitled after the album "Az Esm'". Which showed the true face of Welicoruss, the real progressiveness and vastness to compose different music and deliver different ideas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bandzone.cz/welicorussofficial?at=news|title=Welicoruss|website=Bandzone.cz|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>

=== 2016 ===
The band got invited to play more shows and as a result, booking around 80 shows and reaching new countries and towns they have never played before. Reaching a new public and a great number of fans, the ''[https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Welicoruss/The_Best_of_Welicoruss_%5BSymphonic_Black_Metal_from_the_Coldest_Depths_of_Siberia%5D/662020 "Best of" Compilation CD]'' was released. The CD featured 6 best songs, yet very different sounding and showing the band's skills to compose very progressive sounding music. A big fuss started being spread around about Welicoruss and their music, as people just loved their music and their live presents ! The band gained a reputation of a "Siberian Black Metal" band! Thus the ''"Best of CD"'' was entitled '''"Symphonic Black Metal From The Coldest Depths of Siberia"''' which was printed in 20.000 copies! <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Welicoruss/The_Best_of_Welicoruss_%5BSymphonic_Black_Metal_from_the_Coldest_Depths_of_Siberia%5D/662020|title=Google Image Result for http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/c210.0.540.540/13671815_1402260049800425_309827526_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMxNjIwNjg4NDE5Nzc1ODYyMw%3D%3D.2.c|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.cz|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>

=== 2017 ===
2017 was one of the most turbulent but yet important years for the development of the band Welcoruss, as said by Gojko Marić.<ref>{{Citation|last=T1Mastr|title=Interview - Gojko Marić from Welicoruss|date=2018-01-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-gREA0DQDs&t=2s|accessdate=2018-04-25}}</ref> Just two years in, touring in Europe. Welicoruss decided to go on their first co-headlining tour together with a German band [https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Wolves_Den/3540394793 Wolves Den], which consist of two former [[Equilibrium (band)|Equilibrium]] members: Manuel DiCamillo & Helge Stang. The tour was entitled "Darkness Descents Tour" which consisted of 25 dates, almost a whole month. The band's success is reaching a great position in the underground at this moment, as their 20.000 printed CD of the Best of are almost gone, they decided to print another 20.000 CD's. To push their success and to reach an audience of 40,000 across the whole continent of Europe. This is the also the year that Welicoruss got invited and performed on the biggest metal festival in the metal-world [http://www.hellfest.fr/en/ Hellfest] and the band had around 120 booked shows.<ref>{{Citation|last=WELICORUSSofficial|title=Interview with WELICORUSS for OLIMANAGEMENT 05/02/17 /Regensburg, Germany/|date=2017-02-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1HyoCXAJI&t=8s|accessdate=2018-04-25}}</ref>

Right after the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PM4ozNKVOg Hellfest performance] their bassist decided to leave the band, because of the mutual disagreement and personal reasons inside the band. Leading the band under a lot of pressure for them to find another member and also prepare his for another 60 or shows they had left to perform till the end of 2017. Shortly after their drummer "Ilya Tabacnik" had a medical operation which was a possibly near death experience, because if they have not operated he could have died. After the wait over the operation the band was preparing and composing their new album but the studio they have with all of their gear and everything got flooded, ending up as a total catastrophe. It ended as a total disaster for the band forcing them to stop composing and repair all of their instruments and the studio. Shortly during this period there were some mentions about them having problems with a van too, and needing to buy a new one.<ref>{{Citation|last=T1Mastr|title=Interview - Gojko Marić from Welicoruss|date=2018-01-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-gREA0DQDs&t=2s|accessdate=2018-04-25}}</ref>

=== 2018 ===
In April the band officially announced that they are still composing the new album, entitled ''"'''Siberian Heathen Horde"''''' and that they are slowly finalizing that process. The band is also continuing its intense ''"live performance reputation" and'' a lot of shows will be featuring few of the tracks of the up-coming album.<ref>{{Citation|last=WELICORUSSofficial|title=WELICORUSS "Siberian Heathen Horde" Release party|date=2018-04-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAdT22R0cPE|accessdate=2018-04-25}}</ref>
