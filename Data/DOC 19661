Upon its release, ''Daily Conversation'' was met with favorable reviews from [[Music criticism|music critic]]s. Guido Stern of RapReviews wrote, "While it's probably wise of Torae to keep this as an unofficial first album, it's as impressive a compilation of new music as nearly anyone is releasing in the hip-hop capitol. It may not be heat from start to finish but its lows are not very low at all. If Torae keeps his connections in check and continues to push the bar of his flow and lyrical content, there's no doubt we'll be talking about him again very soon."<ref name=Rap/> HipHopDX reviewer J-23 wrote, "''Daily Conversation'' may not be blazing from front to back, but it also has weak spots that aren't really weak - just not quite up to par with the rest. Torae has long shown his gift for rhyming and now proves his ear for beats to be as good and consistent as his bars."<ref name=HHDX/> D.T. Swinga of HipHopSite.Com wrote, "While Torae has his standout moments on ''Daily Conversation'', at fifteen tracks, there is plenty of room for filler, and it does drag on from time-to-time. If this was his actual 'album', we may have seen a more trim, tightly knit endeavor, but because it's the 'mixtape-album', it's to be expected. While Tor is looked at as a 'beast' by his peers, his appeal lies in his delivery and swagger, rather than lyrical complexity or profound content. Nevertheless, what we have here is an impressive debut, and a sign of great things to come."<ref name=HHS/>
