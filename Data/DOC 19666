==Critical reception==
''Indiaglitz'' wrote "Debutante director R.S. Raja has tried to present 'Maanga' as a film with loads of fun and horror elements though the film cannot be fixed under the 'Horror-comedy' genre. The film also apparently aims to be considered as a science fiction but everything related to the scientific invention of the lead character is presented in a funny way. So one could not be clear whether the intention of such scenes was dealing with science or making us laugh".<ref>http://www.indiaglitz.com/maanga-tamil-movie-review-17375.html</ref> ''The Times of India'' wrote "The film feels like a hodgepodge of movie references, bad science, and lazily written jokes put together in a manner that is hardly competent".<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/Maanga/movie-review/48945259.cms</ref>
