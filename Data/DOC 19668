*'''Delete''' per lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. I can't find anything substantial about this supposed group of churches. I tried searching it scurrent name, former name and the name of its supposed founder. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 15:04, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Not finding coverage in any reliable sources, just directory listing-types of webpages. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 16:04, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
