'''''Luther''''' is an [[People of the United States|American]] syndicated newspaper [[comic strip]] published from 1968 to 1986, created and produced by [[cartoonist]] [[Brumsic Brandon Jr.]] The series, about an [[African-American]] [[elementary-school]] child, was the second mainstream comic strip to star an African-American in the lead role, following ''[[Dateline: Danger!]]'' (1968-1974), the first to do so. Another predecessor, ''[[Wee Pals]]'' (1965-2014), featured an African-American among an ensemble cast of different races and ethnicities.

==Critical analysis==
Cartoon historian [[Maurice Horn]] wrote that, "Although his gags were often about racism, Brandon was also successful in using his nicely designed urban inner-city kids to get his message of racial equality across."<ref name="horn" />

The African-American artist and essayist Oliver W. Harrington wrote in 1976<ref name=charlesjohnson>{{cite book | title= I Call Myself an Artist: Writings by and about Charles Johnson | first= Charles Richard| last=Johnson | first2=Rudolph P., ed. | last2= Byrd | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtAUCalQz0IC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=luther+(comic+strip)+brumsic&source=bl&ots=1VDs37epWf&sig=Qh8kiHMW314KrNXfzBcQp0JxZYc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U9JhU5uiKKjQsQTTzoGACg&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=luther%20(comic%20strip)%20brumsic&f=false 208] | publisher=  [[Indiana University Press]] | year=1999 | isbn = 978-0253335418}}</ref> that with ''Luther'',

{{quote|The cartoonist is actually violating what has always been an American taboo, and that is to create non-white characters or even poor white characters who are human, sympathetic and even lovable. Brandon employs his irresistible humor to level the walls of racism. And what better stage setting could he devise than the schools and the kids they're trying to educate.<ref>{{cite book| first=Oliver W. | last=Harrington | title=Why I Left America, and Other Essays | publisher= [[University Press of Mississippi]] | year= 1993 | page=87 | isbn = 978-0878056552}}</ref>}}

<!--from Oakland Local: Based on his social criticism, Brandon was invited to serve (and served) as a forum member of the White House Conference on Children in 1970. Brandon also wrote and illustrated several Luther segments for the children’s television show “Vegetable Soup” and “Bebop Fables” (which was narrated by Dizzy Gillespie). Later, Brandon created editorial cartoons for Florida Today. Many of his cartoons were included in “Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year” from 1996 through 2003.
