Unlikely search term [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_%280%29&oldid=483348335 created as a fork] of [[MissingNo]].

*'''Retarget to [[MissingNo.]]''' or '''Delete''': There is nontrivial history, but it doesn't appear to have been used elsewhere in Wikipedia, so no copyright concerns.  Missingno makes more sense as a target, but I could also see deleting it outright.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  02:47, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

Not notable at all. [[User:Pelliesh|Pelliesh]] ([[User talk:Pelliesh|talk]]) 18:38, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Weak delete''' - Not discussed by name in the target, but related information is present there, and it could be explicitly named with minimal editing.  Notability is irrelevant to redirects.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  19:22, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Take to [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Pokémon]]''', per BDD yesterday with French-language redirects to Pokémon. We have a lot of Pokémon redirects coming up lately and [[User:BDD is going to take them as a batch to see what their opinion is.

*How is this even a discussion, oh my god!? This was a troll article set up during the [[Twitch Plays Pokémon]] phenomenon, just redirect it to there. Bureaucracy at its absolute worst joke level here. [[User:Andre666|Andre666]] ([[User talk:Andre666|talk]]) 20:24, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
::Mark Arsten doesn't seem like the type to make a "troll article," though I see he's on an indefinite break. Also, it's already redirecting to [[Twitch Plays Pokémon]]; does that mean you want it to be kept? --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 22:40, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' - This is a meme associated with [[Twitch Plays Pokémon]].  While the actual words "Cult of the Helix" isn't in the Twitch Plays Pokémon article, the meme is described there (the part in the "viewership and reception" section that talks about the Helix Fossil).  Since the subject of the redirect is described at the target article, the redirect seems useful. [[User:Calathan|Calathan]] ([[User talk:Calathan|talk]]) 15:04, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' since it is indeed described within the target article. However, can a more pokemon-savvy editor insert the phrase within the article? I think non-pokemon players can understand it better that way. --[[User:Lenticel|<span style="color: teal; font-weight: bold">Lenticel</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Lenticel|<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold">talk</span>]])</sup> 08:39, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

Retarget to a broader title, or turn into its own disambiguation page. Surely there are national awards for areas other than film. [[User:BD2412|<font style="background:gold">'''''bd2412'''''</font>]] [[User talk:BD2412|'''T''']] 00:23, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:*'''Delete'''. For once I hit the jackpot. Searching (with Wikipedia's search engine) for "List of state awards" brings up in this order:
::* [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of Russia]] (R [[Awards and decorations of the Russian Federation]])
::* [[List of honours of Malaysia awarded to heads of state and royals#Awards]]
::* [[List of orders and medals of Thailand#Medals for services to the State]]
::* [[List of honours of Kedah awarded to heads of state and royals#Awards]]
::* [[List of honours of Norway awarded to heads of state and royals]]
::* [[List of honours of Austria awarded to heads of state and royals#Awards]]
::* [[List of honours of Perlis awarded to heads of state and royals#Awards]]
::* [[Václav Havel#State awards]]
::* [[List of honours of Brunei awarded to heads of state and royals#Awards]]
::* [[List of honours of Netherlands awarded to heads of state and royals#Awards]]

...{{lang|la|''etc cetera ad nauseaum''}}. There seems to be a pattern here with these lists and I am disappointed to see [[Elizabeth II]] doesn't even make the Top 10, coming in at No 13 with [[List of honours of the British Crown awarded to heads of state and royals]].

::Now these seem to follow a pattern presumably dictated by [[WikiProject:Monarchy]] or some such, but that is what comes up on my search. We ''could'' put in a list of lists but that is what the search engine is already doing. Hence, we have comprensive lists of awards for almost every country and this redirect should be [[considered harmful]]. Admittedly, these are lists of awards ''to'' the heads of state and royals rather than ''by'' them to [[hoi polloi]], but I agree with BD2412 that national awards tend to be broader than just the flicks. '''I put in state awards not national awards''', I will try that next but don't want to flood RfD with needlessly multiplied examples.

*'''Comment'''. A WP search (not external search) for "List of national awards" brings up, in the top ten:

:* [[List of National Hockey League awards]]
:* [[List of winners of the National Book Award]] (R [[List of winners of the National Book Awards]])
:* [[List of National Film Award records]] (R National Awards Records)
:**Perhaps [[National Awards Records]], should be considered together with this R [[National Award]].
:* [[List of National Basketball Association awards]]
:* [[List of U.S. high school basketball national player of the year awards]]
:* [[List of awards and nominations received by National Film and Television School]]
:* [[2004 National Society of Film Critics Awards nominees]]
:* [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer]] (this is a list article and marked as such but the title is not prefixed "List of": nothing says it should be; the nation in question is India)
:* [[Nandi Awards]] (R [[B.N.Reddy National Award]])
:* [[National Film Award for Best Screenplay]]
:* [[Discontinued and Intermittent National Film Awards]]
:* [[59th National Film Awards]]
:* [[National Basketball Association#Awards]]
:* [[Mrinal Sen#National awards]]
:* [[List of WNBL Awards]]

:...{{lang|la|et cetera ad nauseaum ad infinitum}}. There ''does'' seem more a preponderance of film awards in the "national" results than in the "state" results, but by no means is one country's national film awards particularly predominant &ndash; if anything, the Indian subcontinent seems to have the edge in the search results (but I haven't been counting the stats).

:It would seem to me, then, there is no primary topic for  [[National Award]] (and no {{tlx|R from alternate capitalization}} at [[National award]], thankfully). There's no point in creating a DAB for what the search engine copes with perfectly well. For those reasons, it should be '''Delete'''d to let the search engine deal with it.

*'''Delete''' per [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]]'s findings.--[[User:Lenticel|<span style="color: teal; font-weight: bold">Lenticel</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Lenticel|<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold">talk</span>]])</sup> 08:54, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - per Si Trew. This name is not unique to the target; in fact someone who types in "National Award" is very unlikely to be looking for this particular target. And no other target suggests itself.  --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 21:30, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
