Title : San Francesco, Gubbio
Text : '''''San Francesco''''' is a medieval [[Roman Catholic]] church in the lower town of [[Gubbio]], [[Umbria]], in Italy. 

[[St Francis of Assisi]], who was closely associated with Gubbio, supposedly was once housed in a room adjacent to the church. Tradition holds that the site belonged to Giacomello Spadalunga, who clothed St Francis after his encounter with robber.

The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style church was built by 1256, and decoration was completed by 1291. The present octagonal bell tower was constructed in the 14th century. The interior was reconstructed in the 18th century, though the church contains some of the original faded fresco work from the 15th century.

[[Ottaviano Nelli]] painted a series of frescoes, mainly depicting the ''Story of the Virgin Mary'' (circa 1410-1415). The center apse has a fresco of ''Christ blessing with four saints'' by an anonymous late 13th century painter. Other 14th century frescoes can be found throughout the church and adjacent convent. The church has an altarpiece depicting the ''Immaculate Conception'' by [[Antonio Gherardi]] of Rieti. It contains a ''St Francis before a cross'' (1540) by [[Benedetto Nucci]], and the sacristy has a ''Virgin and child with serpent'' by Benedict's son, Virgilio.

Under the altar of San Carlo Boromeo are the remains of a blessed nun of a Franciscan order, Franceschina, who died in July 6, 1255 returning from Assisi.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=oo4KAAAAIAAJ Gubbio, Past & Present] By Laura McCracken; (1908) pages 197-200.</ref><ref>[http://www.comune.gubbio.pg.it/Principali_Monumenti/Chiesa_di_San_Francesco.aspx Commune of Gubbio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429112028/http://www.comune.gubbio.pg.it/Principali_Monumenti/Chiesa_di_San_Francesco.aspx |date=2014-04-29 }}, entry on church. </ref>
