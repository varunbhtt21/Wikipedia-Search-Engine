* '''Support as nominator''' – [[User:Geni|©Geni]] ([[User talk:Geni|talk]]) 23:58, 30 April 2014 (UTC) 
*'''Oppose''' - I feel it is not sharp enough and shadow on the right of the ship is slightly distracting. Sorry. [[User:Nikhilb239|Nikhil]] ([[User talk:Nikhilb239|talk]]) 13:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - Good angle and nice view but the photo feels a little dark and somewhat hazy. [[User:EuroCarGT|<font color="cyan">'''///Euro'''</font><font color="grey">'''Car'''</font>]][[User talk:EuroCarGT|<font color="orange">'''GT'''</font>]] 03:45, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Image quality is fairly poor. Why is it so soft? To reach a level of sharpness I would deep acceptable for a subject of this kind, it needs to be downsampled to about 50%. That makes it just above the minimum resolution requirements for a FP, but given the fairly pedestrian nature of the image, I think it needs some wow to get it over the line (good detail, interesting location, notable feature, etc). Also, I'd crop a little of the foreground water if it were me, to comply with the rule of thirds. It is a better image than the current lead image though.
