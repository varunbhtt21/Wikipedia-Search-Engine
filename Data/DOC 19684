'''''Brick Lane''''' is a 2006 British documentary directed and produced by Minoo Bhatia. The documentary is about the personal stories and journeys of people who have made the street [[Brick Lane]] their home, how these different groups have shaped the town and the changing cultural markers that define the area. It was broadcast by [[BBC Two]] on 25 March 2006.

==Overview==
[[Brick Lane]] has changed with successive waves of immigration as newer communities reclaim the area as their own and older ones move out.<ref name="asiansinmedia">{{cite news |url=http://www.asiansinmedia.org/news/article.php/radio/1247|title=BBC series focuses on Bangladeshis in Brick Lane|publisher=Asians in Media|date=9 March 2006|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> The documentary explores the history of many first-generation immigrants over the centuries,<ref name="bbc1">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/12_december/07/2factual.shtml|title=BBC TWO – Winter/Spring highlights 2006|publisher=BBC – Press Office|date=7 December 2005|accessdate=1 May 2014}} Brick Lane</ref> it works its way back and forth in time through three groups of immigrants,<ref name="newstatesman">{{cite news |last=Billen|first=Andrew|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/152912|title=East end spice|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=3 April 2006|page=49|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> from French [[Huguenot]]s to Jewish immigrants and more recently Bangladeshi residents. For the Huguenots' story there were engravings and re-enactments by actors, and the Jewish and Bangladeshi experiences were explained by interviews.<ref name="asiansinmedia"/>

First were 15,000 Huguenots Protestants who fled [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholic France]] in the 16th and 17th centuries to settle in [[Spitalfields]]. They brought with them skill as weavers – which they could practise in the [[East End of London|East End]] outside the fortress of closed shops run by City of London guilds.<ref name="newstatesman"/>

Next were the Jewish settlers who came from eastern Europe in the late 19th century and settled into the rag trade. The playwright [[Bernard Kops]]' late parents, Joel and Jenny, came to Brick Lane at the turn of the 20th century from Amsterdam. They were two of tens of thousands of Jewish immigrants who climbed financial survival.<ref name="newstatesman"/>

In the 1950s, came the Bangladeshis, majority of them from the poor farming region of [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]]. Shafiq arrived from Bangladesh in 1958, by the mid-1960s he was the first Asian manager of the [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy Bar]] chain and married a white woman Pamela. His contemporary Abdul Gaffer brought over his Bangladeshi wife,<ref name="newstatesman"/> and despite not knowing English, he settled down to work and 50 years later is still there.<ref name="asiansinmedia"/>

In addition, a Huguenot church turned into a Methodist chapel, then into a synagogue, and in 1976 became the Great London Mosque ([[Brick Lane Mosque]]).<ref name="newstatesman"/> The Huguenots faced riots from jealous native textile workers. Kops witnessed the [[Battle of Cable Street]], in which [[Oswald Mosley]]'s fascists were finally taken on by his people. The Bangladeshis in the 1970s endured the attentions of the [[British National Party|BNP]] and [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], and responded with a sit-in that saw them off.<ref name="newstatesman"/>

The story was of tolerance,<ref name="newstatesman"/> overcoming prejudice in the hope of a brighter future in England<ref name="bbc1"/> and while Brick Lane has been enriching for some, others have only found extreme poverty.<ref name="asiansinmedia"/>

==Broadcast==
''Brick Lane'' was originally screened at [[Rich Mix Cultural Foundation|Rich Mix]] as part of the [[East End Film Festival]] on 1 May 2006.<ref name="indielondon">{{cite news |url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/east-end-film-festival-2006|title=East End Film Festival 2006|location=London|publisher=IndieLondon|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="bbc2">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/04/27/east_end_film_festival_feature.shtml|title=Screen talent endorses film festival|location=London|publisher=[[BBC London]]|date=27 April 2006|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="variety">{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/2006/film/news/grant-s-wah-wah-to-open-festival-1117941786/|title=Grant's 'Wah-Wah' to open festival|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=20 April 2006|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> It was later broadcast by [[BBC Two]] as part of ''A Night on Brick Lane'' and was followed by the drama film ''[[Banglatown Banquet]]'' on 25 March 2006 (the day before [[Independence Day (Bangladesh)|Bangladesh Independence Day]]).<ref name="newstatesman"/>
