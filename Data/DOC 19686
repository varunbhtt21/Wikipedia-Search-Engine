'''''Shongram''''' ({{lang-bn|সংগ্রাম}}) is the [[soundtrack album]] to the 2014 [[Shongram|film of the same name]], written and directed by [[Munsur Ali]]. The album is the first soundtrack and third studio album by Boston-based Bangladeshi singer-songwriter and composer Armeen Musa.

==Background==
Director of the film [[Munsur Ali]] wrote a scene based on the song "Ey Shondhay", which Armeen Musa co-wrote with Saif Q in 2007 and featured on her 2008 debut album ''Aye Ghum Bhangai''. Ali contacted Musa via [[Twitter]] for permission to use the song for the film in September 2011. Coincidentally, Musa was intending to visit London the following month, and after meeting in person, Ali offered her the job of soundtrack composer in December 2011. Subsequently, a pre-launch event was held at [[Rich Mix Cultural Foundation|Rich Mix]] in London on 18 December 2011.<ref name="flavourmag">{{cite news |last=Raybe|first=Tovonya|url=http://www.flavourmag.co.uk/shongram/|title=Shongram|work= |location= |publisher=''Flavour Magazine''|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

In March 2014, whilst speaking with ''[[Dhaka Tribune]]'', Musa said, "...In the journey of this movie I got to explore various genres and discover my own abilities as a music director and I am really proud that my first film soundtrack was one about ‘71 <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Bangladesh Liberation War]]<nowiki>]</nowiki><!-- closing bracket of unspoken phrase -->."<ref name="dhakatribune">{{cite news |last=Chatak|first=Hasan Mansoor|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/entertainment/2014/mar/20/upcoming-film-shongram%E2%80%99s-audio-album-unwraps|title=Upcoming film Shongram’s audio album unwraps|location=Dhaka|newspaper=[[Dhaka Tribune]]|date=20 March 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="bdmediapara">{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.bdmediapara.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/upcoming-movie-shongrams-audio-album.html|title=Upcoming Movie Shongram’s audio album released|work= |location=Bangladesh|publisher=''BD Media Para''|date=March 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

==Recording and production==
Recording started in December 2012 at Bengal Recording Studio in Dhaka, Bangladesh this included Nashid Kamal's vocals for "Rashmonchey Dol Dol", Gazi Abdul Hakim's flute for "Shongram Theme" and the full song of "Main Toh Huin Pareshan". The remaining tracks and mixing was accomplished at Liquid Sound Productions in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Recording was complete in November 2013.

Musa and Hadi were particularly nervous about arranging a [[Nazrul Geeti]] therefore they recorded three or four different versions of "Rashmonchey Dol Dol" (sung by her mother, Nashid Kamal) using electric guitars, acoustic guitars and strings, before choosing the final version. After completing the album, Musa was "especially excited" about the [[cajón]] and [[nylon string guitar]] fusion in the song.<ref name="dhakatribune"/><ref name="bdmediapara"/>

==Composition==
The album contains seven songs (including a theme song) which are sung by Nashid Kamal, [[Dilshad Nahar Kona|Kona]], Armeen Musa, [[Nolok Babu]], Razu and Zanita Ahmed Zilik.<ref name="newagebd1">{{cite news |last=Sadequle|first=Islam|url=http://www.newagebd.com/supliment.php?sid=351&id=2358|title=Audio album launching of ‘71 er Songram’|work= |location=Bangladesh|publisher=''[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]]''|date=20 March 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="newagebd2">{{cite news |last=Sadequle|first=Islam|url=http://newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2014-03-20&nid=87236#.U16Q81e5F8M|title=71-er Sangram music CD launched|work= |location=Bangladesh|publisher=''[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]]''|date=20 March 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> It also includes two instrumentals; "Shongram Theme" and "Ei Shondhay".
