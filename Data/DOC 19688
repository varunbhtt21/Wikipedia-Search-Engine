There were also electronic/dubstep remixes from French dubstep producer Son of a Pitch.

The dramatic and storytelling album combines influences from everywhere Rahman has lived, visited, experienced and loved in â€“ at least three continents. Some of her spoken word pieces are featured in this album and has led her to perform at the DSC Literary Festival and Hackney Word Festival.<ref name="ideastap"/>

==Release==
The album was released on 16 June 2013. Each song on the album unveils a chapter in an overall story about how time affects us - its illusions, deceptions and myths. The album mimics the non-linearity of time and is on a circular track listing. From this, she has visualised one overall narrative by creating a series of eight videos which are all episodes in a series. The first episode "Reflections" received critical acclaim from [[Gilles Peterson]].<ref name="greenman">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenman.net/artist/shama-rahman|title=Shama Rahman|publisher=Green Man Festival|date= |accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="glasswerk">{{cite news |last=Otsao|first=Jamie|url=http://www.glasswerk.co.uk/magazine/article/18009/Exclusive++Shama+Rahman+-+Reflections/|title=Exclusive: Shama Rahman - Reflections|work= |location= |publisher=''Glasswerk Magazine''|date=12 April 2013|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="festivalsforall">{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.festivalsforall.com/article/4th-webisode-from-sitarist-storyteller-shama-rahman|title=4th Webisode from Sitarist Storyteller Shama Rahma|work= |location= |publisher=''festivalsforall''|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>
