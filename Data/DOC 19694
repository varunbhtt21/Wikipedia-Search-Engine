Text : == Summary ==
{{Non-free use rationale
 |Article           = BBC Janala Mojay Mojay Shekha
 |Description       = A screenshot of Kamal Bayazid, Rumana Malik Munmun and Alexandra Tyers from the educational game show, BBC Janala Mojay Mojay Shekha.
 |Source            = The copyright is believed to belong to the distributor of the item promoted, [http://old.bbcjanala.com/mojay-mojay-sheka/mojay-mojay-shekha/ bbcjanala.com], the publisher of the item promoted or the graphic artist(s).
 |Portion           = The entire frame is used to identify the program and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the intended image.
 |Low_resolution    = The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original image, so as not to violate copyright laws.
 |Purpose           = Main infobox. The image serves as the primary means of visual identification of the subject, illustrating a single educational article. It is not otherwise possible to accurately describe the appearance of the title solely through a textual medium sufficient to create a picture in one's mind, so the image is significant in illustrating the subject of the article, facilitating critical commentary as it provides an immediate relevance to the reader more capably than the textual description alone.
 |Replaceability    = As a promotional (nonfree) image, the image is not replaceable by free content; the copyright holders have not released similar images into the public domain or allowed free use of existing copyright images, and any other screenshot would be similarly copyrighted. While a free image of the view could be found, any such version is not true to the original view as the subject of this article and would be inadequate for identification or commentary.
 |other_information = Use of the copyrighted screenshot and the trademarked logo in the article complies with Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free content policy]] and fair use under [[Fair use|United States copyright law]] as described above.
