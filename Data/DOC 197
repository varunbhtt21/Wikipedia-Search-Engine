The '''[[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]]''' was the last election that a united [[Andhra Pradesh]] took part in, as the state was bifurcated into [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] states less than a month after the polls. In Andhra Pradesh there are 25 loksabha constituencies and were scheduled to go for voting on 7 May 2014 and results are announced on 16 May 2014,<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/schedule-set-for-lok-sabha-poll-battle/article5752607.ece Schedule set for Lok Sabha poll battle]. ''The Hindu''.</ref> and the new state of Telangana was carved out from Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.

==Polling==
Elections held in 2 phases i.e. 7th and 8th phase of General election 2014 on 30 April, and 7 May 2014.
