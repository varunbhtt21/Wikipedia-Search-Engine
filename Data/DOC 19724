The trial participants found the technology approach helpful.<ref name="Google Glass BFF">{{cite web|last=Raphael|first=Lisa|title=Why Google Glass May Be a New Mom's New BFF|url=http://www.brit.co/google-glass-breastfeeding/|publisher=BRIT + CO|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Sarah-Jane Bailey, one of the mothers involved in the project, was eager to participate with her son Patrick, after struggling to breastfeed her previous children.
