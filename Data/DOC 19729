===Beginning===
She started her online fitness businesses while she was still in college.<ref name=Raine/> In 2007, she was one of 18 winning designers featured at the "Emerging Stars" fashion show that occurred during San Francisco Fashion Week.<ref name=Witter/> She also interned with Effie's Heart (a [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-based clothing company.) Ho started posting fitness videos on YouTube in 2009 after she decided to move from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] for a full-time job as a fashion buyer.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=Forbes2/>  She had been a part-time [[Pilates]] instructor<ref name=AFN/> and wanted to provide the students she was leaving with online fitness workouts after she moved to Boston.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=Forbes2/><ref name=Cramer/> The first video she uploaded to YouTube was called "POP Pilates: Total Body Sculpt video" and she had considerable trouble with its quality, audio, and editing.<ref name=Forbes2/> After she uploaded the video, she received a number of comments requesting more videos on specific workouts for different muscle groups such legs, thighs, and abs, but she didn't pay attention to these requests for months.<ref name=Forbes2/><ref name=Thatcher/>

Nine months after she moved to Boston to work as a fashion buyer, she decided to quit because she disliked it.<ref name=Forbes2/> She started teaching Pilates classes 12 times a week to pay for her food and rent.<ref name=Forbes2/> She found teaching Pilates this often physically tiring, but because she was not working full-time, she had time to make more workout videos.<ref name=Forbes2/> She began uploading her new videos to YouTube and her views and subscribers began to rapidly increase.<ref name=Forbes2/> She then became a [[YouTube Partner#Posting videos as a livelihood|YouTube Partner]] and her website ''blogilates.com'' dramatically increased its [[web traffic]].<ref name=Forbes2/> She also believes that a feature of one of her bags in Shape magazine in 2010 was a contributing factor in the success she has had in her career.<ref name=Thatcher/><ref name=Hwang/><ref name=Bennett/> After her bag was featured, she realized that she could make money selling bags and went to [[China]] to talk to manufacturers of bags.<ref name=Hwang/><ref name=Bennett/> When she started her YouTube channel and began her Internet marketing of clothing, bags, mats, and fitness apparel, she briefly worked with a [[Public relations|PR]] company, but decided she could handle PR for her businesses.<ref name=Bennett/>

==Views==

===YOLO Meal===
In addition to her YouTube fitness videos, Ho also has a YouTube series ''Cheap, Clean Eats''.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=Steinfellner/><ref name=Thatcher/> In this series, she introduced the concept of a "YOLO Meal" (YOLO is an acronym for "You Only Live Once").<ref name=Steinfellner/><ref name=Hauser/> A YOLO meal consists of what is considered traditionally unhealthy food such as pizza, french fries, and ice cream.<ref name=Steinfellner/> In her view, a healthy diet should include YOLO meals because a healthy diet is a lifestyle that a person can stick with.<ref name=Steinfellner/> YOLO meals are meals a person typically has with friends and they are planned, in her approach, to occur once a week and are surrounded the rest of the week by healthy meals.<ref name=Steinfellner/> Kit Steinkellner reported in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that when she followed this approach she found that it increased her desire for both YOLO meals and healthy food.<ref name=Steinfellner/> Georgie Silvarole, writing for ''Fiterazzi Magazine'', extends Ho's concept of a YOLO meal to a YOLO day and explains that sometimes one needs a whole day off of a healthy diet.<ref name=Silvarole/>

===Body image===
When she first began to upload videos to YouTube and answering questions about fitness on her blog, she thought of herself only as only an instructor.<ref name=Forbes1/> It was at this time that she created a [[Printer-friendly|printable]] poster "How to Get a [[Thigh gap|Thigh Gap]]".<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Ho2/>
At that time, she had not thought much about the social-health implications of trying to achieve a thigh gap and she didn't think about her poster again until it appeared two years later in news segments about the latest unhealthy obsession of trying to achieve a thigh gap.<ref name=Forbes1/> After that incident, she realized that she is not just a fitness instructor but a role model in the fitness industry.<ref name=Forbes1/> She now views her role as extending beyond a fitness instructor to include helping people get healthier and feeling better about their bodies.<ref name=Forbes1/>

In 2014, after she had realized that she had become a role model in the fitness industry, she was looking for a [[bikini]] on Target's website when she noticed an image of a model with a [[photoshopped]] thigh gap.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Ho1/> She took some screen shots of the photoshopped model and blogged about them.<ref name=Forbes1/> The next morning she discovered that the Target model controversy was under discussion at a number of news media outlets such as [[ABC News]], [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]], and [[Good Morning America]].<ref name=Forbes1/> After her post drew widespread media attention,<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Bennett/> Target apologized for manipulating the photo.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=thighgap/> Ho has also warned that the "bikini bridge" may be the new "thigh gap" and that neither define beauty.<ref name="Miller.DN"/>

On her view, working out can become a problem when the only goal is "physical vanity" and thereby attempting to develop a sense of self-worth by working out. Instead, she advocates finding joy in the act of working out and letting it become part of one's lifestyle.<ref name=Forbes1/>

She believes that social media, and in particular social fitness media, has an important role to play in helping people achieve their fitness and healthy lifestyle potential.<ref name=Forbes1/> This is especially true for people who lack the family and friends to provide that support.<ref name=Forbes1/>

She believes that YouTube has an important role to play in issues concerning body image.<ref name=Forbes1/> On her view, body image is shaped by the "perfect" images of women in magazines and movies and that when women and girls pursue these "perfect" body images, the result can sometimes be [[Eating disorder|eating]] and body image disorders.<ref name=Forbes1/> She believes that YouTube provides content creators with a platform to present girls and women as they really are, which she believes will encourage them to be more confident in who they are.<ref name=Forbes1/><ref name=Hauser/>

In January 2016, Ho came out to say that she struggled with an eating disorder following the extreme training and calorie restriction she did in preparation for a bikini competition in 2012.<ref name="Blogilates-Bikini-2012">{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Cassey|title=1 Month After the Bikini Competition – How Am I Doing?|url=http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2012/06/03/1-month-after-the-bikini-competition-how-am-i-doing/|website=Blogilates|publisher=Blogilates|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> She said she was working out up to four hours a day while maintaining a 1,000 calorie diet in the lead up to the [[fitness and figure competition]], and that her mind felt cloudy during this period. In a vlog posted on YouTube,<ref name="Youtube-diet">{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Cassey|title=Why I will never diet again|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZGL6rCDyXo|website=YouTube|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref> she said she would not recommend this or any fitness routine that wasn't sustainable over the long-term.

==Body-shaming response==
In April 2015, Ho responded to an increasing number negative comments about her body by creating a video that quickly went [[Viral video|viral]].<ref name="Turner.L"/>  In her YouTube video ''The "Perfect" Body'', Ho receives negative social media messages about her body.  She is then presented with tools that allow her to "[[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|photoshop]]" her body into a socially perceived ideal body image.  However, when she looks into a mirror, she is dismayed by what she sees.<ref name="Lee.UW"/><ref name="ABC.NEWS"/><ref name="Olya.P"/>  Ho's stated intent in creating this video was to respond to cyber-bullying with the goal "...to show that cyber-bullying and mean comments really affect people, and to think before you say something. I hope that people do the exact opposite after seeing this video, which is enlighten everyone around them with positivity."<ref name="Olya.P"/>

==Personal==
Ho is [[Chinese American|Chinese]]-[[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]] and was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] but grew up in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/><ref name=Sirens/> Her parents are Bach Ho and Cuu Ho and she has a sister named Jackelyn, who is a yoga instructor.<ref name=Sirens/> When she was a teenager, she started a bakery with her mother called "Cooplex Cookies & Candies," which lasted from 2001 to 2005.<ref name=Sirens/> She went to [[James Logan High School]].<ref name=Sirens/> In 2003, she was the winner of the Miss Teen [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] [[Beauty pageant|pageant]].<ref name=MissTeen/>  She went to [[Whittier College]]<ref name=whittier/> on a John Greenleaf Whittier full tuition scholarship with the career aim of becoming a doctor.<ref name=Bennett/> She graduated in 2009<ref name=Forbes2/> with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Biology.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/><ref name=Raine/><ref name=IDEA/>

On August 22, 2017, Ho announced her engagement to longtime boyfriend Sam Livits on her official Instagram page. They married on October 6, 2018. <ref>{{citeweb|url=http://people.com/bodies/cassey-ho-blogilates-engaged/|title=Blogilates Creator Cassey Ho Is Engaged! 'It Feels Like a Dream'|last= Mazziotta|first=Julie|date=August 23, 2017|website=people.com|publisher= People|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>

According to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' "she grew up chubby" and Ho said that the way kids treated her made her become aware of her body when she was young.<ref name=People/> Her interest in fitness and nutrition began when she was 16 and discovered Pilates.<ref name=Hauser/> She was watching an [[infomercial]] and saw Mari Winsor selling her DVD on Pilates.  She asked her parents to buy the DVD and she became hooked on Pilates.<ref name=People/> Ho has also said that it was her "childhood dream to become a fashion designer."<ref name=Witter/>

She told ''[[Asian Fortune]]'' that coming from an Asian culture, her parents expected her to choose a career as a doctor or lawyer.<ref name=AFN/> When she was 16, she told her father that she wanted to be a fashion designer and her father told her that she would fail, make no money, and have no friends.<ref name=Davis/> However, in August 2014, when she released her BodyPop line of clothes, Ho said that both of her parents are now supportive of her efforts.<ref name=Davis/> It was hard for her parents to accept her career path into social fitness on the Internet, but she said they came to accept it.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/> She found that when she started her ''Blogilates'' website she found that when it started to gain popularity, she couldn't keep up with creating content for it and she asked her parents to help with the logistics and management of her business.<ref name=Cramer/> Her mother now helps her with overseas shipments of her products and her father helps her with operations management as well as the logistics of running her businesses.<ref name=AFN/><ref name=NewMediaRockstars/>

Her favorite fitness mantras are "train insane or remain the same" and "train like a beast to look like a beauty."<ref name=Hauser/>
