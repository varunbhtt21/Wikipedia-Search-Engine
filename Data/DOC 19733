'''[[U.S. Route 6 in Iowa|U.S. Highway 6]]''' (US&nbsp;6) is an eastâ€“west [[U.S. Highway]] which runs {{convert|319|mi}} across the U.S. state of [[Iowa]]. The route is signed in places as the [[Grand Army of the Republic Highway]]. The route begins at the [[Missouri River]] crossing at Council Bluffs. From there, it travels east to Atlantic. North of Atlantic, the highway [[concurrency (road)|overlaps]] [[Interstate 80 (Iowa)|Interstate 80]] (I-80) until De Soto. Between De Soto and [[Adel, Iowa|Adel]], the highway overlaps [[U.S. Highway 169 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;169]] before splitting off to the east towards Des Moines, where it closely follows the [[Interstate 35 (Iowa)|I-35]]&nbsp;/ I-80 corridor. At Altoona, the route again overlaps I-80 until Newton, where it splits away. The highway passes near or through several more cities before entering the [[Coralville, Iowa|Coralville]] / [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]] area. From Iowa City, the highway heads to the east-southeast. Near Wilton, the route heads north to I-80 where it again overlaps to Davenport. At Davenport, US&nbsp;6 then follows [[Interstate 280 (Iowa)|I-280]] and [[U.S. Route 61 (Iowa)|US&nbsp;61]] before entering the city. On the eastern side of Davenport, it joins [[Interstate 74 (Iowa)|I-74]] and enters [[Bettendorf, Iowa|Bettendorf]] before leaving Iowa for [[Illinois]]. Dating back to 1910, the route US&nbsp;6 follows was originally part of the Great White Way and River-to-River Road [[auto trail]]s which connected Council Bluffs and Davenport. When the [[U.S. Highway System]] was created in 1926, the highway was designated U.S. Highway 32. US 32 was renumbered in 1931 to US&nbsp;6. As the [[Interstate Highway System]] expanded in the 1950-1970s, US&nbsp;6's importance as a cross-state route was diminished by I-80. As a result, some sections of the route were moved onto I-80.
