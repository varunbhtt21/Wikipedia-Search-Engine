'''George Copeland Hawkins, Jr.''', usually known as '''George C. Hawkins''' (December 4, 1918 - August 9, 1991), was an [[Alabama]] [[lawyer]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[politician]].

Hawkins was born in [[Elora, Tennessee|Elora]] in [[Lincoln County, Tennessee|Lincoln County]] in south [[Tennessee]] and established a law practice in [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]] in [[Etowah County, Alabama|Etowah County]] north of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. He was a member of the [[American Bar Association]] and the Association of Trial Lawyers. He was an alternate delegate to the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]],<ref name=polgraveyard>{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/hawkins.html|title=Hawkins, George Copeland, Jr.|publisher=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> which meeting in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], adopted a [[civil rights]] [[Political platform|platform]] plank opposed by many of the delegates from the then [[Segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[American South]]. Some of the Alabamians staged a walkout in protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Multimedia.jsp?id=m-2240|title=1948 Democratic National Convention|publisher=historycentral.com|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

He was elected to the [[Alabama House of Representatives]] in 1950 and 1954 but left the House to run for [[governor of Alabama|governor]] in 1958. Victory instead went to [[John Malcolm Patterson]], who defeated [[George Wallace]] in a [[runoff election]]. Hawkins was elected in 1962 to the [[Alabama State Senate]]<ref name=polgraveyard/> at the time Wallace won the first of his four nonconsecutive terms as governor. In 1964, he was a candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]] but was defeated, 59.6 to 40.4 percent, by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[James D. Martin]], also of Gadsden, when [[Barry Goldwater]] handily won the [[electoral vote]]s of Alabama that year. Martin, who had lost a [[U.S. Senate]] race in 1962 against the Democrat [[Lister Hill]], left the House seat after one term to wage an unsuccessful battle in 1966 for governor against Wallace's first wife, [[Lurleen Wallace]].<ref>Billy Hathorn, "James Douglas Martin and the Alabama Republican Resurgence, 1962-1965",  ''Gulf  Coast Historical Review'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (Spring 1993), p. 65</ref>
