Title : William de Warenne (1256-1286)
Text : '''William de Warenne''' (9 February 1256 – 15 December 1286) was the only son of [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]] and his wife [[Alice_de_Lusignan,_Countess_of_Surrey|Alice de Lusignan]].<ref name="TMCS">Frederick Lewis Weis, Walter Lee Sheppard and William Ryland Beall, ''The Magna Charta Sureties, 1215: The Barons Named in the Magna Charta, 1215, and Some of Their Descendants who Settled in America During the Early Colonial Years'' (Genealogical Pub. Co., 1999), p. 184</ref>

==Life==
William married Joan, daughter of [[Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford]]. They had the following children:
*[[John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey]] (30 June 1286 – June 1347)
*[[Alice de Warenne]] (15 June 1287 - 23 May 1338), wife of [[Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel]].

William was killed in a tournament at [[Croydon]] in 1286,<ref name="TMCS"/> predeceasing his father. It has been suggested that this was murder, planned in advance by William's enemies.<ref>Juliet R. V. Barker, ''The Tournament in England, 1100-1400'' (Boydell Press, 1986), p. 47</ref><ref>''The Chronicle of Bury St Edmunds'', ed. A. Gransden (Nelson, 1964), p. 87</ref> On the 5th Earl's death the title went to John, the only son of William. John died without legitimate children, so on his death the title passed to [[Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel]], eldest son of Edmund FitzAlan and John' sister Alice.
