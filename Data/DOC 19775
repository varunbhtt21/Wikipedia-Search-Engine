'''George Roll''' is an [[United States|American]] [[ice hockey]] coach. He was the [[head coach]] of the [[Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey|Clarkson Golden Knights]] from [[2003–04 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2003]] thru the end of the [[2010–11 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2010-11 season]], leading them to their most recent conference championship and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|tournament]] appearance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clarkson Men's Hockey Team History|url=http://www.uscho.com/stats/history/clarkson/mens-hockey/2013-2014/|publisher=USCHO.com|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Roll began his coaching career shortly after finishing his college career at [[Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey|Bowling Green]] where he was part of the [[1984 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|1984 National Championship team]], becoming a graduate assistant for his alma mater before joining first-year coach [[Mark Morris (ice hockey)|Mark Morris]]'s staff at Clarkson.<ref>{{cite news|title=George Roll|url=http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=78516|publisher=eliteprospects.com|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Roll remained as an assistant for eight years, helping Morris establish Clarkson as a power in [[ECAC Hockey]], winning two regular season titles, two tournament titles, and making the NCAA tournament six times, including a [[Frozen Four]] appearance for the first time in over 20 years.

Roll left Clarkson to become the head coach of [[State University of New York at Oswego#Athletics|Oswego State]], a [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] program, and in each of his seven years there the Great Lakers finished with a winning record.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oswego Men's Hockey Team History|url=http://www.uscho.com/stats/history/oswego/mens-hockey/2013-2014/|publisher=USCHO.com|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Unfortunately, other than a tournament appearance in his second season, Oswego State didn't have much else to show for his tenure until 2002-03 when Roll pushed the Great Lakers to a 25-7-1 record, earning a regular season title, a conference championship, and were runners-up to the D-III National Title.<ref>{{cite news|title=Postcard: Meet George Roll|url=http://www.insidecollegehockey.com/7Archives/Postcards/roll_0125.htm|publisher=Inside College Hockey|date=2003-03-24|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>  Roll, however, decided against building on his earlier success after he was offered the top job at Clarkson, replacing his mentor Mark Morris after he was fired due to an incident in early November.<ref>{{cite news|title=Morris fired as Clarkson head coach|url=http://www.insidecollegehockey.com/7Archives/Notebooks/clarksonupdate2.htm|publisher=Inside College Hockey|date=2002-11-15|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>

The first few years with the Golden Knights were rocky as Clarkson couldn't manage a winning record until the third year, but Clarkson won 25 games in [[2006–07 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2006–07]], including a conference championship and when they earned a regular season crown the following season it appeared that they had turned the corner. After that brief success, however, Clarkson declined rapidly, ending with losing records in each of the next three seasons and causing Roll termination at the end of the [[2010–11 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2010–11 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Clarkson coach Roll relieved of duties|url=http://www.uscho.com/2011/04/18/clarkson-coach-roll-relieved-of-duties/|publisher=USCHO.com|date=2011-04-18|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Roll quickly found a new job as he was announced as the first head coach for [[Nazareth College (New York)#Athletics|Nazareth College]]'s new Division-III ice hockey program that was to begin in 2012-13.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nazareth names George Roll|url=http://www.nazathletics.com/news/2011/7/6/GEN_0706112738.aspx|publisher=Nazareth Athletics|date=2011-07-06|accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> As of 2014 he is still in that position.
