The '''Melones Dam''', also known as the '''Mayarí Dam''', is a [[concrete-face rock-fill dam]] on the [[Mayarí River]] about {{Convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Mayarí]] in [[Holguín Province]], [[Cuba]]. It is the tallest dam in the country and the center-piece of the '''East–West Transvase System'''. 

==Overview==
The system aims to connect various watersheds in the water-rich Holguín Province to cities and towns within the province and to the drier [[Las Tunas Province|Las Tunas]] and [[Camagüey Province]]s to the west. The project is still under construction but when complex it will comprise six reservoirs and hundreds of miles of canals and pipes. The Melones Dam, with its {{Convert|630000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} reservoir will help supply much of the water. Within the system, it will connect to the Sabanilla Reservoir to the west and the Levisa Reservoir to the east.

==History==
The project originally began in the 1980s but stalled due to economic problems. It since restarted in 2005 under the supervision of the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]]. The first phase was complete in 2009 and the Melones Dam was finished in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cubastandard.com/2011/05/19/keystone-reservoir-of-big-water-system-to-begin-operating/ | title=Keystone project of big water system completed in time | publisher=Cuba Standard | date=19 May 2011 | accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://obras.netcons.com.cu/obras/el-trasvase-este-oeste | title=The Diversion East - West | publisher=OBRAS | accessdate=30 April 2014 | language=Spanish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502014912/http://obras.netcons.com.cu/obras/el-trasvase-este-oeste | archivedate=2 May 2014 | df= }}</ref>
