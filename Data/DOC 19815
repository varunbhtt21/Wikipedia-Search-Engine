The sourcing is indicative of this not being a notable tour--nothing but dates and times and locations. Sure, it happened, but that doesn't mean it's notable by our standards. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 01:23, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep.''' The article "Summer Tour" have sources, promotional ad, dates, announcements, box office and the singer spoke about the "Summer Tour" in interviews. It is a tour to promote her debut album, with dates only in the United States and Canada. But the article "Live in Concert" needs to be modified, it's just a promotional tour at fairs and festivals, few solo shows. "Summer Tour" is the real debut tour. Or create a article "List of Bridgit Mendler tours". =) [[User:Shane Harper 4 Life|Shane Harper 4 Life]] ([[User talk:Shane Harper 4 Life|talk]]) 12:55, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</small>

*'''Delete''' per nom - Non notable tour. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 01:19, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''': Again. The article "Summer Tour" have sources, promotional ad, dates, announcements, box office and the singer spoke about the "Summer Tour" in interviews. It is a tour to promote her debut album, with dates only in the United States and Canada. But the article "Live in Concert" needs to be modified, it's just a promotional tour at fairs and festivals, few solo shows. "Summer Tour" is the real debut tour.

*'''Redirect or Merge''': I can see that there are almost 10,000 results, but that is also because of the video results. Article should be merged into the artist' page.

*'''Merge''' to [[Bridgit Mendler]].  Most of the coverage is very routine in nature, and the article on Mendler herself isn't so extensive that we need to break out a separate article for each tour yet.
