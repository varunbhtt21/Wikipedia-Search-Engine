<small>Improved to Good Article status by [[User:Epicgenius|Epicgenius]] ([[User talk:Epicgenius|talk]]). Self nominated at 01:39, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Huge article, well-written and well-referenced, recent GA, so no concerns there. Hooks are referenced, short and to the point, image is appropriately licensed. I've simply bolded the article that is featured per DYK rules. QPQ does not appear to be necessary, so this is good to go!
