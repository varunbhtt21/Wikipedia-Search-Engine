'''Schenkenschanz''' is a small community in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]] that was incorporated into the town of [[ Kleve]] (Cleves) in 1969. Schenkenschanz is site of the former '''Schenkenschans''' fortress that was of significance in the [[Dutch Revolt]].

==Today==
Schenkenschanz is a village within Kleve and home to about 100 inhabitants (2013).<ref name=schk>{{cite web| url=http://www.heimatverein-schenkenschanz.de/pages/dorf/geschichte.html| author= |title=Heimatverein Schenkenschanz |language=German |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> Most of its 38 [[hectares]] is not protected against flooding  and part of a [[nature preserve]].  Schenkenschanz is located about 5 km north of the center of Kleve. Until 1972 it could only be reached by ferry service across the nearby old Rhine arm, while today the Kleve-Griethausen bridge provides a road connection.

The area of Schenkenschanz is subject to the influence of the [[Rhine river]] due to flooding, erosion, formation of islands and changes in the course of the river.  Schenkenschanz had military significance when it was the point that split the Rhine river into two arms,  the southern [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the northern [[Nederrijn]]. 

[[Flooding]] by the Rhine in 1995 forced a complete evacuation of the village.

After the [[Dutch Republic]] had declared its independence from [[Spain]] in 1581, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] commissioned [[Maarten Schenck van Nydeggen]] to erect a fortress at the Waal/Nederrijn fork in 1586.<ref name=schk/> As Schenkenschans (Schenkâ€™s fortification) it was built as [[star fortress]] with extensive fortification works on both sides of the river representing at its time one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. It controlled the river access to the Netherlands.

During the [[Eighty Years War|Dutch War of Independence]] the fortress was unsuccessfully [[Siege of Schenckenschans (1599)|besieged in 1599]] by Spanish forces. It was however captured by them in 1635 only to succumb to the Dutch forces led by [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]] in the long and bitter [[Siege of Schenkenschans|siege of 1636]].

During the [[Franco-Dutch War]] French troops under [[Louis XIV]] attacked the fortress successfully in 1672.<ref name=kleve>{{cite web| url=http://www.kleve.de/C12572B30025D73F/0/7CF8BD1327FF2E1DC1257537004B9C8A |title=Kleve| publisher=Kleve Township| language=German |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> Two years later [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]n troops took over, dismantled the fortress<ref name=kleve/> and returned the place to the Dutch in 1679. 

By the end of the 17th century Rhine water flowed more and more into the Waal while the Nederrijn at Schenkenschanz was sanding up.  The creation of the [[Pannerdens Kanaal]] in 1701/09 repositioned the fork between the two rivers west to [[Millingen aan de Rijn]] and Schenkenschanz lost its military significance.

About 1800 Schenkenschanz became French again.<ref name=schk/> After the turmoil of the [[Napoleon]]ic wars, Schenkenschanz become part of the [[Rhine Province]], [[Prussia]] at the 1816 [[Congress of Vienna]].<ref name=schk/>
