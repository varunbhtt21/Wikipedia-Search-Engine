Title : Tebay River
Text : {{short description|River in Alaska, US}}
'''Tebay River''' ([[Alaska Native languages]] name meaning "a variety of sheep") is a [[waterway]] in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]]. It is located {{convert|36|miles}} southwest of [[McCarthy, Alaska|McCarthy]],<ref name="Orth1967">{{cite book|last=Orth|first=Donald J.|title=Dictionary of Alaska Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0y48AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA953|year=1967|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=953–}}</ref> in the [[Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve]].

==Geography==
Rising in the [[Chugach Mountains]], Tebay is one of the main affluents of the [[Chitina River]]. It joins the Chitina about {{convert|20|miles}} above the [[Copper River (Alaska)|Copper]], drains the Hanagita Valley and receives through its more southerly branches the discharge from a few minor glaciers. There are several lakes in the headwaters.<ref name="EllsworthDavenport1915">{{cite book|last1=Ellsworth|first1=Clarence Eugene|last2=Davenport|first2=Royal William|last3=Hoyt|first3=John Clayton|title=A water-power reconnaissance in south-central Alaska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBIKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA54|edition=Public domain|year=1915|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=54–}}</ref>

Tebay River drains the Tebay Lakes, but receives most of its water from Hanagita Creek, a much smaller part coming from Bridge Creek, the outlet to Summit Lake. Between the lakes and Bridge Creek, the current is slow and the channel deep and meandering, but below Hanagita Creek the river descends {{convert|1000|feet}} in the stretch of {{convert|6|miles}} to Chitina River. Hanagita Creek is the largest stream in the Hanagita Valley; it drains a number of small lakes and receives water from numerous tributaries. Sangaina Creek is the largest of these tributaries, with a swift current and a great number of boulders in its channel.<ref name="Marshall1914">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Robert Bradford|title=Results of Spirit Leveling in Kansas, 1896 to 1913, Inclusive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pasPAAAAIAAJ&pg=R11|edition=Public domain|year=1914|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=11–}}</ref>
