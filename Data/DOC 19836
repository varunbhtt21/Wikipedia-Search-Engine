The '''La Tuque generating station''' is a hydroelectric power plant, located on the [[Saint-Maurice River]], at the height of the city of [[La Tuque, Quebec|La Tuque]], in the province of [[Quebec]], in [[Canada]]. This power plant is the property of [[Hydro-Québec]]. It is 6th of 11 hydroelectric dams on the river from the mouth.

== Geography ==
With a catchment area of {{convert|32016|km2}}, the dam forms a large water tank of {{convert|800|ha}}. The mouth of the [[Bostonnais River]] flows into this great reservoir of [[Saint-Maurice River]] whose waters are retained by the dam. The next dam downstream on this river is the Grand-Mère's dam. The distance between these two dams offer a wide range of significant water for recreational boating.
