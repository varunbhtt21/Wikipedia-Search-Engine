== Volumes of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra ==

MathWorld gives formulae for the volumes of these polyhedra (and annoyingly don't define what they mean by the volume of a self-intersecting polyhedra). I tried to rederive them, using the [[density (polytope)|density]] method (the one where the centre of a regular pentagram counts twice towards its total area). The [[small stellated dodecahedron]] seems rather easy (the central dodecahedron has density 3, because the outside of it is the centre of a pentagram and hence has density 2: the 12 pyramidal peaks have density 1), but it's not quite clear to me how to divide the other three polyhedra up into regions by density.

== Is this a system I ought to recognise ? ==

I was helping a friend's son to go through some question sheets, revising their first year mathematics-for-physics course.  One of the questions to get them to practice basic calculation with matrices involved the matrix
:<math>\mathbf{M} = \left(\begin{matrix}
0 & 1 & \cos\theta \\
-1 & 0 & \sin\theta \\
\cos\theta & \sin\theta & 0 \\
\end{matrix}\right)</math>

They were asked to confirm that '''M'''<sup>3</sup> = 0, and then that if
:<math>\mathbf{M}_x \; \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \; \mathbf{I} + x \mathbf{M} + \tfrac{1}{2} x^2 \mathbf{M}^2</math>
that
:<math>\mathbf{M}_{x+y} = \mathbf{M}_x \mathbf{M}_y</math>

All straightforward enough to confirm.  But I wondered if this was a system I ought to be recognising?


The second half, although without using the name, is essentially working through the exponential-of-sums property of [[matrix exponential]]s for matrices that commute, in the special case that the power series terminates at the second term.

The first half is setting this up by introducing a matrix that successively maps the orthogonal vectors
:<math>\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\begin{matrix}-\sin\theta \\ \cos\theta \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right)
\to \left(\begin{matrix}\cos\theta \\ \sin\theta \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right)
\to \left(\begin{matrix}\sin\theta \\ -\cos\theta \\ 1 \end{matrix} \right)
\to \left(\begin{matrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right)</math>
-- so the matrix is essentially annihilating one direction at each application, while rotating the rest of the space into the firing line.  A little more involved than <math>\mathbf{M}^\prime = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{smallmatrix}\right)</math>, but not much.

So the question(s) that occurred to me were: is this a matrix whose properties I should recognise; and/or associate with anything?  Has it come from some particular physical model?  Was there any original significance to the &theta; parameter?

The matrix exponentiation suggests that '''M''' might represent a commutator underlying a Lie algebra.  In fact the set-up looks not too dissimilar to that discussed in the article [[Heisenberg group]] if in that article one sets ''b''=''a'' and ''c''=''a''<sup>2</sup>/2 (give or take some rotation, and the non-zero singular values being <math>\sqrt{2}</math> rather than 1).

But I wondered if anyone had come across this matrix and its exponentials, and whether their form or parametrisation is a standard one to address any particular topic? (And if so then what is the significance of it?) [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|talk]]) 22:49, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

: This is a [[nilpotent matrix]]. Nilpotent matrices are similar to block diagonal matrices with blocks as shift matrices. So this may be a similarity transform of such a matrix. Matrix exponentials form a finite sum for such matrices. If every matrix in a Lie algebra is nilpotent, then that forms a [[nilpotent Lie algebra]]. Nilpotent matrices are also related to [[nilpotent orbit]]s in Lie groups and algebras. --[[User:Mark viking|Mark viking]] ([[User talk:Mark viking|talk]]) 23:35, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

::Thanks, useful links.  It is indeed a similarity transformation of a shift matrix,
::<math>\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{P}^{-1}; \mathbf{S} = \left(\begin{matrix} 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{matrix}\right);  \mathbf{P} = \left(\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sin\theta & \cos\theta & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sin\theta \\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos\theta & \sin\theta & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos\theta \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{matrix} \right)</math>
::But I'm still curious as to whether this particular matrix comes from anywhere.  [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|talk]]) 08:24, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
