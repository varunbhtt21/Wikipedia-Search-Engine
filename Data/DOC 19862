Title : Gilahina River
Text : [[File:Chitina River.PNG|thumb|500px|Map of the Gilahina River]]
'''Gilahina River''' is a [[waterway]] in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] in the [[Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve]].

The stream rises in mountains {{convert|6000|-|7000|feet}} high between [[Lakina River]] on the east and [[Kuskulana River]] on the west. It is about {{convert|12|miles}} long and joins the [[Chitina River]] {{convert|9|miles}} below the Lakina. Three miles from the Chitina, it forks. The west branch, which is called the Chokosna, drains an area of {{convert|50|sqmi}} and is nearly as large as the main stream above the forks. The upper {{convert|6|miles}} of the Gilahina in its course through the mountains has a grade of about {{convert|150|feet}} per mile. As it approaches the Chitina Valley, the grade increases, and for the lower {{convert|6|miles}}, the average grade is about {{convert|200|feet}} per mile. There are no glaciers in the basin, and at normal stages, the water is clear and free from sediment. The valley floor is made up of gravel, boulders, sand, and clay, and at high stages, the stream transports considerable material, causing marked changes in the channel.<ref name="EllsworthDavenport1915">{{cite book|last1=Ellsworth|first1=Clarence Eugene|last2=Davenport|first2=Royal William|last3=Hoyt|first3=John Clayton|title=A water-power reconnaissance in south-central Alaska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBIKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA61|edition=Public domain|year=1915|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=61–}}</ref>
