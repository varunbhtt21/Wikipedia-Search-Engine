==Question about a superconductivity==

Is it, may be doing a very colder static of a metals for a superconductivity?--[[User:Alex Sazonov|Alex Sazonov]] ([[User talk:Alex Sazonov|talk]]) 09:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

===Are all metals [[superconductor]]s ?===

...below a [[critical temperature]] ?  How about nonmetals and other materials ?   Our article says "certain materials", but perhaps some just aren't practical because the critical temp is a trillionth of a degree above [[absolute zero]] ?  So, in theory, should everything become a superconductor if close enough to A.Z. ?  If not, do we know why ?  [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 12:41, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:As far as I can see, current theory of superconductivity says some metals (at least copper, silver and gold) do not superconduct. They have only one electron on their outermost shell, which prevents [[cooper pair]] formation. This is still somewhat an open question though; there are still open questions on how superconductivity works, and proving a negative can be hard. For deeper discussion on the subject search the net e.g. ''superconductor gold copper''.

You need an attractive interaction between the electrons for Cooper pairs to form. The exchange of virtual phonons (quantized lattice vibration) provides for such an attractive force, but in case of gold you don't get an atractive interaction.

== Hazmat cleanup ==

What's the standard procedure for cleaning up a major (1000 L or more) spill of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]]?  Thanks in advance! [[Special:Contributions/24.5.122.13|24.5.122.13]] ([[User talk:24.5.122.13|talk]]) 18:17, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:Same as a spill in a lab. Use a dry agent such as sodium carbonate and or calcium hydroxide. Then shovel up into acid resistant containers. Flush site with loads of water. Google: HAL-02-07/1/14/HWCMP01-P.DOC/10/03/06 --[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] ([[User talk:Aspro|talk]]) 19:38, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

::So, let me see if I got this right: Dump a truckload of [[slaked lime]] on the spill site, spread it out (most likely using earth-moving equipment), [[Bulldozer|bulldoze]] into stainless steel- or Teflon-lined waste containers, and then hose down the area with a [[water tender]] -- is that correct?

::Wouldn't they also evacuate the area and wear chem suits with breathing equipment ? [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 20:11, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Right, they would DEFINITELY need at least gas masks, to protect from the acid aerosol (especially if fire is also involved, as it is in my scenario). [[Special:Contributions/24.5.122.13|24.5.122.13]] ([[User talk:24.5.122.13|talk]]) 20:15, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::Good question. Answer: Wikipedia bans all the links I found. As simple as that. If you know of a way around this, please do tell.--[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] ([[User talk:Aspro|talk]]) 17:31, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::::Well, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blocked_external_links] explains this. Yet, the document I refer to is not meant to be excluded.  So it is a no brainer.  I.E, it is the pan google link that is blocked not the document.--[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] ([[User talk:Aspro|talk]]) 20:38, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:The United States Department of Transportation produces a free guide, [http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library/erg the Emergency Response Guide], which they distribute to fire departments, public safety organizations, and private sector partners.  (I keep a copy in my car, in case I ever need to know how many meters to stay away from a fire, because in the course of an ordinary week, I often drive near all kinds of dangerous-but-clearly-placarded stuff)!  You can download a free PDF it online : [http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Hazmat/ERG2012.pdf Emergency Response Guide 2012].
:For sulfuric acid, (when DOT-placarded as 1830), use guide #137 for water-reactive corrosive substances.  (See!  That's exactly why you want to keep this guide-book in your car: the acid reacts with water - so you shouldn't just start spraying water on a vehicle-fire, which can make a bad situation explosively worse!  Your first instincts aren't always correct for hazardous substance incidents).  Probably not a good idea to dump a truckload of [[slaked lime]] on it either.  ''That isn't even the correct action for a small spill'' - don't you remember the chemistry-slogan: '''always''' add acid to water.  The "always" means "always" - ''especially'' in an emergency!  Never add water to acid!  And if there's a spill, why would you add a reactive substance?  '''It can explode.'''
:You can read the guide book, and you should pay attention to all the caveats - there are loads of other variations of sulfuric acid containment best-practices.  But among the other good advice: "As an immediate precautionary measure, isolate spill or leak area in all directions for at least 50 meters (150 feet) for liquids and at least 25 meters (75 feet) for solids.  If tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in a fire, ISOLATE for 800 meters (1/2 mile) in all directions; also, consider initial evacuation for 800 meters (1/2 mile) in all directions."
:It is also worth noting that Guide #137 (for sulfuric acid) does ''not'' mention using lime.  That is an emergency-procedure for other types of hazardous materials.  For sulfuric acid spills, the area should be covered with dry earth or sand, and later removed using plastic containers.  ''Yet another reason'' why you ought to use a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], instead of relying on a random internet web-search!  There are ''loads'' of websites with bad and dangerous advice on chemical procedures; but you should probably rely on a reputable source to inform the best course of action.  Obviously, the specific circumstances of your spill might contravene published advice; there's no such thing as a "standard" catastrophe!

::So, truckload of dry sand, spread it out over the spill and bulldoze into acid-resistant containers, right?  (I presume that any victims lying in the pool of acid -- and most likely screaming in agony with third-degree chemical burns -- will first have to be carried or [[Helicopter rescue basket|winched]] to safety.  Does the person doing this also have to wear acid-proof clothing?) [[Special:Contributions/24.5.122.13|24.5.122.13]] ([[User talk:24.5.122.13|talk]]) 20:57, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

::And for the record, my scenario is a ''highly'' non-standard disaster.  Remember I was asking just a short while ago about how big a piece of avalanche debris has to be to rupture a gas pipeline?  Well, I decided to get '''really''' mean and make it a [[big rig]] carrying concentrated vitriol.  So we have a gas explosion and fire, a massive acid leak right next to it, a downed high-voltage power line close by, plus a nearby river [[Flood|bursting its banks]] due to a debris dam (see below), plus all the other carnage typically found in a major avalanche scenario.  And to top it all off, the avalanche has also cut the road, so all the equipment has to be airlifted in.

:If concentrated sulphuric acid got into the storm sewers, it would need to be diluted or neutralized there, and the metal components of the sewer might be corroded and in need of replacement.  The site where the storm sewer drains would also be contaminated, perhaps killing fish in the lake.  (Some storm sewers drain directly, while others go to sewage treatment plants first.)

::Just took a quick look at the first few pages of the document -- it appears that this is a plan for a hazardous waste site, so most likely any acid to be disposed of at the site would not be highly concentrated as it would be in my disaster scenario.  Hence the use of neutralizing agents would be permissible in this application, but this would not automatically be applicable to a spill of highly concentrated 98% sulfuric acid, as in my scenario.

:::::Where did I say that the contrast medium had any part in detecting radioactivity? It is a given that the dirty-bomb that  her ''hero/stupid idiot boyfriend''  let the terrorists have, contains radioactive material – it is self explanatory by definition. Her brilliant ploy was to stop it going critical and ruining her mascara, by pouring in some  boron and iodine contrast agents.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21273928 Computed tomography imaging of transferrin targeting liposomes encapsulating both boron and iodine contrast agents by convection-enhanced delivery to F98 rat glioma for boron neutron capture therapy.].--[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] ([[User talk:Aspro|talk]]) 13:14, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::[[Dirty bomb]], or [[thermonuclear weapon]]?  Because these are COMPLETELY different types of devices.  And if the former, then it might not NEED to [[Critical mass|go critical]], and in that case adding boron will NOT stop it from working.  As for stopping a thermonuclear weapon, adding boron is not necessary to stop it from exploding -- in order to add the boron, your heroine will have to (partially) disassemble the primary assembly, which ALONE will prevent the device from achieving a nuclear yield -- the primary relies on [[explosive lens]]es exploding '''simultaneously''' to create the [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion]] which compresses the [[fissile material]] to achieve critical mass, and if even a few of these explosive lenses fail to go off, the fissile material will be dispersed rather than compressed.

:::::::Got the feeling that your tail is trying to wag the dog. You could try writing children’s novels instead. There is no demarcation line between dirty and thermonuclear. The efficiency of yield  to mass is what is important. A second-hand (one careful owner) device may be out of spec by the time the terrorists receive it. IE, the tritium balloon and implosion components may be in need of replacement – these ''buckets-of-instant-sunshine''  need rebuilding about every six years. As you may or may not know, the tritium balloon (in the core) has a pipe that extends out of the core assembly. Viewing  other films there is a lot of cinematographic licence to be had here.  If said device, is not got to in-time, Washington gets fried. If it is got to in time  and only partly dismantled when  time runs out, Nichols Kiddman gets more than singed eyebrows if  it fizzles (one has to keep the cinema audience on tenter hooks). BUT  she, in her  wisdom, pours a  boron rich mixture down  the titanium port to the tritium balloon in the centre of the assembly. Utter tosh I know, but the last time Nichol Kiddman dealt  with a nuclear device, the films script writers probably earned more (than I your leading me to believe) you ever will.  You need to understand the research your doing other wise everybody  would be  churning out best seller. Incidentally, the neutron flux (in the film I'm referring to) would have given her a fatal dose from that distance. --[[User:Aspro|Aspro]] ([[User talk:Aspro|talk]]) 22:19, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::Back on topic: I've read the spill response plan for that gold mine in Australia, and the [[MSDS]] DOES in fact say to cover the acid with [[sodium bicarbonate]] or a mixture of [[sodium carbonate]] and [[calcium hydroxide]] -- but that doesn't stop the other emergency response guide from saying to cover it with dry sand and NOT to use neutralizing agents.

::::::::Well, the answer depends.  Who's doing the emergency response?  What laws and regulations apply?  Who has jurisdiction and gets to make the decisions?  In North America, the Department of Transportation guidelines are more relevant, because that's what fire departments and emergency responders will probably follow.  But any individual incident could be handled by a different department, or a different on-scene commander; expeditious response might require actions that don't play out "by the book;” and even if all the rules are followed, special regional laws and safety regulations might apply and a legal counsel or attorney might be needed to sort through the local and federal requirements... it's a mess, literally!

:::::::::Just discussed this with a hazmat expert earlier today -- she told me that the best way to deal with a sulfuric acid spill is to (1) contain the spill and prevent it from spreading by lining the ground with a tarp and damming the downhill flow with plastic blocks; (2) stop the acid leakage from the container, if possible; (3) [[Adsorption|soak up]] the acid already spilled by covering it with [[kitty litter]]; (4) collect the contaminated kitty litter for disposal; and (5) excavate contaminated soil if necessary (in this order).

== Avalanche question ==

If an [[avalanche]] reaches a river, how likely is it that the debris and/or snow will form a [[debris dam]] and cause dangerous flooding?

A Google search suggests that this is a relatively uncommon event, although that's probably not sound evidence. I discounted results that referred to [[rockfall]]s or [[landslide]]s, often confusingly called "avalanches" in the press. In the UK, avalanches occur in high mountain gullies before rivers of any size have formed. However, in big mountain ranges where the avalanches reach enormous proportions, it is probably a different story.

:The [[Mount Saint Helens]] eruption of 1980 was kind of the worst of both. A great amount of destructive debris and flooding downstream, and a greatly altered Spirit Lake created by the debris dam. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 21:13, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*Our [[landslide dam]] article lists a number of examples. The main danger is downstream, because the debris dam would eventually break and the resulting downstream flood could be catastrophic.  See [[1786 Kangding-Luding earthquake]] for a particularly bad example (estimated 100,000 killed).

== Disaster reporting ==

In a mass-casualty disaster (such as an [[avalanche]]) with a final count of between 50-100 victims (dead, wounded and/or missing), how do the initial casualty reports typically compare with the final tally?  Thanks in advance! [[Special:Contributions/24.5.122.13|24.5.122.13]] ([[User talk:24.5.122.13|talk]]) 18:59, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:Typically the initial reports of dead are very low, because they only count people when they find the bodies (also some wounded might later die of their injuries).  The reports of the missing, on the other hand, tend to be high, because of all the people who fled the area or went to hospitals who are in the missing list initially.  Wounded numbers could go up, if they find a batch of buried, wounded survivors. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 20:08, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

::{{EC}} That makes sense, although in really remote areas, it can be much easier to estimate the number of people who might be in the affected area, and if relief is slow in arriving, the chances of finding survivors is small. See [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17647029 8 April 2012: ''Kashmir avalanche: Up to 135 feared dead on Siachen''], whereas our [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche]] article gives a final death toll of 140, declared on 29 May.

:::Well, the number of missing will go down, as people are found, whether dead, wounded, or unharmed.  An exception would be if there was an unknown party of people in the area they discover are missing later, like a tour bus.

== Why do hyacinths stink? ==

A family member brought in some purple hyacinths, and boy oh boy do they stink up the whole house.

What is the point of hyacinths having a powerful enough stench to stink up the whole house? And how exactly is this stench produced?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.233.194.156|108.233.194.156]] ([[User talk:108.233.194.156|talk]]) 21:35, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::It sounds like OP is saying they smell ''bad''. I don't believe hyacinths to have any kind of foul-smelling reputation (like the flowers of the [[Pyrus calleryana|callery pear]] or one of the [[carrion flower]]s). Do you just mean the smell is intense and off-putting because of its intensity? Like someone wearing too much perfume/cologne? --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 05:05, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Yes. If it were maybe 1/1000 of the intensity, it might actually smell nice.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.233.194.156|108.233.194.156]] ([[User talk:108.233.194.156|talk]]) 08:10, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::: How plants, specifically flowers, produce scent is described [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-flowers-have-scent/  here]. The appreciation of some aromas, like that produced by hyacinths, is somewhat subjective. One man's stink is another man's perfume. Some hyacinths' odour is particularly potent and offensive to some noses. They "stink the place out" because they are brought into a closed environment. Take them outside and the problem will dissappear. I have serious doubts about the ability of the odour to deter consumers, I think it might have the opposite effect. It is worth remembering that the the intense odour is artificially produced, wild hyacinths have a perfume but far less intense. I agree with the earlier poster that plants naturally produce odiferous flowers to attract pollinators.
