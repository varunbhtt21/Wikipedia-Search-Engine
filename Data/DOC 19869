== [[Franklin Pierce]] ==

On April 16, 1865, when news had spread of the assassination of President Lincoln, an angry mob of young teenagers gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord. The crowd wanted to know why Pierce's house was not dressed with black bunting and American flags as visual proof of his grief.[86] Pierce came outside to confront the crowd and said he, too, was saddened by Lincoln's passing. When a voice in the crowd yelled out, "Where is your flag?", Pierce became angry and recalled his family's long devotion to the country, including both his and his father's service in the military. He said he needed to display no flag to prove that he was a loyal American. The crowd soon quieted down and even cheered and applauded the former president as he went back into his home.[87]

:What did Pierce say exactly? In his own words.

::From the New York Times, April 26,1865: [http://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/26/news/ex-president-pierce-on-the-death-of-mr-lincoln.html "The Concord (N.H.) Patriot gives the following report of a speech made by Ex-President PIERCE, a few evenings since, in response to calls from a crowd, which waited upon him to ascertain his sentiments"]. An excerpt: ''"If the period during which I have served our State and country in various situations, commencing more than thirty-five years ago, have left the question of my devotion to the flag, the Constitution and the Union in doubt, it is too late now to remove it, by any such exhibition as the enquiry suggests."''

== [[Suggested retail price]] ==

Which is the more common term: manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) or recommended retail price (RRP)? --[[User:EditorMakingEdits|EditorMakingEdits]] ([[User talk:EditorMakingEdits|talk]]) 09:21, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:In the UK it's usually RRP. It might be diferent elsewhere.--[[User:Shantavira|Shantavira]]|[[User talk:Shantavira|<sup>feed me</sup>]] 12:43, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:In the US it seems to be MSRP or just SRP, as not all items are manufactured, like milk. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 13:01, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

==Bovine [[Tuberculosis]]==
I am told that if a person born ca. 1900 survived this illness then he would probably have scars on his neck for life. What caused them? [[User:Kittybrewster|Kittybrewster ]] [[User_talk:Kittybrewster|<font color="0000FF">&#9742;</font>]] 13:23, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:Hm. [[Tuberculous_cervical_lymphadenitis|Scrofula]], perhaps? - [[User:EronMain|Eron]]<sup>[[User Talk:EronMain|Talk]]</sup> 15:53, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
