==Life==
Åkesson was born in [[Östhammar]] in 1964. She is a professor of Zoology at [[Lund University]].

In 2009 she shared the [[August Prize]] with photographer [[Brutus Östling]] about the migration of birds. This was the first time the prize had been given for a non-fiction book about a natural science subject.

She has co-written research which proposes that the stripes of a [[zebra]] may deter horseflies as they find them unattractive.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/736.full | title=Polarotactic tabanids find striped patterns with brightness and/or polarization modulation least attractive: an advantage of zebra stripes |author1=Egri, Ádám |author2=Miklós Blahó |author3=György Kriska |author4=Róbert Farkas |author5=Mónika Gyurkovszky |author6=Susanne Åkesson |author7=Gábor Horváth  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |date=March 2012 | volume=215 | pages=736–745 | doi=10.1242/jeb.065540 | issue=5 | pmid=22323196}}</ref>
