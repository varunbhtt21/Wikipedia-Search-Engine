how do I create an entry to wiktionary?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/222.154.88.158|222.154.88.158]] ([[User talk:222.154.88.158|talk]]) 00:54, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: For a new word (let's say "woobleblarf"), type it into the "Search" box, if there is no existing entry for it, it'll say "''You may create the page "woobleblarf" on a blank page, request its creation or create it using the New Entry Creator!''".  Click on the words "create it" and follow the instructions you find there. [[Special:Contributions/24.242.87.207|24.242.87.207]] ([[User talk:24.242.87.207|talk]]) 05:47, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:::On multiple-word entries, I found at [[wikt:WT:SOP]]:
::::''An expression is idiomatic if its full meaning cannot be easily derived from the meaning of its separate components. Non-idiomatic expressions are called sum-of-parts (SOP).
::::''For example, ''this is a door'' is not idiomatic, but ''shut up'' and ''red herring'' are.''
:::One particular example which gets quite a lot of views is [[wikt:no shit, Sherlock]]. Which passes the SOP test because the "Sherlock" part is always sarcastic. - '''''¡Ouch!'''''

:::::<small> I just finished [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]]'s latest novel, which is based (mainly, among other things) on events and characters from Shakespeare's ''Merchant of Venice'' and ''Othello''. One chapter is, of course, titled "No Shit, Shylock". [[User:Deor|Deor]] ([[User talk:Deor|talk]]) 01:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</small>

: Wikipedia doesn't charge anyone for anything (and we're not a paper either). If someone has asked to to pay in order to write at Wikipedia, they're trying to defraud you. -- [[User:Finlay McWalter|Finlay McWalter]]'''ᚠ'''[[User talk:Finlay McWalter|Talk]] 23:23, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:It sounds as if you've come to the wrong place: you are wanting to talk to some newspaper or magazine, but this is Wikipedia, and we can't help you. I would suggest, however, that if you wish to be an auth'''o'''r, you start using a spell-checker. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 09:47, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
