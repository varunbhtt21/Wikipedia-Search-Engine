== Mythology and related problems. ==

Dear Wikipedia people,

I do want to question in the widest sense the concept of the common use of Mythology.
The Merriam Webster dictionary defines the word myth as such:

myth noun \ˈmith\
: an idea or story that is believed by many people but that is not true

It would be deeply insulting to talk about Christian Mythology, Jewish Mythology or Islamic Mythology but 
yet we allow ourselves to talk about Norse Mythology.  This is a religion (not mine but bear with me) that is
in active practice and very similar to Hinduism in shape. It would indeed create an uproar were Wikipedia to
speak of Hindu Mythology. Let´s treat all alike with same respect and stop talking of Governments and
Regimes which in itself is loaded with opinion shaping elements.

Tolli.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/89.160.161.30|89.160.161.30]] ([[User talk:89.160.161.30|talk]]) 05:05, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:"myth" and "mythology" does not imply false. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myth actually gives three definitions where you only quoted the first:
: : an idea or story that is believed by many people but that is not true
: : a story that was told in an ancient culture to explain a practice, belief, or natural occurrence
: : such stories as a group
:See also [[mythology]]. And we have articles about all your examples: [[Christian mythology]], [[Jewish mythology]], [[Islamic mythology]], [[Norse mythology]], [[Hindu mythology]].  [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 09:07, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:Hello. This page is for help in editing Wikipedia, so your posting is not really on topic here. If you want to argue that Wikipedia should change the way it talks about something, the best place is on the talk page of the subject (eg [[Talk:Mythology]], or if it is more general than one article, find a suitable [[WP:List of WikiProjects|WikiProject]] and discuss it there). But you should be aware that Wikipedia's policy is to use the terms for things most often used in reliable sources. Unless you can show that different terminology is in widespread use outside Wikipedia, you have very little chance of getting it accepted inside Wikipedia. Wikipedia is explicitly not for new ideas or new approaches, but only for those that have already been published. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 11:28, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== "Costly" in school-district athletic programs ==

There is obviously a "template" used when entering school districts. Part of that "template" is the use of this opening entry:

"**** School District offers a wide variety of extracurriculars, including clubs, organizations and an extensive, costly sports program."

"Costly" is an opinion. And not all sports programs are extensive. Should this be an option for a templated entry? [[User:Jrshooter|Jrshooter]] ([[User talk:Jrshooter|talk]]) 07:19, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:You are jumping to conclusions. Your contributions show you have removed "costly" from three Pennsylvania school districts. Use the [[Help:Page history|page history]] to find when it was added. It appears [[User:Raindrop73]] is manually editing a lot of Pennsylvania school districts and has added "extensive, costly sports program" to some of them. If you disagree then you can contact that editor. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 08:51, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{U|Jrshooter}}, I think you are right to delete these, and it is up to the user who added them to discuss it with you if they don't accept your deletion. In my view, an evaluative term like "costly" violates the principle [[WP:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]], and should never appear in a Wikipedia article unless it has been used in a reference being cited. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 11:32, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:Obviously, I'm more in line with [[ColinFine]] on this. The conclusion I'm jumping to is that "costly" is evaluative and not backed up by facts. Also, I'm seeing that [[User:Raindrop73]] appears to no longer be active. So how do I arrange to get a manual, repetitve edit changed? I don't have enough hours in the day to edit every school-district entry in Pennsylvania.[[User:Jrshooter|Jrshooter]] ([[User talk:Jrshooter|talk]]) 16:35, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

::I meant you jumped to the conclusion that it was added indiscriminantly by a template. And you are still jumping to conclusions by talking about "every school-district entry in Pennsylvania" after I already said that Raindrop73 added it to "some of them". And I meant that if you want to prevent "template" additions like this, your apparent reason for posting here at all, you can contact Raindrop73 who is actually very active. [[Special:Contributions/Raindrop73]] shows 33 edits today. I don't object to removing it from three articles you came by without contacting the editor, but if you plan a mass removal then discussion is best. You could start by asking whether it's added to random schools or to schools with sports programs significantly more extensive and costly than usual. I don't know Raindrop73's criteria and haven't examined the programs but it's possible that Raindrop73 has. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 21:28, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:[[PrimeHunter]], if you believe he was "examining" the schools before posting the same thing time after time, you go right ahead and believe that. But before you do that, I'd appreciate if you would spell out just how to contact Raindrop73, because I see no route to him right now. --[[User:Jrshooter|Jrshooter]] ([[User talk:Jrshooter|talk]]) 22:03, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::Please assume good faith from other editors, as you are actually required to do [[WP:AGF|by Wikipedia policy]].  Don't bandy around accusations unless you actually have some evidence, such as a link to this fictitious template you are determined to believe exists.  Anyway, you contact users by posting on their talk page, in this case at [[User talk:Raindrop73]].  By the way, you are completely wrong that they are inactive, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Raindrop73 their edit history] shows that they are very much active.

::I long ago conceded on the "template" thing. You two are the ones hung up on that. But I'm not about to assume good faith when the same thing is posted on multiple (NOT ALL!) pages, the same way. Not even Wikipedia policy can force that, although I see how you might think it can mold minds. No response required; I know what to do now. Thank you. :) [[User:Jrshooter|Jrshooter]] ([[User talk:Jrshooter|talk]]) 22:17, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

::I don't understand how you can jump from 'I don't know Raindrop73's criteria and haven't examined the programs but it's possible that Raindrop73 has' to 'if you believe he was "examining" the schools before posting the same thing time after time, you go right ahead and believe that'. It's hard to have a meaningful conversation when you make jumps like that so I will stop here. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 22:39, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the above reply to my query about logging in.

I now have a query about an edit that I have made to the Wikipedia article on [[Helen Nearing]]. I have added footnote #2 as a cross-reference to the Wikipedia article on [[Helen and Scott Nearing]], which has duly appeared in the "References" as [[Helen and Scott Nearing]] which when clicked on leads to the correct article, but does there need to be some indication in the footnote that the reference is to another Wikipedia article?  --[[User:P123cat1|P123cat1]] ([[User talk:P123cat1|talk]]) 12:51, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks.  I see the reference to Wikipedia has been deleted already and I understand the reason why.  But I think it is important that the reader should know there is another article on her in Wikipedia, i.e. [[Helen and Scott Nearing]], and as there is nothing in this article to show that there is, I have solved the problem by changing "The Nearings" in para 2 of the [[Helen Nearing]] article to "[[Helen and Scott Nearing]]", as a link to that other article.  --[[User:P123cat1|P123cat1]] ([[User talk:P123cat1|talk]]) 14:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:See also would have been fine.  It's basically pointing out closely related articles, that may not be mentioned in the text, which the reader would also be interested in.

Yes, I see the difference. You will note (see above) that I did find a neater way of incorporating the Wiki reference into the text of the [[Helen Nearing]] article that did not involve a footnote or a "See also" entry; I was a bit puzzled subsequently about what "See also" entries were for, but all is clear now. --[[User:P123cat1|P123cat1]] ([[User talk:P123cat1|talk]]) 21:19, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== Tonga ==

Reference to Hawaii giving up the monarchy mentioned in Tonga's history tab is wrong. The United States imprisioned our Queen and in order to save her people she relinquished her throne! We Hawaiians signed a petition to refuse the annexation of Hawaii. Every single Hawaiian that could sign did sign against Hawaii becoming a state of the rip off United States. 

Please research better on how we lost our monarchy and reference this correctly. This native Hawaiian appreciates it that Wikipedia does this wiki wiki as you so appropriately would use our slangs and not even write historically correctly about my beloved home Hawaii and Queen.

== Articles for creation ==

I know that if a page here is in "article space", editors are allowed, indeed encouraged, to improve it. And I understand that if a page here is in an editor's space, ''e.g.'' as a subpage of his user page, it "belongs" to that editor and it would be rude to edit it without his permission. But what is the status of an article for creation?

I ask with reference to [[Wikipedia:Help_desk#I_want_to_submitt_my_article_to_review|this question]] asked here a few days ago. A new editor asked how to submit [[Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Felipe_Browne|an article]] for review. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] advised him to click the green "Submit for review" button. I made extensive edits to the article, to improve the formatting and spelling, and to bring it closer to compliance with en:Wikipedia standards. I tried not to change the actual content, which seemed to me good. But I don't know whether it was appropriate for me to edit an "article for creation" before it had been submitted. I also don't know whether it would be appropriate for me, now, to click the green button; the OP has not taken the advice to do so. [[User:Maproom|Maproom]] ([[User talk:Maproom|talk]]) 18:57, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:If you think it is ready, there is no harm in submitting it, it can always be submitted again if rejected.  Outsiders editing AFC is unusual but perfectly ok, there is no [[WP:OWN]]ership even at AFC.  I personally edited and submitted plenty of while the G13 backlog was being mass-cleared and saved quite a few.  The problem would come if the original author objected.  There is no talk page to thrash out the disagreement, which is one of the advantages of the new draft namespace over AFC.

The usual way to handle situations like this would be to ask the editor to change a parameter in an existing template, but new editors cannot be trusted to correctly follow instructions like that without messing up the syntax, and if they do that then their draft would often lose the whole box with the submission botton, be removed from all categories and never seen by others.

:[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Boaz Keysar]] needs some fixing. I guess the big blue links to the help pages aren't working today. Anyway, [[Help:Referencing for beginners]] will get you started. --<span style="color:Turquoise">''''' &nbsp;[[User:Gadget850|Gadget850]]'''''<sup>[[User talk:Gadget850|&nbsp;''talk'']]</sup></span> 21:02, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:The help page says 
:When referring to an already named reference, ensure that the ref tag is in the following format  ('''note the final slash'''). 
:{{tag|ref|s|params=name="reference name"}}

::<small>''P.S.'' I have put <nowiki><nowiki></nowiki> tags around the <nowiki><ref></nowiki> <nowiki></ref></nowiki> tags in your question, to stop the code that renders this page from thinking that you are trying to define a reference here.

== Nightcore??? ==

Hi, I was wondering, how would one go about writing an article about a remix genre that has no articles about it. (I found a definition on urban dictionary, and there is one website on either the band with the same name or the remix movement, it won't load for me.) From my understanding of it, it is considered a subgenre of trance. sorta happy hardcore. It is rather connected to the anime/manga fandoms, and most videos on youtube use an anime character for their video. That's the info from what I've picked up. I believe this subgenre should have an article (I'm always open to suggestions though, so if you all don't think it's notable/practical/etc just tell me, I'll pick a new project.)

What would count as a valid source for this?? This would be a fun project if I can get it off the ground, but lack of sources is going to be a big issue. 

Thank you for all your help. [[User:NikaGirl|NikaGirl]] ([[User talk:NikaGirl|talk]]) 21:22, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:[[WP:42|First you would need to collect reliably published third party sources (newspapers, books, major media magazines) that had written in a significant manner about the subject. Fan sites dont count.]] If you dont have those, then you dont have the makings for an article. If you do have the coverage, then you could follow the steps outlined under [[WP:AFC]] which will guide you and bring an experienced editor to help guide you. -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]] 22:00, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== Is there a way to add user/IP contributions to a watchlist? ==

I patrol recent changes, and frequently come across problem IPs and users, I'm wondering if there is a way to watchlist the contributions of an IP or user? Thank you.
