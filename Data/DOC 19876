== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Marc Douglas Berardo]] ==

Hello, 

My article was rejected basically because it lacked the references to prove notability etc.  I have updated the article and was wondering if you could let me know if I am in the ball park.  I believe I have the appropriate references now.    Let me know Thank you. PR [[User:PerformerResearch|PerformerResearch]] ([[User talk:PerformerResearch|talk]]) 00:16, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{replyto|PerformerResearch}} You're getting close to acceptance.  The subject doesn't meet [[WP:NBAND]] but with more mentions in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] (like newspapers, etc.} I think you might have a chance to pass [[WP:GNG]]. At this point though, I could not accept this article. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 05:03, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Chris, can you let me know what areas are do not have reliable sources?  I have been looking at other pages and the sources I see on them don't seem to meet what you are saying as sources.  None of which have newspaper reference.  Many of the sources in my article are from legitimate publications like the Muse's Muse, Minor 7th and No Depression.  If you can just give me some more specific guidance that would be helpful. Are any of the sources I have included not acceptable sources or is there a particular area in the article that is questionable.  I really appreciate your help. 

Thank you PerformerResearch [[User:PerformerResearch|PerformerResearch]] ([[User talk:PerformerResearch|talk]]) 12:47, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{replyto|PerformerResearch}} First, [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]] isn't a valid argument. Fully a third of Wikipedia is unreferenced and should be deleted but this project doesn't address that.  You'll note I reformatted two references.  It's not necessary but it helps me to evaluate sources. I had been unaware that ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' was an actual magazine.  Meanwhile ''The Evening Sun'' in upstate NY doesn't look like an actual newspaper though from a glance it looks like it might be.  Most of your sources look like random websites so unless those publications have a Wikipedia entry of their own, I assume they're probably not reliable.  I'm not a student of music so I don't have a lot of knowledge of the trade publications. I recommend you contact [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians|WikiProject Musicians]] as they would know more about this subject. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 17:46, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Chris, I will have to look at what you mean about [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]].  I know that No Depression is recognized among the artist community, but I guess I really still don't understand what is official.  Thanks for the reformatting.  I will follow that format and your advice.  PR [[User:PerformerResearch|PerformerResearch]] ([[User talk:PerformerResearch|talk]]) 18:34, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

Chris I see what you mean by other stuff exists as an argument.  I was using other pages as a guide and examples of what I could use as legitimate and was confused and not necessarily as an argument. I see what you mean now by needing another project.  I will check with Project Musicians.

Hi, I haven't been able to visit this article in awhile but I'm still interested in learning what is wrong with my page to the point that it's not able to be published as a regular page.  Please help me understand. I do know that the information has to be true, so everything I put in my page is indeed true. Please provide me with some advice.



Thanks,

John Benjamin II

:{{to|John L. Benjamin II}} First, it has not been submitted for review: Click "Submit your draft when you are ready for it to be reviewed!" to submit it.
:If you submit it now, it will probably be rejected. It seems you are trying to write an article about yourself. This is [[WP:AUTOBIO|strongly discouraged]] but not forbidden. Wikipedia has lots of rules, but understanding some of the more important ones will greatly improve your article's chances of being accepted:
:* '''[[WP:V|Verifiability]]''': Information must come from [[WP:RS|published, reliable sources of information]]. Personal experience is not reliable, because it is not published.
:* '''[[WP:N|Notability]]''': Subjects need to be "notable" before they can have an article. Notability generally means that reliable sources <em    >independent of the subject</em> have discussed it in detail.
:* '''[[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] and [[WP:NOTPROMO|not for promotion]]''': Articles should be neutral in content and tone. Those two pages are rather long, so I suggest you read about [[WP:SUBJECTIVE|describing aesthetic opinions]] and [[WP:PEACOCK|peacock terms]], the two parts that relate the most to your submission.

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fourth Industrial Revolution]] ==

Hello,

I was wondering when my page could be reviewed as I've amended it a month ago, when the review information gave me about 3 weeks waiting time. 
I know and I'm sure all volunteers are doing their best, but I just would like to know (roughly) when my page could be reviewed.

In advance, many thanks for your answer.

Best Regards,

Hugo.

:{{replyto|HgPchrd}} {{declined}} This entry still sounds very essay-like and it sounds that way because this subject doesn't really exist. Some writers are trying to describe current transformations into a "Fourth Industrial Revolution" but monikers like that are only properly applied by historians hundreds of years '''after''' the fact.  It's a thing called periodization.  Your essay is trying to sell what you think the 4th industrial revolution is. As more writers start describing what it is, there will be more material with which to write an article.  I think it's too early. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 22:19, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{replyto|Sanjay upadhyaye}} First, I've already sent you an invitation to the [[WP:TWA|Wikipedia Adventure]]; I suggest you improve your technical editing skills.

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Andrew Prokos]] ==

I want to include a picture of the photographer, but I can't upload that to Wiki Commons as I don't know the copyright status. Do I have to get some sort of written permission from the photographer to use the photo of him from his own website in the article? [[User:Larantes|Larantes]] ([[User talk:Larantes|talk]]) 16:10, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{to|Larantes}} If it has already been made public, then the answer is '''yes'''. The photographer will have to release it under a free license (usually one of the licenses listed at [[commons:Commons:Copyright tags|Commons copyright tags]]). Follow the instructions [[Commons:OTRS#If you are not the copyright holder|here]].

Hi there. I just submitted an article for being reviewed on Wikipedia and I have received a notification that it has been declined. So would you please advise me the reason(s) for rejection, so that I can correct it accordingly and improve my article? This is the first time I take part in a project on Wikipedia, and I really want to contribute useful information to your directory. I look forward to your feedback. Thank you in advance.[[Special:Contributions/113.190.163.193|113.190.163.193]] ([[User talk:113.190.163.193|talk]]) 19:39, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:First, understand that [[WP:NOTDIR|Wikipedia is not a business directory]]. It only includes topics that are "[[WP:N|notable]]," which means that they have been discussed by people who are independent of it. So you need to find [[WP:IRS|independent, reliable sources of information]] (such as news articles or reviews) that discuss this organization and cite them in the article.

:{{replyto|Davidsansmountsinai}} {{declined}} First, having a username including "mount sinai" concerns me when you write an article about a doctor that works at that hospital.  Your submission doesn't meet [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:ANYBIO]]. The entire thing looks promotional and probably could be deleted again.  If you want to contribute to Wikipedia, you have to be here to do it without any ulterior motives.  If your job is to be public relations, 99% of the time your efforts are going to violate our norms. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 21:12, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*To [[User:Davidsansmountsinai|Davidsansmountsinai]] and [[User:Chris troutman|Chris troutman]]: My initial research indicates that this subject easily passes [[WP:PROF]]—holds a named chair at a major medical school, very high citation index, extensive coverage in major Spanish newspapers, a lengthy article devoted to him and and his work in the ''[[New York Times]]'' [http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/13/science/scientist-work-carlos-cordon-cardo-cancer-trailblazer-follows-genetic.html?pagewanted=print] (subsequently reprinted in [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P0UdAQAAIAAJ&q=Carlos+Cordon-Cardo+:+Cancer+trailblazer+follows+the+genetic+fingerprints&dq=Carlos+Cordon-Cardo+:+Cancer+trailblazer+follows+the+genetic+fingerprints&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QfVdU5WbIe3Y7Abjl4GwBQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA ''Scientists at Work: Profiles of Today's Groundbreaking Scientists from Science Times, The New York Times''] ([[McGraw Hill]]). The problem is that the article is poorly referenced, uses highly promotional language, and lacks a biographical narrative. Alas, a common problem when articles are written based on public relations material and/or official biographies, as this one is. Much of it is paraphrased from pages like [http://icahn.mssm.edu/static_files/MSSM/Files/About%20Us/Deans%20Office/2011%20CONVO%20PROGRAM%20FINAL%20FINAL.PDF] and [http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/carlos-cordon-cardo]. I'm going to completely re-write and reference this article. It will be considerably shorter, devoid of adjectives, factual, neutral, and '''boring''' :-).

Hello,

I want to add a discography that will include name of album, artist and year released.  There will be nearly a hundred including many notable albums that should link, such as LeAnn Rimes "Blue".  I have read and read, but don't understand how to insert a proper template.  Can you help me please?

:{{replyto|Racheldeering}} I would recommend copying an entry from [[:Category:Discographies|our discographies category]].  I guess [[Help:Tables]] wasn't helpful. On a side point, so far your entry doesn't meet [[WP:NBAND]]; you might want to be sure Milo is notable himself because simply saying he was involved on notable songs or albums might not be enough.  Being the spouse of the subject and mentioning that in the article isn't a good omen, either. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 18:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
