This user is not only just not signing in to hide behind an IP address to be disruptive but the user also makes personal attacks during AfD discussions.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ginger_Alden&diff=next&oldid=605474749 Edit that was made by 99.122.81.101 but signed by Juliesong]


[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ginger_Alden&diff=prev&oldid=605474625 Edit by 99.122.81.101 stating that Lady Lotus has ""an agenda" as an over jealous EP fan. She is known as a "trouble maker" with Wikipedia and Facebook."] Which is untrue.

User just seems to be a disruptive fan with no attempt at beneficial edits. <small><span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #09F,-4px -4px 15px #9F0;">[[User:Lady Lotus|LADY LOTUS]]</span> • <span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #F90,-4px -4px 15px #F09;">[[User talk:Lady Lotus|TALK]]</span></small> 19:32, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

*I'm adding User:Elwood48 to this SPI also as they just appeared to have a say so in the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ginger Alden]] discussion and has only made 7 edits, all of which were about [[Ginger Alden]] or about her on the [[Personal relationships of Elvis Presley]] page. <small><span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #09F,-4px -4px 15px #9F0;">[[User:Lady Lotus|LADY LOTUS]]</span> • <span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #F90,-4px -4px 15px #F09;">[[User talk:Lady Lotus|TALK]]</span></small> 13:42, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*Indeed very disruptive in the AfD for Ginger Alden. User should also be reported at WP:ANI. Julie also seems to be a single-purpose account. [[User:XXSNUGGUMSXX|XXSNUGGUMSXX]] ([[User talk:XXSNUGGUMSXX|talk]]) 14:33, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*{{User|Elwood48}} is {{unlikely}} a sock of {{User|Juliesong}} though, as always, [[WP:MEAT]] cannot be disproved. If the edits at the AfD are disruptive enough, that trumps any CU findings. --[[User:Ponyo|<b><font color="Navy">''Jezebel's''</font></b><font color="Navy">Ponyo</font>]]<sup>[[User_talk:Ponyo|<font color="Navy">''bons mots''</font>]]</sup> 16:50, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*{{adminnote}} Juliesong has not "hid" behind an IP address; hiding does not include signing your account name after an IP address edits. It has all the appearance of a new account unfamiliar with Wikipedia, editing while logged out (either because they forgot to log in or otherwise were confused). While Elwood48 and Juliesong clearly share an interest, they don't seem to be the only ones, I note other SPAs on this article over its history (including [[Special:Contributions/Jonathanmarc4|Jonathanmarc4]], [[Special:Contributions/Vespas51|Vespas51]], and various IPs). Juliesong could be one of the older SPAs creating a new account (which isn't disallowed since all of the old SPA accounts are long abandoned), or could be recruited to the AfD (it's impossible to know) but given that there is no apparent technical connection I'm confident in concluding that Juliesong and Elwood48 only share an interest, nothing more. Juliesong is guilty of disruption, but nothing since the most recent warning so there doesn't seem to be need for administrative action at this point. I'm marking the case for closure. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 18:43, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
