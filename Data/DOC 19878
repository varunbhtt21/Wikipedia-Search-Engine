Batka83 was blocked for edit warring on articles related to the term "Mongoloid" (in its now-obsolete Down syndrome sense).  The IP account made the same edits as Batka83 during the edit war (compare [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongoloid_(disambiguation)&diff=prev&oldid=605279326] with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongoloid_(disambiguation)&diff=605268967&oldid=581680193], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongolian_idiot&diff=prev&oldid=605283560][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongoloid_idiot&diff=prev&oldid=605282867] with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongoloid_idiot&diff=605268495&oldid=579376783][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongoloid_idiot&diff=next&oldid=605269625][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongoloid_idiot&diff=next&oldid=605269938]).  After the block, Batka83 nominated [[Mongoloid idiot]] for deletion (and !voted twice) [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_April_24&diff=605531948&oldid=605080739][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_April_24&diff=605583829&oldid=605576828] and the above two accounts, freshly created, dropped by to voice their support using the same poor grammar characteristic of Batka83's contributions [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_April_24&diff=605584203&oldid=605583988][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARedirects_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_April_24&diff=605584917&oldid=605584283].

*'''Added [[User:Guntengis]] to this request'''. Seems to be a [[WP:DUCK]] sockpuppet per their only edit: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_24&diff=prev&oldid=605693019].

*{{adminnote}} I've blocked Guntengis as an obvious sock and extended the sockmaster's block from a week to a month for block evasion. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 13:32, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

As with the previous sock [[User:Otemd]], this fresh account's only actions have been to copy and paste third-party text into its user page (cf. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Otemd&oldid=605585178] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bayaraa99&oldid=607103118]) followed by making a poorly phrased edit to a "mongoloid"-related page (cf. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongoloid_%28disambiguation%29&diff=prev&oldid=607103482] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_24&diff=prev&oldid=605584917]).  The username also fits the pattern ("Bayaraa" is a Mongolian personal name, as are "Batka", "Otem", and "Jumbara").
