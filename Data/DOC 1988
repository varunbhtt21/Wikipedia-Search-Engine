===Car No. 7 history ===
====2018–present====
On May 21, 2018, it was announced the team would be returning to the Cup Series for the [[2018 Coca-Cola 600|Coca-Cola 600]] for the first time since 2015, receiving a multi-year deal with Steakhouse Elite as a sponsor. [[J. J. Yeley]] was announced to drive the No. 7 car in a partnership with [[Premium Motorsports]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Nguyen|first=Justin|url=https://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2018/05/ny-racing-team-debuting-at-coca-cola-600-jj-yeley-to-drive/|title=NY Racing Team debuting at Coca-Cola 600, JJ Yeley to drive|publisher=The Checkered Flag|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref> After qualifying 40th, Yeley finished 38th after suffering from fuel pump issues on lap 191.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/race/2018_Coca-Cola_600/W|title=2018 Coca-Cola 600|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=May 28, 2018}}</ref> The following week at Pocono they fielded a car in association with [[Premium Motorsports]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/jayski/status/1002311555827097601|title=Jayski on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref> Yeley qualified the car 37th and finished 32nd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/2018_Pocono_400/W|title=06/03/2018 race: Pocono 400 (Cup) - Racing-Reference.info|website=www.racing-reference.info|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> After missing several races, the team returned to the track for the [[Coke Zero Sugar 400]] in collaboration with [[BK Racing]].

NY Racing continued their partnership with Front Row Motorsports after the purchase of BK's charter. During the autumn Talladega race, the No. 23 team switched manufacturers from Toyota to Ford before switching back to Toyota for the next two races. Yeley continued being the driver of the No. 23 Toyota for the rest of the season and during the final race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, BK Racing operated as a Ford Fusion. With BK Racing officially shutting down at season's end and being absorbed into Front Row Motorsports, NY Racing and Front Row Motorsports ended their partnership.

For 2019, NY Racing plans to run a No. 7 Steakhouse Elite Ford Mustang with Yeley as the driver. They have yet to attempt a Cup Series start.

===Car No. 30 history ===
====2014====
Before the 2014 Richmond spring race, the team purchased the owner points and assets of the recently defunct No. 30 from [[Swan Racing]], including their race shop in [[Statesville, North Carolina]], hoping to end their recent struggles in qualifying by having a solid points base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/4/23/swan-racing-future-26-team-sold-bk-racing-cole-whitt-parker-kligerman.html|title=Swan Breakup Leaves Kligerman Without A Ride|last=Caraviello|first=David|date=April 23, 2014|publisher=NASCAR.com|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref>  The team used No. 30 for Richmond due to NASCAR rules regarding ownership transfers, but switched back to the No. 44 thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jayski.com/news/teams/story/_/page/44-Xxxtreme-NASCAR-Team-News|title=#44 NASCAR Team News and Links|work=[[Jayski's Silly Season Site]]|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Car No. 44 history ===
====2012–2014, 2015====
The team returned from hiatus and began running the Cup Series in November 2012. A car numbered 44 for [[David Reutimann]] was fielded at the [[2012 AdvoCare 500 (Phoenix)|2012 AdvoCare 500]] at [[Phoenix International Raceway]] with sponsorship from [[No Label Watches]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Lee|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/David-Reutimann-set-to-return-to-Cup-with-Xxxtreme-Motorsports-at-Phoenix-110612|title=Reutimann to return to Cup racing|publisher=[[Foxsports.com]]|date=November 6, 2012|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref> Reutimann finished 40th, pulling out of the race early due to a vibration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/2012_AdvoCare_500_(November)/W|title=2012 AdvoCare 500|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref>

For 2013, [[Scott Riggs]] was hired as the team's full-time driver and the team switched manufacturers from [[Chevrolet]] to [[Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catchfence.com/2013/sprintcup/02/27/no-label-watches-clocks-in-with-xxxtreme-motorsport-for-2013-season/|title=No Label Watches Clocks in with Xxxtreme Motorsport for 2013 Season|work=Catchfence|date=February 27, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}</ref> The team attempted most races in the first half of the season, but following numerous instances of having to [[start and park]], coupled with poor sponsorship, the team shut down for the year midseason, and Riggs moved to [[RBR Enterprises]] in the [[Camping World Truck Series]].

In 2014, [[J. J. Yeley]] moved to the team following his departure from [[Tommy Baldwin Racing]].  The team struggled for speed early in the season, failing to qualify for two races and withdrawing from two others. The team qualified for Richmond after the field was set by the rulebook due to rain, but were running four laps down when the engine expired on lap 384. In May, after failing to qualify for the [[2014 Aaron's 499|Aaron's 499]] in the [[All City Leasing & Warehousing]] Chevrolet SS, the team qualified for the [[2014 5-hour Energy 400|5-hour Energy 400]] on speed in the [[Phoenix Warehouse]] Chevrolet SS, starting the race in the 35th position. However, they once again suffered an engine failure, finishing 41st. They then missed the [[2014 Coca-Cola 600|Coca-Cola 600]], and blew their third engine at Dover.  The next week at Pocono, despite cutting down a tire mid-race, they were able to stay on the track and complete a race for the first time in their existence, finishing 38th. An incident-free race the next week at Michigan brought the team's best finish to that point, 36th, which they then bested again at Sonoma with a 34th. The team then withdrew from Kentucky in the midst of more personnel shuffling. The team was absent for most of the summer, returning as "Team Xtreme Racing" in September for the [[2014 AAA 400|AAA 400]] at Dover, with [[Timmy Hill]] as driver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jayski.com/news/stats/2014/story/_/page/29-Dover-2014-Entry-List|title=Dover Entry List|work=[[Jayski's Silly Season Site]]|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref> The team made the race, but lost an engine early into the event.

Former [[Tommy Baldwin Racing]] driver [[Reed Sorenson]] was signed by the team to compete in the [[2015 Daytona 500]] with [[Golden Corral]] sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Lee|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/reed-sorenson-joins-forces-with-xtreme-motorsports/|title=Reed Sorenson joins forces with Xtreme Motorsports|publisher=Motorsport|date=February 9, 2015|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}</ref> Despite crashing on the final lap Sorenson was able to cross the start-finish line to record the team's first lead-lap finish, in 32nd place. [[Travis Kvapil]] was scheduled to drive the car in Atlanta, but they were forced to withdraw after the car, truck and hauler were stolen from a hotel parking lot. The race car and truck that was hauling the trailer have been recovered. The trailer and spare racing parts remain missing.<ref name="Fox Sports">{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/team-xtreme-racing-stolen-race-car-truck-trailer-update-johnathan-cohen-travis-kvapil-080315|title=Team Xtreme Racing: Man pleads guilty in theft of truck and trailer|last=Pennell|first=Jay|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|date=August 3, 2015|website=FoxSports.com|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}</ref>

After Kvapil failed to qualify for the next three races, combined with Cohen facing his own civil arrest warrant for not answering an information subpoena, the team announced that they would withdraw from Martinsville in order to better prepare for Texas;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/martinsville-speedway-sprint-cup-series-entry-list-team-xtreme-racing-withdraws-032715|title=Team Xtreme Racing withdraws from Martinsville Sprint Cup event|last=Turner|first=Jared|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|date=March 27, 2015|website=FoxSports.com|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}</ref> however, they have not returned to the series since. On August 3, Jason Terry pleaded guilty in the theft of the Team Xtreme truck and trailer.<ref name="Fox Sports"/> Since then, the No. 44 became available and was later used by [[Richard Petty Motorsports]] for [[Brian Scott]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Long|first=Dustin|url=http://nascar.nbcsports.com/2016/01/11/rpm-brings-back-history-with-number-change-for-brian-scott/|title=RPM brings back history with number change for Brian Scott|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}</ref>
