Sword-Site was blocked for promotional edits + his username, the edit in question are seen here;
* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Longsword&diff=605816415&oldid=601180172

A newly registered user, Koolmejacs, readds the external link to the same article, as well as others;

1. Both do not use edit summaries.
2. Both add the text in the exact same place.
3. Both advertised for the same site. Thank you. 

Chuderly is the renamed Koolmejacs, who appears to have reregistered his other account. The user has not made any edits until last 2007. I just thought I'd include it just in case, as it was a rename. [[User:Tutelary|Tutelary]] ([[User talk:Tutelary|talk]]) 04:17, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

Piranhatank has done the same exact edit as the other two:

[[User:Deskana|Deskana]], I understand. However, Chuderly was a renamed Koolmejacs, and given that Koolmejacs's old name was Chuderly, I sought to include it. I understand, though. ^^ [[User:Tutelary|Tutelary]] ([[User talk:Tutelary|talk]]) 21:53, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

Without diffs or other evidence to show a suspected link between [[User:Chudlery|Chudlery]] and the other accounts, I cannot run a check on that account. --[[User talk:Deskana|(ʞɿɐʇ)]] [[User:Deskana| ɐuɐʞsǝp]] 21:49, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
