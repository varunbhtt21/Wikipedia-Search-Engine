'''Wu Xinzhi''' ({{zh|s=吴新智}}; born 1928) is a Chinese [[paleoanthropologist]], academician of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]],<ref>[http://english.ivpp.cas.cn/pe/cm/ CAS Members]. Chinese Academy of Sciences.</ref> and former vice director of the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]] (IVPP).

==Biography==
Majoring in paleoanthropology and specializing in anatomy, Wu served from 1953 to 1958 as a teaching assistant at Department of Anatomy, Dalian Medical College. He later became an assistant research professor, and vice director, of the IVPP. During the 1980s he was chief editor of the Chinese science journal ''Acta Anthropologica Sinica''. He also serves as an academician of [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. In 2013 he was honored as Laureate of the 2013 Lifetime Achievement Award in Anthropology.<ref>[http://comonca.org.cn/PDF/2013/COMONCA07-007.pdf Career of Academician WU Xinzhi, Laureate of the 2013 Lifetime Achievement Award in Anthropology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005007/http://comonca.org.cn/PDF/2013/COMONCA07-007.pdf |date=May 2, 2014 }}.</ref>

==Views on human evolution==
Wu is most known for his criticism of the [[Out of Africa hypothesis]]. Along with [[Milford H. Wolpoff]] and [[Alan Thorne]] he developed the alternative [[Multiregional hypothesis]] in 1984. Wu however confines his palaeoanthropological research to China and coined "Continuity with Hybridization" to refer to a China-specific Multiregional model (Wu, 1998). According to Wu, the human lineage arose in Africa sometime during the early Pleistocene and since then, evolution has been within a single, continuous species. He considers ''[[H. erectus]]'' for example to be the earliest fossil specimens of the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', against the more popular view that ''Homo sapiens'' arose as a species 200,000 years ago in Africa. Wu argues that while there were [[Early human migrations|migrations]] outside of Africa within the last 100,000 years, these did not replace the human population already settled in China. He claims there is evidence of regional continuity in China in terms of [[Mongoloid]] cranial morphology, but that there was always gene flow between the indigenous occupants and African migrants.
