Doesn't appear to be notable. The majority of sources here come nowhere near RS, by the looks of it, and what we have is little more than short reviews. &nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 02:07, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' From the page: "the song did not chart but in 2014 the song was featured in a Vodafone advert." It doesn't seem worth keeping a page about a song that isn't notable for anything. [[User:Szsmr|Szsmr]] ([[User talk:Szsmr|talk]]) 02:48, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per [[WP:MUSICBIO#C1]].--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 06:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::[[WP:MUSICBIO#C1]] is for musicians and ensembles. As this is a song article, the relevant guideline would be [[WP:NSONG]]. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 17:35, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Ah, thank you. I believe it also meets [[WP:GNG]].--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 18:47, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I don't see that this song is notable per the [[WP:NSONG]] guideline, and the article is more about the music video than it is about the song itself. Sourcing issues per Crisco 1492. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 17:35, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
**To clarify, I don't believe it meets [[WP:GNG]] either. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 02:42, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' Though it needs work, the song is the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works per [[WP:NSONG]]. Of the three sources Crisco questioned on the DYK nom, I was able to find the first two hosted by a mainstream magazine (reliable per [[WP:NEWSBLOG]], perhaps?) See if you could squeeze more criticism of the song as you can from the reviews cited; [http://www.factmag.com/2013/01/23/bonobo-drops-new-single-plus-probable-album-countdown/ here] is another source from ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]'' magazine, from before the music video was released.

*'''Delete''' or '''Merge''' into [[The North Borders]] - has not been ranked on any significant chart or won any reward. Most sources are short reviews, many for the album, not the song itself. Does not meet [[WP:NSONG]]. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 22:53, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' The number of references seem to help it barely meet [[:WP:GNG]] even though they're short, the sheer number shows some interest in the subject. [[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 22:36, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
