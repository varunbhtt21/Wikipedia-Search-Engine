Dhody, [[AVSM]].<ref name="Nath2009"/>

The regiment took part in Operation Trident in 1987, in counter-insurgency operations in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] during [[Operation Rakshak]].

==Cap badge==
The regiment had initially deliberated on two patterns of cap badges:<ref name="Nath2009"/>
* A pair of crossed lances with pennons. The number "85" placed around the crossing. A silhouette bust of the horse placed in the upper angle. The regimental motto placed in [[Devanagari]] script on a scroll below.
* A pair of crossed lances with pennons. The number "85" placed on the upper angle. A tank silhouette within laurel leaves placed on the crossing.

In contravention to the practice of each regiment having a unique badge, the Army Headquarters proposed a common design for all armoured regiments raised post 1977. This was strongly opposed by all regiments. In the event, this design, proposed as the common badge, became the cap badge of the 85th Armoured Regiment.<ref name="Nath2009"/>

The cap badge consists of a Vijayanta tank in silhouette surrounded by laurel leaves with a mailed fist or gauntlet at the top.<ref name="Nath2009"/>
