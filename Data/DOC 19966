The '''Alaska Peninsula brown bear''' or '''peninsular grizzly''' (''Ursus arctos gyas'')<ref name="ITIS">{{Cite web |title=''Ursus arctos gyas'' Merriam, 1902 |url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=726991#null |publisher=ITIS}}</ref> is a subspecies of [[brown bear]] that lives in the coastal regions of southern [[Alaska]], although according to some sources it is a population of the mainland [[grizzly bear]] subspecies (''Ursus arctos horribilis''),<ref name="Brown Bear">{{cite web|title=Brown Bear|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=brownbear.main|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game}}</ref> or the [[Kodiak bear]] subspecies (''U. a. middendorffi'').<ref>Burt.

Alaska Peninsula brown bears are a very large [[brown bear]] subspecies, usually ranging in weight from 800 to 1,200 pounds (363 to 544&nbsp;kg).<ref>Whitaker, John O. (1980). ''The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals.'' {{ISBN|0-394-50762-2}}.</ref> They are found in high densities along the southern Alaskan coast due not only to the large amount of [[clam]]s and [[sedge grass]] but also to the annual [[salmon]] runs; this allows them to attain huge sizes, some of the biggest in the world.<ref name=Smith>{{cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-439-01-0001.pdf |title=Mammalian Species- Ursus arctos |publisher=American Society of Mammalogists, Smith College |accessdate=2012-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053247/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-439-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> They may gather in large numbers at feeding sites, such as [[Brooks Camp|Brooks Falls]] and [[McNeil River|McNeil Falls]], both in [[Katmai National Park]] near [[King Salmon, Alaska|King Salmon]].

There is debate as to if Alaska Peninsula brown bears should be referred to as "grizzlies" along with all other North American subspecies of the brown bear. There is confusion experienced when referring to inland and coastal ones separately, but biologists still maintain that coastal ones are truly brown bears. However, it is considered correct to place all North American members of ''U. arctos'' in the subspecies ''horribilis'' except the giant [[Kodiak bear]]s of [[Kodiak Island]].<ref name="Brown or Grizzly Bear">{{cite web|title=Brown or Grizzly Bear|url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/brown-or-grizzly-bear.html|publisher=North American Bear Center}}</ref> To avoid confusion, many simply refer to all North American members, including Kodiaks, as "grizzly bears."<ref name="Grizzly Bear">{{cite web|title=Grizzly Bear|url=http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/mammals/grizzly-bear.aspx|publisher=National Wildlife Federation}}</ref>

Prized by hunters for their skulls and hides, up to 500 of Alaska's 1,500 brown bears killed yearly by hunters come from the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. To hunt this large bear, hunters must follow a variety of regulations, including bear bag limits, hunting fees and proper rifles.<ref name="Brown Bear Research in Alaska">{{cite web|title=Brown Bear Research in Alaska|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=551|publisher=ADFG}}</ref>

==Naming and etymology==
[[File:2~Bear~Diorama~AMNH~11-29-08.jpg|thumb|left|Taxidermied specimens, [[AMNH]]]]
The Alaska Peninsula brown bear's name most likely arose because, until 1975, they were considered a different species from the inland grizzly bear. They were never considered closer to [[European brown bear]]s than inland grizzlies, but were given a different name, due to the size and color differences of coastal browns and inland grizzlies. From 1975 onward, they were considered to be the same species, but coastal ones retained the name "brown bear."<ref name="Brown or Grizzly Bear"/>

==Appearance==
Alaska Peninsula brown bears are the second largest type of brown bear in the world, only after the giant bears of Kodiak Island. They usually measure 8 feet (2.4 m) in length, usually have a shoulder height of about 4-4-1/2 feet (1.2-1.4 m), and a hindfoot length of 11 in (28&nbsp;cm). One study found that the average weight for a coastal male was around 408&nbsp;kilograms (900&nbsp;lb). For a female, this average weight would be 227&nbsp;kilograms (500&nbsp;lb).<ref>{{cite web|title=Brown Bear|url=http://beartrust.org/brown-bear|publisher=Bear Trust International}}</ref> On the other hand, an occasional huge male brown has been recorded which greatly exceeds ordinary size, with weights reported up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>Wood, G.

Its weight was estimated at {{convert|725|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|771|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

==Diet==
[[File:A054, Katmai National Park, Brooks Falls, Alaska, USA, bear and salmon, 2002.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear in [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]] with salmon. Salmon make up the majority of the brown bear's diet during summer.]]
Brown bears on the Alaskan Peninsula usually feed on spawning [[salmon]], and use many different ways to catch them. These include waiting at the bottom of the falls for the fish to jump, or standing at the top of the falls waiting to catch the fish in midair (sometimes in their mouths). Bears also have much experience at chasing fish around and pinning the slippery animals with their claws. After the salmon runs, berries and grass make the mainstay of the bears' diets, after which they put on sufficient fat reserves and go into hibernation.<ref name="Grizzly Bear 2">{{cite web|title=Grizzly Bear|url=http://www.nps.gov/dena/naturescience/grizzlybear.htm|publisher=NPS}}</ref>
