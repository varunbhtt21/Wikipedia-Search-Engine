'''La Trenche Generating Station''' is a [[hydroelectric]] power plant on the [[Saint-Maurice River]] and within [[La Tuque]], in Upper-Mauricie, in the administrative region of [[Mauricie]], in [[Quebec]], in [[Canada]]. Its construction was completed in 1950. This power station was put into service immediately. It is the central 6th to block the river from its mouth. With its {{convert|302|MW}}, it is the most powerful.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} [[Hydro-Québec]] acquired La Trenche power from the [[Shawinigan Water & Power Company]].

This concrete dam-gravity type has a height of {{convert|53|m}} and a length {{convert|442|m}}. Its retaining capacity is 6 million cubic meters of water at the outlet of [[Tourouvre lake]]. The lake is formed by a widening of the [[Saint-Maurice River]] because the dam receives water from the [[Trenche River]].

== Toponymy ==
The dam is named after the [[Trenche River]].

The name "Tranche Dam" was officially registered on June 6, 2001 in the Bank of place names of the [[Commission de toponymie du Québec]] (Geographical Names Board of Québec).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/Fiche.aspx?no_seq=273817 |title=Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Québec) - Bank of place names - La Trenche power plant |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111040830/http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/Fiche.aspx?no_seq=273817 |archivedate=November 11, 2013 }}</ref>
