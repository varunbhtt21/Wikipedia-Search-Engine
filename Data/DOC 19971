==Sound and influence==

The band began the progress of recording the album in late 2012. Upon the album's release, on April 29 the album was described to have a "poppier/R&B influenced sound" and overall was a "collection of love songs" by Alter the Press.<ref name="alter the press">{{cite web|last=Garland |first=Emma |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2014/04/atp-album-review-cab-lock-me-up-ep.html |title=ATP! Album Review: The Cab - Lock Me Up EP |publisher=Alter The Press! |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}</ref> The album strives away from the band's previous [[studio album]] ''[[Symphony Soldier]]''{{'}}s [[pop punk]] and [[alternative rock]] sound and drives closer to a more recognizable radio friendly, [[dance-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound. The EP's second track "Moon" is an [[electropop]] influenced track fit for [[top forty]] radio. The opening self-titled track, "Lock Me Up" reverts to the band's themes on ''Symphony Soldier'', having a similar "thumping marching army" vibe.<ref name="alter the press"/> It was produced by [[Steve Mac]] and co-written by English singer and songwriter [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]]. The EP's third and fourth tracks; "Numbers" and "Stand Up" contain an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Urban contemporary|urban]] sound. The final track, "These Are The Lies" experiments with more [[electronica]] and [[dubstep]] sounds with a [[piano]]-driven and [[violin]]-influenced opening.
