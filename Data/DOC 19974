The second '''USS ''Marmora'' (IX-189)''' was a [[United States Navy]] [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] in commission from 1944 to 1946. She saw service as a mobile floating storage ship during and in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]].

==Construction and early history==
The ship was built as SS ''Montrolite'' by the [[American Shipbuilding Company]] at [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], in 1918. She operated in commercial service and was renamed SS ''J. S. Fitzsimmons'' in 1926.

After the outbreak of World War II, [[Standard Oil of California]] chartered ''J.S. Fitzsimmons'' on 22 April 1942. Under the [[Lend-Lease]] program, the [[United States]] transferred her to the [[Soviet Union]] on 14 October 1942. In Soviet service she was renamed SS ''Valerian Kuybyshev''. The Soviet Union returned her to the United States at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Territory of Hawaii]], on 13 December 1944, and the U.S. [[War Shipping Administration]] took control of her under her former name, SS ''J. S. Fitzsimmons''. The same day, the U.S. Navy acquired her from the War Shipping Administration under a [[bareboat charter]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] her with [[Lieutenant]] Grant R. Olsen, [[United States Naval Reserve|USNR]], [[Commanding officer|in command]] as the miscellaneous unclassified ship USS ''Marmora'' (IX-189) for use as a mobile floating storage ship.

==Service history==

===World War II===
Assigned to the Service Force, [[United States Pacific Fleet]], ''Marmora'' departed Pearl Harbor on 28 January 1945 bound for the [[Marshall Islands]], arriving at [[Eniwetok]] on 13 February 1945 for duty as a mobile floating storage ship. Four days later she continued on to [[Saipan]] in the [[Mariana Islands]], anchoring there on 27 February to begin unloading [[aviation gasoline]] she had  brought from Pearl Harbor.

On 31 March 1945, ''Marmora'' departed for the [[Caroline Islands]], reaching [[Ulithi]] on 3 April 1945. She next stopped at the [[Ryukyu Islands]], operating out of [[Okinawa]] from 28 May 1945 through the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on 15 August 1945.

===Postwar===
''Marmora'' continued to operate from Okinawa until 1 November 1945, when she departed bound for the [[United States Gulf Coast]] via Pearl Harbor and the [[Panama Canal]]. She arrived at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], on 4 January 1946.

==Disposal==
On 11 February 1946, ''Marmora'' [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] at Mobile and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration, returning to her former name SS ''J. C. Fitzsimmons''. She later was sold to the Pinto Island Metals Company for scrapping. She was delivered to Pinto Island Metals on 1 February 1947, and subsequently scrapped.
