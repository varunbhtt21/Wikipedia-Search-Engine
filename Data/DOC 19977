'''''Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse''''' is the fourteenth studio album by American singer and songwriter [[Mariah Carey]]. It was released on May 23, 2014, through [[Def Jam Recordings]], her only album on the label. The record had been in development since 2011; during its production, Carey hired friend and collaborator [[Randy Jackson]] to manage her career, before replacing him with another frequent collaborator, [[Jermaine Dupri]]. The album consists of guest appearances from [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]], [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], and [[Fabolous]], as well as gospel and R&B duo [[Mary Mary]], in addition to Carey's twins Moroccan and Monroe. On the deluxe edition of the album, [[R. Kelly]] and [[Mary J. Blige]] respectively make appearances on remixes of two songs - ''Betcha Gon' Know'' and ''It's a Wrap'' - taken from Carey's twelfth studio album ''[[Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel]]'' (2009). These remixes were originally intended to appear on Carey's canceled remix album, ''Angel's Advocate'' (2010).

Previously titled ''The Art of Letting Go'', the album was originally scheduled for release in 2012 following the single, "[[Triumphant (Get 'Em)]]" featuring [[Rick Ross]] and [[Meek Mill]]. However, after the song's underperformance, additional songs were recorded for the album, causing the release date to be pushed back several times throughout 2013 and again in 2014. Together with [[Bryan Michael Cox]], Carey and Dupri [[executive producer|executively produced]] the album. It is named after a self-portrait that Carey drew at the age of three-years old that she captioned "Me. I Am Mariah". "The Elusive Chanteuse" part of the title is one of Carey's many [[Nickname|monikers]].

After its release, the album was critically appreciated but was commercially unsuccessful, becoming the lowest selling release of Carey's career. ''Me. I Am Mariah...'' was promoted through a number of media appearances by Carey as well as [[The Elusive Chanteuse Show]]. Four singles were released from the album including, the [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] top-ten and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-twenty song "[[Beautiful (Mariah Carey song)|#Beautiful]]" (a duet with [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]]), as well as the less successful "[[The Art of Letting Go]]", "[[You're Mine (Eternal)]]", and "[[You Don't Know What to Do]]" featuring rapper Wale. Although the re-release of her 2002 album ''Charmbracelet'' was issued with a [[Parental Advisory]] warning in some territories, ''Me. I Am Mariah...'' is Carey's first studio album to bear the warning in the United States. Alternate edited versions were also released for the standard and deluxe versions of the album.

Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews. The review aggregator website [[Metacritic]] gives a weighted average rating to an album based upon the selected independent mainstream reviews it utilizes, and the album has a Metascore of a 67 out of 100 based on 15 reviews.<ref name=metacritic /> At [[AllMusic]], Andy Kellman rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying how Mariah has abandoned the brevity of her earlier releases, but says the songstress is "still capable of delivering 40 minutes of strong, supremely voiced R&B when she's up for it.". He also stated that the standard edition of the album could have worked better without the clumpy and jumbled "Money", the oddly cheap sounding "One More Try", and the stiff/empty "Thirsty".<ref name=allmusic /> Kenneth Partridge of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' rated the album a 77 out of 100, writing how Mariah has found her musical niche that her fans have come to expect that is a "mix of pop-classicist balladry and hip-hop-tinged summer jamming".<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6099198/mariah-carey-me-i-am-mariah-the-elusive-chanteuse-track-by-track-review|title=Mariah Carey, 'Me.

Jim Farber of ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' rated the album four stars out of five, writing how the title is not indicative of the release as a whole because he says Mariah is not "elusive" in the least on an album where she "made her talent more clear."<ref name=nydailynews /> At ''[[USA Today]]'', Elysa Gardner rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of four, remarking whether "Elusive or not, this chanteuse is a survivor, and that's a rare thing in today's fickle, polarized pop landscape."<ref name=usatoday /> Glenn Gamboa of ''[[Newsday]]'' graded the album an A-, commenting how Mariah has "nailed it" because she "goes for timeless [sounding music], with grand results."<ref name="Newsday-Music: Entertainment"/> At ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', Troy L. Smith graded the album a B, indicating how the music meanders towards the latter stages of the album, yet noting that Mariah still picks the correct collaborators to work with on the release.<ref name=Cleveland>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2014/05/mariah_carey_takes_a_trip_down.html|title=Mariah Carey gets nostalgic on 'Me.

Nick Murray of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the album three stars out five, observing how "stylistic cohesion is as elusive as the chanteuse herself."<ref name=rollingstone /> At ''[[The Guardian]]'', Caroline Sullivan rated the album three stars out of five, indicating how the release contains "a good deal of clutter", however, Mariah is "also at her most soulful and melodic" on a release she calls "a welcome return."<ref name=theguardian /> Eric Henderson of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' rated the album three stars out of five, observing how the release is chalked full of ''Un''disciplined R&B pastiches."<ref name=slantmagazine /> At ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Sarah Rodman gave a mixed review of the album, commenting on how even the good moments are "sabotaged", and the release as a whole is highly predictable with "a clutch of interchangeable slow-to-midtempo tunes long on pulsating atmosphere—several with distractingly fidgety rhythmic tracks—but short on melody or verve."<ref name=thebostonglobe>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2014/05/25/review-mariah-carey-mariah-the-elusive-chanteuse/41rWzLkTzZxsP8ZSD6uFHJ/story.html|title=CD REVIEW: Mariah Carey, 'Me.
