This is a list of '''members of the [[Victorian Legislative Council]]''' between the elections of 31 May 1922 and 4 June 1925. As half of the Legislative Council's terms expired at each triennial election, half of these members were elected at the 1922 triennial election with terms expiring in 1928, while the other half were elected at the 1919 triennial election with terms expiring in 1925.

The Electoral Provinces Boundaries Act 1903 defined 17 Provinces with two members each for a total of 34 members.<ref>
