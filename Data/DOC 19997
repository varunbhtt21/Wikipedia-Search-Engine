A rail line came to Pemberton Ferry in 1884.<ref name=rail/> It was a rail stop by the [[Withlacoochee River (Florida)|Withlacoochee River]] just north of where the I-75 bridge over Croom-Rital Road and Withlacoochee State Trail is today. The area is now mostly rural.

The Croom Tract is part of the [[Withlacoochee State Forest]]. There is also a 20,000 acre [[Croom Wildlife Management Area]]. Ruins in the area include 1900 Thomas House, old foundations, a brick vat, the remains of an iron railroad bridge, family cemeteries and pits from phosphate mining. The area once included a [[turpentine]] still, [[sawmill]], sugar mill, railroad switch out, railroad bridge and ferry. The area is now popular for turkey hunting and single track mountain biking.<ref>[http://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/trails/articles/2013/march/croom-tract-biking-withlacoochee-state-forest-amrhein.html "Biking the Croom trails in Withlacoochee State Forest, FL" by Saundra Amrhein (Visit Florida.com)]</ref> Another settlement in the area was known as Oriole and an abandoned Oriole cemetery remains in existence.

In 1886 a project to clear the Withlacoochee River for navigation went as far as Pemberton Ferry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A35NAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1659&lpg=PA1659&dq=%22Pemberton+Ferry%22&source=bl&ots=uvAtTBsZR6&sig=0S0pw1ZxgMHq0Ih-Nq9tp-LahZ4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZcNhU5eQEqjw2QXl-oCgAg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22Pemberton%20Ferry%22&f=false] 1659, 1660</ref>

A post office was located in the area from 1902 until 1935.<ref>[http://pascocemeteries.org/hernando_post_office.html]</ref>

Croom was on the west coast route of the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] to Tampa. A station and a branch line extended to Brooksville.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=l_0wAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA311&dq=croom+oriole+florida&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AsJhU765IefL8wG80oGYCg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=croom%20oriole%20florida&f=false A Guide to Florida for Tourists, Sportsmen and Settlers by Harrison Garfield Rhodes, Mary Wolfe Dumont] Dodd, Mead and Company, 1912 page 311</ref> The iron bridge was a [[trestle]] for logging trains.

The [[South Florida Railroad]] finished the construction of the 57-mile Pemberton’s Ferry Branch in May 1886. It ran from Bartow to Lakeland, where it crossed the South Florida mainline, north to Pemberton’s Ferry, where it interchanged with the [[Florida Southern Railway]].<ref>Tapline</ref>
