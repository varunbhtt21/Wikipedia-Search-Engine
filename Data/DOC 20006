The [[AllMusic]] review recommended the album awarding it 3 stars and stating "Bishop plays a great deal of music in a short period of time. The performances are essentially classic bebop, although 11 of the 16 tunes (five by Bishop) can be considered obscurities. An underrated gem".<ref name="AllMusic">Yanow, S., [http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-walter-bishop-trio-mw0000029830 AllMusic Review] accessed May 1, 2014</ref>
