Russian theater artist that I've tried to find any info on-but nothing. Can't find any info at all.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 03:36, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*<s>'''Delete''' per lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. </s>[[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 14:50, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as not notable and not properly documented.--[[User:Dthomsen8|DThomsen8]] ([[User talk:Dthomsen8|talk]]) 02:54, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. I like how people don't know anything and say things like "lack of coverage", "not notable". How would you know if he were? You can't write his name in Russian or Georgian, so you can't check... He is notable and there's enough coverage: [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE+%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B7%D0%B5#hl=en&q=%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE+%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B7%D0%B5&tbm=bks in Russian], [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%E1%83%9C%E1%83%98%E1%83%99%E1%83%9D+%E1%83%92%E1%83%9D%E1%83%AA%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98%E1%83%AB%E1%83%94#hl=en&q=%E1%83%9C%E1%83%98%E1%83%99%E1%83%9D+%E1%83%92%E1%83%9D%E1%83%AA%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98%E1%83%AB%E1%83%94&tbm=bks in Georgian]. --[[User:Moscow Connection|Moscow Connection]] ([[User talk:Moscow Connection|talk]]) 21:16, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' For those who don't know Cyrillic, I think his name is Нико Готсириж/Нико Готсириѕ/Нико Готсириџ? I'm not sure about the last character. --[[User:AmaryllisGardener|<font color="#E0115F">'''Amaryllis'''</font><font color="#74C365">'''Gardener'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:AmaryllisGardener|'''talk''']]</sup> 03:14, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' He is notable with several mentions in substantial books. Being a "people's artist" is a high rank. By the way, the cyrillic form is usually '''Нико Гоциридзе'''.  The article does require someone fluent in Russian and/or Georgian to appropriately develop it and footnote it. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 08:00, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
:The article now has three citations, and more than three times the text. --08:37, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per insights offered by Ruskie editors. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 15:35, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-Thanks to the people who helped update this page-AFD's don't always hurt the article, they can help get people in as well to keep the article. I am not sure if I should withdraw or not though given the fact I'm pretty sure this will be closed soon. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:28, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', per Candleabracadabra, that Russkies have spoken.  To [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]]: It is helpful to all that you as nominator have indicated a willingness to withdraw the nomination, but given that someone else has voted Delete, the rule or practice is that you cannot simply Close the AFD yourself.
