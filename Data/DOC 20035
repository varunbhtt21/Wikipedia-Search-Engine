The '''1901 Louisiana hurricane''' was the first hurricane to make [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in [[Louisiana]] in the month of August or earlier since [[1888 Atlantic hurricane season|1888]].<ref name="wpc"/> The fourth [[tropical cyclone]] and second hurricane of the [[1901 Atlantic hurricane season|season]], this storm developed southwest of the [[Azores]] on August&nbsp;2. Moving southwestward and later westward, the depression remained weak for several days, until strengthening into a tropical storm while approaching the [[Bahamas]] early on August&nbsp;9. It then crossed through the islands and intensified only slightly. Late on August&nbsp;10, the storm made landfall near [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]]. After reaching the [[Gulf of Mexico]] the next day, continuous intensifying occurred and by August&nbsp;12, the storm reached hurricane status. Peaking with winds of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h), it struck [[Louisiana]] late on August&nbsp;14 and then [[Mississippi]] less than 24&nbsp;hours later. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on August&nbsp;16 and became [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] several hours later.

Along portions of the east coast of Florida, "considerable damage" was reported due to strong winds. In [[Alabama]], trees were uprooted, houses were de-roofed, and chimneys collapsed in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. Some areas of the city were also inundated with up to {{convert|18|in|mm}} of water due to storm tide. Several yachts, schooners, and ships were wrecked or sunk, resulting in at least $70,000 (1901&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage.{{#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1901 [[United States dollar|USD]], unless otherwise noted|group="nb"}} However, due to warnings by the Weather Bureau, the Mobile Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded. All towns along the coast of Mississippi "suffered seriously". In Louisiana, severe damage was reported at some towns due to strong winds and high tides. The community of [[Port Eads, Louisiana|Port Eads]] reported that only the lighthouse was not destroyed, while other sources state that an office building also remained standing. In [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], overflowing levees inundated numerous streets. Outside the city, crops suffered severely, particularly rice. Overall, the storm caused 10–15&nbsp;deaths and $1&nbsp;million in damage.

==Meteorological history==
{{Storm path|1901 Atlantic hurricane 4 track.png}}
A tropical depression developed about {{convert|615|mi|km}} southwest of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores Island]], [[Azores]] at 0000&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on August&nbsp;2. The depression moved southwestward and remained weak for several days. On August&nbsp;5, it re-curved west-southwestward and then westward while passing north of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The next day, the system curved west-northwestward and briefly to the west on August&nbsp;8. Finally, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 0000&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;9, while located about {{convert|50|mi|km}} northeast of [[Cat Island, Bahamas]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Around that time, the [[National Weather Service|Weather Bureau]] first observed a "feeble disturbance in the subtropical north of Cuba."<ref name="mwr">{{cite report|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/mwr_pdf/1901.pdf|title=Forecasts and Warnings|author=Edward B.

Early on August&nbsp;11, the storm weakened slightly while crossing Florida. It then decelerated and reached the eastern Gulf of Mexico several hours later. Thereafter, the system began to re-strengthen and became a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on the modern-day [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale]] at 1200&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;12. Early the next day, the storm attained its [[maximum sustained wind]] speed of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h). It weakened slightly early on August&nbsp;14 and curved northwestward while approaching the coast of Louisiana. At 2100&nbsp;UTC, the storm made landfall near [[Buras, Louisiana|Buras]] with winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h). Curving northeastward, the hurricane re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico early on August&nbsp;15. However, around 1700&nbsp;UTC, it made another landfall near [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]] at the same intensity. Early on August&nbsp;16, the system weakened to a tropical storm. It then weakened much quicker and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] over Mississippi at 0000&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;17. The remnant extratropical cyclone persisted until late the next day, at which time it dissipated over [[Indiana]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

==Preparations and impact==
As the storm approached the east coast of [[Florida]] on August&nbsp;10, a warning was sent to all [[National Weather Service|Weather Bureau]] stations in Florida, as well as [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], regarding a "disturbance of moderate intensity", which posed a threat to small crafts in Florida and the western [[the Bahamas|Bahamas]]. The next day, as the storm was moving across Florida, another message sent to Weather Bureau stations from [[New Orleans]] to Charleston warned of the potential for severe squalls along the west coast of Florida. While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States on August&nbsp;13, storm warnings were ordered for [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]], as well as for the west coast of Florida. At the [[National Weather Service New Orleans/Baton Rouge, Louisiana|National Weather Service office]] in New Orleans, hurricane warnings were ordered in Louisiana from mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] westward on August&nbsp;15 and expanded to eastern [[Texas]] later that day. In New Orleans, 500&nbsp;men, who were city authorities or levee board members, worked to strengthen the levees along canals in the city. Throughout much of the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], vessels and ships were warned to take precautions and remain in port.<ref name="mwr"/> 

In Florida, "considerable damage" due to strong winds was reported along portions of the east coast. Wind gusts reached {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].<ref name="partagas">{{cite report|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/Partagas/1901-1904/1901_1.pdf|title=Year 1901|author=Jose Fernandez Partagas and Henry F.

Tides inundated the cotton exchange with up to {{convert|18|in|mm}} of water, while the [[Western Union]], [[United States Postal Service|post office]], and electrical house for railroads were also flooded. The pleasure yacht ''Ariel'', which was bound for the [[Fish River (Alabama)|Fish River]], was smashed into pieces at a wharf along the eastern end of [[Mobile Bay]]. Between 12 and 15 schooners from the F. F. Saunders company fishing fleet were badly damaged; four of which sank, resulting in $70,000 in damage.<ref name="lahe">{{cite news|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH19010817.2.18&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN------#|title=Hurricane's Great Havoc Near Mobile|date=August 17, 1901|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]|publisher=[[California Digital Newspaper Collection]]|accessdate=May 1, 2014|location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref> However, due to warnings by the Weather Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded.

High winds and rough seas were observed in Louisiana. In [[Port Eads, Louisiana|Port Eads]], five-minute sustained winds reached {{convert|56|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, before the anemometer blew away. At the same location, a 24-hour rainfall record was set for the month of August, with {{convert|7.64|in|mm}} of precipitation observed.<ref name="wpc">{{cite report|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/lahur.pdf|title=Louisiana Hurricane History|author=David M. Roth|date=April 8, 2010|work=[[Weather Prediction Center]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=May 1, 2014|location=College Park, Maryland|format=PDF}}</ref> According to a contemporaneous report, the weather instrument shelter was swept away due to storm tides and the flag staff was broken. While the office building did weather the storm intact, documents in it were soaked.<ref name="mwr"/> However, a report written in 2010 states that in Port Eads only the lighthouse remained standing in the aftermath of the devastation.<ref name="wpc"/> Fifteen fatalities were reported after a house was swept away by storm tides.<ref name="partagas"/> The 2010 report, however, states that a total of ten deaths were caused by the storm over its entire existence.<ref name="wpc"/> In [[Pilottown, Louisiana|Pilottown]], the large "lookout" tower was toppled and destroyed. The outhouse that displaymen used and slept in was blown over and then rapidly filled with water, due to tides rising to {{convert|4|ft|m}} in only 10&nbsp;minutes. Additionally, property of the Weather Bureau was also damaged.<ref name="mwr"/>

Buras reported {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water in town.<ref name="wpc"/> River stages along the Mississippi River at New Orleans rose to a level of {{convert|7|ft|m}} during the storm, producing much flooding. The [[Carondelet Canal]] also overflowed, inundating streets in the neighborhood of [[Tremé]] with {{convert|1|to|3|ft|m}} of water. Levee breaks around New Orleans flooded the city. Additionally, strong winds littered the streets with tree branches. The worst hit areas of New Orleans were the neighborhoods of Bucktown, [[Milneburg, New Orleans|Milneburg]], [[West End, New Orleans|West End]], all of which are located on the shore of [[Lake Pontchartrain]].<ref name="mwr"/> In the New Orleans suburb of Shell Beach, severe crop damage was reported, particularly to rice. While sailing the Mississippi River just outside New Orleans, Dr. J. N. Thomas reported that a schooner and a small boat were wrecked, resulting in 60&nbsp;deaths.<ref name="lahe"/> However, this was not confirmed. Overall, damage in Louisiana reached $1&nbsp;million, which excluded losses to crops.<ref name="mwr"/>
