Not sure how Express entertainment works, bt the article just lists info from that ref and links to Facebook, maybe more info is needed, but this does appear to be a AFD right now. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 16:48, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - The article text was obviously a copyvio and has been removed, leaving a one-line, unreferenced stub. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 04:24, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
Yeah just saw the edits you did-thanks. Since I have no clue how television shows work in Asia, I am really not sure what exactly Express TV is. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 04:30, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
