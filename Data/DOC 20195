'''The Hipstones''' are an Australian/American seven-piece [[Soul music|soul]], [[jazz]] and [[funk]] musical group that formed in 2006.

==History==

The band was formed in 2006, by Mark Palmer and Anthea White, during a six month contract gig at the [[Tokyo]] [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton]] in [[Shinjuku]], [[Japan]].<ref name=jammit>{{cite web|last=Jamm|first=Rick|title=Interview: Premier Soul Band The Hipstones Tell it All and More|url=http://jamsphere.com/videos/interview-premier-soul-band-the-hipstones-tell-it-all-and-more|work=Jamsphere|publisher=Jamsphere|accessdate=01/05/14}}</ref> The couple then moved to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] where they formed a 10 piece band and began recording their first album, ''Something's Gonna Start.''<ref>{{cite news|title=Eon Beats & The Hipstones join forces for Basement gig|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/9231/Eon-Beats-Hipstones-join-forces-for-Basement-gig|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Faster Louder|date=30 May 2007}}</ref>

Prior to the release of their second album, the band moved to [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to both develop their musical style and take advantage of the city's vibrant original music scene.<ref name=tran_article />  The album, [[Dreamers (The Hipstones Album)|Dreamers]], was released in 2009.

The band is now permanently based in New York City.

The Hipstones' third album ''Wise Man'' was funded by the band’s fans through [[crowd sourcing]]. The album was produced by [[Justin Stanley]], who has also produced for [[Nikka Costa]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Jamie Liddel]] and [[Chaka Chan]]. It is set to be released in mid-2014.<ref name=tran_article />

==Style==
The band's music spans a variety of tempo's and styles. Performances see the band fuse traditional jazz, soul and funk with a variety of other alternative including [[beat-boxing]], voice modulation and [[Oud]].<ref name=mcnamara>{{cite web|last=McNamara|first=Aimee|title=Review: The Hipstones and Virna Sanzone|url=http://blog.sydneyfringe.com/review-the-hipstones-and-virna-sanzone/|work=Sydney Fringe|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=smith_drummedia>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Michael|title=Something's Gonna Start Review|newspaper=Drum Media|date=18 September 2011}}</ref>

Michael Smith of Drum Media, said that "tonally White is closer to the glistening dulcet tones of local pop diva Abby Dobson than the edgy growl of the classic soul queens, but that merely adds an evocative ache to songs like Revolution."<ref name=smith_drummedia />
