'''[[Interstate&nbsp;96]]''' is an Interstate Highway that runs for approximately {{convert|192|mi|km}} entirely within [[Michigan]] from an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]] (BUS US&nbsp;31) near [[Norton Shores, Michigan|Norton Shores]] to [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] near the [[Ambassador Bridge]] in [[Detroit]]. From [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] through [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] to Detroit, the freeway parallels Grand River Avenue, never straying more than a few miles from it. Grand River Avenue originated as an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trail before Michigan statehood, and it was later used as a wagon road and state trunkline. Construction of a freeway along the length of the corridor was proposed in the 1940s, and included as part of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950s. This construction was started in 1956 and initially completed across the state to Detroit in 1962. I-96 was completed on November 21, 1977. Since then, additional interchanges and lanes have been added in places to accommodate traffic needs. ([[Interstate 96|'''more...''']])
