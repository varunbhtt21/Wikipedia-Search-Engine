12th season(?) of which there is no article for any other season. Appears to be an event within Minecraft, making it fail per [[WP:GNG]], [[WP:WEBCRIT]], or [[WP:GAMECRUFT]] [[User:Loriendrew|<font color="#005000">&#9790;Loriendrew&#9789;</font>]] [[User talk:Loriendrew|<font color="#000080">&#9743;''(talk)''</font>]] 04:25, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Speedy delete''' This is a really confusing article, as it completely lacks context. From this website[http://bigbrotherminecraft.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Big_Brother_4], it appears to be a fan-made cross-over between [[Minecraft]] and the [[Big Brother (TV series)]]. It pretty clearly fails notability requirements. I'd recommend a speedy delete per A7.

*'''Endorse [[WP:CSD#A7|speedy A7]]''': A fan-made [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]-style contest run in a [[Minecraft]] game server world. Fails [[WP:GAMECRUFT]] and possibly [[WP:NOTWEBHOST]].
