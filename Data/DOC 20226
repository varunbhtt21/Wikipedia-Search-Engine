After the death of [[Ali Mohammed Khan]] [[Rohilla]] in 1748, the region of [[Rohilkhand]] split into numerous independent chieftaincies. The most powerful chiefs among the Rohillas were Hafiz Rahmat Khan, [[Najib ad-Dawlah]], Faizullah Khan, Ali Mohammed Khan Bangesh and Dundy Khan. In 1772 the total force of the Rohilla leaders was estimated at 80,000 cavalry and infantry. But the independence of each chief rendered it very difficult to effect a union of military power.<ref>Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volume 12 page 429</ref> Due to this division and lack of unity, Rohilla chieftaincies fell to joint forces of Awadh and [[East India Company]] one by one in 1774. Rohilla chiefs like [[Zabita Khan]] and Faizullah Khan did not lose their lands.
