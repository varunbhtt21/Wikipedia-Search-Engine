'''Cinco Vodka''' is a [[:wikt:handmade#Adjective|hand-made]] American [[vodka]] produced in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]].  Founded by Richard "Trey" Azar III, Cinco Vodka is made from [[Idaho]]-sourced [[wheat]] and naturally filtered water drawn from the [[Edwards Aquifer]]; it is the first European-style Texas vodka.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cinco Story|url=http://www.cincovodka.com/CincoStory.aspx|access-date=2014-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044129/http://www.cincovodka.com/CincoStory.aspx|archive-date=2014-10-06|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

Cinco Vodka is made in small batches according to European tradition, and is the only Texas vodka that is made from 100% wheat, rather than corn. It is [[Distilled beverage|distilled]] five times from Idaho-sourced amber wheat in the distillery's 530-[[gallon]] hand-hammered [[copper]] kettle.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cadillac of vodka: Texas' own Cinco Vodka attacks America's dependency on foreign liquor|url=http://houston.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/10-10-11-the-cadillac-of-vodka-texas-own-cinco-vodka-attacks-americas-depedency-on-foreign-liquor/|publisher=CultureMap|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref>

The [[motto]] of Cinco Vodka is "The [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] lover's vodka," which alludes to Richard Azar's vision of creating an American ultra-premium vodka that rivals traditional European imports such as [[Grey Goose (vodka)|Grey Goose]], [[Ketel One]], and [[Belvedere (vodka)|Belvedere]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lankford|first=Randy|title=That's the Spirit|newspaper=S.A.
