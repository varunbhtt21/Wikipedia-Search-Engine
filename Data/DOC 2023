Possible hoax, as I can find no reliable sources of these awards at all. The only link I found was a link to Twitter, where I don't think it's a Google or notable project at all. [[User:Good888|good888]] ([[User talk:Good888|talk]]) 16:51, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Speedy delete''' Fails WP:V and there's no way Google is reducing itself to the pop culture ground wore down by teen mags like ''J-14'' and ''Tiger Beat''. <font face="Myriad Web">'''[[User:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:royalblue4">Nate</span>]]''' <span style="color:dark blue">•</span> <small>''([[User_talk:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:darkgoldenrod">chatter</span>]])''</small></font> 00:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Speedy delete.''' Per everyone else, and it also creates '''SERIOUS''' BLP violations. [[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 01:33, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
