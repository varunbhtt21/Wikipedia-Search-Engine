He continued to be very active in media politics in the 1980s when he was then the editor in chief of the aforesaid newspaper. In the late 1980s, he held his first political office as an LCI Councillor for [[Nakawa Division]].

It was about that time that he co-founded the [[Forum for Democratic Change]] (FDC) with [[Kiiza Besigye]] and others.
