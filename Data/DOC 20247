==Production==
Gierasch came up with the concept of ''Fractured'' (then titled ''Schism'') after he talked Anderson out of a potentially unpleasant plane trip, which made him feel guilty.<ref name=DC1>{{cite web|last=Decker|first=Sean|title=Screamfest LA 2013 Exclusive: Adam Gierasch and Ashlynn Yennie Talk Schism World Premiere|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/71091/screamfest-la-2013-exclusive-adam-gierasch-and-ashlynn-yennie-talk-schism-world-premiere#axzz30R4CiZkg|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> From there he wondered about the concept of guilt and redemption and "Can you change your fate, or are you damned forever once you fuck up? Can you ever truly make amends?"<ref name=DC1 /> From there Gierasch and Anderson wrote the script and planned for filming to take place in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=DC1 /> Gierasch chose to cast [[Ashlynn Yennie]] in the film due to her role in ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|The Human Centipede]]''.<ref name=DC2>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Staci Layne|title=Exclusive: Adam Gierasch Talks Fractured|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/75354/exclusive-adam-gierasch-talks-fractured#axzz30R4CiZkg|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> The film was given its world premiere in 2013 under the name ''Schism'', but had to undergo a name change before it was given a further release due to the foreign sales company handling the movie.<ref name=DC2 />

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
''[[Fearnet]]'' gave a positive review for ''Fractured'' and praised one of the film's death scenes, as they found it "so dark, disturbing, and visually powerful that it allows one to overlook some rather egregiously cheap CGI gun play that pops up later on."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=FEARNET Movie Review - Fractured|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-fractured|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> 
Patrick Cooper from [[Bloody Disgusting]] praised the film, writing, "a sexy blend of nightmarish horror and mystery that’s as consistently intriguing as it is disturbing. It takes a while for the film to build up steam as it piles up its clues and puzzles, but once it gets going ''Fractured'' delivers a haunting portrait of a normal guy trying to save his soul from damnation."<ref name="cooper14">{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Patrick |title=[BD Review] 'Fractured' a Sexy Blend of Nightmarish Horror and Mystery! - Bloody Disgusting |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3283838/bd-review-horror-and-neo-noir-had-a-baby-named-fractured/ |website=Bloody Disgusting.com |publisher=Patrick Cooper |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref> 


In contrast, ''[[Shock Till You Drop]]'' and ''[[About.com]]'' both gave less positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web|last=Doro|first=Paul|title=Review: Fractured is a Film With An Identity Crisis|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/352053-review-fractured-2014/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> with ''About.com'' stating that the acting of the film's leads was solid but that the supporting cast was "more uneven" and that the direction was "visually bland".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Mark H.|title='Fractured' Movie Review|url=http://horror.about.com/od/2014theatricalreviews/fl/Fractured-Movie-Review.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> Scott Hallam from [[Dread Central]] awarded the film a score of 2.5 out of 5, writing, "''Fractured'' is something of a mystery, something of a horror film, but not much of either. Outstanding practical F/X save this movie and make it something at least worth giving a glace. And if not for the F/X, it’s worth it for LaLiberte’s performance. The movie has a concept that possibly could work, but ultimately falls flat. It’s not a bad effort, but it never grabs the audience outside of a couple practical F/X scenes."<ref name="hallam14">{{cite web |last1=Hallam |first1=Scott |title=Fractured (2014) - Dread Central |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/52799/fractured-2014/ |website=Dread Central.com |publisher=Scott Hallam |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref> Paul Doro from ''[[Comingsoon.net]]'' gave the film a ShockScore of 3/10, atating, "''Fractured'' doesn’t know what kind of movie it’s trying to be. It’s got a bluesy score and appears to be trying for noir at times, but it has no sense of what type of mood that necessitates. The visions are out of a horror movie, but it never generates any suspense and is certainly never scary."<ref name="doro">{{cite web |last1=Doro |first1=Paul |title=Review: Fractured is a Film With An Identity Crisis - ComingSoon.net |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/740561-review-fractured-2014 |website=Comingsoon.net |publisher=Paul Doro |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref>
