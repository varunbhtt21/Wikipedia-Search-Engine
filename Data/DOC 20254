[[American Film Institute]]'s magazine ''AFI Preview'' praised the "charismatic performances" and its "terrific photography and music."<ref name=afi/> Mariane Morisawa of ''[[IstoÉ|IstoÉ Gente]]'' and José Geraldo Couto of ''[[Folha de S. Paulo]]'' called it a counterpart of [[Fernando Meirelles]]' ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' as it focuses on the good things of a ''favela'' in opposition to the violence depicted in Meirelles' film.<ref name=istoe/><ref name=folha>{{cite web | url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/critica/ult569u890.shtml | title="Uma Onda no Ar", de Helvécio Ratton, amplifica voz da favela | date=September 6, 2002 | work=[[Folha de S. Paulo]] | accessdate=May 1, 2014 | language=Portuguese}}</ref> Morisawa praised the actors but labeled its screenplay and editing "somewhat loose" which makes it "just nice" and "dilutes the strength of its message."<ref name=istoe/> Although he praised its music, Couto stated that it fails with its dialogues and supporting cast. He claimed that ''City of God'' may triumph over ''Something in the Air'' in technical aspects but that that only served to hide its "moral emptiness"; Couto would like to see a film that is as technically great as Meirelles' and also has an "ethical-political commitment" like Ratton's.<ref name=folha/>
