Title : Citadel spread
Text : '''Citadel Spread''' is a [[paste (food)|paste]] made of [[peanut butter]], oil, sugar and [[milk powder]].  First developed as a trail food for [[hiking|hikers]], a Citadel Spread resembles common ready-to-use [[therapeutic food]] (RUTF) formulations, such as  [[Plumpy'nut]].

==Composition and advantages==
A key feature of Citadel Spread is the use of [[powdered milk]] in a recipe with no water, making it difficult for bacteria to grow and giving the nutritional advantages of milk with a long shelf life, as demonstrated in a clinical study comparing F100 and Plumpy'nut.<ref name="AJCN">{{Cite journal

Another feature  of Citadel Spreads is the low cost of manufacturing, storing, and distribution. These features made formulations like Citadel Spread a practical ready-to-use food.<ref name="ISBN 978-92-806-4147-9">{{cite web|last=A Joint Statement by the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition and the United Nations Children’s Fund|title=Community-Based Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition |url=|publisher=World Health Organization/World Food Programme/United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition/The United Nations Children’s Fund, 2007}}</ref>

==History==
Frank Delfino, former [[Skippy (peanut butter)|Skippy]] plant manager and engineer, remembers the Alameda plant producing around 500 cases of a ready-to-use fortified food in the 1960s, using peanut oil with added vitamins and minerals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Krampner|first=Jon|title=Creamy & crunchy : an informal history of peanut butter, the all-American food|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231162326}}</ref> Skippy proposed a collaboration with the US government to use the product for nutritional needs of children, but the proposal was not adopted.

In 1971, [[Edward B. Garvey]] published “Appalachian Hiker: Adventure of a Lifetime”. By the time Garvey published “The New Appalachian Trail (Appalachian Hiker)” in 1997, the vegetarian version of Citadel Spread that uses vegetable oil instead of bacon grease had become a popular hiking trail food in the USA.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garvey|first=Edward B|title=Appalachian Hiker: Adventure of a Lifetime|publisher=Appalachian Books|isbn=0912660015|date=January 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Garvey|first=Ed|title=The New Appalachian Trail (Appalachian Hiker)|publisher=Menasha Ridge Press}}</ref>

==Applications==
Ready-to-use therapeutic foods, which possibly mimic the Citadel Spread recipe, are manufactured for treatment of [[malnutrition|severe acute malnutrition]], as shown in one clinical report.<ref name=AJCN/> Such formulations support rapid weight gain, supply multiple [[essential nutrient]]s and are easy for children to eat because they can feed themselves the soft paste from a tear-open individual package. The fortified peanut butter-like paste contains fats, carbohydrates, proteins ([[nutrient#Types of nutrient|macronutrients]]), vitamins and minerals ([[micronutrient]]s). Peanut butter is relatively high in calories and an excellent source of [[vitamin E]], [[B vitamins]], [[dietary fiber]] and numerous [[dietary mineral]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nutrition facts for peanut butter, smooth style, with salt, 100 g, USDA Nutrient Database |publisher = Conde Nast| url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4366/2|date=2014|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>
