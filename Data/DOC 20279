Title : Kidin-Hutran
Text : '''Kidin-Hutran''' is  a middle-Elamite king of the ''Igihalkid'' dynasty known for his wars with [[Babylonia]].  The Babylonian Chronicle P  describes two Kidin-Hutran attacks (iv 14-22).<ref>A. Kirk Grayson. Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, Eisenbrauns, 2000</ref>  In his first raid, he crossed Tigris, sacked Der and [[Nippur]] and deposed the Babylonian king (almost certainly an Assyrian puppet) ''Enlil-nadin-shumi''. Later on, during the reign of [[Addad-Shuma-Iddina]], he attacked Babylonia again, striking Marad and [[Isin]] <ref>{{cite book | title = The Archaeology of Elam | author = .T.Potts | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 1999 | pages = 208 }}p.234</ref>

Kidin-Hutran is also mentioned in the so-called Berlin letter ([[Pergamon Museum]] ,VAT17020), a neo-Babylonian copy of a letter sent by an unnamed Elamite king to the Babylonian court, stating his right to the Babylonian throne.<ref>J. Goldberg . The Berlin Letter, Middle Elamite Chronology and Sutruk-Nahhunte Iâ€™s Genealogy . Iranica Antiqua,  39, 2004</ref>  The letter states that  Kidin-Hurtan was a son of the king [[Untash-Napirisha]] and a grandson of the Babylonian king [[Burna-Buriash]].

Since there is more than 100 years distance between the end of Burna-Buriash reign and the accession of Addad-Shuma-Iddina, some authors <ref>F. Vallat, L'Elam du lie millenaire et la chronologie courte,  in Akkadica, Akkadica 119-120 (2000), pp. 7-17</ref> assume that there were more than one king with this name.
