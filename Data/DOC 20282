* ... that writer and pharmacist '''[[Hagop Terzian]]''' ''(pictured)'' was imprisoned, deported, and ultimately murdered during the [[Armenian Genocide]]?

:* '''Concern''' "Murder" is a very specific crime. Is killed, executed or assassinated more accurate? [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] ([[User talk:Hipocrite|talk]]) 15:33, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::* {{ping|Hipocrite}} Since he was killed during the [[Armenian Genocide]] and since genocides are considered "[[mass murder]]s", I assumed it would be safe to say he was murdered. Besides, the infobox for the Armenian Genocide article says that the "Attack type" is mass murder. Hence, I think using the term murder would be more aligned with the Armenian Genocide article and the consensus reached over its terminology. Assassination can work too. But I believe assassination is limited to a political motive. This may not accurately describe his murder since he wasn't a politician or anything of that sort; he was merely a writer and pharmacist who just happened to be born Armenian. Nevertheless, I do believe there was a political motive behind the Armenian Genocide but some academics argue it may not have been the only motive. At any rate, either term is fine with me.

:::* I'm fine with either, just raising the concern. Appreciate you addressing it. [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] ([[User talk:Hipocrite|talk]]) 17:06, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Okay, thank you Hipocrite. [[User:EtienneDolet|Étienne Dolet]] ([[User talk:EtienneDolet|talk]]) 17:08, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
