Non-notable company. Unreferenced (except for the company website) since 2009, when it was created by an SPA; no significant editing since then. In a search I could find nothing significant about this company, or its other name BH Fitness, or its parent company BH Group. Tagged for the past five years for references, notability, and orphan status. I'm surprised this article lasted so long.

*'''Comment''' - I found tons of independent reviews of BH bikes, which is a part of this conglomerate, but oddly not mentioned in the article. Here is a sampling of the industry news I found: [[http://www.bicycleretailer.com/north-america/2013/03/28/pivot-cycles-sells-stake-bh-usa#.U2Kb1fldWvN]], [[http://pelotonmagazine.com/tested/bh-ultralight-reviewed/]], [[http://blogs.bicycling.com/blogs/thestraightdirt/2011/05/23/dave-weagle-split-pivot-full-suspension-mountain-bike-bh/]], [[http://www.roadbikeaction.com/Most-Popular-Stories/content/67/6105/Being-There-BH-Bikes-USA.html]]. It seems like you could make the argument for the bike part of the company to be notable, but I've struck out finding any mentions of the corporation as a whole. Not sure what to do with that information, if anything. [[User:EBstrunk18|EBstrunk18]] ([[User talk:EBstrunk18|talk]]) 23:17, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks for your research. The references suggest that the bikes are made by a Spanish branch of the company; this article is about the North American branch. Possibly an article could be written about the BH Group as a whole, but this article isn't it - and, like you, I couldn't find any information giving an overview of the company. If we had that info we could use it to expand and rename this article. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 03:28, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Hi [[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]]! I apologize for not being more precise. I completely agree and have started trying to find resources for the [[Beistegui Hermanos]] article. [[User:EBstrunk18|EBstrunk18]] ([[User talk:EBstrunk18|talk]]) 18:08, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
