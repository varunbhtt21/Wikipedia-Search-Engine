==Biography==

The band originated during Zac Little’s teenage years in a small Appalachian town in [[Noble County, Ohio]]. Little relocated to the city of [[Columbus, Ohio]] with original members Steva Jacobs and Luke Smith to attend [[Ohio State University]].<ref name="nodepression"/> Throughout his college years in Columbus, Little accumulated and learned a number of instruments: banjo, mandolin, dulcimer and more, and upon meeting violinist Grace Chang, Saintseneca’s initial live line-up coalesced in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/23/291406580/first-listen-saintseneca-dark-arc|title=First Listen: Saintseneca, 'Dark Arc'|first=Bob |last=Boilen |publisher=NPR|date= 23 March 2014|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> This line-up toured regionally around the East Coast and released the four-track ''Saintseneca'' EP on September 1, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Saintseneca - Saintseneca|url = http://www.discogs.com/Saintseneca-Saintseneca/release/3961061|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref> This was followed with the release of the five track ''Grey Flag'' EP on March 30, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Saintseneca - Grey Flag|url = http://www.discogs.com/Saintseneca-Grey-Flag/release/4369362|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}</ref>

This line-up continued to tour the Midwest and East Coast throughout 2010 and early 2011 while work began on their first full-length album, ''Last'' which was released by Mama Bird Recording Co. on August 16, 2011.
