:({{Find sources|Monica Mehta (author)}})
article for relatively unimportant author of a single relatively unimportant book. 

The article goes into detail about her family and college years, which will be of little interest except to her family and friends,  who will be adequately served by Facebook.  She has worked for several companies, and made a number of talk show appearances. Neither of these is notability. Her present position is given as "investor" for a capital firm, not as a principal or officer of the company. 

her book, amusingly listed here as "first" book when it is at this point her ''only'' book, is in only 178 Worldcat libraries, a trivial number for a popularizing work of its sort. The prizes are  trivial, and not prizes that bring  any notability, considering that not even the groups awarding them are notable. The article cites no major reviews, no placement o a major best seller list.

An interesting exercise in making something out of nothing, but what was made is not an encyclopedia article. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 05:35, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*<s>The article as written is highly problematic so I would say '''Delete'''. However,</s> this commentator, author and consulatant appears to be quite notable so I would support the creation of a well referenced and properly written article on her.

** You admit the person is notable, so voting delete seems unwise. -- [[User:Fuzheado|Fuzheado]] | [[User talk:Fuzheado|Talk]] 21:37, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*After seeing her on TV, I was impressed enough to look her up here, and am grateful that I was able to find out what else she has done. So I say improve the article if you can, but please do not delete it.[[User:George Fergus|George Fergus]] ([[User talk:George Fergus|talk]]) 10:15, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' - notable enough, given the book has won an award, and she has made an appearance on Realtime with Bill Maher which is no minor show. -- [[User:Fuzheado|Fuzheado]] | [[User talk:Fuzheado|Talk]] 21:36, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::You're certainly welcome to fix it. But as it is it should be deleted. If you need more time just ask for it to be moved to your userspace. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:50, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::It looks quite a bit better now. I am revising my recommendation to '''Keep'''. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 14:24, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' - She is more a journalist than an author (see the external links for a number of her columns) and her professional title as investor is Managing Principal. Here's a start at a cleanup: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monica_Mehta_%28author%29&diff=606955430&oldid=606582242] As a commentator/journalist who has authored multiple articles for each of [[Inc.]], [[Bloomberg Businessweek]], and [[Entrepreneur]] she does look notable to me, even leaving aside the video media appearances. Maybe somebody could point out what further cleanup is needed? [[User:Jodi.a.schneider|Jodi.a.schneider]] ([[User talk:Jodi.a.schneider|talk]]) 22:53, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*Keep-  her contributions on Bill Maher's show we're intelligent and well reasoned. Her background in economics and business was apparent.  She deserves to remain on Wikipedia.

*'''Keep'' - based on numerous major TV appearances.  This is not an endorsement of her views, only her [[WP:GNG|notability]]. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 17:18, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
