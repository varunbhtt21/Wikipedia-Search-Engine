==Early life==
Ishaq Beg Munonov was a native of [[Ulugqat]] in western Xinjiang.<ref name="MZB">(Chinese) [http://www.mzb.com.cn/html/node/149738-1.htm "柯尔克孜族将领——伊斯哈克拜克・木农阿吉"] 2010-10-27</ref>  Shortly after the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, he moved to the [[Soviet Union]] to study and became a follower of [[Marxism]].<ref name="MZB"/>  After returning to China in 1922, he was imprisoned for espousing revolutionary beliefs and urging the Kyrgyz to rise up against Xinjiang governor [[Jin Shuren]].<ref name="MZB"/><ref name=Forbes234/>  He later served as a [[regiment]] and then a [[brigade]] commander in the army of [[Sheng Shicai]] who supplanted Jin Shuren as governor in 1933.<ref name="MZB"/><ref name=Forbes234/>  Some sources say that Ishaq Beg was a sent by Soviet intelligence to Xinjiang to support Sheng Shicai.<ref name=Forbes234/>

Ishaq Beg was a capable commander but aroused the suspicion of Sheng Shicai, who removed his military post and reassigned him to [[Yining City|Yining]] to serve as the head of the Kazakh-Kyrgyz Cultural Society.<ref name="MZB"/>  In Yining, Ishaq Beg was under government surveillance.<ref name="MZB"/>

==Ili Uprising==
In 1943, he secretly returned to southern Xinjiang and organized a militia called the Puli Liberation Organization in [[Tashkurgan Town|Tashkurgan]] where he led a rebellion in June 1944.<ref name="MZB"/><ref name="WXD">(Chinese) [http://www.21ccom.net/articles/lsjd/article_201001204459.html Wang Xindeng, 王欣登：抗战时期苏联对新疆的扩张渗透与“三区革命” 2010-01-20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082935/http://www.21ccom.net/articles/lsjd/article_201001204459.html |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>  After the outbreak of the Soviet-backed [[Ili Rebellion]] in November 1944, he became a deputy commander-in-chief of the [[Ili National Army]].  The uprising gave rise to the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] (ETR).  Ishaq Beg was a member of the pro-Soviet progressive faction within the ETR.<ref name=Forbes234>[[#Forbes|Forbes 1986]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tt7wAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&dq=Ishaq+Beg+xinjiang&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XMVhU8T7OIrLsATz0YCwCw&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Ishaq%20Beg%20xinjiang&f=false 234]</ref>   He reportedly held both Chinese and Soviet citizenship.<ref>[[#Forbes|Forbes 1986]]: 186</ref> In the summer of 1945, he directed the Battle of Jinghe-Wusu.<ref name="MZB"/><ref>[[#Forbes|Forbes 1986]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tt7wAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&dq=Ishaq+Beg+xinjiang&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XMVhU8T7OIrLsATz0YCwCw&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Ishaq%20Beg%20xinjiang&f=false 188-89]</ref> 

In June 1946, the revolutionaries of the ETR, which controlled three of Xinjiang's 10 districts, and the [[Nationalist Government (China)|Nationalist Chinese government]], which held the other seven districts, reached a peace agreement and formed a coalition government in Xinjiang.  Soviet advisors departed the Ili National Army and Ishaq Beg became the commander-in-chief.<ref name="WXD"/>

In August 1949, as the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) gained the upper hand of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the CCP and the Ili leadership began discussing cooperation.  The CCP's delegate to Ili, [[Deng Liqun]], stayed at the home of Ishaq Beg in Yining.  He conveyed Mao Zedong's invitation of the Ili leaders to attend a planning conference for the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]].  

Ishaq Beg Munonov was part of the leadership delegation that left Yining on August 22, 1949 for Beiping.<ref name=NewChina1>(Chinese) [http://military.china.com/zh_cn/history4/62/20051003/12712023.html 新中国和平解放新疆内幕 (1)] 2005-10-03</ref>  He, along with Ehmetjan Qasim, [[Abdulkerim Abbas]], [[Dalelkhan Sugirbayev]] and [[Luo Zhi]], was killed in a plane crash near [[Lake Baikal]] on or about August 26, 1949.<ref name=NewChina1/>
