Bags and food/drinks are not allowed into the room. Lockers will be available ($1 for four hours).<br>

==Resources==

Built especially for the event by [[user:Lankiveil]], a '''[[User:Lankiveil/EWH Article List|side-by-side checklist of the The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia and the matching Wikipedia biography]]'''.

Since the venue is a great public library, there are many resources available if we want to order them up from the stack. They have to be referred to in the reading room but it is just down the stairs, near the edit-a-thon. Some rare resources are held offsite, but they can be ordered online in advance to be available on the day via the [http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/ SLNSW Catalogue].  The Library has onsite access available to a huge variety of databases, and remote access to quite a few as well.
