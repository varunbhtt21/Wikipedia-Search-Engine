Non-notable person; in addition I feel the article's emphasis on the negative raises BLP issues. This person's electoral positions as county assessor and county supervisor are not sufficient for notability per [[WP:POLITICIAN]], and general coverage about him is not sufficient for notability per [[WP:GNG]]. Half the article is about allegations of corruption, including a criminal conviction, but that issue got only local and at-the-time coverage - nothing which would justify an article here.

*'''Delete''': I agree with nom's rationale. He is a [[WP:POLOUTCOMES|local politician]] in an area not famous enough for local politicians to inherit notability, and neither his actions as administrator nor his (alleged and convicted) [[WP:CRIME|criminal]] activity achieved [[WP:SIGCOV|significant]] national coverage. For what it's worth, I disagree that the article has [[WP:BLP|BLP]] problems - his local coverage is almost entirely about his criminal activity and not about his political record. It's therefore quite appropriate for Wikipedia to cover him in the same way. [[User:Ivanvector|Ivanvector]] ([[User talk:Ivanvector|talk]]) 19:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
