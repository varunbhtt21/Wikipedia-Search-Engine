'''Gu Bin''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 顾斌; born 10 November 1991 in [[Shanghai]]) is a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] footballer who currently plays for [[Zhejiang Greentown]] in the [[China League One]].

== Early life ==
Gu Bin was born on November 10, 1991 into a poor family in Shanghai. When he was 2 years old, his parents divorced and his mother left the family. His father would die of lung cancer when he was 14, and he would be subsequently taken care of by his uncle and aunt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-17/10312697606.shtml|script-title=zh:初中毕业面临失业 足球追梦少年遭不幸不知路在何方|work=sports.sina.com.cn|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2018-04-16|language=zh}}</ref> He received his preliminary education in the Fourth Preliminary School of Pingliang Road, a school famous for national footballers, but his family was too poor to afford a pair of football boots, let alone the costs of professional training after the preliminary school.
