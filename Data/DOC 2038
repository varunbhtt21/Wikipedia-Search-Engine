The '''fan effect'''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Retrieval of propositional information from long-term memory|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=October 1974|volume=6|issue=4|pages=451–474|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90021-8|citeseerx=10.1.1.469.4855}}</ref>  is a [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomenon under the branch of [[cognitive psychology]] where recognition times or error rate for a particular concept increases as more information about the concept is acquired. The word "fan" refers to the number of associations correlated with the concept.

== The origin of the fan effect ==
The fan effect first appeared in a series of experiments conducted by [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R. Anderson]], a cognitive psychologist, in 1974.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Radvansky|first=Gabriel A.|title=The Fan Effect: A Tale of Two Theories|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=June 1999|volume=128|issue=2|pages=198–206|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.128.2.198}}</ref> The three experiments he conducted involved participants learning 26 sentences that paired a person with a location. Additionally, they were asked to determine whether or not a particular sentence that was given to them belonged to the 26 they were asked to study.  An example of a sentence Anderson used in his experiment was:  "A hippie is in the park." Some sentences seemed similar in the sense that a person was paired with another location. For instance, "A hippie is in the church." Results revealed that participants produced a longer retrieval time when a person was paired with more than one location. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that multiple associations, such as including a large number of nouns in a sentence, interfered with the recognition time by producing a much slower effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Buntinga, M.F., Conwayb, A., and Heitzc, R.P.|title=Individual differences in the fan effect and working memory capacity|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=April 2004|volume=51|pages=604–621|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.07.007|issue=4}}</ref>

==Spreading activation==
In the brain, [[memory]] stores information in a network of nodes that are linked together.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Radvansky and Zacks|first=Gabriel and Rose|title=Mental Models and the Fan Effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1991|volume=17|issue=5|pages=940–953|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.17.5.940}}</ref> When a memory is retrieved, activation spreads on the links until it intersects or enough time has passed. If there is one association, the activation only has to spread to a single link whereas multiple associations would divide the activation to many links. Because there are so many connections, it causes the brain to take a longer time to identify the concepts and retrieve the memory.

==Plausible theories==
The fan effect is due to multiple mental models and is included as part of the [[ACT-R]] theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Anderson and Reder|first=John and Lynne|title=The fan effect: New results and New Theories|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=June 1999|volume=128|issue=2|pages=189–197|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.128.2.186|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.8243}}</ref> The key factors that the fan effect is dependent on are the strength and degree to which one of the variables can predict the other and the importance of the concept to a person during the retrieval process. Concepts can be better recognized by similar ideas instead of a random order of ideas. When stored in a random order, the concepts are placed in independent places in the brain instead of putting the concepts together as one unit. The fan effect can be reduced if random sentences are exposed frequently and unified into one concept.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moeser|first=Shannon Dawn|title=The Role of Experimental Design in Investigations of the Fan Effect|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory|date=March 1979|volume=5|issue=2|pages=125–134|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.5.2.125}}</ref>
