'''Highway 549''', known as the '''Bella Vista Bypass''', is the temporary designation of Future [[Interstate 49 in Arkansas|Interstate&nbsp;49]] (I-49) near [[Bella Vista, Arkansas|Bella Vista]] in the U.S. state of Arkansas. It currently consists of a two-lane freeway from a temporary roundabout interchange with [[Interstate 49 (Arkansas)|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71 (Arkansas)|US 71]] near [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]] to an incomplete interchange with County Road 34 near [[Hiwasse, Arkansas|Hiwasse]].<ref name=ADG>{{cite news |title= First Section of Bella Vista Bypass to Open |url= http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/98279/first-section-of-bella-vista-bypass-to-open |accessdate= May 1, 2014 |newspaper= [[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date= April 21, 2014 |agency= Associated Press |location= Little Rock, AR}}</ref>

==Route description==
AR&nbsp;549 currently begins at an interchange with [[Interstate 49 (Arkansas)|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71 (Arkansas)|US 71]] in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]] and continues west to an interchange with [[Arkansas Highway 72|AR&nbsp;72]] at [[Hiwasse, Arkansas|Hiwasse]]. AR&nbsp;549 turns northwest and has another interchange with AR&nbsp;72, where it turns northward and continues to its temporary end at Rocky Dell Hollow Road.

==History==
The AR&nbsp;549 designation was signed again in 2014 as the temporary designation to the Bella Vista Bypass. This segment was signed in late April and runs for approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} as a [[two-lane expressway]], with room to expand up to four lanes.<ref>{{cite news |work= Arkansas Matters |location= Little Rock, AR |publisher= [[KARK-TV]] |url= http://www.arkansasmatters.com/story/d/story/first-section-of-bella-vista-bypass-now-open/15025/DxfFfErv7Emdlcrj2HUKjA |title= First Section of Bella Vista Bypass Now Open |date= April 22, 2014 |accessdate= May 14, 2014}}</ref>

==Future==
The Bella Vista Bypass is set to continue northwards, running along the western edge of [[Bella Vista, Arkansas|Bella Vista]] before entering [[Missouri]]. After an interchange with [[Missouri Route 90]], the bypass will rejoin [[U.S. Route 71 in Missouri|US&nbsp;71]] near [[Pineville, Missouri]]. When the entire section has been upgraded to interstate standards, it will be signed as I-49.
