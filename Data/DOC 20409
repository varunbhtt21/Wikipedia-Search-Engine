Title : Metropolitan Town Planning Commission
Text : The '''Metropolitan Town Planning Commission''' was created in 1922 by the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian state government]] to provide advice for the planning and development of the city of [[Melbourne]], Australia. It produced the first comprehensive urban development strategy for Melbourne in 1929, and influenced future development for many years

==Origin==
Urban growth in the early 20th century was putting pressure on infrastructure in Melbourne including increased land use conflicts. A town planning conference convened by the [[City of Melbourne|Melbourne City Council]] on 1 October 1920, recognising the need for the 'regulation of development on modern scientific lines'. The Local Government Act in 1921 allowed municipalities to introduce by-laws to define residential areas where new 'trade, industry or commercial issues' could be prohibited – a form of land use zoning. In the following year, as a consequence of 'a consistent agitation' the ''Metropolitan Town Planning Commission Act (1922)'' was passed.<ref>McLoughlin, J. Brian, ''Shaping Melbourne's Future?: Town Planning, the State and Civil Society'' CUP Archive, 1992 p.32</ref> The Commission was chaired by [[City of Melbourne]] councilor and architect [[Frank Stapley]].<ref name=fedsq>{{cite web

The Commission was empowered to 'report upon the present conditions and tendencies of urban development' and to 'set out general plans and recommendations with respect to the better guidance and control of such development'.<ref>[http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00352b.htm eMelbourne Encyclopedia Metropolitan Town Planning Commission]</ref>

The Commission undertook a range of research to identify both the problems in Melbourne's planning, and theory and practice for resolving them. Prominent architect and planner Saxil Tuxen worked was employed as a technical expert, trafelling to the United States in 1925, to examine their approaches to surveying and planning.<ref>Nichols, D, 2009, Lecture Four: ‘Early Planning Innovator's, The University of Melbourne 23 March 2009, retrieved 13 May 2009, <http://app.lms.unimelb.edu.au/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp?tab=course&u%2Fbn%2Fcommon%2Fcourse.pl%3Fcourse_id%3D_108727_1>.</ref>  His primary authorities were Melbourne's waterways, roadways and public transport, where he tried to ensure that Melbourne's [[Trams in Melbourne|tram networks]] were preserved and maintained, at a time when other planning experts were calling for them to be removed and to promote development which incorporated Melbourne's waterways, notable, the Yarra River<ref>Nichols, D, 2004, ‘Merely the Man in the Street: Community Consultation in the Planning of 1920's Melbourne’, ''Australian Planner'', vol. 41, no. 3, p. 53</ref>

==Railways==
The initial 1929 report recommended an underground railway to bypass the city from [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]] to [[North Melbourne railway station|North Melbourne]] stations via [[Exhibition Street|Exhibition]] and [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria]] streets, to alleviate the congestion at [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]].<ref name=lf>{{cite web

This led ultimately to the construction of the [[City Loop|Melbourne Underground Rail Loop]] It also proposed a city square over the railway yard between Flinders Street and Batman Avenue, running east {{convert|33|ft|m}} from Princes Bridge, but was later dropped as unsuitable due to cost and traffic congestion.<ref name=fedsq />'s. this was ultimately completed as [[Federation Square]].

Another proposal was for the construction of a [[Doncaster railway line|new railway line to Doncaster]], (echoing the 1928 Railways Standing Committee of the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]] which recommended an extension of the [[Kew railway line|Kew branch line]], to serve [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]].<ref name="nr40">{{cite magazine

==Legacy==
Although the 1929 plan was not formally implemented, many of its ideas were eventually adopted. In the early 1950s the planning system was substantially created as we know it today with the 1954 [[Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme]]<ref>[https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/policy-and-strategy/planning-for-melbourne/melbournes-strategic-planning-history/melbourne-metropolitan-planning-scheme-1954-report Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme 1954 – Report and its associated Survey and Analysis volume] being produced and gradually implemented under the aegis of the Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works, Department of Transport and local councils.</ref>
