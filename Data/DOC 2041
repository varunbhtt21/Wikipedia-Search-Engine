'''''Litophyton arboreum''''', also known as '''broccoli coral''', is a common [[Alcyonacea|soft coral]] ([[Octocorallia|octocoral]]) found from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]]. It grows up to 80&nbsp;cm, usually on seaward reef slopes or hard bottoms. The color of ''L. arboreum'' varies from pale olive-green to yellow or grey.  ''L. arboreum'' are [[anthozoa]]ns in the order ''[[Alcyonacea]]'' in the family ''[[Nephtheidae]]''.  The ''L. arboreum'' was originally classified in 1775 by Peter [[Peter Forsskål|Forsskål]], a Swedish [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] naturalist.  As of 2016, the entire genus ''[[Litophyton]]'' was reclassified using [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] data, in contrast to its original [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] classification.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ofwegen|first=Leen van|date=2016-02-22|title=The genus Litophyton Forskål, 1775 (Octocorallia, Alcyonacea, Nephtheidae) in the Red Sea and the western Indian Ocean|url=https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/7212/|journal=ZooKeys|issue=567|pages=1–128|doi=10.3897/zookeys.567.7212|issn=1313-2970|pmc=4829695|pmid=27103869}}</ref>

== Ecology ==
''L. arboreum'' is commonly found in the Red Sea. A 1997 reef [[transect]] study showed that octocorals, such as ''L. arboreum'', compose under 20% of soft coral coverage on both reef flats, and the upper fore-reefs in the [[Gulf of Aqaba|Gulf of Eilat]], off the East coast of the [[Sinai Peninsula]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Benayahu|first=Y.|last2=Loya|first2=Y.|date=1977-08-01|title=Space partitioning by stony corals soft corals and benthic algae on the coral reefs of the northern Gulf of Eilat (Red Sea)|journal=Helgoländer Wissenschaftliche Meeresuntersuchungen|volume=30|issue=1|pages=362–382|doi=10.1007/BF02207848|issn=1438-3888|bibcode=1977HWM....30..362B}}</ref> Typically in Gulf of Eilat reefs, octocoral coverage is dominated by carpets of a few species.<ref name=":02" /> A possible explanation for this extensive, monospecific coverage is periods of rapid growth.<ref name=":02" /> ''L. arboreum''is not typically one of these dominant octocorals, but can compose up to 36% of living soft coral coverage, as seen in the Gulf of Eilat Nature Reserve.<ref name=":02" /> In other Red Sea locations, ''L. arboreum'' composes as little as 3% of soft coral coverage, such as in the South and Center Muqebla regions.<ref name=":02" />

As observed in other species of corals, space for settlement on the reef is one of the most important limiting factors for new colonies of ''L. arboreum.''<ref name=":02" /> Similarly, physical factors—such as wave action, temperature variation, salinity and light– and biological factors– such as competition, predation, and disease– limit the success and prevalence of ''L. arboreum.''<ref name=":02" /> Specifically, predation and competition for space may disrupt continuous community development for some species of Red Sea soft corals, resulting in patchy, discontinuous, communities spread across the reef.<ref name=":02" /> However, the coexistence of [[Scleractinia|stony corals]], [[Alcyonacea|soft corals]], and [[algae]] in the Gulf of Eilat suggests that no one component has a distinct competitive dominance on the reef; instead, spatial variation results in different species exhibiting competitive dominance in different locations based on their unique [[ecological niche]]s.<ref name=":02" /> At present, the intra- and interspecific competitive hierarchy of ''L. arboreum'' is unknown.<ref name=":02" />

In other Red Sea locations, such as the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] off the [[Jordan]]ian coast, ''L. arboreum'' is found in well developed reefs.  The Aqaba reefs are unique to other coastal reefs due to their lack of [[Spur and groove formation|spur and groove]] patterns on the fore-reef.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276267007|title=Morphology and evolution of the coral reefs of the Jordanian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea)|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Spur and groove formations are most likely absent due to the relatively calm waters of the Gulf of Aqaba; the lack of major wind and wave action eliminates the force required.<ref name=":12" /> The Gulf of Aqaba reefs are [[Biogenic substance|biogenic]] in origin, like the majority of reefs globally, and well developed on capes.<ref name=":12" /> The developed capes are distinct, and separated by sandy embayments that correspond to past dried river beds.<ref name=":12" /> As in other coastal reefs, the Aqaba reefs are fringed by shallow bays containing beds of [[seagrass]], which lead into the reefs.<ref name=":12" /> The reefs themselves have wide, built, coral formations abundant at a depth of 20m, and reef flats most abundant at 60m.<ref name=":12" /> The spatial distribution of the corals present in the Aqaba community suggest [[ecological succession]]– driven primarily by geologic and ecological forces– is responsible for the [[topography]] of the reef.<ref name=":12" /> The existing Aqaba reefs are highly diverse, though future reef expansion is limited by steep shelf inclines, and any major expansion is highly unlikely given the [[Benthic zone|benthic]] topography of the existing reefs.<ref name=":12" />

== Symbiosis and reproduction ==

The [[Reproduction|reproductive]] mechanisms of ''L. arboreum'' have been extensively studied, and offer a unique insight into ''anthozoa'' reproduction– particularly in regard to the uptake of [[symbiodinium]].<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|url=|doi=10.1016/0040-8166(92)90063-d|title=Entry of algal symbionts into oocytes of the coral Litophyton arboreum|journal=Tissue and Cell|volume=24|issue=4|pages=473–482|year=1992|last1=Benayahu|first1=Y.|last2=Weil|first2=D.|last3=Malik|first3=Z.}}</ref> ''L. arboreum'', like other corals, have a relationship with an [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] [[dinoflagellate]].<ref name=":22" /> Often referred to as [[zooxanthellae]], the genus ''symbiodinium'' is a point of extensive research, and its relationship with corals remains largely enigmatic.

In a 1992 study, researchers found that in ''L. arboreum'' [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] events, [[gamete]]s released for [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] were already associated with ''symbiodinium''.<ref name=":22" /> Such an observation suggests that the symbiodinium were incorporated into the gametes, the [[oocyte]]s, during [[oogenesis]]– the [[Meiosis|cellular division process]] yielding [[Ploidy|haploid]] oocytes.<ref name=":22" />

There are two primary strategies of symbiodinium uptake by anthozoans.  Individuals can either take symbiodinium from the maternal colony, or they can uptake new ''symbiodinium'' from the surrounding environment.<ref name=":22" /> In situations of environmental uptake, [[zooplankton]] can act as an intermediary, transferring the symbiodinium from the surrounding water column, to the daughter colony.<ref name=":22" /> The vast majority of [[scleractinia]]n, or [[Calcium carbonate|CaCO₃]] reef-building corals, lack ''symbiodinium'' in their broadcast gametes, indicating that the daughter coral are reliant on the surrounding environment to acquire ''symbiodinium''.<ref name=":22" /> Some species of octocorals– such as ''L. arboreum''–have indicated an uptake strategy of maternal transfer.<ref name=":22" />

''L. arboreum''is a ''[[Gonochorism|gonochoric]] planulae brooder'', meaning that individual coral colonies have separate sexes, and reproduction is dependent on spawning events in which gametes are broadcast into the surrounding water for fertilization, creating genetically distinct individuals which develop into new colonies.<ref name=":22" /> ''L. arboreum'' undergoes oogenesis cyclically, biannually, and has a highly specialized mechanism of symbiont uptake indicative of [[Mutualism (biology)|obligate mutualism]] and [[coevolution]] between the ''symbiodinium'' and the ''L. arboreum''.<ref name=":22" /> During oogenesis, symbiodinium found in the adjacent [[gastrovascular cavity]] of the parent ''L. arboreum'' are incorporated into the haploid daughter cells of the oocytes.<ref name=":22" /> Stud-like cellular features on the exterior of epidermal cells that link together individual cells to form a cellular matrix– similar to the bumps on legos, or the hooks in velcro, and resemblant of [[hemidesmosome]]s– and link together the gastrodermal cells, locking into place the receptive cells and making symbiodinium transfer possible.<ref name=":22" /> While in place, gaps open in the [[mesoglea]] tissue beneath the follicular cells, and the parent ''symbiodinium'', present in the [[vacuole]]s of follicular and gastrodermal cells, move through the mesogleal gaps and are up-taken by [[Microvillus|microvilli]] on the undeveloped oocyte prior to the completion of oogenesis.<ref name=":22" /> Once uptaken by the oocytes, the ''symbiodinium'' are then covered with a thin layer of cells, later followed by a thicker follicular layer composed of gastrodermal cells from the maternal colony.<ref name=":22" /> Following symbion uptake, the gaps close, leaving a single, continuous [[mesoglea]].<ref name=":22" /> Evidence suggests that symbions that are unsuccessfully uptaken– either rejected by the oocyte, or that die after uptake– are consumed and used as nutrients by the daughter cell.<ref name=":22" /> In summary, ''symbiodinium'' stored in the maternal colony are inserted into reproductive cells before they are broadcast into the environment, yielding haploid cells associated with ''symbiodinium'' before fertilization.  This strategy of maternal symbion transfer may lead to more successful colonization; individuals have a higher chance of survival if new colonies do not need to establish their own symbiosis.<ref name=":22" />

Historically, this maternal symbiont transfer is of great significance, because it is the first indication of cell-bound ''symbiodinium'' found in the vacuoles of parent cells not being exclusively used for [[symbiosis]].<ref name=":22" /> Further, ''L. arboreum'' is one of very few corals that has recorded evidence of maternal ''symbiodinium'' transfer, offering a unique insight into the complex world of coral reproduction.<ref name=":22" />

== Medical applications ==
Like many other reef-dwelling organisms, ''L. arboreum''has applications in the medical field, many of which are unknown. A 2006 study showed that 83% of Red Sea Alcyonacean corals exhibited antimicrobial activity against a variety of marine bacteria found in the surrounding environment.<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal|last=Kelman|first=Dovi|last2=Kashman|first2=Yoel|last3=Rosenberg|first3=Eugene|last4=Kushmaro|first4=Ariel|last5=Loya|first5=Yossi|date=May 2006|title=Antimicrobial activity of Red Sea corals|journal=Marine Biology|volume=149|issue=2|pages=357–363|doi=10.1007/s00227-005-0218-8|issn=0025-3162}}</ref> As a means of combating [[microbial]] attacks, Red Sea ''Alcyonacean'' corals use antibiotic compounds as a chemical defense.<ref name=":32" /> A 2018 study specifically on  ''L. arboreum'' was able to find and isolate a pseudoguaiane-type [[sesquiterpene]] compound, an organic molecule, ''litopharbol'', which exhibits both antimicrobial and anticancer activity, and has direct applications to medicine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abou El-Kassem|first=Lamia T.|last2=Hawas|first2=Usama W.|last3=El-Desouky|first3=Samy K.|last4=Al-Farawati|first4=Radwan|date=2018-01-26|title=Sesquiterpenes from the Saudi Red Sea: Litophyton arboreum with their cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities|journal=Zeitschrift für Naturforschung C|volume=73|issue=1–2|pages=9–14|doi=10.1515/znc-2017-0037|issn=1865-7125}}</ref>
