The '''international Thorium Energy Committee''' (iThEC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithec.org |title=iThEC |publisher=iThEC |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> was founded in late 2012 at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]] by scientists, engineers, political figures and industrialists under the leadership of its honorary president [[Carlo Rubbia]], to promote the cause of using [[thorium]] as a means of reducing existing and future nuclear waste, and also for generating electricity.

==International conference==
After its founding, the first action of the committee was to organise an international conference on [[Thorium]], ThEC13,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indico.cern.ch/event/222140/ |title=* Thorium Energy Conference 2013 (ThEC13) * CERN Globe of Science and Innovation, Geneva, Switzerland (27-31 October 2013) |publisher=Indico.cern.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> using mostly private funding and institutional support from [[CERN]]. The conference lasted four days and attracted wide support from research institutes, energy companies and private individuals who contributed to the establishment of the current state-of-the-art in Thorium technology. Amongst the many contributions to the conference, one may note the announcement of the decision by the companies [[Solvay S.A.|Solvay]] and [[Areva]] to jointly fund research in [[Thorium]] development<ref>{{cite web|author=SmartPlanet |url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/conventional-nuclear-giant-areva-strikes-thorium-deal/ |title=Conventional nuclear giant Areva strikes thorium deal |publisher=SmartPlanet |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> and the tests by the Norwegian company Thor energy <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thorenergy.no/ |title=Thor Energy - the Norwegian thorium initiative - Thor Energy |publisher=Thorenergy.no |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> of [[Thorium]] fuel rods in the [[Halden Reactor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10255442/Thorium-put-to-the-test-as-policymakers-rethink-nuclear.html |title=Thorium put to the test as policymakers rethink nuclear |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref>

==Expansion==
The Committee is expanding its membership to reach a  wider audience and attracted to the ThEC13 conference keynote speakers such as [[Pascal Couchepin]], former president of the Swiss confederation and member of the [[Liberal Party of Switzerland]] and [[Hans Blix]], former head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].
