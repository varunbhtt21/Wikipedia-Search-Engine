'''Kolonos Hill''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-el|Λόφος Κολωνού}}) is a hill in [[Central Greece]]. It is located in the narrow coastal passage known as [[Thermopylae]], and is near the city of [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]].

==History==

The hill is best known for the site for the final stand of the [[300 Spartans]] during the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC.<ref name = Crw>Crawford, Osbert Guy Stanhope (1955).

Weidenfeld and Nicolson, p. 302</ref> In 1939, [[Spyridon Marinatos]], a Greek archaeologist found large numbers of Persian arrows around the hill, which changed the hitherto accepted identification of the site where the Greeks had fallen, slain by Persian arrows.<ref name=Crw/><ref name=academic>{{cite web|title=Thermopylae|url=http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110tech/thermopylae.html|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

A commemorative stone was placed on the site in Antiquity, but the original stone has not survived. In 1955, a new stone was erected, with [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]]' epigram engraved on it.<ref>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.228.1 VII, 228]</ref>
