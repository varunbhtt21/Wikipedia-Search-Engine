==History==
[[File:New York State Fair station (4), August 2011.jpg|thumb|left|The 2002-constructed platform in 2011]]
New York Central trains stopped at the fair beginning in the 19th century, but service was eventually discontinued.<ref name=kirst2>{{cite news |url=http://www.syracuse.com/kirst/index.ssf/2014/08/amtrak_at_the_new_york_state_fair_for_a_core_of_loyal_customers_the_only_way_to.html |title=Amtrak at the New York State Fair: For a core of loyal customers, the only way to go |date=28 August 2014 |first=Sean |last=Kirst |newspaper=Syracuse.com |accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref> In 2001, the Empire State Passengers Association brokered talks between Amtrak and the New York State Fair Director about adding the Fair as an Amtrak stop, with positive response from both parties.<ref name=espa2002>{{cite journal |url=http://www.trainweb.org/espa/espa402.htm |journal=THE ESPA EXPRESS |title=Good News and Bad at Annual Meeting |date=April 2002 |publisher=Empire State Passengers Association}}</ref> After an agreement was reached with CSX, the Fair constructed a platform and cinderblock shelter, and Amtrak stopped at the 2002 fair. Approximately 1000 riders - most from Rochester - used the stop in 2002, taking advantage of half-price admission to the fair when arriving by train.<ref name=espa2002oct>{{cite journal |url=http://www.trainweb.org/espa/espa1002.htm |journal=THE ESPA EXPRESS |title=Amtrak's State Fair Stop Proves Popular |date=October 2002 |publisher=Empire State Passengers Association}}</ref>

Ridership has remained constant at around 1,000 passengers using the stop at each fair. Most are from Rochester and Buffalo, as Amtrak schedules do not allow riders from the east to spend a full day at the fair, and [[Central New York Regional Transportation Authority|CENTRO]] runs buses from Syracuse with higher frequency and lower fares.<ref name=kirst1 /><ref name=kirst2 /> In 2014, Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] intervened when scheduling conflicts with CSX threatened service to the fair.<ref name=kirst2 />
