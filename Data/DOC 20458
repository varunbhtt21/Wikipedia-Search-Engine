Even though Elaine and Susan learned to put it behind them' their brother Brian was not so fortunate.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

Susan, Elaine and Brian all wanted to move on with their lives but Brian was still suffering from the trauma of their childhood together and would do everything he could to spend as little time with his siblings as possible because he didn't want to relive anymore bad memories, straining the relationship between.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

While her sister Susan married a man by the name of Drake, and Brian ended up marrying a woman named Rebecca. Elaine met [[Morris Walters]] and fell in love with him, they soon got married and Elaine took on her husband’s surname becoming '''Elaine Walters''', and not long after they soon had a baby girl named '''Jennifer'''. Morris hoped that Jennifer would become a police officer like him, but Elaine supported Jennifer’s ambitions to become a professional dancer growing up instead.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

Since her husband was the Sheriff of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department, he came across many enemies, the biggest one was the mobster Nicholas Trask.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

Trask wanted Morris killed and planned out a murder by smashing into him in his car and make it look like a drunk driving accident, but his plan backfired because Elaine had been the one driving to see Jennifer’s dance recital with two of her friends.
