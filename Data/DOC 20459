{{nihongo|'''Hōsen-in'''|宝泉院}} is a Buddhist temple of the [[Tendai|Tendai-shū]], located in [[Sakyō-ku, Kyoto|Sakyō-ku]] of [[Kyoto|Kyoto-shi]], in the prefecture of [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], Japan. It is specified as a [[natural monument]] by the Kyoto government.

==History==
It was built in 1012 under the reign of [[Emperor Sanjō]] in the imperial year [[Chōwa]] 2. Its original purpose was to serve as temple quarters for priests from the nearby [[Shōrin'in]] temple.

==Structure==
One of the rooms features a blood stained ceiling that was originally a floorpiece from [[Fushimi Castle]]. The blood is from [[Torii Mototada]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]'s retainer, and several hundred other men who committed [[seppuku]] when they and the castle they were garrisoned in were about to be overrun by [[Ishida Mitsunari]]'s forces during the Sekigahara Campaign. This act allowed Tokugawa Ieyasu to escape with his life and live to unify Japan under the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. Thus, Torii Mototada's act of valor is honored through having the bloody floorpiece serve as a piece of Hōsen-in.

==Visiting==
At the entrance, along with paying the fee, guests are given a ticket that can be used for refreshments at the end.
Guests are passed through a [[washitsu]] featuring such sights including a five-leafed pine.
This temple also features a garden called '''Hōrakuen''', or "Treasure Paradise"
At the end, the refreshments ticket can be exchanged for green tea and some light snacks.
