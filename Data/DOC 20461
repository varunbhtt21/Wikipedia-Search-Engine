The '''Curtiss/Curtiss-Robertson Model 56 Thrush'''<ref group=note>All Curtiss model numbers lower than 75 were assigned retroactively.</ref> was a 1929 six passenger high-wing fixed undercarriage single-engine cabin [[monoplane]]  airliner and utility transport powered by either a [[Curtiss Challenger]] or a [[Wright Whirlwind]] [[radial engine]]<ref name=aerofiles/> and built as an enlargement of the earlier [[Curtiss Robin]].<ref name=J169/> Several were used for record breaking endurance flights by female pilots during the early 1930s including one in which the aircraft stayed aloft for almost ten days.

==Design and development==
[[File:Curtiss Thrush NC9142 (3.6.29).jpg|thumb|Prototype Thrush with Challenger engine in experimental cowling and prototype rudder shape.]]
Three {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} Curtiss Challenger-engined Curtiss Thrush prototypes (serialled G-1 to G-3) were built at Curtiss' Garden City factory, but these were underpowered<ref name=J169/> and production examples, redesignated Thrush J (serialled 1001 to 1010) with {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}} Wright Whirlwind engines, were built at the Curtiss-Robertson St Louis factory. All three prototypes were later re-engined with Whirlwinds to make them Thrush Js.<ref name=J170>Juptner, 1964, p.170</ref> 
The fuselage of the Thrush formed the basis for the twin-engine [[Curtiss Kingbird]] which was developed roughly in parallel.<ref>Bowers, 1979, p.386</ref>

The fuselage was built up as a [[Pratt truss]] frame formed mainly from [[Duraluminum]] tubing and fittings with welded [[41xx steel|Chrome-moly]] tubing reinforcing highly stressed areas and covered in fabric.<ref name=J170/>
The wing was a fabric covered [[Cantilever|semi-cantilever]]<ref group=note>The inner portion of the wing was strut braced, while the outboard was cantilever.</ref> braced with steel tube struts, and had solid spruce spars and stamped [[Alclad]] ribs with Alclad sheet wrapped over leading edge.<ref name=J170/> A fuel tank is mounted within each wing near the root.<ref name=J170/> Rudder and elevators were welded chrome-moly steel tubing.<ref name=J170/> 116" track undercarriage is fitted with [[Oleo strut|oleo-pneumatic shock obsorbers]] and [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix brakes]], and is braced to the front struts and lower longerons.<ref name=J170/>

==Operational history==
12 examples were ordered by [[China National Aviation Corporation]] (CNAC) but only ten production examples were built. All but one was then registered in the US, as many aircraft exported to the CNAC were, however only one example made it to China, which it did in 1930, and it may not have entered CNAC service.<ref>Andersson, 2008, p.257</ref> One of the ten was lost on its first flight (serial 1006) and its registration was transferred to the next aircraft built.<ref name=B391>Bowers, 1979, p.391</ref>
One of the prototypes went to Venezuela to a private individual,<ref>[http://www.airhistory.org.uk/gy/reg_YV-.html Civil Aircraft Register - Venezuela] accessdate:May 2014</ref> and a production example went to Cuba where it was the first aircraft operated by the [[Compañía Nacional Cubana de Aviación Curtiss]] (CNCAC), forerunner of Cubana de Aviación, Cuba's national airline.<ref>[http://www.urrib2000.narod.ru/Civ2-e.html The Rise of CUBANA de Aviacion air company (1929-1945)] accessdate:May 2014</ref>

From the 14th to the 22nd of August 1932, [[Louise Thaden]] & [[Frances Marsalis]] flew prototype Thrush J NC9142 "'''I.J. Fox'''" (named for their sponsor, a fur coat company and nicknamed the "Flying Boudoir" by the press) for 196 hours 5 minutes, refuelling in flight from a [[Curtiss Robin]] to set an endurance record near [[Valley Stream, New York]].<ref name=Oak65>Oakes, 1985, p.65</ref><ref>Bowden, 1995, p.80 & 82-83</ref> For this and other record-breaking flights, Thaden received the [[Harmon Trophy]] in 1936.<ref>Oakes, 1985, p.10</ref>
[[Helen Richey]] and Frances Marsalis flew production Thrush J NC7568 "'''Outdoor Girl'''" (named for a brand of women's cosmetics, a new sponsor) for 237 hours, 42 minutes (nearly ten days) from the 20th to the 30th of December 1933 over [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=Oak65/> Like the first flight, it too was refuelled from the air from a Curtiss Robin.
[[Jean LaRene]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Owens]]<!-- or [[Mary Owens Campbell]]? --> made five attempts at the world's endurance record at the [[Curtiss-Reynolds Airport]] in August during the 1934 [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] in Curtiss Thrush J NR581N "'''Lone Star'''"<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/mary-elizabeth-owens-records-ca1940/oclc/601880820 Mary Elizabeth Owens records, ca.1940.] accessdate:May 2014</ref> Jean LaRene made another attempt in NR581N on the record with [[Henrietta Sumner]] from 8 December to 30 November 1934 over [[Oklahoma City]] but experienced engine problems and was forced down after 198 hours and 13 minutes aloft.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140503013632/http://www.oldairfield.com/people/sumner_he/index.html Henrietta Sumner/Lantz] accessdate:May 2014</ref>

Two examples found their way to Alaska where they were used as [[bush plane]]s, one by [[Ralph Savory]] before he joined [[Star Air Service]],<ref>[http://www.alaskabushpilot.org/BushPilotsS_V.html Biographies (S - V) of 1920s-1930s Era Alaska Bush Pilots] accessdate:May 2014</ref> and a second was flown in Alaska by [[Gordon MacKenzie]].
The remainder were used in the United States by various operators as air taxis and feeder airliners.
