'''Jane Peyton''' (October 26, 1870 – September 8, 1946) was an American lead and supporting actress whose career did not commence until she was nearly 30. During her time on stage, she appeared in several long-running [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays and successful road tours. Peyton was perhaps best remembered for performances in ''The Ninety and Nine'', ''The Earl of Pawtucket'', ''The Heir to the Hoorah'', ''The Three of Us'', and ''The Woman.'' Once the wife of actor [[Guy Bates Post]], Peyton retired after 14 years on stage, when she married the writer [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]].

In her youth, Peyton gave recitals and sang at social and church gatherings and at [[G.A.R.]] functions hosted by her father. She married a local physician after attending [[Northwestern University]] and for some years hence, her activities routinely merited a mention in newspaper [[society reporting|society pages]]. With the encouragement of [[Otis Skinner]], in the summer of 1900, she left her family and comfortable life behind and departed for New York for a career in theatre.<ref name="Fortune">"Prefers Stage to Big Fortune".

==Personal life==
Peyton married Milwaukee physician Dr. Robert Curtis Brown at her father's residence on October 26, 1892, and settled down to life that revolved around social activities of the city's elite.<ref>"To Be Married To-Day Nuptials of Miss Jennie Van Norman and Dr. R.

Upon hearing of his daughter's departure, George Van Norman threatened to disinherit her, and ultimately, in July 1902, Peyton's husband was granted an uncontested divorce on the grounds of desertion.<ref name="Fortune" /><ref name="Divorced" />

Peyton next married Arthur Cecil Gordon Weld, at the time the musical director at the [[Casino Theatre (New York City)|Casino Theatre]] and one-time musical director of the [[Florodora|Florodora Company]]. The two most likely first met when Weld worked in Milwaukee in the 1890s. For legal reasons, twice-divorced Weld could not remarry in New York, so instead the ceremony took place at the Hotel Walton in Philadelphia on May 22, 1903. This marriage ended in divorce on October 23, 1907.<ref>"Arthur Weld is Married". ''New York Times'', May 23, 1903, p. 1</ref><ref name="GBP">"Guy Bates Post's Marriage Annulled".
