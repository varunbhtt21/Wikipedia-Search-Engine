== Geography ==
Guluguba is located on the [[Leichhardt Highway]], north of [[Miles, Queensland|Miles]] and south of [[Wandoan]].<ref>{{Queensland Globe|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
The name ''Guluguba'' is thought to be an [[Australian Aboriginal|Aboriginal]] word meaning ''squatter pigeon''.<ref name=qpnt/><ref name=qpnl/>

Guluguba Post Office opened by 1916 (a [[receiving office]] had been open from 1915).<ref name = "Post Office">{{Cite web  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List  | publisher = Premier Postal Auctions | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=QLD&country= | accessdate = 10 May 2014}}</ref>

Guluguba Provisional School opened on 1 February 1917 on a half-time basis with Downfall Creek Provisional School which opened in March 1917. When the Downfall Creek school closed in 1918, Guluguba became a full-time school.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|title=Queensland schools past and present|publication-date=2010|author1=Queensland Family History Society|edition=Version 1.01|publisher=[[Queensland Family History Society]]|isbn=978-1-921171-26-0}}</ref>

In 1940 at Downfall Creek, the local Lutheran community established a Lutheran Day School. Meanwhile, Guluguba State School had two temporary closures in 1942 and 1944 due to a lack of teacher accommodation.<ref name=":0" />

In 1957, the Queensland Education Department was willing to provide a teacher to Downfall Creek so the Lutheran Church school became Downfall Creek Provisional School once again. It finally closed in 1962.<ref name=":0" />

== Education ==
Guluguba State School is a government co-educational primary school (P-6) at Fosters Road. In 2016, the school had an enrolment of 6 students with 2 teachers (1 full-time equivalent) and 4 non-teaching staff (2 equivalent full-time).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gulugubass.eq.edu.au/Supportandresources/Formsanddocuments/Annual%20reports/annual-report-2016.pdf|title=Annual Report 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Guluguba State School|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916034320/https://gulugubass.eq.edu.au/Supportandresources/Formsanddocuments/Annual%20reports/annual-report-2016.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=16 September 2017}}</ref>
