The '''Church of St Thomas''', [[Thurstonland]], West Yorkshire, England, is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church. It is an [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] building in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, designed by James Mallinson and [[William Swinden Barber]], and completed in 1870. The building was funded by [[William Legge, 5th Earl of Dartmouth]], and it was consecrated by [[Robert Bickersteth (bishop)|Robert Bickersteth]], [[Bishop of Ripon (modern diocese)|Bishop of Ripon]]. The total height of the tower and spire is {{Convert|109|ft|m}}, and the nave contains an [[Timber roof truss#Arch-braced truss|arch-braced]] [[hammerbeam roof]].<ref name="EH Thurstonland 1135375" />

The first incumbent of the parish to use this building was Rev. Robert Boyle Thompson, an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] missionary who had already done "great work" in the slums of [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]] when he was granted the living of Thurstonland at the age of 28 years.<ref name="YP and LI 3 July 1882" />

==Architects and artisans==
{{Main article|William Swinden Barber}}
The building was designed between 1867 and 1870 by Mallinson & Barber, however it was Barber who closely supervised the building work, so it can be understood that Barber was largely responsible for the plans.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" /><ref name="Church Plans online" /> The ground plan dated March 1867 and an undated sketch by the architects of [[William Butterfield]]'s St John the Evangelist, [[Birkby, North Yorkshire|Birkby]], are held at [[West Yorkshire Joint Services|West Yorkshire Archive Service]].<ref name="Church Plans online" >[http://www.churchplansonline.org/retrieve_results.asp?n=MALLINSON+(JAMES)+%26+BARBER+(WILLIAM+SWINDEN)&Submit=Start+Search Church Plans Online: William Swinden Barber] Retrieved 29 January 2014</ref><ref>[http://catalogue.wyjs.org.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=CC01278%2f1%2f7&pos=8 West Yorkshire Archive Service: CC01278 – Calderdale architects, plans and drawings (MISC:703), ground plan of Thurstonland Church, MISC:703/7] Retrieved 1 May 2014</ref><ref>[http://catalogue.wyjs.org.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=CC01278%2f1%2f8&pos=9 West Yorkshire Archive Services: CC01278 – Calderdale architects, plans and drawings (MISC:703), sketch of new church at Thurstonland, MISC:703/8] Retrieved 1 May 2014</ref> It is possible that Butterfield's 1853 Birkby church may have partially inspired or informed this design.<ref>See image of Butterfield's St John the Evangelist, Birkby [[:File:St John the Evangelist, Birkby.jpg]]</ref>

The clerk of the works in 1869 was Leonard North of [[Kirkburton]], followed by Thomas Elliott of Bradford in 1870. George Pollard of [[Huddersfield]] was the mason, Joah Swallow of [[Hepworth, West Yorkshire|Hepworth]] was joiner, and the plumber was Lockwood of [[Honley]]. The slaters were Goodwin & Sons of Huddersfield, the plasterer was Alfred Jessop of [[Shepley]], and the painter was Brighouse of Huddersfield. The heating apparatus was installed by Thornton of Huddersfield.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" /><ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" /><ref name="LM 27 July 1869 foundation stone" /><ref>Note: painting in Barber churches could mean stencilling and spirit frescos.</ref>

==History==
By 1869 three new churches had already been built in the Kirkburton parish due to the efforts of its vicar Rev. Richard Collins (1794–1882), but there was still just an inadequate chapel-room in Thurstonland. This was originally a dissenters' chapel built in 1810 and used as a [[chapel of ease]] for Kirkburton from 1834 to 1870. Around 1850 there was an unsuccessful local attempt to raise funds for a new church; a second attempt in 1867–1868 came to fruition.

The scattered population of this village, which was soon to become a parish in its own right, consisted of about 1,200 persons of "limited means", engaged in agricultural and manufacturing trades, so the congregation could not fund a new church. The Church of England therefore appealed to its richer members, so that Mr J.F. Winterbottom (1800–1868) of [[Newbury, Berkshire|Eastwood Hey]], Berkshire, bequeathed the one-acre site.<ref>Death cert: December 1868, Winterbottom John Frederick, 68 [[Westminster St Margaret and St John|Westminster St Margaret]], 1a/299</ref> The building was funded by [[William Legge, 5th Earl of Dartmouth|William Legge]], [[Earl of Dartmouth]], C.H. Bill, Colonel Brooke of Honley, J. Hirst JP, Colonel Bradbury and others, including ladies who organised a bazaar.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" /><ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" /><ref>United Kingdom Census 1861: estimated population of Thurstonland 1,116, spread across 2,050 acres</ref> Colonel Brooke was treasurer. Local people had raised £100 and, being unable to assist further with funding, had offered voluntary manual labour; they levelled the ground by hand. At the consecration it was mentioned by Rev. Richard Collins that funds were being raised for a new vicarage at Thurstonland.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" />

===Foundation stone ceremony===
The [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]] was laid at 1.30&nbsp;pm on Monday 26 July 1869. A large crowd gathered at the site, so that the area reserved for the ceremony had to be roped off. Countess Augusta of Dartmouth and Rev. Richard Collins, vicar of [[Kirkburton]], led the procession, followed by the [[William Legge, 5th Earl of Dartmouth|Earl of Dartmouth]] and the Rev. R.B. Thompson who was to be the first incumbent of Thurstonland Church. Then came more than 20 clergymen, churchwardens and a dozen or more VIPs who all crowded into the enclosure. Among the VIPs were Lieutenant-Colonel Bradbury JP, William Brooke JP, Captain Legge, Adjutant Legge, Major Brooke, George Wood Jenkinson (1838–1898) the Thurstonland churchwarden, and W.S. Barber the architect.<ref>Birth cert: September 1838, Jenkinson George Wood, Huddersfield, 22/342</ref><ref>Death cert: June 1898, Jenkinson George Wood, 59, Huddersfield, 9a/233</ref> In the newspaper reports, James Mallinson is not mentioned as being present. The choir, the band, the Sunday School children and the spectators arranged themselves outside the ropes.<ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" >''Huddersfield Chronicle'' 31 July 1869: New church for Thurstonland</ref><ref name="LM 27 July 1869 foundation stone" >''Leeds Mercury'' 27 July 1869: Laying the foundation stone of a new church at Thurstonland</ref>

[[File:William Legge 5th Earl of Dartmouth.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Legge, 5th Earl of Dartmouth]] who laid the foundation stone]]
The audience sang a hymn, ''This stone to Thee in faith we lay'', while an inscribed silver trowel was presented to the Earl of Dartmouth. The earl spread the mortar for the cornerstone. This cornerstone contained a cavity, and inside was a bottle containing "various documents related to the laying of the stone." The hole was sealed with an inscribed brass plate,<ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" /><ref name="LM 27 July 1869 foundation stone" /> which said:<blockquote>Glory be to God, the Son and the Holy Ghost, the foundation of this church in Thurstonland in the parish of Kirkburton, to be dedicated to His service by the name of St Thomas, was laid by Wm. Walter, Earl of Dartmouth, on the 26th July, 1869. Richard Collins, vicar of Kirkburton; Robert Boyle Thompson, curate of Thurstonland; George W. Jenkinson, churchwarden of Thurston-land, James Mallinson and Wm Swindon Barber, architects.<ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" /><ref name="LM 27 July 1869 foundation stone" /></blockquote>

The stone was lowered into place, struck by the Countess with a mallet, and declared laid. Thompson ended the service and the choir sang ''God Save the Queen''. The ceremony was not over, however, until the Earl had been formally thanked by Collins and had replied with a long speech which mentioned donations, touched on evangelism and dwelt on his newborn grandson. There was benediction from Collins, the procession left and the audience dispersed.<ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" /><ref name="LM 27 July 1869 foundation stone" /><ref>Note: the ''Leeds Messenger'' 27 July 1869 article states that the foundation stone was laid in a cavity, and under the stone was deposited a bottle containing newspapers etc.</ref>

Three hundred persons then enjoyed luncheon served in a marquee in the next-door field, alongside the road. There were many speeches, including a long one from the Earl: this time discussing church and laity, flattering the clergy and mentioning the [[Irish Church Act 1869|Irish Church Bill]]. A number of toasts were given, drunk and responded to at length. A toast was made to the architects and Barber responded, concluding the speeches with a toast to the ladies.<ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" /><ref name="LM 27 July 1869 foundation stone" />

===Consecration===
[[File:Robert Bickersteth Bishop of Ripon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Bickersteth (bishop)|Robert Bickersteth]], [[Bishop of Ripon (modern diocese)|Bishop of Ripon]], who consecrated the church]]
The church and graveyard were consecrated at 11&nbsp;am on 3 October 1870 by [[Robert Bickersteth (bishop)|Robert Bickersteth]], [[Bishop of Ripon (modern diocese)|Bishop of Ripon]], although part of the graveyard had already been consecrated by 1862, and the spire was not completed.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" >''Huddersfield Chronicle'', 8 October 1870: Consecration of St Thomas' Church, Thurstonland</ref><ref name="Graveyard Project" /> The pews were filled to overflowing when the bishop processed into the church, followed by over thirty local clergymen, all repeating [[Psalm 24]]. The bishop read the sentence of consecration, followed by morning prayers. The choir sang, and the almost-completed organ was played for the first time by Samuel Pontefract (1815–1896) of [[South Crosland]].<ref>Death cert: September 1896, Pontefract Samuel, 81, [[Borough of Fylde|Fylde]], 8e/408</ref> The bishop's sermon was based on [[Psalm 122]], verse 1. He alluded to the recent building work, the need for support from the laity in spirit and funding, and the pressing need for the final £400 required to pay off building costs. The collection amounted to £313 7s 1d. The bishop then processed outside with the clergy, to consecrate the burial ground.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" />

The [[marquee (tent)|marquee]] had appeared again in the neighbouring field, and a luncheon was enjoyed this time by only 100 persons, including the Bishop of Ripon, Rev. Collins of Kirkburton, Archdeacon Musgrave, the Earl and Countess of [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and other VIPs. The bishop and archdeacon ate and left, then a long series of toasts and speeches began. As chairman of the proceedings, the Vicar of Kirkburton stated that W.S. Barber the architect was unable to attend due to illness, but that he "had worked very hard in connection with the church; he had paid them a great many visits, and his superintendence had been untiring." In his speech, Rev. Thompson referred obliquely to the free seating in the new church, saying that rich and poor could worship together, and exhorting his privileged audience to take full part in public services regularly. The evening service raised £50, making the total collection for the day £363 7s 1d towards paying off the final £400 owing for building costs.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" />

===Original design===
[[File:St Thomas Thurstonland 035.jpg|thumb|right|East view of church]]
As originally designed in the "[[Gothic Revival architecture|geometric decorated style]] of architecture" to accommodate 385 adults and children, the nave was {{Convert|69|ft|m}} by {{Convert|28|ft|m}}, and {{Convert|47|ft|m}} high to the roof-ridge. The tower was {{Convert|17.5|ft|m}} square with a height of {{Convert|57|ft|m}}. The stone spire was originally designed to be {{Convert|40|ft|m}} but was ultimately raised to {{Convert|52|ft|m}}. The organ chamber measured {{Convert|14|ft|m}} and the vestry was {{Convert|12|ft|m}}. The ground floor of the tower doubled as the church porch, and its first floor held a children's gallery – directly beneath the single bronze bell. The nave roof was open-timbered, but the chancel roof was arched and boarded. The pews and choir stalls, designed by Mallinson and Barber, were of stained deal. These were to be for free use, with no rented box pews. Made to the architect's original design and commission, the oak pulpit stood on a stone base and the carved stone font was placed by the south west door.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" /><ref>[http://www.yorkshireindexers.info/wiki/index.php?title=Thurstonland_St._Thomas_Church Yorkshire Indexers: Thurstonland St Thomas Church] Retrieved 15 May 2014</ref>

===Exterior===
When the foundation stone was laid in 1869, this Gothic Revival Anglican church was said to have been designed "in the geometric decorated style."<ref name="HC 31 July 1869 new church" /> It is built of hammer-dressed stone with [[ashlar]] dressing. The stone gutter of the slate roof is on moulded brackets. The tower is at the east end of the nave, and it has a stair turret to the second floor on its west side and a splay-footed stone spire with four [[lucarne]]s. Over the south door is a canopied niche with a "moulded arched head and figure" beneath.<ref name="EH Thurstonland 1135375" />

===Interior===

====Tower====
[[File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 088m.JPG|thumb|left|View inside spire]]
The tower has four floors, of which the ground floor doubles as the church's porch.<ref>See image of door to nave at [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 081.jpg]]</ref> The first floor is the children's gallery; this has a stepped floor to accommodate the pews, leaving a large, wedge-shaped cavity between the ground floor ceiling and the surface for the seating. The children's gallery is well-lit by large windows, and is open to the nave, forming a balcony overlooking the pulpit. The opening to the nave was closed off around 1984 with a screen and door. The gallery is accessed separately from the nave via the tower's staircase, allowing the Sunday School children to be brought into the gallery and taken away to lessons without disturbing the service. This gallery is long disused and the steps beside the pews have become rotten and unsafe.<ref>See image of children's gallery: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 003.jpg]]</ref> The second floor is the clock chamber, containing an 1889 turret clock mechanism by [[Potts of Leeds]], who as of 2014 continue to maintain it. The clock chamber has no windows and is completely dark.<ref>See image of clock at: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 084m.JPG]]</ref> The bell chamber is on the third floor and contains the single bronze bell and clapper for the clock.<ref>See image of bell at [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 012.jpg]]</ref>

Above the bell frame there is a hole in the bell chamber ceiling, and through that opening can be seen the inside of the spire. It is a hollow cone of stone blocks, unsupported by any interior frame, and is full of light because it has four [[lucarne]]s at the bottom, and eight more large openings higher up.

====Nave====
[[File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 050.jpg|thumb|right|Oak [[pulpit]]]]
Inside there is an [[Timber roof truss#Arch-braced truss|arch-braced]] [[hammerbeam roof]].<ref name="EH Thurstonland 1135375" /> This is seen to full effect because of the contrasting dark-stained wood against very pale ceiling paint, and the large amount of light from clear-glazed windows.<ref>See image of nave ceiling: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 024.jpg]]</ref> Until at least 1984 there was an 1870 carved, square, marble font standing on four marble colonnettes, designed by Mallinson and Barber and funded by Mrs Bensted, wife of the vicar of Lockwood.<ref name="EH Thurstonland 1135375" /><ref name="A Church Near You" >[http://www.achurchnearyou.com/thurstonland-st-thomas/ C of E: A church near you, St Thomas, Thurstonland] Retrieved 27 February 2014</ref> The font was replaced in the 1980s, when the church room was installed inside the back of the nave, and the whereabouts of the original is unknown. Because an artisan painter is credited, there may originally have been wall paintings.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" />

The entrance area and aisle are paved with coloured, plain encaustic tiles whose layout pattern was designed by Mallinson and Barber; the floor under the pews retains its original floor boards.<ref>See image of tiled floor of nave at: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 040.jpg]]</ref> The organ was made by F.W. Jardine for Kirtland and Jardine in 1870, and was fully restored in 1990. It fits into the organ arch, which was designed for its dimensions.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" /><ref name="A Church Near You" /><ref>Information from wall plaque next to organ in nave</ref><ref>[http://www.organbuilders.co.uk/index.php?webpage=history Jardine Church Organs: history] Retrieved 11 May 2014</ref> The original 1870 carved oak pulpit on its carved stone plinth stands in its original position in front of the north side of the chancel arch.<ref>See image of pulpit at: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 050.jpg]]</ref> Many of the original pews designed by Mallinson and Barber still exist in situ, but the ones at the back of the nave were removed along with the marble font in the 1980s when the church room was constructed there.<ref>See image of pews at: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 063.jpg]]</ref>

====Chancel====
[[File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 092m.JPG|thumb|right|Roundel in east window]]
The east window by [[William Wailes]] represents the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]; it cost £100 and was funded in 1870 by the local inhabitants in memory of Thomas Brooke, father of the 1869–1870 fund-raising treasurer Colonel Brooke. Rev. Richard Collins stated at the 1870 consecration that the theme of Good Samaritan and the word "just" in the window's dedication referred to Thomas Brooke's good deeds.<ref name="HC consecration 8 Oct 1870" /> The [[reredos]] was installed in the 1920s, and on its bottom right hand skirting board there is a wooden plaque commemorating its presentation.<ref>See image of reredos at: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 036.jpg]]</ref> The sanctuary has decorative encaustic floor tiles whose arrangement was designed by Mallinson and Barber. These tiles were funded by D. Sharman who was master of Thurstonland [[Endowed Schools Act 1869|Endowed School]]. The choir stalls and the altar rail are decoratively carved, and were designed and commissioned by Mallinson and Barber.<ref>See image of choir stalls at [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 046.jpg]] and altar rail at: [[:File:St Thomas Thurstonland interior 043.jpg]]</ref>

==Graveyard==
Although the church itself was not consecrated until 1870, part of the graveyard was available for burials by 5 March 1862. The extant 1880 plan of the main area does not conform to the present layout – for example the paths are missing – and there are no sexton's records of individual burial sites; however there is a burial register transcript. It is an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] graveyard, although [[nonconformist]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] burials are recorded here.<ref name="Graveyard Project" />

The churchyard contains around 2,000 graves of patients who died at [[Kirkburton]] in [[Storthes Hall Hospital]] (1904–1991). Most of these graves are unmarked, in a separate field behind the church which was added by Rev. Arnold Escombe Jerram before he left in 1910.<ref name="Graveyard Project" /><ref name="YEP 2 June 1913" /> By 1913 there was fear in the village that the pauper burials were causing epidemics, because the sexton was saving money by leaving graves open to rain and weather, and not filling them with earth until they each contained their full complement of four coffins. The authorities claimed that Storthes Hall's use of the graveyard benefited Thurstonland by the payment of rates and that only fifty paupers per year, who were unclaimed by relatives, were buried there. Rev. P.S. Brown, at that time vicar of Thurstonland and chaplain to Storthes Hall, claimed that the burials were no danger to health, even though the sexton had to ladle out water from open graves before subsequent funerals.<ref name="YEP 2 June 1913" >''Yorkshire Evening Post'' 2 June 1913: Rattle his bones over the stones, condition of Yorkshire paupers' graves, villagers and epidemics</ref>
