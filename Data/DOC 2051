:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] I am concerned that the bulk of the article is cited to primary sources. Source 1 (Naval Technology) reads like a press release, and I suspect it might be one. The second source is from Bluefin Robotics Corporation. Those two are the most heavily relied upon sources.

::*Hi Sven, from what I understood, Naval Technology is pretty much a technology magazine. I agree that the writing seems to be from the POV of a marketing agency, but it seems to me like a regular magazine. As for the official Bluefin website, only the specifications have been taken from there. Should I reword it to say, according to the manufacturer? --[[User:Rsrikanth05|Rsrikanth05]] ([[User talk:Rsrikanth05|talk]]) 11:23, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Naval Tech calls themselves as a ''reference site''...so I think the POV can be taken for granted. It is a rather reliable source though. BTW, they use almost the same style of writing for other articles too (see [http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/delhi-class-destroyers/ 1] [http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/shivalik-class-friga/ 2] )....Cheers, '''<span style="text-shadow:2px 2px 3px lightskyblue;">[[User:Strike Eagle|<font color="#F62817 ">ƬheStrike</font>]][[User talk:Strike Eagle|<font color="#1673F5">Σagle</font>]] <sup>[[Special:Contributions/Strike_Eagle|sorties]]</sup></span>''' 12:55, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] [http://gifatron.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/senor-chang-ill-allow-it-sombrero.gif I'll clear the sources then]. This is new enough, long enough, within policy, the hook is appropriate, there is a QPQ, and an image is not under consideration.

:[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Still good with the image. I personally wouldn't run that image, per it not being reasonably clear looking at 100x100px, but it does meet the DYK requirements.
