'''Deep Thinka Records''' is an [[independent record label]] and [[booking agency]] based in Buffalo, New York. Founded by Anthony Caferro (Tone) and Robert Hill (Speed) in April 1997, it is the largest and most prominent hip-hop label in Upstate New York. Deep Thinka Records produces, publishes and books hip hop music, tours and events geared toward organizing the community, as well as developing strategic partnerships with other independent businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtr45.com/about.php|title=About DTR|publisher=DTR|date=August 1, 1997}}</ref> The label is proudly independent and active in such operations as Artist Management, Artist Development, Tour Booking, Visual/Film Production, Social Media Marketing and Street Promotion. The current roster includes acclaimed independent artists such as [[Blueprint (rapper)|Blueprint]], [[Substantial (rapper)]], [[Count Bass D]], [[Billy Drease Williams]], [[Paulie Rhyme]], [[Chuckie Campbell]], [[Tanya Morgan]], and [[Fresh Kils]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sussman|first=Sarah|title=Fresh Kils signs to Deep Thinka Records & announces European tour |url=http://www.hiphopcanada.com/2014/04/fresh-kils-signs-to-deep-thinka-records-announces-european-tour-news/|publisher=Hip Hop Canada|accessdate=8 April 2014}}</ref>

==History==
Deep Thinka Records began as an ambitious idea out of a University of Buffalo dorm room,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artvoice.com/issues/v5n16/this_is_buffalo_hip_hop|title=This Is Buffalo Hip Hop|publisher=Artvoice|first=Daniel|last=Honigman|date=April 20, 2006}}</ref> has now grown into the most influential independent Hip Hop label in "The Queen City" of Buffalo. The label has dedicated itself to expressive artistic revolution, skillful and innovative music, social consciousness and aims to counterbalance the brash materialism, meat-headed misogyny, and glorified violence that have become synonymous with popular rap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalospree.com/buffalospreemagazine/archives/2005_0506/050605hiphop.html|title=Hip Hop: Two Turntables and a Business Loan|publisher=Buffalo Spree Magazine|first=Joe|last=Sweeney|date=May–June 2005}}</ref>

The name of the label was borne out of a collaborative song entitled "How The Real Crew Bang", recorded in 1996 and 1997 for an early internet hip hop crew called Ill Crew Universal (ICU). Caferro felt the previous ICU mixtapes during that time featured primarily California or overseas based artists, and wanted to record a posse cut with ICU members located in the eastern USA for the crew’s third mixtape: The Death of Hip Hop.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICU 3: Who's Tru?|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-ICU-3-The-Death-Of-Hip-Hop/release/1927435|publisher=Discogs}}</ref> The song ultimately featured DTR co-founder Robert "Speed" Hill as well as Jason "Furious" Floyd; Iz-Real, The Joker, Quest One, and Kid Logik. In the interest of cohesion, the artists involved decided to credit themselves collectively for the song, and eventually they settled on "Deep Thinkaz".
<ref>{{cite web|title=DeepThinkaz|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/1568994-Deep-Thinkaz|publisher=Discogs}}</ref>
Shortly after the release of the mixtape, Caferro and Hill decided to form an indie label based on the positive experience of working together, and the exuberant support and response to the song, and "Deep Thinkaz" became Deep Thinka Records. The label was originally formed as a personal partnership in 1997; and in 2001, was legally formed as a Limited Liability Company in the State of New York.<ref>{{cite web|last=Park |first=Gene |title=Deep Thinking |url=http://www.ubspectrum.com/arts/deep-thinking-1.1394400?#.U2OGAuaSy4k |publisher=UB Spectrum |accessdate=2 Sep 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502201631/http://www.ubspectrum.com/arts/deep-thinking-1.1394400 |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}</ref>

From 2004-2009, DTR, alongside [[Billy Drease Williams]] curated the annual Art of Hip Hop event in Buffalo. The Art of Hip Hop focuses on educating young people in Western New York on art, music, mathematics and business.
