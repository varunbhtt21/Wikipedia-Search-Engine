* [[Skyrider (roller coaster)]] to [[SkyRider (roller coaster)]]. So both articles have had histories on the same topic but a user wanted to move Skyrider to SkyRider. Since SkyRider was a redirect with article history, a straight move could not happen so a cut-paste move resulted. Would it be possible to move SkyRider out of the way (e.g. [[SkyRider (roller coaster)/old]] or similar) and have the original Skyrider article moved to SkyRider (roller coaster) to preserve the history? I posted this here because there is a one-revision history merge that could be done in the process. <span style="border:1px solid #0072BC;padding:1px;">[[User:Themeparkgc|<span style="color:#0072BC;padding-left:1px;">Themeparkgc</span>]]&nbsp;[[User_talk:Themeparkgc|<span style="color:#fff;background:#0072BC;">&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;</span>]]</span> 00:42, 9 August 2014 (UTC)

* [[Lisa Pathfinder]] and [[New Gravitational Wave Observatory]]: Quite a nasty one here, somebody got the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft confused with another mission and renamed the article accordingly. Without noticing their error I moved the page again to fix a formatting issue in the new title. Somebody else then noticed the error and attempted to revert the move by copying the article to a different title again. Also the [[New Gravitational Wave Observatory]] page, which contains the page history for LISA Pathfinder, has somehow ended up pointing at [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (which is probably the correct place for that title to redirect to). What I think needs to happen is for the page history at NGWO to be merged into [[Lisa Pathfinder]], and then for the whole article to be moved back to its original title of [[LISA Pathfinder]], requiring the deletion of a redirect created by the original move under CSD G6. --'''''[[User:WDGraham|<font color="#115566">W.</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:WDGraham|<font color="#364966">D.</font>]]&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/WDGraham|<font color="#496636">Graham</font>]]''''' 16:02, 28 June 2014 (UTC)

*{{notdone}} [[Chen (singer)]] to [[Chen (South Korean singer)]] (asked for by <nowiki>{{histmerge}}</nowiki>) : page [[Chen (South Korean singer)]] started as not a cut-and-paste but as a new independent start.

*{{notdone}} A move of [[Mudslide]] to [[Mudflow]] was requested at [[WP:RMTR]]. The non-empty talk page at [[Talk:Mudflow]] was in the way of this, so I have moved it to [[Talk:Mudflow/Archive 1]]. There is not really anything worth textmerging in the old talk. I just did this to avoid the alternative of deleting old versions.

*{{notdone}} A move of [[Subash Nemwang]] was requested at [[WP:RMTR]]. The target was messed up due to a reverted cut-and-paste move. History merge not possible. See [[Talk:Subash Chandra Nembang]] for what was done. [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] ([[User talk:EdJohnston|talk]]) 15:54, 13 July 2014 (UTC)

* [[User:Turgan/Sandbox2]] to [[Uranium ore]]: A major update to Uranium ore was undertaken in my sandbox and then cut/pasted into the main article before I knew all the ins and outs of the proper methods.  All edits in the sandbox up to march 23, 2009 are related to that effort and should probably be included in that edit history.  Thank you, [[User:Turgan|Turgan]] <sup>[[User talk:Turgan|Talk]]</sup> 21:59, 5 July 2014 (UTC)

*{{notdone}} A move of [[Untitled Next (film)]] to [[Badlapur (film)]] was requested at [[WP:RMTR]]. This couldn't be done due to parallel histories. For details see [[Talk:Badlapur (film)#Article moves]]. [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] ([[User talk:EdJohnston|talk]]) 15:55, 26 June 2014 (UTC)
*[[Automatic vectorization]] was merged into [[Vectorization (parallel computing)]] as a section (#Techniques). I want to rename the latter page to the former's title, because the article only discusses ''automatic'' vectorization, not [[Array programming|manual vectorization]].
