*'''Delete''' self promotional material is not suitable for writing a wikipedia article. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 21:39, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per [[WP:HEY]], based on a cite from ''USA Today'' and other reliable sources added after I first looked at the article. The peppy tone can be fixed. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 20:27, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. To the extent subject received coverage in reliable sources it appears to be [[WP:ONEEVENT]], though book may be notable and general subject is for sure notable. --''[[User:Pink Bull|<span style="font-family:Verdana;color: #FF1493">Pink</span>]][[User talk:Pink Bull|<span style="font-family:Verdana;color: #FF1493">Bull</span>]]'' 16:03, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Redirect''' to [[Commercial surrogacy in India]], not independently notable; however, book publicised India as a place of commercial surrogacy. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 00:30, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
