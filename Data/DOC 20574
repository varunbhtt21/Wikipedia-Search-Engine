Title : File:Nick Jonas - Haven't Met You Yet.jpg
Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
|Description = Cover art for the single "Haven't Met You Yet" by singer Nick Jonas.
|Source = https://itunes.apple.com/in/album/havent-met-you-yet-feat.-nick/id508054976
|Author = [[Nick Jonas]], [[Columbia Records]]
|Article = Haven't Met You Yet#Nick Jonas version
|Purpose = to serve as the primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the work in question.
|Replaceability = As musical cover art, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the music would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary.
|Minimality = The entire cover: because the image is cover art, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image.
|Commercial = The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original cover. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable as artwork on pirate versions or other uses that would compete with the commercial purpose of the original artwork.
