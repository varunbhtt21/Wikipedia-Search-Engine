==Birth and early childhood==
Mahmud Namık was born in Dolmabahçe Palace and lived there until the death of his grandfather, Sultan [[Mehmed V]], just before the end of World War I on 4 July 1918. He then moved with his family to a [[Konak (residence)]] at [[Nişantaşı]] for the winter months and to one in Bağlarbaşı, above Beylerbeyi, for the summer.

==Exile==
In March 1924, at the age of 10, Prince Mahmud Namık was sent into exile along with the entire Imperial Ottoman family, following the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]] and the [[abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate]] and the Ottoman Caliphate. Prince Mahmud Namık never returned to Turkey, since he died before the decree of exile was lifted in 1974. He was initially sent to boarding school in Lebanon, but then soon came to live with his family in Nice, France once they had settled there to be close to the former Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed VI]], who had rented a villa in San Remo, and to their cousin, the last Caliph of Islam [[Abdülmecid II]], who lived in Nice. In 1934 he moved to Alexandria, Egypt with his father Ömer Hilmi and grandmother, and was later joined in January by his sister, Emine Mükbile, and his brother-in-law, Ali Vâsib. By the early 1940s Prince Mahmud Namık kept an apartment with his wife Şaharazad (or Shahrazad) in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egy.com/maadi/10-11-25.php |title=Maadi'S Ottomans |publisher=Egy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>
