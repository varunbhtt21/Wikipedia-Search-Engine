Graphic marketplace with claims not verified by reliable sources. 2010 Weeby award winner was [[Tumblr]] [[User talk:Bisswajit|<font size="4"><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;color:green">Bisswajit</span></font>]] 09:01, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': Well... the thing is, the award they won wasn't the main one but the people's choice award. Of course that brings in a new concern of whether or not they could have potentially swayed the vote by getting people to vote for them or falsifying votes, but I'd like to think that the WA would have a way to avoid ballot stuffing. I hope they would, in any case. [[User:Tokyogirl79|Tokyogirl79]][[user talk:Tokyogirl79|'''<span style='color: #19197;background-color: #FFFFFF;'>  (｡◕‿◕｡)</span>''']]  09:31, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. I found quite a bit of mention of the company in various different avenues, including several books. I put one of them on the article, but there was still a ton of mentions in other books that could be seen as reliable as far as notability goes. There's also quite a bit of coverage in various RS as well. I have to admit that because of how promotional the article was, I wasn't expecting to find much of anything out there but I've given the article a good scrubbing and cleaned the worst of it out. I'd say that the Webby Award it did win would help go towards notability, so all of this together would show notability enough to pass [[WP:CORP]] or [[WP:WEB]].

:Greatly appreciate your cleanup. The article is sourced with reliable sources so I am willing to '''withdraw''' the nomination. Thank you. [[User talk:Bisswajit|<font size="4"><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;color:green">Bisswajit</span></font>]] 14:07, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
