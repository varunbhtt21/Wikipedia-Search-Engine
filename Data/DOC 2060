==West Bank plot==
During the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], the [[Shin Bet]] revealed an alleged plot by Hamas to depose Fatah rule in the West Bank. This was to be achieved by deploying Hamas cells around the West Bank to incite a third [[wikt:intifada|intifada]] and overwhelm Palestinian Authority forces. More than 90 people were arrested. President Abbas said the plot was "a grave threat to the unity of the Palestinian people and its future."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-says-it-foiled-hamas-plan-for-coup-against-pa-in-west-bank/|title=Israel says it foiled Hamas plan for massive attacks on Israel, coup against PA|last=Ginsburg|first=Mitch|date=18 August 2014|work=[[The Times of Israel]]}}</ref>
