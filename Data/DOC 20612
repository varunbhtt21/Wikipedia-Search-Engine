The '''Freightliner Business Class M2''' is a model range of [[medium-duty truck|medium-duty]] trucks produced by [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]].  In production since June 2002, the M2 was the successor to the [[Freightliner Business Class (FL-Series)|FL-Series]] introduced in the 1990s.<ref name="Fleet Owner-2/02">{{cite web | url=http://fleetowner.com/news/fleet_freightliner_introduces_business | title=Freightliner introduces Business Class M2 | accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>  In terms of size, the M2 is produced in [[Truck classification|Class 5 through Class 8]] GVWR ratings, competing primarily against the [[International Durastar]] and the [[Ford F-650|Ford F-650/F-750 Super Duty]].

Freightliner produces the Business Class M2 model range in [[Mount Holly, North Carolina]] and Santiago Tianguistenco, Mexico.

==Models==
The Business Class M2 is produced in a wide range of configurations, in both medium-duty and severe-service configurations.   There are three different cab configurations: a 106-inch BBC (bumper to back of cab) day cab, a 132-inch BBC extended cab, and a 154-inch BBC 4-door crew cab.<ref name="Fleet Owner 8/02">{{cite web | url=http://fleetowner.com/news/fleet_freightliner_rolls_new | title=Freightliner rolls out new Business Class M2 models | accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>  The crew-cab configuration offers seating for up to six passengers.<ref name="Fleet Owner 8/02" />

====M2 106====
Named for its 106-inch BBC length in daycab configuration, the M2 106 is a Class 5-8 truck available in GVWRs up to 56,000 lbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freightlinertrucks.com/Trucks/Models/M2106/|title=M2 106 - Vocational, Medium-Duty Truck - Freightliner Trucks|website=www.freightlinertrucks.com}}</ref>  The M2 106 is produced primarily as a straight truck, although its cab and chassis are used in the bus industry as a cutaway cab conversion.  
 
====M2 112====
Named for its 112-inch BBC length, the M2 112 is a Class 8 truck available in GVWRs up to 80,000 lbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freightlinertrucks.com/Trucks/Models/M2112/|title=Vocational, Medium-Duty M2 112 - Freightliner Trucks|website=www.freightlinertrucks.com}}</ref>  Although available as a straight truck like the M2 106, it is also available as a tractor. Externally, it is distinguished by a larger grille and slightly higher hoodline.

====eM2====
The '''e-M2''', an all-electric variant of this class 5 medium duty [[cube truck]], was unveiled in mid-2018. It would have {{convert|480|hp|kW|abbr=on}} peak horsepower, using {{convert|325|kWh|Mcal|abbr=on}} batteries, having a range of {{convert|230|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The fast charger would allow for 80% charge in 1 hour ({{convert|184|mi|km|abbr=on}}). It has a load capacity GCWR of {{convert|26000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=TruckNews-2018-06-06> {{cite news |url= https://www.trucknews.com/equipment/freightliner-debuts-electric-cascadia-m2/1003086111/ |title= Freightliner debuts electric Cascadia, M2 |author= James Menzies |date= 6 June 2018 |publisher= Truck News }} </ref> {{asof|2019}}, it costs $400,000; about 4 times the price of the diesel equivalent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adler |first1=Alan |title=2019 Work Truck Show: Adoption of Electrification Wonâ€™t be Fast |url=https://www.trucks.com/2019/03/08/2019-work-truck-show-adoption-electrification-wont-be-fast/ |website=Trucks.com |accessdate=4 April 2019 |date=8 March 2019}}</ref>

===Bus===

Freightliner offers two variants of the M2 for bus use: the C2/S2 cowled chassis and the S2C [[Cutaway van chassis|cutaway cab]] bus chassis.  Serving as the donor chassis for the [[Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2]] school bus constructed by Freightliner subsidiary [[Thomas Built Buses]], the C2 chassis departs from previous precedent in its higher parts commonality with the M2 106 truck.  Forward of the driver's seat,  the dashboard is used in its entirety; while the windshield is redesigned (enlarged), the stock windshield wipers are retained.

Outside of school bus use, Freightliner designates the cowled bus chassis as the Freightliner S2;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcccbus.com/wp-content/uploads/chassis_pdfs/S2Flyer.pdf |title=Specs |website=www.fcccbus.com |format=PDF}}</ref> the model is no longer offered on the Freightliner chassis website.

The Freightliner S2C is the cutaway-cab variant of the M2.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcccbus.com/wp-content/uploads/chassis_pdfs/S2CFlyer.pdf |title=Specs |website=www.fcccbus.com |format=PDF}}</ref>  Never produced with a school bus body, the S2C was intended for various commercial uses, including shuttle and transit bus use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcccbus.com/chassis/s2c/|title=S2C Chassis{{!}} Freightliner Bus|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>      {{Clear|}}

=== Severe-service trucks ===
[[File:CN railroad maintenance truck 176356 20120930 02.JPG|thumb|Freightliner M2 112V crew-cab railroad maintenance vehicle]]
As with the FL-Series, Freightliner developed severe-service variants of the Business Class M2.  While the M2 106V and M2 112V would share the same cabs and hood as the medium-duty vehicles, they were based on their own unique chassis.  In 2011, Freightliner replaced the M2 106V/112V with the "SD" line of severe-service trucks, dropping them out of the Business Class M2 model range.   While the 108SD and 114SD still used the M2 cab, an all-new hood and chassis was used.

Freightliner Specialty Vehicles (also known as SportChassis LLC)<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=6710487|title = Bloomberg Business {{!}} Company Overview of Freightliner Specialty Vehicles, Inc.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> is a manufacturer based in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]] that produces conversions of the Business Class M2 as consumer vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportchassis.com/models|title=SportChassis|website=www.sportchassis.com}}</ref>  Several vehicles are available, including 5th-wheel tow vehicles and pickup trucks.  While similar in layout to the [[International XT|International CXT/RXT]], these differ in that they are completed by a [[Second stage manufacturer|second-stage manufacturer]].
