Title : Plasmid partition system
Text : A '''plasmid partition system''' is a mechanism that ensures the stable inheritance of [[plasmid]]s during bacterial cell division. Each plasmid has its independent replication system which controls the number of copies of the plasmid in a cell. The higher the copy number is, the more likely the two daughter cells will contain the plasmid. Generally, each molecule of plasmid diffuses randomly, so the probability of having a plasmid-less daughter cell is 2<sup>1−N</sup>, where N is the number of copies. For instance, if there are 2 copies of a plasmid in a cell, there is a 50% chance of having one plasmid-less daughter cell. However, high-copy number plasmids have a cost for the hosting cell. This metabolic burden is lower for low-copy plasmids, but those have a higher probability of plasmid loss after a few generations. To control vertical transmission of plasmids, in addition to controlled-replication systems, bacterial plasmids use different maintenance strategies, such as [[multimer resolution systems]], [[Addiction module|post-segregational killing systems (addiction modules)]], and partition systems.<ref name="Dmowski">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dmowski M, Jagura-Burdzy G | title = Active stable maintenance functions in low copy-number plasmids of Gram-positive bacteria I.

== General properties of partition systems ==

Plasmid copies are paired around a [[centromere]]-like site and then separated in the two daughter cells. Partition systems involve three elements, organized in an auto-regulated [[operon]]: <ref name="pmid3420178">{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman SA, Austin SJ | title = The P1 plasmid-partition system synthesizes two essential proteins from an auto-regulated operon | journal = Plasmid | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–12 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3420178 | doi = 10.1016/0147-619X(88)90049-2 }}</ref>
* A centromere-like DNA site
* Centromere binding proteins (CBP)
* The motor protein

The centromere-like DNA site is required in ''[[Cis-regulatory element|cis]]'' for plasmid stability. It often contains one or more inverted repeats which are recognized by multiple CBPs. This forms a nucleoprotein complex termed the partition complex. This complex recruits the motor protein, which is a nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase). The NTPase uses energy from NTP binding and hydrolysis to directly or indirectly move and attach plasmids to specific host location (e.g. opposite bacterial cell poles).

The partition systems are divided in four types, based primarily on the type of NTPases:<ref name="Gerdes2000">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerdes K, Møller-Jensen J, Bugge Jensen R | title = Plasmid and chromosome partitioning: surprises from phylogeny | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 455–66 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10931339 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01975.x }}</ref>
* Type I : Walker type P-loop ATPase
* Type II : Actin-like ATPase
* Type III : tubulin-like GTPase
* Type IV : No NTPase

== Type I partition system ==

This system is also used by most bacteria for [[chromosome segregation]].<ref name="Gerdes2000" /> 
Type I partition systems are composed of an ATPase which contains [[Walker motifs]] and a CBP which is structurally distinct in type Ia and Ib. ATPases and CBP from type Ia are longer than the ones from type Ib, but both CBPs contain an arginine finger in their N-terminal part <ref>{{cite journal|last=Ah-Seng|first=Y|author2=Lane, D|author3=Pasta, F|author4=Lane, D|author5=Bouet, JY|title=Dual role of DNA in regulating ATP hydrolysis by the SopA partition protein|journal=Journal of Biochemical Chemistry|date=2009|volume=70|issue=44|pages=30067–75|pmid=19740757|pmc=2781561|doi=10.1074/jbc.M109.044800}}</ref><ref name="Dmowski" /><ref name="Schumacher2012" >{{cite journal | author = Schumacher MA | title = Bacterial plasmid partition machinery: a minimalist approach to survival | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 72–9 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22153351 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2011.11.001 | pmc=4824291}}</ref>.

=== Type Ia ===

The CBP of this type consists in three domains:<ref name="Schumacher2012" />
* N-terminal NTPase binding domain
* Central Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) domain
* C-terminal dimer-domain

=== Type Ib ===

The CBP of this type, also known as ''parG'' is composed of:<ref name="Schumacher2012" />
* N-terminal NTPase binding domain
* Ribon-Helix-Helix (RHH) domain

For this type, the ''parS'' site is called ''parC''.

== Type II partition system ==

This system is the best understood of the plasmid partition system.<ref name="Schumacher2012" />
It is composed of an actin-like ATPAse, ParM, and a CBP called ParR. The centromere like site, ''parC'' contains two sets of five 11 base pair direct repeats separated by the ''parMR'' promoter.
The amino-acid sequence identity can go down to 15% between ParM and other actin-like ATPase.<ref name="Chen2008" /><ref name="pmid25788699">{{cite journal | authors = Gunning PW, Ghoshdastider U, Whitaker S, Popp D, Robinson RC | title = The evolution of compositionally and functionally distinct actin filaments | journal = J Cell Sci | date=2015 | pmid = 25788699 | doi=10.1242/jcs.165563 | volume=128 | issue = 11 | pages=2009–19}}</ref>

The mechanism of partition involved here is a pushing mechanism:<ref name="pmid14690601">{{cite journal |vauthors=Møller-Jensen J, Borch J, Dam M, Jensen RB, Roepstorff P, Gerdes K | title = Bacterial mitosis: ParM of plasmid R1 moves plasmid DNA by an actin-like insertional polymerization mechanism | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1477–87 | year = 2003 |  pmid = 14690601 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00451-9 }}</ref>
# ParR binds to ''parC'' and pairs plasmids which form a nucleoprotein complex, or partition complex
# The partition complex serves as nucleation point for the polymerization of ParM; ParM-ATP complex inserts at this point and push plasmids apart
# The insertion leads to hydrolysis of ParM-ATP complex, leading to depolymerization of the filament
# At cell division, plasmids copies are at each cell extremity, and will end up in future daughter cell

The filament of ParM is regulated by the polymerization allowed by the presence the partition complex (ParR-''parC''), and by the depolymerization controlled by the ATPase activity of ParM.

== Type III partition system ==

The type III partition system is the most recently discovered partition system. It is composed of tubulin-like GTPase termed TubZ, and the CBP is termed TubR.
Amino-acid sequence identity can go down to 21% for TubZ proteins.<ref name="Chen2008" />

The mechanism is similar to a treadmill mechanism:<ref name="Ni2010">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ni L, Xu W, Kumaraswami M, Schumacher MA | title = Plasmid protein TubR uses a distinct mode of HTH-DNA binding and recruits the prokaryotic tubulin homolog TubZ to effect DNA partition | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 26 | pages = 11763–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20534443 | pmc = 2900659 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1003817107 | url = }}</ref>
# Multiple TubR dimer binds to the centromere-like region ''stbDRs'' of the plasmids.
# Contact between TubR and filament of treadmilling TubZ polymer. TubZ subunits are lost from the - end and are added to the + end.
# TubR-plasmid complex is  pulled along the growing polymer until it reaches the cell pole.
# Interaction with membrane is likely to trigger the release of the plasmid.

The net result being transport of partition complex to the cell pole.

== Other partition systems ==

=== R388 partition system ===

The partition system of the plasmid R388 has been found within the ''stb'' operon. This operon is composed of three genes, ''stbA'', ''stbB'' and ''stbC''.<ref name="pmid21625564">{{cite journal |vauthors=Guynet C, Cuevas A, Moncalián G, de la Cruz F | title = The stb operon balances the requirements for vegetative stability and conjugative transfer of plasmid R388 | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = e1002073 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21625564 | pmc = 3098194 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002073 }}</ref>
* StbA protein is a DNA-binding protein (identical to [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11904 ParM]) and is strictly required for the stability and intracellular positioning of plasmid R388 in ''E. coli''. StbA binds a ''cis''-acting sequence, the ''stbDRs''.
The StbA-''stbDRs'' complex may be used to pair plasmid the host chromosome, using indirectly the bacterial partitioning system.
* StbB protein has a Walker-type ATPase motif, it favors for conjugation but is not required for plasmid stability over generations.
* StbC is an orphan protein of unknown function. StbC doesn't seem to be implicated in either partitioning or conjugation.

StbA and StbB have opposite but connected effect related to conjugation.

This system has been proposed to be the type IV partition system.<ref name="Cruz2011">{{cite journal |vauthors=Guynet C, de la Cruz F | title = Plasmid segregation without partition | journal = Mobile Genetic Elements | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 236–241 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22312593 | pmc = 3271553 | doi = 10.4161/mge.1.3.18229 | url = }}</ref> It is thought to be a derivative of the type I partition system, given the similar operon organization.
This system represents the first evidence for a mechanistic interplay between plasmid segregation and conjugation processes.<ref name="Cruz2011" />

=== pSK1 partition system (reviewed in <ref name="Dmowski" />) ===

pSK1 is a plasmid from [[Staphylococcus aureus]]. This plasmid has a partition system determined by a single gene, ''par'', previously known as ''orf245''. This gene does not effect the plasmid copy number nor the grow rate (excluding its implication in a post-segregational killing system). A centromere-like binding sequence is present upstream of the ''par'' gene, and is composed of seven direct repeats and one inverted repeat.
