'''''Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury''''' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Albert Chevallier Tayler]] completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the [[Kent County Cricket Club]] at the suggestion of chairman [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|Lord Harris]] to celebrate their first [[County Championship]] title win.<ref name=sell>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/251684.html |title=Kent sell classic painting for £600,000 |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the [[St Lawrence Ground]] until 1999, at which time it was moved to the [[Lord's Pavilion]] as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting<ref name=feat /> to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in [[London]].<ref name=m />

== Commissioning ==
[[Kent County Cricket Club]] won the [[1906 County Championship]], gaining 78% of the points available in their completed matches, above the 70% achieved by second-place [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/0/County_Championship_1906.html|title=County Championship 1906 table |publisher=Cricket Archive |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}</ref> This was Kent's first victory since the [[County Championship]] had been instituted in 1890. At a celebratory dinner in London, the Kent chairman, [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris]], suggested that the club commission a painting to celebrate the championship victory.<ref name=ct />

Kent selected [[Albert Chevallier Tayler]] as the artist; he had earlier painted Lord Harris batting for Kent in 1905. Tayler was paid 200 [[Guinea (coin)|guinea]]s by Kent for the painting, with an additional royalty for reproductions that could bring the total as high as 350 guineas.<ref name=ct />

== Composition ==
Lord Harris expressed his view that the painting should show an action shot of a match at the [[St Lawrence Ground]], [[Canterbury]], and suggested that the [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] in the painting should be Kent's [[Colin Blythe]].<ref name=ct>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/228980.html |title=A Canterbury tale |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Kent had only played three matches at Canterbury during [[1906 County Championship|the 1906 season]]; of those it was decided that the subject of the painting would be Kent's match against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]]. That match was part of the [[Canterbury Cricket Week]], and Blythe had taken eight [[wicket]]s, making it the most appropriate of the three fixtures to depict. Tayler decided that he would show the second day of the match, at an hour prior to [[lunch (cricket)|lunchtime]].<ref name=ct />

The painting shows the view from the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] of the Nackington Road end of the St. Lawrence Ground with [[Canterbury Cathedral]] visible in the background. The painting has Blythe in the action of bowling from the Pavilion End to [[Johnny Tyldesley]]. Tayler compressed the view of the playing area so that he could feature all of Kent's eleven players while keeping them recognisable and reasonably sized.<ref name=ct />{{clarify|image only shows 10 fielders|date=August 2015}}

To ensure accuracy, Tayler arranged sittings with each member of the Kent team and made an effort to paint each one true to life. He initially planned to include [[non-striker|non-striking]] Lancashire [[batsman (cricket)|batsman]] [[Harry Makepeace]], but when Makepeace was unable to attend a sitting, Tayler used another Lancashire player, [[William Findlay (cricketer)|William Findlay]], as the batsman. Findlay had not actually played in that particular match, but he was available to visit Tayler's London studio as he had been newly appointed secretary of the [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] after his retirement from active cricket competition at the end of 1906.<ref name=ct />

== Reception and display history ==
Tayler completed the painting in 1907. By this time, 192 advance engravings of the painting had been ordered, ensuring that Tayler would be well compensated for the work. When the painting was unveiled, it was praised for its accuracy, use of lighting, and shade.<ref name=book>{{cite book | first =Stella | last = Walker  | title =British sporting art in the twentieth century | publisher = Sportsman's Press | edition = | year = 1989| isbn = 0948253363 | page = 185}}</ref> In 1908, a limited print signed by Tayler and Lord Harris was created; further prints were made by Kent in 1990 and 2000, and each was signed by current players of their respective times, including [[Colin Cowdrey]], [[E.W. Swanton]], [[Les Ames]] and [[Matthew Fleming]]. As a result of its popularity, the painting was lent out for display at [[Rectory Field]], [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and Lord's Cricket Ground.<ref name=ct /> The painting is viewed by cricket fans and historians as a notable illustration of the [[Golden Age of cricket]] in the Victorian and Edwardian periods before the [[First World War]].<ref name=ct /> Cricket historian [[E. W. Swanton]] praised the painting, singling it out as "one of the finest ever portrayals of distinguished identifiable cricketers in action".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/255236.html |title=Blythe's canvas immortality |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>  

The painting was predominantly displayed in the pavilion of the St. Lawrence Ground. However, in 1999 it was lent to [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) after Kent were unable to continue to afford its insurance.<ref name=feat /> The MCC hung the painting in the [[Lord's Pavilion]] while Kent retained one of the prints for display in the St. Lawrence Ground pavilion in place of the original.<ref name=feat /><ref>{{cite book | first =Duncan | last = Hamilton  | title =A Last English Summer: The Biography of a Cricket Season | publisher = Quercus | edition = | year = 2011| isbn = 0857383043 | chapter = Afterword: A very perfect gentle knight}}</ref> In 2005, with Kent finding itself in debt,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4811060.stm |title=Cricket club getting £7m revamp |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-16 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> the club announced their intention to sell the painting.<ref name=ct /> When questioned by Kent members about the proposed sale, Kent chairman [[Carl Openshaw]] said that it was being done because he felt the painting no longer particularly benefited the cricket club as many of Kent's members already owned reproductions of the painting.<ref name=km>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/cricket-club-may-sell-100-year-o-a21709/ |title=Cricket club may sell 100-year-old painting |publisher=Kent Online |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Openshaw also stated that the painting would not be sold if it did not achieve an "appropriate sum".<ref name=km /> 

The painting was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] in 2006. With a guide price of £300,000 to £500,000, the painting was sold for £680,000.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.L06131.html/f/68/L06131-68.pdf |title=Victorian & Edwardian Art |publisher=Sotheby's |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref> This was a record price for a cricket painting.<ref name=feat>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/5121736.stm |title=Auction feat for cricket painting |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> It was bought by the Andrew Brownsword Art Foundation run by [[Bath Rugby]] chairman [[Andrew Brownsword]]; the foundation is known for keeping "important British paintings in the public eye in Britain".
