Title : Symbolism in the French Revolution
Text : [[File:Sansculottes.jpg|thumb|French revolutionaries wearing [[Phrygian cap]]s and ''tricolor'' [[cockade]]s]]
'''Symbolism in the French Revolution''' was a device to distinguish and celebrate (or vilify) the main features of the [[French Revolution]] and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illusrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instill in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.<ref>Censer and Hunt, "How to Read Images" CD-ROM with {{Cite book|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution|year=2001|location = Pennsylvania|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|first =Jack|last = Censer|author2=Lynn Hunt }}

==Fasces==
[[File:Armoiries république française.svg|thumb|The unofficial but common [[National Emblem of France]] is backed by a fasces, representing justice.]]
[[Fasces#Fasces in France|Fasces]], like many other symbols of the French Revolution, are Roman in origin. Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing an axe. In Roman times, the fasces symbolized the power of magistrates, representing union and accord with the Roman Republic.  The French Republic continued this Roman symbol to represent state power, justice, and unity.<ref name="ReferenceA">Censer and Hunt, "How to Read Images" CD-ROM</ref>


During the Revolution, the fasces image was often used in conjunction with many other symbols. Though seen throughout the French Revolution, perhaps the most well known French reincarnation of the fasces is the Fasces surmounted by a Phrygian cap. This image has no display of an axe or a strong central state; rather, it symbolizes the power of the liberated people by placing the Liberty Cap on top of the classical symbol of power.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==''Tricolore'' cockade==

{{main|tricolore cockade}}
Cockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789. They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' - thus producing the original [[tricolore cockade|''Tricolore'' cockade]]. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction—although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.
[[File:The french tricolor cockade.svg|thumb|left|250px|The tricolore cockade was created in July 1789. White (the royal color) was added to nationalise an earlier blue and red design.]]

The tricolore flag is derived from the cockades used in the 1790s. These were circular rosette-like emblems attached to the hat. [[Camille Desmoulins]] asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms. Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.<ref name="Crowdy">Crowdy, Terry, ''French Revolutionary Infantry 1789–1802'', p. 42 (2004).</ref> The blue and red cockade was presented to King [[Louis XVI]] at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] on 17 July.  Lafayette argued for the addition of a white stripe to "nationalise" the design.<ref>Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert Du Motier Lafayette (marquis de), ''Memoirs, correspondence and manuscripts of General Lafayette,'' vol. 2, p. 252.</ref> On 27 July, a tricolore cockade was adopted as part of the uniform of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]], the national police force that succeeded the militia.<ref>Clifford, Dale, "Can the Uniform Make the Citizen? Paris, 1789-1791," ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'', 2001, p. 369.</ref>

[[Militant feminism in the French Revolution|The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women]], a militant group on the far left, demanded a law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the tricolore cockade to demonstrate their loyalty to the Republic.  The law was passed but was violently opposed by other groups of women. The Jacobins in charge of the government decided that women had no place in public affairs, and disbanded all women's organizations in October 1793.<ref>Darline Gay Levy, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson, eds.  ''Women in Revolutionary Paris, 1789-1795''  (1981) pp 143-49</ref>

==Liberty cap==

In revolutionary France, the cap or ''[[:fr:bonnet rouge|bonnet rouge]]'' was first seen publicly in May 1790, at a festival in [[Troyes]] adorning a statue representing the nation, and at [[Lyon]], on a lance carried by the goddess [[Libertas]].<ref>Jennifer Harris, "The Red Cap of Liberty: A Study of Dress Worn by French Revolutionary Partisans 1789-94." ''Eighteenth Century Studies'' (1981): 283-312. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2738492 in JSTOR]</ref>  To this day the [[national emblem]] of France, [[Marianne]], is shown wearing a Phrygian cap.<ref>Richard Wrigley, "Transformations of a revolutionary emblem: The Liberty Cap in the french Revolution, ''French History''  '''11'''(2) 1997:131-169.</ref> The caps were often knitted by women known as [[Tricoteuse]] who sat beside the guillotine during public executions in Paris in the French Revolution, supposedly continuing to knit in between executions.

[[File:Sans-culotte.jpg|thumb|250px|Early depiction of the tricolour in the hands of a ''[[sans-culotte]]'' during the French Revolution.]]
The Liberty cap, also known as the [[Phrygian cap]], or [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]], is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. The cap was originally worn by ancient Romans and Greeks.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460407/pileus entry]</ref> The cap implies ennobling effects, as seen in its association with Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the mythical twins, [[Castor and Pollux]]. The emblem's popularity during the French Revolution is due in part to its importance in ancient Rome: its use alludes to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty. The Roman tribune [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] incited the slaves to insurrection by displaying a pileus as if it were a standard.<ref>[[William J. Cooper, Jr.|William J. Cooper]], and [[John McCardell]]. "Liberty caps and liberty trees." ''Past and Present'' 146.1 (1995): 66-102.</ref>

The pileus cap is often red in color. This type of cap was worn by revolutionaries at the fall of the Bastille. According to the Revolutions de Paris, it became "the symbol of the liberation from all servitudes, the sign for unification of all the enemies of despotism." <ref name="ReferenceB">Censer and Hunt, "How to Read Images" LEF CD-ROM</ref> The pileus competed with the Phrygian cap, a similar cap that covered the ears and the nape of the neck, for popularity. The Phrygian cap eventually supplanted the pileus and usurped its symbolism, becoming synonymous with republican liberty.

==Clothing==
{{main|1775–95 in Western fashion|1795–1820 in Western fashion}}
As the radicals and Jacobins became more powerful, there was a revulsion against high-fashion because of its extravagance and its association with royalty and aristocracy.  It was replaced with a sort of "anti-fashion" for men and women that emphasized simplicity and modesty.  The men wore plain, dark clothing and short unpowdered hair. During the Terror of 1794, the workaday outfits of the sans-culottes symbolized Jacobin egalitarianism. High fashion and extravagance returned under the Directory, 1795–99, with its [[Directoire style|"directoire" styles]]; the men did not return to extravagant customs.<ref>James A. Leith, "Fashion and Anti-Fashion in the French Revolution," ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750-1850: Selected Papers'' (1998) pp 1-18</ref>

==Liberty Tree==

The Liberty Tree, officially adopted in 1792, is a symbol of the everlasting Republic, national freedom, and political revolution.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> It has historic roots in revolutionary France as well as America, as a symbol that was shared by the two nascent republics.<ref>Cooper and McCardell. "Liberty caps and liberty trees."  (1995): 75–77</ref> The tree was chosen as a symbol of the French Revolution because it symbolizes fertility in French folklore,<ref>Ozouf, "Festivals and the French Revolution" 123</ref> which provided a simple transition from revering it for one reason to another. The American colonies also used the idea of a Liberty Tree to celebrate their own acts of insurrection against the British, starting with the Stamp Act riot in 1765.<ref>Cooper and McCardell. "Liberty caps and liberty trees."  (1995): 75</ref>

The riot culminated in the hanging in effigy of two Stamp Act politicians on a large elm tree. The elm tree began to be celebrated as a symbol of Liberty in the American colonies.<ref>Cooper and McCardell. "Liberty caps and liberty trees."  (1995): 88</ref>   It was adopted as a symbol that needed to be living and growing, along with the Republic. To that end, the tree is portrayed as a sapling, usually of an oak tree in French interpretation. The Liberty Tree serves as a constant celebration of the spirit of political freedom.

==Hercules==

The symbol of [[Hercules]] was first adopted by the [[Old Regime]] to represent the monarchy.<ref>Hunt 1984, 89.</ref>  Hercules was an ancient Greek hero who symbolized strength and power. The symbol was used to represent the sovereign authority of the King over France during the reign of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon monarchs]].<ref name="Hunt 1984, 101–102">Hunt 1984, 101–102</ref>  However, the monarchy was not the only ruling power in French history to use the symbol of Hercules to declare its power.

During the Revolution, the symbol of Hercules was revived to represent nascent revolutionary ideals. The first use of Hercules as a revolutionary symbol was during a festival celebrating the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly's]] victory over federalism on 10 August 1793.<ref>Hunt 1984, 96</ref>  "Federalism" was a movement to weaken the central government.<ref>Bill Edmonds, "'Federalism' and Urban Revolt in France in 1793," ''Journal of Modern History'' (1983) 55#1 pp 22-53</ref> This Festival of Unity consisted of four stations around Paris which featured symbols representing major events of the Revolution which embodied revolutionary ideals of liberty, unity, and power.<ref>Hunt 1984, 92</ref>

The statue of Hercules, placed at the station commemorating the fall of [[Louis XVI]], symbolized the power of the French people over their former oppressors. The statue's foot was placed on the throat of the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], which represented the tyranny of federalism which the new [[French First Republic|Republic]] had vanquished. In one hand, the statue grasped a club, a symbol of power, while in the other grasping the fasces which symbolized the unity of the French people.  The image of Hercules assisted the new Republic in establishing its new Republican moral system. Hercules thus evolved from a symbol of the sovereignty of the monarch into a symbol of the new sovereign authority in France: the French people.<ref>Hunt 1984, 97, 103</ref>

This transition was made easily for two reasons. First, because Hercules was a famous mythological figure, and had previously been used by the monarchy, he was easily recognized by educated French observers.   It was not necessary for the revolutionary government to educate the French people on the background of the symbol. Additionally, Hercules recalled the classical age of the Greeks and the Romans, a period which the revolutionaries identified with [[Republicanism|republican]] and democratic ideals. These connotations made Hercules an easy choice to represent the powerful new sovereign people of France.<ref name="Hunt 1984, 101–102"/>

During the more [[Reign of Terror|radical phase]] of the Revolution from 1793 to 1794, the usage and depiction of Hercules changed. These changes to the symbol were due to revolutionary leaders believing the symbol was inciting violence among the common citizens.  The triumphant battles of Hercules and the overcoming of enemies of the Republic became less prominent. In discussions over what symbol to use for the Seal of the Republic, the image of Hercules was considered but eventually ruled out in favor of [[Marianne]].<ref name="Hunt 1984, 113">Hunt 1984, 113</ref>

Hercules was on the coin of the Republic. However, this Hercules was not the same image as that of the pre-Terror phases of the Revolution. The new image of Hercules was more domesticated. He appeared more paternal, older, and wiser, rather than the warrior-like images in the early stages of the French Revolution. Unlike his 24-foot statue in the Festival of the Supreme Being, he was now the same size as Liberty and Equality.<ref name="Hunt 1984, 113"/>

Also the language on the coin with Hercules was very different from the rhetoric of pre-revolutionary depictions. On the coins the words, "uniting Liberty and Equality" were used. This is opposed to the forceful language of early Revolutionary rhetoric and rhetoric of the Bourbon monarchy. By 1798, the [[Council of Ancients]] had discussed the "inevitable" change from the problematic image of Hercules, and Hercules was eventually phased out in favor of an even more docile image.<ref name="Hunt 1984, 113"/>

[[File:Pils - Rouget de Lisle chantant la Marseillaise.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Rouget de Lisle, composer of the Marseillaise, sings it for the first time in 1792]]

"La Marseillaise" ({{IPA-fr|la maʁsɛjɛːz}}) became the [[national anthem]] of France.  The song was written and composed in 1792 by [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle]], and was originally titled "''Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin''". The [[French National Convention]] adopted it as the [[French First Republic|First Republic's]] anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by [[Fédéré|volunteers]] from [[Marseille]] marching on the capital.

The song is the first example of the "European march" anthemic style. The anthem's evocative melody and lyrics have led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and its incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music. Cerulo says, "the design of "La Marseillaise" is credited to General Strasburg of France, who is said
to have directed de Lisle, the composer of the anthem, to 'produce one of those hymns which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'"<ref>Karen A. Cerulo, "Symbols and the world system: national anthems and flags." ''Sociological Forum'' (1993) 8#2 pp. 243-271.</ref>

==Guillotine==
{{main|Guillotine}}
[[File:Cruikshank - The Radical's Arms.png|thumb|right|As shown in this British cartoon by [[Isaac Cruikshank]], the guillotine became a disparaging symbol of violent excess during the Reign of Terror. The tricolor ribbon on top is inscribed "No God! No Religion! No King! No Constitution!" Below the ribbon, and its Phrygian cap with tricolor cockade, are two bloody axes, attached to a guillotine, whose blade is suspended above a world aflame. An emaciated man and drunken woman dressed in ragged clothes serve as heraldic "supporters", gleefully dancing on discarded royal and clerical regalia.]]
Hanson notes, "The guillotine stands as the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution."<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul R. Hanson|title=The A to Z of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYJ4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA151|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=151}}</ref> Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory. It was celebrated on the left as the people's avenger and cursed as the symbol of the [[Reign of Terror]] by the right.<ref>R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Culture, A Concise History, Volume II: Since 1340'', (2nd ed., 2007), p. 664.</ref>  Its operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programs listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women ([[tricoteuse]]s) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored.<ref>R. F. Opie, ''Guillotine'' (2003)</ref>

What it is that horrifies people changes over time. Doyle comments:
:Even the unique horror of the guillotine has been dwarfed by the gas chambers of the Holocaust, the organized brutality of the gulag, the mass intimidation of Mao's cultural revolution, or the killing fields of Cambodia.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Doyle|title=The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEi4bYIUP1sC&pg=PT22|year=2001|publisher=Oxford UP|page=22}}</ref>
