"'''You Don't Know What to Do'''" is a song by American singer and songwriter [[Mariah Carey]] included on her fourteenth studio album, ''[[Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse]] '' (2014), and features rapper [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]. The track was released on June 30, 2014, as the second and final promotional single (fourth overall) from the album. It was written by Wale, Carey, [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], with production helmed by the latter three. The song contains an [[Interpolation (music)|interpolation]] of "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair" written by [[Patrick Adams (musician)|Patrick Adams]] and Terri Gonzalez, both of whom received songwriting credits as a result. The single's artwork caused controversy when the media criticised Carey for [[Photo manipulation|photoshopping]] and re-using images of herself. Carey herself later expressed her discontent on the matter, stating that she had no knowledge of the single's artwork until it was released.

A [[disco]] revival song, the lyrics are about Carey being dissatisfied by her lover's failed attempts at romancing her. Despite being serviced to [[Urban contemporary|urban]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]] radio in the United States, Belgium and South Korea were the only territories where the song charted, peaking at number 14 on its Ultratip chart, which ranks the top songs that have yet to enter the main [[Ultratop|Ultratop 50]] chart, and number 2 on the South Korea download chart. "You Don't Know What to Do" garnered critical acclaim amongst music critics: many complimented the disco revival and throwback style, calling it the best track on the album, and compared it to the works of [[Jocelyn Brown]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]] and post-revivalist songs produced [[Pharrell Williams]]. Carey and Wale performed the song for the first time on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show in the United States.

==Background and release==
[[File:Walle Georgetown.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.80|American rapper [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]] features on "You Don't Know What to Do".|alt=A man wearing a woollen hat holding a microphone, looking to his left.]]
"You Don't Know What to Do" was written by Carey, [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Bryan-Michael Cox]], with featured artist [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]. The song [[Interpolation (music)|interpolates]] a song called "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by [[Patrick Adams (musician)|Patrick Adams]] and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by [[Inner Life]] in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result.<ref name="Albumnotes"/> In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be ''[[Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse]]'', before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. "She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and we picked up right where we left off. I just feel like between Jermaine, myself and her, we came up with a few things that [are] really, really a solid body of work".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first= John|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1691082/mariah-carey-triumphant-upcoming-album.jhtml |title=Mariah Carey's 'Triumphant' Single Is 'Close To Her Heart'|work=[[MTV News]]|date=August 2, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2015}}</ref>

In response, Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and is asking for a second chance. Carey then decides that it has been too long that Wale has not loved her for, and feels liberated for letting him go.<ref name="HitFix"/> Kenneth Partridge of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' likened the string arrangement to [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s 1979 single "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]".<ref name="Billboard track by track">{{cite web|last=Partridge|first=Kenneth|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/6099198/mariah-carey-me-i-am-mariah-the-elusive-chanteuse-track-by-track-review|title=Mariah Carey, 'Me.

[[File:Donatella Versace Time Shankbone 2010.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|Fashion designer [[Donatella Versace]] described Carey and Wale's collaboration as "poetry".<ref name="Vogue"/>|alt=A woman with blond hair wearing a blue dress.]]

''[[PopMatters]]'' writer Devone Jones described the song as "the most energetic track" on the album, and continued to write that the "skillful" lyrics allow Carey to perform "genuine harmonies" which are reminiscent of seventies dance songs.<ref name="Pop Matters"/>  Both Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] and Eric Henderson for ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' noted that Carey appeared to be channeling American dance singer [[Jocelyn Brown]], with the former writer that she sounded like Brown more prominently in the intro, while the latter described "You Don't Know What to Do" as a "stunning" tribute to Brown's 1984 single "[[Somebody Else's Guy]]".<ref name="Slant">{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Eric|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/mariah-carey-me-i-am-mariah-the-elusive-chanteuse|title=Me.

''Billboard'' writer Kenneth Partridge complimented the song for its dance appeal, adding that the only thing missing was a cameo from [[Nile Rodgers]].<ref name="Billboard track by track"/> Melinda Newman of [[HitFix]] praised the song's "playful" sentiment, writing that it was the best song that had been released from ''Me.

Jordan Sargent of [[Pitchfork Media]] praised its composition and noted that the disco and gospel genres are where middle-aged woman can "thrive", whereby Carey "fits in unsurprisingly well". He was, however, critical of the decision to include Wale on the song.<ref name="Pitchfork"/> Similarly, Aisha Harris of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'' praised the song's production and Carey's vocals too, but also thought that Wale's rap verses were not required.<ref name="Slate"/> Conversely, fashion designer [[Donatella Versace]], a friend of Carey's, told ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' that she thought Carey's singing and Wale's rapping complimented each other on the song, describing it as "poetry", and that it made her want to get up and dance "all summer".<ref name="Vogue">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/06/24/donatella-versace-reviews-mariah-carey-you-dont-know-what-to-do|title=Donatella Reviews Mariah's New Album|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=June 24, 2014|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}</ref>
