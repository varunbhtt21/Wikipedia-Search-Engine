Title : Treasure guardians in folklore
Text : {{Orphan|date=May 2014}}

The '''treasure guardian''' is a recurring [[motif (narrative)|motif]] in [[folklore]] of a being that guards a treasure. Typically, the hero must overcome the guardian in order to obtain the treasure. In some cases the treasure guardians are non-human beings, although one subtype, known as "treasure ghosts", were deceased humans who had been murdered and buried with the treasure to protect it.<ref name="Huggins 2003">{{citation |first= Ronald V. |last= Huggins |authorlink= Ronald V.
