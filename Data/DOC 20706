:* Sourced to a video and a blog, but its hard to dispute that the product is real... Can you please add additional details or the news release from Rocket Fizz? I.e. [http://www.rocketfizz.com/news/9-newsflash/431-ranch-dressing-soda-the-newest-flavor-by-lesters-fixins this] From the sounds of it... Rocket Fizz is well-aware of its "effects", which makes for a probably more interesting DYK! And if that's not enough, Rocket Fizz announced "[http://rocketfizz.com/news/9-newsflash/435-ranch-dressing-flavored-soda-could-be-the-worst-thing-on-the-planet Ranch Dressing Flavored Soda Could Be The Worst Thing On The Planet]!"

::*Both of the sources are from [[WP:IRS|reliable]] news media sources, and the blog is a reliable [[WP:NEWSBLOG]], thus qualifying to accurately [[WP:V|verify]] information in the article and for the hook. Secondary sources such as these are typically preferred compared to primary sources such as press releases.

:::* You are arguing over nothing, and I do disagree, but it does meet the requirements for a DYK - but you missed what seems to be a more interesting aspect and hook. Your choice. [[User:ChrisGualtieri|ChrisGualtieri]] ([[User talk:ChrisGualtieri|talk]]) 17:49, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*Hi [[User:ChrisGualtieri]]: Not arguing, just following [[WP:WIADYK|the rules]]. Therein it states, "The hook fact must be cited in the article with an inline citation to a reliable source..." At [[WP:RS]], it states in section [[WP:WPNOTRS]], "While specific facts may be taken from primary sources, secondary sources that present the same material are preferred" and "All interpretive claims, analyses, or synthetic claims about primary sources must be referenced to a secondary source, rather than original analysis of the primary-source material by Wikipedia editors."

:::::* Look, I'm not going to argue with you over this. I much prefer the existence and documentation of a product or a service where the sourcing is best. I recently had to work on a fictional creature and even newspapers unknowingly and later purposely ran stories as if it were real. I feel you are missing the better hook and the origin of the drink. It took less than a minute to dig up the information and I should not spend much more than that explaining why its perfectly acceptable and helpful. If you want this to run, it meets, but you did less than I expected. [[User:ChrisGualtieri|ChrisGualtieri]] ([[User talk:ChrisGualtieri|talk]]) 15:50, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::*If you want to propose a new hook, just add an actual formatted ALT1. It would be much easier for you to write it, than it would be for me to write one based upon your own expectations relative to your own ideas. It is unreasonable to request and expect other editors to write ALTs based upon your own "expectations". You need to do it yourself in this forum. Thank you in advance for considering this viewpoint.

:::::::* Fair assessment - but I'm new to DYK so forgive me. We need not quibble over it. I think it is fair to pass it, it meets the standards. [[User:ChrisGualtieri|ChrisGualtieri]] ([[User talk:ChrisGualtieri|talk]]) 04:02, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]]  New enough and long enough. Refs and cites check out (don't think I'd like to drink one).
