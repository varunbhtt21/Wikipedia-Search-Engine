'''Waist chop''' ({{zh|first=t|t=腰斬|s=腰斩|p=yāo zhǎn|labels=no}}) or '''waist cutting''' was a form of execution used in ancient China.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=American Journal of Chinese Studies|author=American Association for Chinese Studies|year=1998|issue=第 5 卷，第 1–2 號|publisher=American Association for Chinese Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jkxxAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> As its name implies, it involved the condemned being sliced in two at the waist by an executioner.

==History==
Waist chop first appeared in the [[Zhou dynasty]]. There were three forms of execution used in the Zhou dynasty: ''[[Dismemberment|chelie]]'' (車裂; quartering the prisoner alive), ''zhan'' (斬; waist chop), and ''sha'' (殺; beheading).<ref name="ifeng">{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/1/midang/200807/0709_2664_642981.shtml|title=揭秘古代酷刑："腰斩"的历史从产生到消失_资讯_凤凰网|publisher=news.ifeng.com|accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref> Sometimes the chopping was not limited to one slice. [[Gao Qi]], a [[Ming dynasty]] poet, was sentenced by the [[Hongwu Emperor]] to be sliced into eight parts for his politically satirical writing.<ref>祝允明《野记》：“魏守（观）欲复府治，兼疏溶城中河。御史张度劾公，有‘典灭王之基，开败国之河’之语。盖以旧治先为伪周所处，而卧龙街西淤川，即旧所谓锦帆泾故也。上大怒，置公极典。高太史启，以作《新府上梁文》与王彝皆与其难。高被截为八段-{云}-。”</ref> An episode not attested in the official histories tells that in 1734, Yu Hongtu (俞鴻圖), the Education Administrator of [[Henan]], was sentenced to waist chop. After being cut in two at the waist, he stayed alive long enough to write the Chinese character ''cǎn'' (慘; "horrible/miserable") seven times with his own blood before dying. After hearing this, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] abolished this form of execution.<ref>林濤《正說清朝三百年》</ref>

In modern [[Chinese language]], 'waist chop' has evolved to become a [[metaphor]] for or cancellation of an ongoing project, especially [[Cancellation (television)|cancellation of television programmes]].
