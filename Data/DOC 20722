==Features==
The beach is a place for marine deposit with both fine sands and rubble. It also has marine abrasion land forms such as sea cape, sea cliff and reef at the bottom of the sea. The seabed around this area is uneven which resulted in the usual undercurrent under the sea.
 
==Transportation==
The beach is accessible south east from [[Su'ao railway station|Su'ao Station]] of [[Taiwan Railways Administration]].
