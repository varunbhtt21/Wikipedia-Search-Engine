Local postmaster, notable for being .... local postmaster. I'm sure he's a great asset to his local community, but I see no evidence that he's notable enough for an encyclopedia. Has been PRODded and dePRODded, so here we go at AfD. [[User:PamD|<font color="green">'''''Pam'''''</font>]][[User talk:PamD|<font color="brown">'''''D'''''</font>]] 10:32, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''', as above: the intro says it all, "well known in Celebration, Florida"...but not in the wider world.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 13:28, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge''' content into [[Celebration, Florida]] and redirect title there. Davison does not meet Wikipedia's criteria for a stand alone article but he is [[WP:V|verifiably]] well known in Celebration; winning the town's Good Neighbor Award in 2001 which [[WP:RS|reliable sourcing]] calls "high praise".—[[User:John Cline|John Cline]] ([[User talk:John Cline|talk]]) 02:16, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
