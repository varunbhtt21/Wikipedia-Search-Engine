Non-notable individual. References are to an automated statistics site, non-independent sites (Mozilla, Bugzilla), and a blog. No ''significant coverage'' of this individual from independent secondary sources. ''"We require 'significant coverage' in reliable sources so that we can actually write a whole article, rather than half a paragraph or a definition of that topic. If only a few sentences could be written and supported by sources about the subject, that subject does not qualify for a separate page, but should instead be merged into an article about a larger topic or relevant list."'' This article has existed for almost a decade, has had a notability warning for 2 years, and has still failed to get beyond the ''few sentences'' stage. [[Mozilla]] and [[Bugzilla]] are the notable topics here, not the individual. [[User:Chris Bainbridge|Chris Bainbridge]] ([[User talk:Chris Bainbridge|talk]]) 17:34, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
