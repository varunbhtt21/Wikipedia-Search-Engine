==Background==
{{Main|Xinjiang conflict}}
The attack occurred on the final day of [[Xi Jinping]]'s four-day tour of the region.<ref name=NYT1/>  He had, only the day before, labelled Xinjiang as the "front line against terrorism" during a visit to the nearby city of [[Kashgar]], and vowed to take a hardline against terrorism and violence attributed to Muslim [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] separatists, which claimed the lives of at least one hundred people over the past year.<ref>{{cite news|title=President Xi Jinping delivers tough message to ‘frontline of terror’ on visit to Xinjiang|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1499803/xi-makes-rare-visit-xinjiangs-restive-south-bolster-anti-terror-campaign|date=29 April 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014|first=Hong|last=Zhang|newspaper=South China Morning Post}} '''{{subscription required}}'''</ref>  It is not known if Xi was still in the province when the attack took place.<ref name=NYT1/> On the morning of the attack, he visited a mosque – located {{convert|2|km}} away from the railway station – and urged religious leaders to foster harmony among the people in Xinjiang by giving followers a better understanding of religious teachings.<ref name=SCMP1/>

==Initial response==
After the attack, "security forces moved quickly" to the station, and later paramilitary and riot<ref name="MSN "/> police were stationed on its various entrances.<ref name=BBC1/><ref name=SCMP1/><ref name="BBC2 "/> Casualties were taken to the hospital in ambulances, but taxis were also commandeered to compensate for a lack of ambulance availability and to ensure the swift treatment of injuries.<ref name="MSN">{{cite web | url=http://news.uk.msn.com/world/extremists-bombed-china-station | title=Extremists 'bombed China station' | work=MSN | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> According to [[Xinhua News Agency]], the area around the station was evacuated by security forces.<ref>{{cite news|title=Explosion in China railway during presidential visit kills three|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10799050/Explosion-in-China-railway-during-presidential-visit-kills-three.html|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014|first=Tom|last=Phillips|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> The bombing meant that the rail services ceased for about two hours, and ensuing this attack nearby shops repaired minor damage and tightened security.<ref name="MSN "/>

There was an overnight cordon around the train station,<ref name="MSN "/> which was lifted at 9:00 PM,<ref name="CNA">{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/china-s-xi-orders/1091938.html | title=China's Xi orders crackdown after Xinjiang stabbing spree | work=Channel News Asia | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=1 May 2014}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}</ref> amid heavier police security.<ref name=NYT1/>

Many internet posts regarding the attack were rapidly [[Censorship in China|censored]] by the Chinese government.  [[Sina Weibo]], the country's largest [[Microblogging in China|microblogging]] site, took down comments and photos pertaining to the explosion,<ref name=BBC1/> which had come through within an hour on their "Breaking News" account.  It did not make any further updates for two hours.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1501612/sina-weibo-censored-news-alerts-urumqi-train-blasts | title=Breaking news alerts on Urumqi attack ‘censored’ on Weibo | work=South China Morning Post | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=1 May 2014 |first=Andrea|last=Chen}}</ref>

==Reactions==
Communist Party general secretary [[Xi Jinping]] responded to the incident by promising "decisive actions [against] terrorist attacks",<ref name=BBC2>{{cite news|title=Xinjiang station attack: President Xi Jinping urges action|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-27232924|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> and stated that a “strike-first” strategy would be implemented.<ref name="Time "/> He also called on government officials in the region to do everything they could to ensure that the injured were assisted, the crime investigated and the perpetrators punished severely.<ref name=SCMP1/>

Search engine [[Baidu]] prevented certain results from appearing when searching for terms related to the attack – citing "relevant legal rules and policies"<ref name=NYT2/> – while Chinese [[news media]] simply duplicated the report by [[Xinhua News Agency]], which is required of them when reporting on sensitive topics.<ref name=NYT2>{{cite news|title=Online, a Censored Reaction to Urumqi Bombing|url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/online-a-censored-reaction-to-urumqi-bombing/|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014|first=Didi Kirsten|last=Tatlow|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>
