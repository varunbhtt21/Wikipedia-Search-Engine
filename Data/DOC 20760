'''Isabella Hill''' (1 April 1833 – 6 June 1879), better known as '''Mrs Howard Paul''', was an English actress, operatic singer and [[Actor-manager|actress-manager]] of the [[Victorian era]], best remembered for creating the role of Lady Sangazure in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] comic opera ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877).

Her stage career began in 1853 in London in [[ballad opera]]s, such as ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''. In 1854 she married the American writer [[Henry Howard Paul]], in whose comic entertainments the two performed for much of the next two decades, often on tour, both in Britain and America. She was popular for her musical impersonations of singers of the day. She also played in [[Victorian burlesque]] and other theatrical roles, among the best known of which was her [[Lady Macbeth]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1869.  Various composers wrote songs for her to premiere.

After ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', Gilbert and Sullivan cast Mrs Paul in their next opera, ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', but her vocal abilities had declined so much by that point that they cut parts of her role, and she resigned from the production.

Mrs Howard Paul was born as '''Isabella Hill''' at [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]], the daughter of George Thomas Hill, a leather merchant. She was educated in France and Italy,<ref name=Boase>Boase, p. 1393</ref> and studied singing under the composer and teacher [[George French Flowers]], whose biographer Louisa Middleton rates her as "perhaps his most distinguished" pupil.<ref>Middleton, Louisa (rev).

Under the name '''Isabella Featherstone''' she began her stage career as a member of the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] company in London. There, in January 1853, she played Tom Tug in [[Charles Dibdin]]'s  [[ballad opera]] ''The Waterman''.<ref>"Strand Theatre", ''Reynolds's Newspaper'', 16 January 1853, p. 8</ref> According to the theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', she made a great hit.<ref name=era1>"Provincial Theatricals", ''The Era'', 13 February 1853, p. 10</ref> She appeared briefly at the [[Theatre Royal, Cork]] the following month,<ref name=era1/> returning to the Strand in March to play Captain Macheath ''[[Breeches role|en travesti]]'' in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.<ref name=DNB>Knight, John Joseph.

''The Era'' commented, "We take the opportunity of predicting for her much future success. She has an excellent voice and is by no means devoid of acting capabilities."<ref>"Easter Amusements", ''The Era'', 3 April 1853, p. 10</ref> After this, she played Lucy Lockit in ''The Beggar's Opera''.<ref name=Boase/>

''The Era'' later reported, "Her dashing style and rich, powerful voice at once attracted attention and more important engagements rapidly followed at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and the [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]]."<ref name=obit>"Death of Mrs Howard Paul", ''The Era'', 15 June 1879, p. 12</ref> They included Drury Lane's Christmas [[pantomime]] in December 1853,<ref>"Drury Lane Theatre", ''The Lady's Newspaper'', 31 December 1853, p. 397</ref> and, the following month, [[Mark Lemon]]'s ''Paula Lazarro'', in which she played Juana.<ref name=Boase/> At the Haymarket, she again played Macheath from April 1854.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=NYT/> In July of that year she married the American writer and actor [[Henry Howard Paul]] at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]] in London.<ref name=Boase/> Shortly after the wedding the couple went to Switzerland, in August 1854, and performed with success in Geneva.<ref>"The Drama, Music, &c", ''Reynolds's Newspaper'', 3 September 1854, p. 9</ref> They went on to Paris, where she played for a month at the [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal]] in a specially-written sketch, ''La fille adroit'', which was highly praised by [[Jules Janin]] in the ''[[Journal des débats]]''.<ref>"Waterloo Rooms", ''Caledonian Mercury'', 26 September 1857, p. 1</ref><ref name=LJ>[http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&res_dat=xri:jjohnson:&rft_dat=xri:jjohnson:image:20090522170705lb:1 "Mrs. Howard Paul"], ''[[The London Journal]]'', c. 1855 {{subscription}}</ref>

In musical entertainments given by herself and her husband in 1860 and over the next 17 years in London and the provinces, Mrs Paul became a favourite for her impersonations of [[Henry Russell (musician)|Henry Russell]], [[Sims Reeves]], and other popular singers of the day, particularly [[tenor]]s.<ref name=Boase/><ref name=DNB/> Another piece that they toured was called ''Thrice Married''.<ref name=NYT/> Mrs Howard Paul's voice was admired by various composers, who wrote songs for her to premiere.<ref name=LJ/>

==Later years==
Early in 1867 she returned with her husband for engagements in the United States.<ref name=NYT>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60915F9385A137B93C2A8178DD85F4D8784F9 "Obituary: Mrs. Howard Paul"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 June 1879</ref> In September of that year, she was back in London at the Strand Theatre playing Mrs Dove in her husband's ''Ripples on the Lake''. At the [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1868 she appeared in the title role of ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein|The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'';<ref name=Boase/><ref name=NYT/> this production also went on tour in Britain.<ref>Broadbent, R.J.

At the Drury Lane Theatre in 1869, she played [[Lady Macbeth]] opposite [[Samuel Phelps]] and [[Charles Dillon (actor-manager)|Charles Dillon]] on alternate nights. "Anticipating subsequent actresses, she softened Lady Macbeth, subjugating to conjugal love the sterner traits ordinarily assigned the character."<ref name=DNB/> On the same evenings, she doubled in the role of [[Hecate]] in ''Macbeth''.<ref name=Baker/> She then toured the provinces with a company of her own, playing a series of drawing-room entertainments. Among the characters that she portrayed through song were the [[bluestocking]] Miss Grym, the advocate of [[Women's suffrage|women's rights]],<ref>"Mrs. Paul Howard in her impersonation of Miss Grym, 'one of the grimmest specimens of that class of womankind which bore ... with the everlasting subject of woman's rights'", ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'', vol. 29, 4 December 1869, p. 189</ref><ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/8422 Sheet music cover for "Bother the Men"], sung by Mrs Howard Paul as Miss Grym, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] Collection</ref> and Jemimer Cobb ("cruelly deceived by the Footman who wore false whiskers").<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitLarge/mw241668/Isabella-Featherstone-nee-Hill-Mrs-Howard-Paul?LinkID=mp69866&search=sas&sText=Isabella+Featherstone+%28nee+Hill%29+%28Mrs+Howard+Paul%29&role=sit&rNo=5 Illustrated sheet music cover for "Jemimer Cobb"] (1865), [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]</ref> In February 1870, she was playing Drogan in ''[[Genevieve de Brabant]]'' in New York.<ref>Brown, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924082209440#page/457/mode/2up "The Theatre Francais"], p. 457</ref> She played the title role in [[H.

In 1871 she and her husband were living in [[Liverpool]] when not on tour; both their occupations were listed as "Musical Artiste" in the census.<ref>[http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/7619/LANRG10_3776_3778-0405/7686341?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.co.uk%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3frank%3d1%26new%3d1%26MSAV%3d1%26msT%3d1%26gss%3dangs-g%26gsfn%3disabella%26gsfn_x%3dXO%26gsln_x%3dXO%26msbdy%3d1833%26msbpn__ftp%3dDartford%252c%2bKent%252c%2bEngland%26msbpn%3d84542%26msbpn_PInfo%3d8-%257c0%257c0%257c3257%257c3251%257c0%257c0%257c0%257c5270%257c84542%257c0%257c%26msddy%3d1879%26msdpn__ftp%3dLondon%252c%2bLondon%252c%2bEngland%26msdpn%3d85535%26msdpn_PInfo%3d8-%257c0%257c0%257c3257%257c3251%257c0%257c0%257c0%257c5274%257c85535%257c0%257c%26msgdy%3d1857%26gskw%3dactress%26cpxt%3d1%26catBucket%3drstp%26uidh%3drc8%26_83004003-n_xcl%3dm%26cp%3d11%26mssng0%3dhenry%2bhoward%26mssns0%3dpaul%26pcat%3dROOT_CATEGORY%26h%3d7686341%26db%3duki1871%26indiv%3d1%26ml_rpos%3d1&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnRecord 1871 England Census for Isabella Paul], [[Ancestry.com]] (registration required)</ref> She was Mistigris in ''Babil and Bijou'' by [[Dion Boucicault]] at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] (1872–73), with music by [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]] and [[Frederick Clay]].<ref name=DNB/>

In 1877 the [[impresario]] [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] approached Mrs Paul to play the part of Lady Sangazure in the new [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', which Carte was producing at the [[Opera Comique]]. She accepted on condition that her 24-year-old protégé, [[Rutland Barrington]], was given a part, and he was cast in the role of Dr Daly, the vicar.<ref name=Whowaswho>Stone, David. [https://www.gsarchive.net/whowaswho/B/BarringtonRutland.htm "Rutland Barrington"], ''Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 1 May 2014</ref>

Her appearance in ''The Sorcerer'' proved to be her last London engagement; by this stage in her career her voice was deteriorating.  She was engaged to play Cousin Hebe in the next [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] production, ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (for which she was to be paid 10 [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]]s a week "to sing and act as principal contralto during the period of the run").<ref>Ainger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rnCTyQ5xziMC&pg=PA156 p. 156]</ref> Gilbert made an effort to write an amusing part for her despite Sullivan's reluctance to use her, but her declining abilities were apparent, and cuts were made to her part.  By mid-May 1878, both Gilbert and Sullivan wanted her out of the cast; unhappy with the cuts, Mrs Paul left the production. With only a week to go before opening night, Carte engaged the concert singer [[Jessie Bond]] to play the now much smaller role of Cousin Hebe.<ref>Ainger, pp. 134 and 156–57; and Stedman, p. 160</ref><ref>Stedman, Jane W. "Cousin Hebe: Who Was She?", ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal'', Vol. 10, Spring 1978, pp. 295–96</ref>

Meanwhile, Mrs Howard Paul had left her husband in around 1877, as he was having an affair with the actress-dancer [[Letty Lind]], by whom he fathered two illegitimate children. His wife continued performing under her married name.<ref>Barrington, p. 21; Cruickshank, Graeme. "The Life and Loves of Letty Lind" in ''The Gaiety'', Issue 22, Summer 2007</ref> Her last performance was in May 1879 in [[Sheffield]] as Mrs Denham in [[James Albery]]'s comedy ''The Crisis''. On 1 June, a critic in ''The Era'' wrote, "We have rarely seen better acting … Mrs Howard Paul as Mrs Denham alone repays a visit".<ref>"Provincial Theatricals", ''The Era'', 1 June 1879, p. 9</ref> By the time the notice appeared she had been taken gravely ill. She was brought to her home in London near [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], [[Turnham Green]], and on 6 June 1879 she died there. She was buried at [[Brompton Cemetery]] in West London.<ref name=DNB/>

==Reputation==
Mrs Paul's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said: "She was gifted with a wonderful voice [but] ... nearly all her efforts were made in the lighter branches of dramatic and musical art ... her acting was at once droll and vivacious".<ref name=NYT/> Henry Barton Baker, in his ''History of the London Stage and Its Famous Players'', called her "A charming actress and a beautiful singer".<ref name=Baker/> Opinions differed on whether she had made the best use of her talents. [[Joseph Knight (critic)|Joseph Knight]] wrote in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'': "Mrs Howard Paul was a woman of ability, whose talents were often frittered away in parts and occupations unworthy of them."<ref name=DNB/> A writer in ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' agreed, commenting that "had she adhered to the lyric stage instead of being an erratic artist associated with Mr Howard Paul in 'musical and dramatic entertainments,' [she] would have taken the highest position as a contralto."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vro5AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA284 "Musical Gossip"], ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', No. 2340, 31 August 1872, p. 284</ref> Another contemporary critic considered that she had in fact  achieved a high position:
{{quote|Never could the motto "A host in themselves" be more appropriately applied to any party than to this one. Not a hundred Christy minstrels, not the funniest comic singers, not the most comical clowns at Christmas pantomimes could raise such hearty and spontaneous laughter as was evoked last evening by Mrs Howard Paul and Mr Walter Pelham. The lady, who ranks in one of the highest branches in her profession, is wonderfully clever, both in dramatic versatility and vocal ability."<ref>"Mrs Howard Paul and company", ''The Sporting Times'', 16 January 1875, p. 179</ref>|}}
