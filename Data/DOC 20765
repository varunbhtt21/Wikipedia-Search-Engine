The '''Sutri Treasure''' is an important [[Lombards|Lombardic]] hoard found at [[Sutri]], [[Italy]] in the late nineteenth century that is currently in the collections of the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_domagnano_treasure.aspx British Museum  Highlights]</ref></blockquote>

==Discovery==
The rich grave group was found in 1878 near the town of Sutri in the [[province of Viterbo]] in central [[Italy]]. Dating to the 6th-7th centuries AD, the treasure was buried at a time of conflict between the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Nine years after its discovery, the hoard was purchased by the British Museum, where it resides to this day.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=31649&plaA=31649-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>

==Description==
Given the large number of prestigious items in the treasure, it probably belonged to a noble lady of high rank from the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombardic court]]. It includes a blue glass [[drinking horn]], two greenish-blue small [[amphoras]], a gilded fan-shaped silver [[brooch]],  a gold and garnet encrusted S-shaped brooch, a simple gold cross and a pair of earrings with triple pendants. A number of other items (including a pin, beads, coins, another drinking horn and a third brooch) were not purchased by the museum at the time; their current whereabouts is unknown.
