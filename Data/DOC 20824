==Biography==
Wilfrid North was born in London on 16 January 1863.<ref>{{cite web|title=WILFRED NORTH: Film information|url=http://www.citwf.com/person321563.htm|work=''citwf.com''|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wilfred North movies, photos, movie reviews, filmography, and biography|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/wilfred-north-p185409|work=Allmovie|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> A stage actor long before entering films, North had appeared on Broadway in 1899 with Mrs. Fiske and Maurice Barrymore in ''Becky Sharp'' and with Julia Marlowe in 1901 in ''When Knighthood was in Flower''.

North joined [[Vitagraph Studios]] as a director in 1912.<ref name=Soister/> Vitagraph appointed him the director of films of its comedy star, [[John Bunny]]. North directed several films of the Bunny series like ''Bunny's Honeymoon'', ''Bunny Versus Cutey'', ''Bunny and the Bunny Hug'', ''Bunny's Birthday Surprise'', ''Bunny as a Reporter'', ''Bunny's Dilemma'' and ''Bunny for the Cause'', earning him popularity in the Vitagraph Studios, which led to his appointment as the supervising director of the company's studio in [[Brooklyn]] in 1917.<ref name=Soister>{{cite book|last1=Soister|first1=John|title=American Silent Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Feature Films, 1913–1929|date=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786487909|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajXwxJuYd5gC&pg=PA28}}</ref>

Actress [[Anita Stewart]], who had started her acting career at Vitagraph and had acted in several films directed by her brother-in-law [[Ralph Ince]], felt that the new director, North, was incompetent in his work, and went on strike during the production of two films.<ref name=pioneers>{{cite web|title=Anita Stewart – Women Films Pioneers Project|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-anita-stewart/|work=Women Films Pioneers Project|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> However, when Stewart had set up her own production company called Anita Stewart Productions, she acted in the 1919 film ''Human Desire'', directed by North.<ref name=pioneers/>

In September 1913 North was temporarily blinded as a result of a yacht-cannon that exploded prematurely during the principal photography of the film ''Miss Tomboy and Freckles''.<ref name=danger/> The incident happened at the [[Atlantic Yacht Club]] in [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn|Sea Gate]], New York when the film crew was preparing for the filming of a yacht race. It was believed that spark from one of the actor's cigarettes had caused the explosion. North's face was badly burnt as he was pouring flour into the cannon.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spark is blown into cannon|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1429005/spark_is_blown_into_cannon/|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=17 September 1913|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|page=9|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}</ref> He recovered and returned to work on the film on 15 October.<ref name=danger>{{cite journal|title=Wilfred Northton out of danger|journal=Moving Picture World|date=October 1913|page= 134|url=https://archive.org/stream/movingpicturewor18newy#page/134/mode/2up|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>
