The '''Artres Treasure''' is an important [[Merovingian]] hoard found at [[Artres]], northern [[France]] in the nineteenth century.  Most of the treasure is now in the collection of the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/grave_group_from_artres.aspx British Museum  Highlights]</ref></blockquote>

==Discovery==
The rich grave group was found in 1855 under a small mound near the town of Artres in [[Pas-de-Calais]], northern France. Dating to the middle of the 6th Century AD, it probably belong to an affluent and powerful [[Franks|Frankish]] women. Most of the hoard was purchased by the curator and philanthropist [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], who bequeathed it to the British Museum in 1897.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=28051&plaA=28051-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote> It has recently been shown that a gold disk pendant (now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]]) was also part of the hoard.

==Description==
The Artres Treasure for the most part includes luxurious [[jewellery]] fashionable at the [[Franks|Frankish]] court. It is composed of two large gilded silver fan-shaped [[brooch]]es, a pair of small gold and garnet encrusted brooches in the shape of a bird, a pair of matching earrings, a crystal ball [[pendant]] and a small silver bracelet. Other items in the hoard included a finger ring and a large crystal ball; the whereabouts of these objects are unknown.
