The original planning for the game began in June of 1953 when the General Manager for the Red Wings, [[Jack Adams]], visited the prison while doing a promotional tour for Stroh’s beer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/redwings/news/wings-first-outdoor-game-was-in-prison/c-615868|title=Wings' first outdoor game was in prison|website=NHL.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref> There, the warden asked Adams if the Red Wings would come play the prison. Adams agreed, but only because he never expected the game to ever actually happen. Some say that Adams also agreed as a favor to two inmates he knew, [[Harry Keywell]] and Ray Bernstein, who were both members of the notorious [[The Purple Gang|Purple Gang]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/the-scene/archives/2015/02/02/61-years-ago-today-the-red-wings-played-against-a-team-of-convicts-at-marquette-state-prison|title=61 years ago today the Red Wings played against a team of convicts at Marquette State prison|last=DeVito|first=Lee|website=Detroit Metro Times|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitathletic.com/blog/2009/10/13/the-jailhouse-rocked-when-the-wings-played-in-prison/|title=The Jailhouse Rocked When the Wings Played in Prison|last=Dow|first=Bill|date=2009-10-13|website=Detroit Athletic Co.
