}}'''''Violent Moment''''' is a 1959 British [[drama film]] directed by [[Sidney Hayers]] and starring [[Lyndon Brook]], [[Jane Hylton]] and Jill Browne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6b9e960f|title=Violent Moment (1958)|work=BFI}}</ref> It was made as a [[B film]] for release on the lower-half of a [[double bill]]. It was the [[film editor]] Hayers' first film as director. It also marked the debut of [[Moira Redmond]].<ref>Michael & Cotter p.157</ref> It was released in the United States as '''''Rebound'''''.

The film is based on a story by [[William Edward Vickers|Roy Vickers]], from his 'Department of Dead Ends' series, originally published from 1934. These stories were ‘inverted’ mysteries: the reader knows the identity of the criminal, but the interest lies in how the detective solves the case and featured detectives dusting off cold cases. As with many of the criminals in Vickers’ stories, the protagonist Doug, is sympathetically depicted.<ref>http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3679</ref><ref>William Edward Vickers|</ref>
