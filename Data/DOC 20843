Title : Bindu of Bukhara
Text : '''Bindu of Bukhara''' was [[Bukhar Khudahs|Bukhar Khudah]] (king of [[Bukhara]]) from an unknown date to 681. Several rulers of Bukhara are known before him, however, it is not known if they were from the same dynasty. Bindu had a wife who is only known by her title of [[Khatun]], who bore him a son named [[Tughshada]]. In 681, during the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana]], Bindu was killed by the [[Umayyad]] general [[Salm ibn Ziyad]]. He was succeeded by his few months old son Tughshada.
