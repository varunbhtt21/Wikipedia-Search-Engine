The '''Luke Richardson House''' is a historic house at 204 Hancock Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  The 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built c. 1820 by Luke Richardson, son of early settler Abijah Richardson, Sr.  The house has vernacular Greek Revival styling, with corner pilasters and a wraparound porch.  Luke Richardson operated a gristmill and sawmill on a nearby property, and was instrumental in establishing a Trinitarian Congregational church in Dublin in 1827.  Later owners include Charles F. Appleton, who built a hydroelectric facility on Wilder Brook and provided Dublin with its first electric service, and artist [[Tom Blackwell]], who used the barn on the property as his studio.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004073}}|title=NRHP nomination for Luke Richardson House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>
