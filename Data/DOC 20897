==Background==
Cristo Rey Columbus was established in 2013 as a part of the [[Cristo Rey Network]] of high schools. It is housed in a renovated building that was built in 1899 as the [[Ohio School for the Deaf]].<ref>[http://www.cristoreycolumbus.org/uploads/2015/crc-corna-bizfirst.pdf Building]. Accessed December 28, 2015.</ref> The building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, underwent an $18 million restoration to accommodate the new school. Renovations included motion-sensor lights in all classrooms, wi-fi, and built-in projectors that connect to students’ tablets and display their work on whiteboards, all of which become smart boards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cristoreycolumbus.org/local-news/former-ohio-school-for-the-deaf-gets-a-new-lease-on-life-as-high-school|title=Former Ohio School for the Deaf Gets a New Lease on Life as High School|website=www.cristoreycolumbus.org|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref>
