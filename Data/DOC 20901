The '''James Robbe Jr. House''' is a historic house on Old Peterborough Road in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].  The 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame house was built c. 1825 by James Robbe Jr., whose father was an early Dublin settler (and whose house stood nearby and has not survived).  The original main block of the house is a typical Dublin farmhouse of the period, similar in style to the nearby [[Micajah Martin Farm]]; it has been connected via  narrow single-story ell to a sympathetically-designed modern garage and greenhouse.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=83004074}}|title=NRHP nomination for James Robbe Jr. House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>

The house was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.<ref name="nris"/>
