==Career==
Andrés Bucci was born in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]] and grew up in the "Bucci Gallery" in the city centre. One of the few places that offered art exhibition space in the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chilean military regime]], the Bucci Gallery was one of the cultural bastions of the last years of the dictatorship and welcomed emerging avant-garde painters as well as [[Chilean rock|punk and 80s new wave musicians]].
In 1996, while living in Germany, Andrés met [[Jimi Tenor]] at the [[Kunsthaus Tacheles]], an important art center where he rented a studio. They worked on some tracks together and Bucci realized he was able to produce music suitable for release.
On a trip to his homeland of Chile, Andrés contacted his friend Christian Powditch and with him, along with Guillermo Ugarte and the Argentinean [[Gustavo Cerati]] (lead musician and voice of [[Soda Stereo]]), created in 1995 his first musical project, [[Plan V]]. The first album of the group "Plan V" (1995) was a success and introduced Chilean electronic music to major audiences,<ref>[http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?op=Artista&id=308 Plan V in Musica Popular] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424225642/http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?op=Artista&id=308 |date=April 24, 2014 }} musicapopular.cl Marisol García retrieved March 26, 2014</ref> with their second album in 1998 bringing them popularity on both sides of the [[Andes Range|Andes]]. Alongside this, Andrés produced solo work under the pseudonym of Chord, performing in Chile and Argentina at venues such as Club La Feria, La Casa Club and Microman.
In 1999, the label [[Ruta 5]] (owned by Martin Schopf's Berlin based Chilean musician, aka [[Dandy Jack]]), invited Andrés to participate in the "Austral project", a compilation album of Chilean artists such as [[Atom Heart]], [[Ricardo Villalobos]], [[Luciano (DJ)|Luciano]] and [[Daniel Nieto]] ([[Danieto]]), released on [[Payola record]] label.
In 2000, Andrés was invited to curate a Chilean art exhibition in Berlin's Bethanien Art Center. He integrated the exhibition with music, performing himself and sharing the stage with German musicians [[Stereo Total]] and Silvesterboy (Golden Citronen).
During 2001, Andrés released his debut album under the pseudonym Chord, titled "Monochord". He also released many remixes for important South American artists such as Original Hamster, Chilean musicians [[Pánico]], [[DJ Bitman|Bitman & Roban]], and the Argentinian Gustavo Cerati, and continued performing live in Chile and Argentina.
In 2002, he formed the duo "Detalles" with Kate Simko, a music student from Chicago, and released the album "Shapes of summer" for the German label Traum. They would later, in 2007, release "Micros morning" for the US label Kupei Musika.<ref>[http://www.ibiza-voice.com/music/artist/Andres_Bucci  Andres Bucci – Ibiza Voice] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140319183647/http://www.ibiza-voice.com/music/artist/Andres_Bucci |date=March 19, 2014 }} ibiza-voice.com retrieved on March 25, 2014</ref>
In 2003, Andrés performed as Chord at the MicroMutek festival in [[Valparaiso]] and in the same year, released an EP with his brother Pier for the WMF record label.
The duo, known as "Bucci", debuted with their track "Dude" and came in at number 8 in the specialized [[Debug (magazine)|De:Bug]] magazine chart, performing in several Berlin clubs. Also in 2003, Bucci appeared in the "Canción Electrónica" (Electronica Song) compilation album from Argentina's Indice Virgen Records and the "Colores Compilation" album from Mexico's Mil Records.

In 2004, Andrés performed with Detalles at the Mutek Festival in Chile where they were named one of the "next 100 most influential bands of the year" in the US by [[URB (magazine) URB magazine]].<ref>[http://www.mutek.org/en/archives/artists/469-andres-bucci  Mutek – Andres Bucci] "Just for Laughs Museum" Mutek.org June 4, 2005 retrieved March 25, 2014</ref>
In 2005, Bucci was invited to perform at Mutek Festival in Canada where his set received excellent reviews. From this point Bucci started to perform frequently in clubs around Europe.

In 2007, Andrés released his solo EP "Chocopanda", and performed with Bucci at the Raum Club<ref>[http://raum.im/ Raum Club] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425000408/http://raum.im/ |date=April 25, 2014 }} retrieved March 25, 2014</ref> in Barcelona, at the Synch Festival in Greece<ref>[http://www.synch.gr/index_new.php?lang=2&cid=2 Synch Festiva Greece] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528114318/http://www.synch.gr/index_new.php?lang=2&cid=2 |date=May 28, 2014 }} retrieved March 25, 2014</ref> and at Watergate Club in Berlin.
