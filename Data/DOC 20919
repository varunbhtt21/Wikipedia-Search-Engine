The '''Sawyer Tavern''' is a historic building at 63 Arch Street in [[Keene, New Hampshire]].  This landmark 2-1/2 story frame house was built no later than 1803-06, and has a long record as a tavern and inn in West Keene.  Although it is now filled with private residences, it served in both the 19th and 20th centuries as a tavern.  It was built by Abraham Wheeler, Jr., a veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], whose son-in-law Josiah Sawyer later took over the business.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=80000280}}|title=NRHP nomination for Sawyer Tavern|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>

The building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.<ref name="nris"/>
