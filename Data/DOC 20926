==Early life and education==
Suo received a B.S. degree in solid mechanics from [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]] in 1985 and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Harvard University in 1989, advised by [[John W. Hutchinson]].

==Career==
Suo joined the faculty of the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]], and established a research group studying the mechanics of materials and structures. The group moved to [[Princeton University]] in 1997, and to [[Harvard University]] in 2003. He studied basic processes, including fracture, deformation, polarization, and diffusion, driven by various thermodynamic forces (e.g., stress, electric field, electron wind, chemical potential). He developed applications for microelectronics, large-area electronics, soft materials,<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/super-stretchy-jelly-can-take-a-hit-1.11354 "Super-stretchy jelly can take a hit"]. ''Nature News''. Katharine Sanderson, 05 September 2012</ref> active materials,<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24127-bioinspired-speaker-uses-clear-gel-to-play-music.html#.VZ3ERkZ0elo " Bio-inspired speaker uses clear gel to play music"]. ''New Scientist'', 29 August 2013 by Sandrine Ceurstemont</ref> and lithium-ion batteries.

With Teng Li, Suo co-founded iMechanica, the web of mechanics and mechanicians. In 2015, iMechanica has over 20,000 registered users. He is a member of the Executive Committee (2005-2010, Chair 2010) of the Applied Mechanics Division, of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and is a member at large of the US National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (2006-2012).

Suo is a recipient of the Humboldt Research Award.<ref>[http://www.onlinetmd.com/materials-biocompatible-harvard-091312.aspx#.VZ3F90Z0elr "Biocompatible Material is Tougher than Cartilage"]. ''Today's Medical Developments''. September 13, 2012</ref> He won the [[Pi Tau Sigma]] Gold Medal and the Special Achievement Award for Young Investigators in Applied Mechanics, both from ASME. He received the [[William Prager Medal]], Society of Engineering Sciences.  He is a member of the [[US National Academy of Engineering]] and the [[US National Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2019-nas-election.html|title=2019 NAS Election|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|date=April 30, 2019}}</ref>

Suo is the author of many peer-reviewed articles, including "Mixed mode cracking in layered materials", (JW Hutchinson, Z Suo), ''Advances in applied mechanics'' 29 (63) and "Fracture mechanics for piezoelectric ceramics", (Z Suo, CM Kuo, DM Barnett, JR Willis), ''Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids'' 40 (4).  In 2015, he contributed to the article "Syringe-injectable electronics", which was published in ''Nature Nanotechnology''.<ref>[http://www.zmescience.com/science/nanotechnology-science/neural-mesh-brain-17062015/ "Scientists create neural lace that fuses with your brain"].
