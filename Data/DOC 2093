==Reception==
In a contemporary review, the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' found the film was "erratically scripted, unusually clumsily dubbed, and sagging badly in the middle"<ref name="mfb-review">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Lunghi capelli della morte, I (The Long Hair of Death)|volume=34|issue=396|pages=142-143|year=1967|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=London}}</ref>
it still had "enough good sequences to lift it well out of the rut" and was "a pleasingly atmospheric Gothic tale".<ref name="mfb-review" /> The review compared Margheriti to [[Mario Bava]], stating that he "hasn't quite the same gift as Bava for this sort of thing" but still "acquits himself creditably".<ref name="mfb-review" /> The review also praised the acting of Halin Zalewska and Barbara Steele finding the latter to be "her usual extraordinary self".<ref name="mfb-review" />

In retrospective reviews, the film was called a "superior monochrome gothic".<ref>Hughes, p.87</ref> Roberto Curti, author of ''Italian Gothic Horror Films'' felt the film was not as strong as Margheriti's ''Danza macabara'' (''[[Castle of Blood]]'').{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=125}} Margheriti himself stated that he did not like the film, because he felt the script and story were of poor quality.{{sfn|Curti|2015|p=125}}
''Video Librarian'' referred to the film as a "minor classic of Gothic horror" noting that it was  "short on traditional horror set pieces (and plot)" but "boasts plenty of lovely imagery and ominous atmosphere."<ref name="librarian">{{cite magazine|magazine=Video Librarian|volume=30|issue=2|pages=41-42|title=The Long Hair of Death|ISSN=0887-6851|last=Axmaker|first=S."|date=2015}}</ref>
