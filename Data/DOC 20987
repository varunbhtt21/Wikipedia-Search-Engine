'''Military airspace''' is any area in which [[military aircraft]] are present and participate in a variety of activities. There are many kinds of airspace.

==Military operating areas==
Military Operating Areas (MOA) are zones in which military aircraft conduct non-hazardous exercises. It is highly recommended that pilots check for information on the MOA before proceeding into the zone.<ref name="ac210-5b">http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/8208fab053d0a1d586256b43004dda8f/$FILE/ac210-5b.pdf</ref>
