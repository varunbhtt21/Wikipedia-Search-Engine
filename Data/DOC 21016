:I have no knowledge about this bloke, but he is mentioned in Jocelyn and McEwen's ''The Long March'' published by Constable in 2006. He would generally meet [[WP:SOLDIER]] having commanded a division and later an army. [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]  ([[User_talk:Peacemaker67#top|send... over]]) 05:46, 3 May 2014 (UTC) 
*'''Keep''' Two references added establishing notability per [[WP:SOLDIER]]. Unfortunately Jocelyn and McEwen's book is not available for preview at Google books (snippet view only), but he's definitely in there.
