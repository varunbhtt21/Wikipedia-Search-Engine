==Architecture and history==
The library is located near the center of Machias's downtown area, at the junction of Court and Free Streets.  It is a 1-1/2 story masonry building, constructed out of ashlar granite in the Romanesque Revival style.  It has an T-shaped plan, the stem of the T paralleling Court Street, with [[gable end]]s facing to the north, west, and south, that are capped by Romanesque [[pinnacle]]s.  The main entrance is in the northern corner of the T, sheltered by a [[portico]] with large round arches.  The adjacent gable end has a band of five smaller round-arch windows on the first floor, and a pair of slender round-arch windows in the attic level.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=78000208}}|title=NRHP nomination for Porter Memorial Library|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-12-18}}</ref>

The Machias Library Association was formed about 1815 by Rufus K. Porter, a local attorney.  His son, Henry Homes Porter, was a successful railroad executive.  With the library of his hometown lacking in funding and a permanent home, he gave $1,500 in 1891 to stabilize its financial situation, and promised an additional $9,000 for construction of a permanent home.  The present building was designed by [[Boston, Massachusetts]] architect [[George A. Clough]] and was completed in 1893.  It was named to honor both Porters for their role in its founding.<ref name=NRHP/>
