In 2002 the City of Houston began installing an updated storm sewer system for the neighborhood because by that year, there was a tendency for the Brays Bayou to overflow and for rain to pool on lawns and streets. The $2.8 million project began in August 2002. By November of that year, was about 25-35% done according to Pat Henney, project manager for the company that manages the construction, Carter and Burgess Inc.<ref name=Saucierstreets/> It was scheduled to be completed in August 2003.<ref name=Saucierstreets/> In 2004 Feser wrote that the new streets and sewer system benefited the neighborhood.<ref name=Feserrenov/>
