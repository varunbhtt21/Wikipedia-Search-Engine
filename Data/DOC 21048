==Career==

===Solo career===

Although Stewart participated in [[rap battle]]s in his early days, using the experience to gain exposure and get his name out, he has said that he was never really part of the "battle scene" and his dedication is to recording songs.<ref name="aahh-2010iv" />

His independent debut production, ''Chapters of Substance'', was released in 2008 under the name Fluent Form.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluent Form – Chapters of Substance|url=http://cratecartel.com/audio/fluent-form-chapters-of-substance/|publisher=Crate Cartel|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="R&P-Furnace">{{cite web|title=Fluent Form – The Furnace|url=http://www.rhythmandpoetry.net/2009/10/20/fluent-form-the-furnace/|work=Rhythm & Poetry|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=20 October 2009}}</ref>  This was quickly followed the next year by ''The Furnace'', released under the newly formed [[Crate Cartel]] label and distributed through [[Obese Records]].<ref name="R&P-Furnace" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Fluent Form – The Furnace|url=http://cratecartel.com/audio/fluent-form-the-furnace/|publisher=Crate Cartel|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>  Described by an interviewer as "a dark manifesto, serving as an outlet for rage and dissatisfaction", he said that ''The Furnace'' reflects his "burning desires, rage,{{nbsp}}... life, lessons, greed, envy, growth, anger, obstacles, reward, death, life... everything."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluent Form|url=http://certifiedscribe.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/fluent-form/|work=Certified Scribe|date=29 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624130527/http://certifiedscribe.wordpress.com/2009/10/29/fluent-form/|archivedate=24 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  He was praised for his "complex rhyming structure, deep concepts, and overall flow" and as having "the composure of a veteran long in the game."<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluent Form – The Furnace Review|url=http://allaussiehiphop.com/2010/03/01/fluent-form-the-furnace-review-2/|work=All Aussie Hip Hop|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=1 March 2010}}</ref>  In an interview, he said that telling personal stories through the tracks on the album was "very important".<ref name="aahh-2010iv" />
