==History==
By the 20th-century, the bishop of the time expressed the wish for a new church to be constructed on Portland, to succeed St George's as the parish church.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dorsethistoricchurchestrust.co.uk/reforne.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021155723/http://dorsethistoricchurchestrust.co.uk/reforne.htm |archive-date=21 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The church was known for being uncomfortable and draughty, while the original freehold selling of the box pews proved to be a burden over the life of the church. This was because the pew owners had become untraceable as they had been split between hundreds of members of Portland families over time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Legg|first=Rodney|title=Portland Encyclopaedia|year=1999|publisher=Dorset Publishing Company|page=132}}</ref> These issues led to plans being put forward for a new parish church, and these were approved in 1913.<ref>{{cite book|last=Legg|first=Rodney|title=Portland Encyclopaedia|year=1999|publisher=Dorset Publishing Company|page=7}}</ref>

By March 1914, enough funding had been raised to commence the building of the church. The chosen site for the church was within the Easton area known as Straits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=Roy|title=Portland: A Topographical and Historical Gazetteer|year=1999|page=8}}</ref> The building of the church commenced in 1914, and was completed and consecrated in 1917.<ref>http://dorset-churches.org.uk/portland-easton.html</ref> It had been designed by architect George Crickmay, and built by Crickmay and Sons,<ref name="english-heritage1"/> with total costs amounting to £13,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Legg|first=Rodney|title=Portland Encyclopaedia|year=1999|publisher=Dorset Publishing Company|page=7}}</ref> The original plans had intended for a tower to be added to the church, however this was never built.<ref name="english-heritage1"/>
