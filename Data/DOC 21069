Fails to meet [[WP:MUSICBIO]]. Poorly referenced article with unreliable sources. [[User talk:Bisswajit|<font size="4"><span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;color:green">Bisswajit</span></font>]] 13:59, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Very little coverage. The band she was in, Sistanova, doesn't seem very notable either (the German Wikipedia has an article on them but it doesn't present a strong case - one top 50 single, one album, lack of third-party references[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistanova]). The cited sources on this are weak: the Regiomusik article on Sistanova looks the best[http://www.regiomusik.de/pop/cd/preview-sistanova-unglaublich.html] but it does nothing to establish Key Lisa's individual notability. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 14:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
