:* ''Comment'': 5x expanded
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]). Self nominated at 14:14, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] Expansion 250 bytes to 1087; not a 5x expansion and not long enough either (under the 1,500 byte minimum limit). <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 08:34, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:* [[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]] , forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't article length found under "page information"? The info given to me by "page information" says the article is over 7000 bytes long, if I minus 1000 for the infobox and picture I still have 6000 bytes.

:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] Per [[Wikipedia:Did you know|the rules]], "Articles must have a minimum of 1,500 characters of prose (ignoring infoboxes, categories, references, lists, and tables etc.)" The prose size is currently 1087 so the article would need another 413 characters to be eligible. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 12:27, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::* [[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Thanks for clarifying, I believe the character count should be in order after my recent edits. [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 14:48, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Now long enough, expansion is over 5x and was done within the time limit, so it's also new enough.
*"In 1886, it was declared that mining was allowed in Johannesburg. The first significant building in Johannesburg, the Central Hotel was built soon after that by FH Bussey on the corner of Commissioner and Sauer street.[3]" fn3 doesn't say that the Central Hotel was built on Commissioner Street, only that the owner of Central Hotel built a hotel there (so I suppose it wasn't the first, either).
*Regarding the hook, the source is not clear if it was the first Chinatown in the country or merely the city. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 08:59, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*:[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  '''ALT1:'''... that [[Johannesburg]] has two [[Chinatown]]s and the first is on '''[[Commissioner Street (Johannesburg)|Commissioner Street]]'''?
I have changed the Central Hotel entry to "one of the first" instead of "the first" [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 12:45, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] This is not satisfactory. The article still maintains that the central hotel was built there, but the reference says "FH Bussey, the owner of Central Hotel, built a new hotel on the corner of Commissioner and Sauer streets" - which is not the same thing. Also although you have ditched the originally proposed hook, the article still states that it was the first chinatown in the country, although this isn't supported in the references. Please fix these things. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 19:03, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Thanks for checking, I have changed the hotel entry to some information about Johannesburg's first chemist, supported by the inline citation. I have also changed the chinatown fact from South Africa
's first to Johannesburg's first. [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 19:36, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Better, but still needs work, per the rules: "The "Did you know?" fact must be mentioned in the article and cited with an inline citation since inline citations are used to support specific statements in an article." <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 21:50, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:*{{DYK?again}} getting there, my recent edits have added the fact to the "Chinatown" section along with a couple of refs. [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 22:32, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] fn9 does not appear to be a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] and fn10 doesn't appear to specifically support the "fact". <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 08:57, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:* {{DYK?again}} thanks [[User:Cloudz679|C]] some pieces of info from fn 9 "Erwin Pon is the chair of the Chinese Association, which puts on the New Year Festival in Old Chinatown." "Cyrildene is the center of the newest Chinese immigrants in Johannesburg." That proves there are two Chinatowns. I'l add a reliable source that I have found.

:* I also changed he fact to say 'Johannesburg has two', and not 'Johannesburg is one of the few' to have two Chinatowns.[[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 09:12, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] QPQ not required, ALT1 hook now meets the criteria.
