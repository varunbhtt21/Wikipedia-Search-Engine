The song was written and recorded during a weekend session at McCarthy's Sausage Studio. About the song's meaning, Kapranos stated: <blockquote>We all feel as sensitive to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and see nothing but destruction, avarice, and boredom. So we look to find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and the bright lights of Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.<ref name="documentary">{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bQTjLlXf3k | title=Franz Ferdinand - Come Home, Practically All, Is Nearly Forgiven | publisher=YouTube | date=23 August 2013 | accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref></blockquote>
