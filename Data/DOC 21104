==History==
[[File:臺灣高雄燈塔 Kaohsiung Lighthouse of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|left|Old image of Kaohsiung Lighthouse]]
After the signing of [[Convention of Peking]] in 1860 during the [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing Dynasty rule]], the [[Port of Kaohsiung|Takau Harbor]] was opened to foreign traders in 1863. With increasing commercial shipping activities and a lack of a proper ship navigation system, the [[British Empire|British]] engineers built a Chinese-style rectangular red-brick lighthouse at the top of Mount Ki-au ([[:zh:旗後山|旗後山]]), at the southern side of the harbor.

During the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], in line with the expansion of the harbor, the lighthouse was rebuilt in 1916 as part of the project. It underwent renovation in 1918 to what it looks like today. The base of the lighthouse building was rebuilt in Baroque style.

In 1985, the lighthouse was rated a Class 3 Building of Historical Interest by the [[Ministry of the Interior (Republic of China)|Ministry of the Interior]] and was subsequently opened to the public.

==Features==
The lighthouse tower provides an excellent view of the entire Port of Kaohsiung.
