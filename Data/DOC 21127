He has worked with many of the most important "[[historically informed performance|historically informed]]" groups of Europe, having recording mainly with [[Jordi Savall]]'s ''Le Concert des Nations'' before he created his own baroque ensemble: ''Les Basses Réunies''. He is very recognized for the "rescue" of forgotten composers such as [[Jean-Baptiste Barrière]] or [[Evaristo Felice Dall'Abaco]], two examples of a vast corpus of recordings including innovative versions of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] Cello Suites and [[Vivaldi]] Cello Concerti and Sonatas.
