The '''Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014''' (ESIC; {{USBill|113|S.|2262}}) is a bill that focused on improving energy efficiency in the United States by reducing homeowners' energy use, improving the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] provisions of building codes, and making other changes.<ref name="NYTdavenport"/>

The bill was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the last time Congress passed a major energy bill was seven years ago.<ref name=NYTdavenport>{{cite news|last=Davenport|first=Coral|title=Amid Pipeline and Climate Debate, Energy-Efficiency Bill is Derailed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/us/politics/bill-to-encourage-energy-efficiency-fails-in-senate.html?_r=1|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 May 2014}}</ref>

==Provisions of the bill==
The bill would have changed the energy efficiency requirements applied to new homes and commercial buildings.<ref name="GOPblocks"/> The bill "contains measures to boost building codes, train workers in energy efficient building technologies, help manufacturers become more efficient and bolster conservation efforts at federal agencies."<ref name=Senatevotestobegin>{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Senate votes to begin work on energy efficiency bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/205311-senate-votes-to-begin-work-on-energy-efficiency-bill|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=6 May 2014}}</ref>

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=2262cbo>{{cite web|title=CBO Estimate of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Effects for S. 2262, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014, as introduced on April 28, 2014|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/s2262paygo.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref>

The legislation would increase direct spending by requiring [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] to revise certain standards related to underwriting mortgages. The legislation also would reduce direct spending by modifying existing requirements to reduce consumption of energy generated from [[fossil fuel]]s at certain federal buildings.<ref name="2262cbo"/>

==Procedural history==
The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014 was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] on April 28, 2014 by [[Jeanne Shaheen|Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH)]].<ref name=2262allactions>{{cite web|title=S. 2262 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2262/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref>  The Senate considered the bill on May 6 and 7, 2014. On May 12, the Senate voted on a cloture motion that would have led to a final yes or no vote on passing the bill, but the cloture motion failed to pass.<ref name="2262allactions"/> Only three Republicans voted in favor of cloture, with the final vote being 55-36, with 60 votes needed to pass.<ref name=GOPblocks>{{cite news|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|title=GOP blocks energy bill, scuttling vote on Keystone XL pipeline|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/205903-gop-blocks-energy-bill-scuttling-keystone-vote|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=12 May 2014}}</ref> Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] changed his vote from in favor to opposed at last minute so that he would be able to recall the bill for another vote at a later date.<ref name="GOPblocks"/>

==Debate and discussion==
The failure of the bill to receive cloture on May 12, 2014 was seen as hurting two Democratic Senators who have difficult re-election campaigns this year.<ref name="GOPblocks"/> Those two Senators were [[Jeanne Shaheen]] (D-NH), who sponsored the bill, and [[Mary Landrieu]] (D-LA).

According to Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] (R-KY), he voted against the bill and Republicans filibustered it in general because Senator Reid refused to allow votes on a few amendments that the Republicans wanted.<ref name="GOPblocks"/> McConnell, arguing that the amendments were legitimate ones and not a delaying tactic, said that "it's laughable to say it's obstructionism to allow the minority to have five or six amendment votes."<ref name="Senatevotestobegin"/>

Senator [[Rob Portman]] (R-OH), who co-sponsored the bill, argued that "this bill is good for American jobs and good for American energy security."<ref name="Senatevotestobegin"/> After the vote to end cloture failed, Portman said that "today's failure to move forward on a bipartisan energy-efficiency bill is yet another disappointing example of Washington's dysfunction."<ref name="NYTdavenport"/>

According to [[Margot Anderson]], the executive director of the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]]'s Energy Project, the changes made by the bill "aren't huge, bold things."<ref name="NYTdavenport"/> Her concern with the failure of the bill was the lost of momentum on energy because "people are worried that if we can't even pass that, we're not in good shape to tackle the bigger stuff."<ref name="NYTdavenport"/>

The [[Alliance to Save Energy]] was in favor of the bill, arguing that the bill "will help speed the transition to a more energy efficient economy, increasing both our economic competitiveness and our energy security for the coming decades, while driving economic growth and encouraging private sector job creation."<ref name=ASEsummary>{{cite web|title=Summary Of The Energy Savings And Industrial Competitiveness Act|url=http://www.ase.org/resources/summary-energy-savings-and-industrial-competitiveness-act-shaheen-portman|publisher=Alliance to Save Energy|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] also supported the bill, because the bill's "broadly supported goals are to save taxpayer dollars, promote job growth, and cut carbon pollution by increasing investments in energy efficient buildings and technologies."<ref name=NRDCsum>{{cite web |title=Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014 (Shaheen-Portman) |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/energy-savings-industrial-competitiveness-act.asp |publisher=Natural Resources Defense Council |accessdate=13 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508181547/http://www.nrdc.org/energy/energy-savings-industrial-competitiveness-act.asp |archivedate=8 May 2014 |df= }}</ref>

A coalition of organizations, including [[Heritage Action for America]], [[Americans for Prosperity]], [[American Energy Alliance]], the [[American Conservative Union]], [[FreedomWorks]] and others, argued against the bill.<ref name=Coalitionopposes>{{cite web|title=Coalition opposes Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014|url=http://americansforprosperity.org/legislativealerts/coalition-opposes-energy-savings-and-industrial-competitiveness-act-of-2014|publisher=Americans for Prosperity|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> According to the coalition, the bill is not "voluntary" as it advertises, because it "authorizes $200 million of taxpayer money to 'incentivize and assist' states and tribal groups to meet allegedly voluntary building codes" which the "taxpayer did not volunteer" to pay for.<ref name="Coalitionopposes"/> They also charge that the bill promotes corporate welfare and is duplicative of existing federal and state programs, pointing a Department of Energy "list of more than 4,200 state programs including targeted tax breaks, rebate programs, revolving loans, low-interest loans and regulations" the promote "efficiency measures and renewable energy."<ref name="Coalitionopposes"/>
