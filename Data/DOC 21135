==Objectives==
See CRUK's Henry Scowcoft's [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/830696#vp_1 interview with Medscape.com] in September 2014]

From John's WMUK/WMF blogpost (see section below):  "Part of the role at CRUK will be to work with the existing medical editors on the English Wikipedia to improve our articles on cancer topics, in particular those on the four common cancers which are widely recognised as having the greatest “unmet need” due to little improvement in survival rates in recent decades. These are cancers of the lung, pancreas, brain and oesophagus. CRUK has just announced a [http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/our-organisation/beating-cancer-sooner-our-strategy new research strategy] with an increased focus on these types of cancers, and my role will complement that. I will also be addressing other cancer-related content, for example in relation to the Medical Translation Project of WikiProject Medicine.

CRUK has access, through its own staff and its access to other researchers and clinicians, to tremendous amounts of expertise, both in terms of science and the communication of science, where they have teams trained and experienced in communicating with a wide range of distinct audiences, from those who write their patient information pages in very plain English to the different teams who produce material for scientists and for general audiences. My boss, Henry Scowcroft, writes for CRUK’s award-winning science blog, and is a Wikipedian. I’ll be exploring a number of approaches in hopes of bringing all this expertise to bear on Wikipedia’s content.

Wikimania 2014 in London, about a mile from CRUK’s HQ, is a great opportunity to bring CRUK and many medical Wikipedians together face to face. A novel aspect of the role is that we are planning to conduct research into the experiences on a range of different types of consumers of Wikipedia’s cancer content. There has been very little formal qualitative research into the experiences of Wikipedia’s readers – we hope this project will begin to address this gap, as well as encourage others to carry out similar projects.

I will also be making presentations and conducting training for key groups of CRUK staff and researchers at their five main research centers in London, Manchester, Glasgow, Oxford and Cambridge. Some of this will be traditional how-to-edit training, but I will also be doing some workshops aimed at people who want to contribute reviews and comments, but who don’t expect to do much editing themselves.

On another tack, I will be working on releasing suitable CRUK images on open licenses and uploading them onto Wikimedia Commons. I think the medical diagrams CRUK has created will be especially useful in Wikipedia articles. We’re already making substantial progress towards a substantial release of content."

Top cancer-related translation targets, from the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Translation task force|Popular pages WikiProject Medicine Translation task force list]]: [[Cancer]], [[Leukemia]] , [[Colorectal cancer]], [[Lung cancer]], [[Breast cancer]], [[Prostate cancer]], [[Stomach cancer]], [[Skin cancer]], [[Health effects of tobacco]].  

Based on the funding application to the [[Wellcome Trust]], who are funding the project, [[Wikimedia UK]] has created a list of the objectives for this project from their point of view. It refers to their strategy structure, which you can see at [[wmuk:Strategic goals]].

==CRUK article reviews==
These are initial reviews by the internal people who recently reviewed and revised the CRUK (cancerhelp section) pages on this, with the most useful recent papers, which I have working copies of. The idea is to sort these points out in the article before sending the article for review by other outside specialists. 
*[[Talk:Pancreatic_cancer#Initial_review_by_CRUK]]
*[[Talk:Esophageal_cancer#Initial_review_by_CRUK]]
*[[Talk:Lung_cancer#CRUK_review|Lung cancer initial review]] 
*[[Talk:Brain_tumor#Cancer_Research_UK_review]] (not much to say as too much needs redoing)

[[Pancreatic cancer]] has now had a review by an outside clinical expert, has completed a [[Wikipedia:Peer review/Pancreatic cancer/archive1|Wikipedia peer review]], and is going through a [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Pancreatic cancer/archive1|Featured Article nomination]]

==CRUK images released on open licenses==

We now have over 400 body diagrams up - not all cancer-specific. More images to follow as the project continues. [https://tools.wmflabs.org/catscan2/quick_intersection.php?lang=commons&project=wikimedia&cats=Images+from+Cancer+Research+UK%0D%0AImages+uploaded+by+F%C3%A6&ns=6&depth=0&max=1000&start=0&format=html&redirects=&callback This is a list of the latest upload].  Many thanks to [[User:Fae]] for uploading the first main batch.  '''''Please help to categorize and use them!'''''

The [https://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/baglama2/index.html#gid=166 BaGLAMa2 report] shows page views of articles using these images in August, traditionally a low-traffic month, totalled 1.1 million. Subsequent months showed: September, 1.41 million, October 1.43 million, November 1.35 million (cumulative 6.61 million to November).  These figures exclude views on mobile & other hand-held devices, which will represent about 30% of total traffic.

==Cancer Statistics==
CRUK maintains [http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/ CancerStats] a large web sub-site devoted to cancer statistics, mostly UK but also global.  A [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_CRUK/Angel_training#Participants.2C_stats_team|number of CRUK specialists from the stats team]] added basic UK stats to several cancer articles on October 3rd - e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prostate_cancer&diff=prev&oldid=628093603 this], with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Prostate_cancer&diff=prev&oldid=628093953 this note/disclosure] on the talk page: "Hi, I'm from Cancer Research UK and going to add some UK stats to the epidemiology section complied from ONS, ISD Scotland, Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit and the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry as summarised on the Cancer Research UK website".  They now plan to do the rest of the 35 cancer types they cover in the same way. What is great is that they are keen to incorporate this into their standard updating procedures.

:Missing any? Please add - [[lymphoma]] is in top 6-7

==Notes on articles==
* [[Histology]] - long, c300K views pa, only 3 refs
* [[Obinutuzumab]] aka Gazyvara - write up new [http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/nice_denies_roche_cancer_drug_due_to_data_uncertainties_603342 NICE decision not to fund, 3/10], and Euro approval
* [[Chimeric antigen receptor]] - [[User:Mxpule]] interested in working on this.
*[[Obesity and cancer]] - [[Diet and cancer]]
*[[Blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia]] - merge or at least use link as a ref
*[[Brain metastasis]] - c 80K views pa. Only 1 ref, though text ?competent.  Little change since 2011, expert tag since 2010
*[[Adenocarcinoma]] - over 500 K vpa, bad - [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adenocarcinoma&diff=615493123&oldid=613337935 work now done on this]
* [[Urachal adenocarcinoma]] no - article - how rare is this?
*[[Tumour classification]]
*[[Clear-cell adenocarcinoma]] - "Clear-cell adenocarcinoma is a type of adenocarcinoma.  Types include: ...." That's it. 
*[[Surgical oncology]] no refs at all; discursive.
*[[Pancreaticoduodenectomy]] (Whipple's procedure) About 240k views pa! Rather old, many refs deadlinks. Lots in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23856911 (CA Cancer J Clin. 2013 Sep;63(5):318-48. doi: 10.3322/caac.21190. Epub 2013 Jul 15., "Recent progress in pancreatic cancer.", Wolfgang CL1, Herman JM, Laheru DA, Klein AP, Erdek MA, Fishman EK, Hruban RH.)
*[[Cancer research]] - generally pretty terrible
*[[Head and neck cancer]] - confused, few refs

===Short, jargon-only=== 
*[[Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor]] and indeed [[Tumor-induced osteomalacia]]
*[[Massive giant-cell tumor of pelviacetabulum]]
*[[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy]], simple, 120k pv pa

===Henry's picks===
:[[Human papillomavirus]] - Intro wrong re types

: Incredibly US focused (tho’ mentions the big European trial): [[Prostate cancer screening]]

:Always a fun topic to fight over:
[Mobile_phone#Health_effects], [[Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health]]

:There is *nothing* on the ‘alcoholic beverage’ page about health, let along cancer…
[[Alcoholic_beverage#Ethanol_considered_as_a_drug]] but (JB) [[Alcohol_and_cancer]] gets 60K vpa and is a terrible article

Only tangential mention of cancer on either of these pages:
:[[Obesity]], [[Body_fat]]  - but (JB) [[Obesity-associated_morbidity]] gets 17K vpa & is a terrible title, really terrible article. [[Diet and cancer]] doesn't cover either.	

But there is here: [[Overweight]]


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise
Under ‘health effects’ – has a section on everything *except* cancer (and mentions obliquely just a couple of times).

Barely mentions cancer:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy

Could do with a check:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution#Cancer

Likewise:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen#Occupational_carcinogens

However, this is excellent: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfoods
