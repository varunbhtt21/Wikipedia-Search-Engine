This project may never take off, yes it has a "teaser poster" and references, BUT the references are from 2 and 3 years ago about how Dreamworks has planned to make it but it's now back in development and isn't listed as starting production anytime soon. I would say maybe redirect to [[DreamWorks]] until the film actually begins filming. All this per [[WP:CRYSTAL]] and [[WP:NFF]] <small><span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #09F,-4px -4px 15px #9F0;">[[User:Lady Lotus|LADY LOTUS]]</span> • <span style="text-shadow:4px 4px 15px #F90,-4px -4px 15px #F09;">[[User talk:Lady Lotus|TALK]]</span></small> 14:38, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Support redirect''' (to [[DreamWorks Animation]]). DWA has a full slate till 2017, so the film is not expected to be released before then, if ever.--[[User:Carniolus|Carniolus]] ([[User talk:Carniolus|talk]]) 21:21, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' as above. Since notability is not temporary, simply falling out of production ([[vaporware]]) isn't reason enough to delete an article. This said, before bringing this to deletion, a redirect conversation on the talk page would have sufficed. I didn't find much in a Google search. I'm not exactly sure how reliable sources go for films, but there is a lack of online coverage from usual sources here. Redirects are [[Wikipedia:Redirects are cheap|cheap]] and it can always be undone if more shows up. <span style='font:1.1em"Avenir";padding:1px 3px;border:1px solid #909;color:#909'>czar&nbsp;[[User:Czar|<font color="#909">♔</font>]]</span> 00:03, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
