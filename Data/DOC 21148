Set shortly after the events of ''Persona 4 Arena'', the story focuses on the two protagonists groups, The Investigation Team and the Kirijo Group, who are trapped in a dimension known as the Dark Hour where they encounter doppelgangers known as Shadows. As the story progresses, the cast meets apparent culprit behind this, a teenager known as Sho Minazuki. While retaining gameplay elements from ''Persona 4 Arena'', now the player can directly choose each character's Shadow that change the gameplay elements. The game was well received by video game publications.

==Gameplay==
{{see also|Persona 4 Arena#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Persona 4 Arena}}

Like the previous title, ''Persona 4 Arena Ultimax'' is a [[fighting game]] in which characters from both ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]'' battle each other using a variety of special moves, combos, and Persona abilities. Along with balance adjustments and new moves added to the returning characters, a new S-Hold system allows players to charge up their attacks. Also new to ''Ultimax'' is the ability to choose "Shadow Types" for many of the game's characters. These Shadow versions differ by being largely skill-based variants of their counterparts, employing a high-risk high-reward play style thanks to reduced normal attack damage and an altered move set with lacking defensive options. They also keep their SP over multiple rounds instead of resetting each time and possess an exclusive Shadow Rampage ability, which replaces the Burst command, giving the characters infinite SP for a limited time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shoryuken.com/2014/05/16/atlus-latest-persona-4-the-ultimax-ultra-suplex-hold-trailer-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-labrys-new-shadow-mode-form/|title=Atlus’ Latest Persona 4 The Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold Trailer Gives Us a Glimpse of Labrys’ New Shadow Mode Form|work=Shoryuken|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006145247/http://shoryuken.com/2014/05/16/atlus-latest-persona-4-the-ultimax-ultra-suplex-hold-trailer-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-labrys-new-shadow-mode-form/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}</ref>

The game's story mode is now split into two separate campaigns for the ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'' casts, as opposed to a campaign for each character. Two additional story campaigns are available: one allows players to replay the character campaigns from ''Persona 4 Arena'', while the other is included with the Tohru Adachi downloadable content and focuses on his actions during the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/03/adachi-dlc-character-persona-4-arena-ultimax/|title=Adachi Is A DLC Character In Persona 4 Arena Ultimax|work=Siliconera|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122031/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/06/03/adachi-dlc-character-persona-4-arena-ultimax/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}</ref> Golden Arena is a dungeon-based survival mode, in which players travel through various dungeons to increase the fighter's stats.

==Plot==

===Setting and characters===
The game begins a day after the conclusion of ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'', in the fictional rural Japanese town of Inaba. Unlike in the previous game, which focused on the TV World, the events of ''Ultimax'' occur in the real world. However, due to the enemies' interference, Inaba is shrouded by red fog and turns into a labyrinth that mixes with the places of ''[[Persona 3]]'' such as Moonlight Bridge, Club Escapade, and Tartarus.

All 13 playable characters featured in ''Persona 4 Arena'' return in ''Ultimax''. Eight new characters, five of whom were introduced in console version, were also added to the roster: [[Yukari Takeba]], [[List of Persona 3 characters#Ken Amada|Ken Amada]] and his canine partner [[List of Persona 3 characters#Koromaru|Koromaru]], [[List of Persona 3 characters#Junpei Iori|Junpei Iori]], [[List of Persona 4 characters#Rise Kujikawa|Rise Kujikawa]], [[List of Persona 4 characters#Tohru Adachi|Tohru Adachi]], [[List of Persona 4 characters#Marie|Marie]], [[List of Persona 4 characters#Margaret|Margaret]] and a brand new character, [[List of Persona 4 characters#Sho Minazuki|Sho Minazuki]]. Furthermore, many (though not all) of these characters feature a Shadow Type. Other characters, such as [[List of Persona 3 characters#Fuuka Yamagishi|Fuuka Yamagishi]] from ''Persona 3'', [[List of Persona 3 characters#Theodore|Theodore]] from ''Persona 3 Portable'', and [[List of Persona 4 characters#Nanako Dojima|Nanako]] and [[List of Persona 4 characters#Ryotaro Dojima|Ryotaro Dojima]] from ''Persona 4'', appear in a non-playable capacity.<ref name="siliconera.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.siliconera.com/2013/11/24/persona-4-ultimax-suplex-hold-coming-ps3-next-year/ |title= Persona 4: The Ultimax Suplex Hold Coming To PS3 Next Year |author= Ishaan |date= 2013-11-24 |website= Siliconera |accessdate= 2013-11-24 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131126001133/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/11/24/persona-4-ultimax-suplex-hold-coming-ps3-next-year/ |archivedate= 2013-11-26 |df=  }}</ref><ref name="Sequel1">{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201308/16038325.html |title=【速報】『ペルソナ4 ジ・アルティメット イン マヨナカアリーナ』の続編！ 東京と大阪で本日よりロケテ開始!! - ファミ通.com |publisher=Famitsu.com |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817043820/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201308/16038325.html |archivedate=2013-08-17 |df= }}</ref><ref name="Sequel2">{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201308/16038447.html |title=『ペルソナ4 ジ・アルティメット イン マヨナカアリーナ』続編の最速プレイリポート！ - ファミ通.com |publisher=Famitsu.com |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817044126/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201308/16038447.html |archivedate=2013-08-17 |df= }}</ref><ref name="ultimax">{{cite web |url= http://shoryuken.com/2013/09/26/persona-4-arena-the-ultimax-ultra-suplex-hold-officially-announced-trailer-reveals-new-character-sho-minazuki/ |title= Persona 4 The Ultimax Ultra Suplex Hold Officially Announced, Trailer Reveals New Character Sho Minazuki |date= 2013-09-26 |website= Shoryuken |accessdate= 2013-09-26 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130928105429/http://shoryuken.com/2013/09/26/persona-4-arena-the-ultimax-ultra-suplex-hold-officially-announced-trailer-reveals-new-character-sho-minazuki/ |archivedate= 2013-09-28 |df=  }}</ref><ref name="dengekimax">{{cite web |url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/721/721992/ |title=電撃 - AC『P4U』の続編に鈴村健一さん演じる新キャラ・皆月翔が参戦！ 強力なスキルを放てる"Sホールドシステム"など新バトルシステムも判明 |publisher=Dengekionline.com |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2013-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154839/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/721/721992/ |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}</ref><ref name="famitsumax1">{{cite web |author=@ |url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201309/26040703.html |title=『ペルソナ4 ジ・アルティマックス ウルトラスープレックスホールド』特別捜査隊とシャドウワーカーの熱戦再び！ - ファミ通.com |publisher=Famitsu.com |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2013-09-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929031925/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201309/26040703.html |archivedate=2013-09-29 |df= }}</ref>

===Story===
At midnight the day after the P-1 Grand Prix concludes, the TV in Yu's room suddenly starts airing the Midnight Channel, showing a promotion for the P-1 Climax and an image of Mitsuru, Aigis, Akihiko, and Fuuka crucified, with General Teddie announcing the world's end within one hour. A black out then occurs throughout Inaba and the whole town is surrounded by red fog. The Investigation Team starts facing Shadows that steal fragments of their enemies' Personas upon their defeat.

Yu, Yosuke, and Chie reach Yasogami and are approached by Sho, who announces himself as the culprit behind the P-1 Grand Prix and P-1 Climax. Tohru Adachi, whom they had believed to be imprisoned, also appears and give cryptic clues regarding Sho's intentions to them. At Tartarus, they once again encounter Sho and defeat him, but are overpowered by his other self, Minazuki. Minazuki reveals he has gathered enough Persona fragments to summon a malevolent entity that will destroy the world. Now reunited with their teammates and the Shadow Operatives, they pursue him through Tartarus, but are assaulted by a huge group of Shadows, forcing the group to let Yu confront Sho alone. At the top of the tower, Yu stops Sho from killing Adachi and fights Minazuki, emerging victorious. General Teddie, revealing himself to be Hi-no-Kagutsuchi, possesses Sho's body and fights Yu. With Adachi's help, they are able to kill Kagutsuchi. As Tartarus collapses, Elizabeth transports everyone to the TV World where Yu reunites with his friends who all set up to find a new path in their futures.

Following this scenario, the game shows how Mitsuru, Aigis, Akihiko, and Fuuka are captured by Sho. In response, the reserve members of the Shadow Operatives as well as Labrys all head to Inaba via helicopter (save for Junpei, who ends up at Inaba by accident). After separately meeting the members of Investigation Team and rescuing their captured friends, they encounter Sho, the culprit behind Labrys' hijacking, who goads them into fighting Shadows in order to gather their Persona fragments. It is also revealed that Sho used to be one of [[List of Persona 3 characters#Shuji Ikutsuki|Ikutsuki]]'s test subjects, living in isolation and growing to resent the entire world after Ikutsuki abandoned him. During one of the experiments to make him a Persona user like [[List of Persona 3 characters#Strega|Strega]] by using a Plume of Dusk, similar to Aigis and Labrys, another personality was born within Sho, which he refers to as Minazuki. Minazuki claims to have been born to grant Sho's wish to create a world without bonds. Labrys reaches the top of the tower and fights Sho. After defeating Sho, Hi-no-Kagutsuchi proceeds to possesses Sho's body. Labrys is able to emerge victorious against Kagutsuchi. As Tartarus collapses, Margaret transports everyone into the TV World. Sho, who is also transported, asks if she really did defeat Kagutsuchi, which she confirms, and Sho acknowledges her strength. Labrys then tries to convince Sho to join the Shadow Operatives.

After both scenarios are completed, a new chapter is unlocked, which follows the aftermath of Yu and Adachi defeating Kagutsuchi. As both Margaret and Elizabeth appear to witness the event, Sho is revealed to be alive but unable to sense Minazuki within him. He then reveals that after waking up from his coma, he discovered that Ikutsuki paid his medical expenses, leaving him with a large inheritance. Feeling lost due to only knowing how to fight, Sho eventually settled in Inaba, where he observed the Investigation Team [[Persona 4|solving the serial kidnapping/murder case]] in secret, believing that they might be able to understand him, only to give up. It was then that he was confronted by Hi-no-Kagutsuchi, who asked him if he wanted to destroy the world, and he agreed. Realizing Sho's only way to form bonds is by fighting, Yu starts a rivalry with him and both fight, revealing that Minazuki's persona has been passed down to Sho. After Sho's friendly departure, Margaret safely transports everyone out of the tower at Yu's request, and come to terms with Elizabeth's departure from the Velvet Room after trying to convince her to return. In the aftermath, the Investigation Team and the Shadow Operatives reunite at Junes, where they all bond together and celebrate their victory, while Yu and Labrys express their belief in Sho finding bonds of his own.

====Episode Adachi====
Adachi continues to undergo police questioning regarding his methods for the two murders in Inaba, but his interrogators still do not believe his account of his crimes. However, Sho brainwashes one of the interrogators into assaulting Adachi and forcing him back into the TV World. There, Sho coerces Adachi into aiding him in his plan to destroy the world. Adachi outwardly agrees, but decides to sabotage him in order to honor his promise to the Investigation Team to follow society's rules, and subtly manipulates the Investigation Team towards defeating Sho. When the Persona fragments are collected, Adachi makes his move, betraying Sho. However, Minazuki brutally beats Adachi. Adachi is rescued by Yu, and he destroys Hi-no-Kagutsuchi with Yu's aid. Adachi then returns to his prison cell and is visited by his old friend Dojima the next day.
