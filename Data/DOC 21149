Text : [[File:063GubbioMadonnaDelPrato.JPG|thumb|Madonna del Prato, Gubbio]]
The church of '''Madonna del Prato''' is a [[Baroque]]-style [[Roman Catholic]] temple in [[Gubbio]], region of [[Umbria]], in Italy. 

==History==
The church construction began in 1662 to house an image of the ''Madonna del Prato'', that was held to be miraculous. The plain facade with two statues does not prepare the visitor for the interior, which is a near replica of the interior space and ordering of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane|San Carlino alle Quattro Fontane]], one of the masterpieces of Baroque architecture in Rome, by [[Francesco Borromini]]. The architectural plan is attributed to [[Carlo Perugini]], but there is evidence Borromini may have played a direct role.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/1782837/Roma_1638_Gubbio_1662._Francesco_Borromini_e_la_chiesa_della_Madonna_del_Prato_in_Le_Vie_dei_Mercanti._Citta_rete_Rete_di_citta Article about Borromini in Gubbio].</ref> The dome, which in Rome is populated by geometric crosses, was frescoed by [[Francesco Allegrini]] and [[Louis Dorigny]] (1677-78). The church also has altarpieces by [[Ciro Ferri]], [[Gaetano Lapis]], and [[Domenico Maria Viani]].<ref>[http://www.comune.gubbio.pg.it/Principali_Monumenti/Chiesa_della_Madonna_del_Prato.aspx Commune of Gubbio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502024323/http://www.comune.gubbio.pg.it/Principali_Monumenti/Chiesa_della_Madonna_del_Prato.aspx |date=2014-05-02 }} Tourism website entry.</ref>
