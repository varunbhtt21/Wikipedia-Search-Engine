The result was  '''Deleted''' - the article got the CSD:A7 axe while the AfD was in progress. Hey, it happens. A non-admin closure. [[User:And Adoil Descended|And Adoil Descended]] ([[User talk:And Adoil Descended|talk]]) 22:24, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

Completely non-notable person. One sentence of unverified information, and the person would not be notable even if it were verified. Evidence suggests that this article was created by the subject himself (User:Heykarthikwithu). That user created a previous joke article under the same name, which was speedy-deleted.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHeykarthikwithu&diff=605153168&oldid=591996993] This article was proposed for first speedy and then prod; both were declined by the creator (who has so far done nothing constructive here). Wish we could speedy-delete this nonsense, but at least let's delete it, and possibly salt the title. [[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 14:51, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Speedy delete''' - It should be speedy deleted, CSD#A7. Creator can remove the {{tl|Prod}} tag, but can't really "speedy" ones. He should better contest the speedy on article's talk page, and let the admin decide thereafter. If creator removes speedy tag, we warn them on their talk page for removing csd tags. Subject is completely non-notable. No reliable sources found because there's not really even one! Perhaps, I'm going to tag the article again with [[WP:CSD#A7]] and requesting protection from creation at [[WP:RPP]].

::Thanks for nominating this for speedy deletion. To clarify the history: An article by this name (but with different content) was deleted last month under A3. The author then created this article. It was again tagged for speedy under A3 "no content", because it consisted only of an infobox; the creator added a line of text so the tagger removed the speedy tag. The tagger then put on a BLP PROD tag because the article had no references; the creator added a reference (actually an invalid one, namely linkedin) and the creator removed the BLP PROD tag. I don't know what the tagger would have done next, because I came along and AfDed it. I wonder if we could have renominated it for speedy, using A7 instead of A3? There are so many reasons to speedy-delete this that it seems like one of them should have stuck! --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 19:26, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::And..... it's gone, in the time it took me to write this note. Let's hope it's gone for good. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 19:28, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*This article was earlier deleted for lacking sufficient context under [[WP:CSD#A3]] speedy deletion criteria. And, this time, it was created again, but with some context. As, it appeared to be non-notable doing [[WP:BEFORE]], speedy was more appropriate choice. We can tag article for whatever [[WP:GCSD|criteria of speedy deletion]], it qualifies. Well, you may want to close this AfD as "speedy delete" ([[WP:NAC|non-admin closure]])?

:::::Thanks for the info. I know that articles can't be prodded a second time, but I didn't realize they can be tagged for speedy a second time (with a different rationale). --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 20:00, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
