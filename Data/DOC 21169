'''''Let It Rock!''''' is [[The Connection (band)|the Connection's]] first full-length LP, released in June 2013.<ref name="hippopress"/> While all rock and roll, the songs on ''Let It Rock!'' are otherwise diverse in nature, and one of them incorporates touches of [[country music]].<ref name="newhampshire"/> A single, "Crawling from the Wreckage (Of a Saturday Night)", was released before the album as a [[7-inch single]].

''Let It Rock!''  was album of the summer on ''El Sotano Radio'' in [[Madrid]], Spain, in 2013.<ref name="letitrocksotano"/> [[Goldmine (magazine)|''Goldmine'' magazine]] named ''Let It Rock'' number 14 on its Top 20 Albums of 2013, stating, "A helping of punk energy, plenty of pop songwriting smarts and a whole lotta rock and roll attitude sums up these [[New Hampshire]] boys."<ref name="goldmine"/>

==Overview==

===Production===
The record features two covers: "[[Connection (The Rolling Stones song)|Connection]]" by [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[Chuck Berry]]'s classic "[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let it Rock]]."<ref name="newhampshire"/> The other tracks are original Marino/Palmer compositions.<ref name="altrobandcamp"/>  According to Marino, "Some of the songs are like the first album{{nbsp}}... that 1964 AM radio, three chord [sound], and then we have some other songs where they sound more like a 1972 Rolling Stones' song. We have saxophone, piano{{nbsp}}... I tune my guitar to the [[Keith Richards]] tuning{{nbsp}}... we just let it rip."<ref name="newhampshire"/>

==="Crawling from the Wreckage"===
Released earlier than the album on May 27, 2013 was a promo single "Crawling from the Wreckage (Of a Saturday Night)." The song is an original Marino/Palmer composition, and is an up-tempo number that pays homage to [[Dave Edmunds]] and his 1979 [[Graham Parker]]-penned song, "[[Crawling from the Wreckage]]."<ref name="altrobandcamp"/>

===Album release===
In June 2013, The Connection's first full-length LP ''Let It Rock!''<ref name="hippopress"/> was released in the US on King Yum Records and Collectors Club Records. By December 2013, the album was released in Spain.<ref name="wirenhdreadnaught"/> The American [[LP record]] had 13 tracks, and there were 14 tracks in Europe. The album was then reissued as a 22-track CD by adding the songs from the ''Connection Collection Vol.1'' EP.<ref name="snyderdavid"/>  This version was released in Japan.

===Reception===
''Let It Rock!''  was album of the summer on ''El Sotano Radio'' in Madrid in 2013.<ref name="letitrocksotano"/> ''[[Goldmine Magazine]]'' named ''Let It Rock'' number 14 on its Top 20 Albums of 2013, stating, "A helping of punk energy, plenty of pop songwriting smarts and a whole lotta rock and roll attitude sums up these New Hampshire boys."<ref name="goldmine"/> According to a review, "There is no one—no one—on the scene today that does rock 'n' roll better than The Connection. Their music takes us back to the early days of rock innocence and exuberance when people like [[Eddie Cochran]], Chuck Berry, the Rolling Stones and [[the Fab Four]] sang songs that affirmed the uncontaminated perceptions of youth{{nbsp}}... The Connection prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that rock still has its vibrance, its power and its relevance in the 21st century."<ref name="altro"/>
