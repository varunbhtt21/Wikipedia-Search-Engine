'''CLaCS''' ('''Cryo-Laser and Cryo-Sclerotherapy''') is a treatment for leg vein lesions by combining transdermal laser effect and injection [[sclerotherapy]], all under skin cooling (Cryo - cold air blown onto the skin at -20C)<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Miyake|first=Hiroshi|last2=Miyake|first2=Kasuo|last3=Duarte|first3=Flávio|last4=Kikuchi|first4=Rodrigo|date=2008|title=Pequenas Varizes e Telangiectasias|trans-title=Small Varicose Veins and Telangiectasias|url=|journal=Doenças Vasculares Periféricas|language=Portuguese|edition=4|location=Rio de Janeiro, RJ|publisher=Guanabara Koogan S.A.|volume=2|pages=1769-1795|isbn=9788527714600|via=}}</ref>. The laser causes a selective [[Laser hair removal|photothermolysis]] damaging the vein wall. The vein's lumen gets smaller. On a second procedure, sclerosing agent is injected where the vein is still open. This combination allows to treat veins that could be treated by phleboectomy or foam sclerotherapy - more invasive options. To improve results, CLaCS can be guided by Augmented Reality ([[near-infrared vein finder]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title= Vein imaging: a new method of near infrared imaging, where a processed image is projected onto the skin for the enhancement of vein treatment|date=2014-01-24 |pmid=16918565 | doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.2006.32226.x |volume=32 |issue=8 |journal=Dermatol Surg |pages=1031–8 | last1 = Miyake | first1 = RK | last2 = Zeman | first2 = HD | last3 = Duarte | first3 = FH | last4 = Kikuchi | first4 = R | last5 = Ramacciotti | first5 = E | last6 = Lovhoiden | first6 = G | last7 = Vrancken | first7 = C}}</ref>

'''CLaCS''' was created by Dr. Roberto Kasuo Miyake, in 2002, to adhere to patients' requests for treatment that did not require hospitalizations<ref name=":0" />.
