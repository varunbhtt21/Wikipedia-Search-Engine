'''Forkontumac''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Форконтумац}}) is a [[river island]] in [[Serbia]], located on the [[Danube]], east of [[Belgrade]] and north of the neighbouring island [[Čakljanac]]. Both islands are the southernmost part of [[Pančevo]]. The island has an area of 391,7 [[Hectare|hectares]].<ref>[http://www.pancevo.rs/?wpfb_dl=986&cir=lat Službeni list grada Pančeva, 31/2015, p. 20], Retrieved on 2017-03-24.</ref>The [[river mouth]] of [[Tamiš]] into Danube is located north of Forkontumac.

==Name==
The name of the island refers to the former [[quarantine]] station of the city, built in the early 18th century. The old term Kontumaz ([[Latin Language|Latin]] Contumacia) was used as [[synonym]] for quarantine. In 1813, one of the most famous guests was [[Vuk Karadžić]] who stayed in it for several weeks. The German name Vorkontumaz meant the station in front of the headquarters station. This station was located nearby the [[river mouth]] of Tamiš. There is an impression of the  Vorkontumaz which is recorded on the map of the [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Josephinian]] land survey from the late 18th century at the [[National Archives of Austria]].<ref>[http://www.pancevac-online.rs/arhiva/arhiva/!4070/07hronika.htm#vrh Kontumac, Forkontumac i Rastel], Retrieved on 2017-03-24.</ref><ref>Sammlung aller k.k.

==Natural environment==
More than 50 percent of the island is untouched nature, which consists of dense [[forest]]. Forkontumac is an important habitat of numerous [[Bird|bird species]].

==Resort Bela Stena==
There is a weekend settlement with about 400 [[cottages]] on the western tip of the island, which are mainly used by city dwellers during the summer. The name of this [[resort]] is [[Bela Stena]] and means white rock. A white sand [[beach]] makes it popular since the seventies of the last century. During the hot days, thousands of bathers and picknickers line the beach.<ref>[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/57/srbija-danas/1368430/forkontumac---pancevacki-havaji.html Forkontumac - pančevački Havaji], article on the Website by [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]], Retrieved on 2017-03-24.</ref>

==Methanscraper==

Architect Marko Dragićević proposed a construction of the {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}} tall "skyscraper" on the island, for the management of the non-recyclable waste. The design of the "vertical landfill" was awarded the first prize at the 2019 [[eVolo]] futuristic skyscraper design competition.<ref name=Politika>{{cite news | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Солитер - вертикална депонија будућности | trans-title = Skyscraper - vertical landfill of the future | newspaper = [[Politika]] | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 13 May 2019}}</ref> The structure was named Methanscraper.<ref name=gradnja>{{cite web | url = https://www.gradnja.rs/marko-dragicevic-evolo-skyscraper-2019-methanscraper/ | author = Igor Conić | title = Naš arhitekta pobedio na međunarodnom takmičenju za neboder budućnosti | trans-title = Our architect won the international competition for the skyscraper of the future | date = 10 May 2019 | publisher = Gradnja.rs | language = Serbian }}</ref>

The waste tower, "which visually resembles contraptions from the ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]''", is envisioned as the vertical skeletal construction with modular capsules attached to its concrete core. The capsules are filled with the organic waste that turns into [[methane]] in time, which is then extracted into the depot cistern where it would be used for the electricity production. The sustainable system of the tower is not polluting air or the water and eliminates the need for classical landfills which cover lots of space.<ref name=Politika/>
