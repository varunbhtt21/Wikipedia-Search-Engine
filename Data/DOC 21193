A '''mosaic plot''' (also known as a '''Marimekko diagram''') is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables.<ref name="Schlotzhauer2007">{{cite book|author=Sandra D.

==Example==
A classic example of mosaic plots uses data from the passengers on the ''[[Titanic]]''. The data used for this example has 2201 observations and 3 variables. The variables are:

*the gender of the person (male / female)
*the class (1st, 2nd and 3rd class, or crew)
*did this person survive the sinking (yes / no)?

The observations were compiled into the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
! Gender
! Survived
! 1st Class
! 2nd Class
! 3rd Class
! Crew
|-
| rowspan="2" | Male
| No
| align="right" | 118
| align="right" | 154
| align="right" | 422
| align="right" | 670
|-
| Yes
| align="right" | 62
| align="right" | 25
| align="right" | 88
| align="right" | 192
|-
| rowspan="2" | Female
| No
| align="right" | 4
| align="right" | 13
| align="right" | 106
| align="right" | 3
|-
| Yes
| align="right" | 141
| align="right" | 93
| align="right" | 90
| align="right" | 20
|}

===Mosaic plot construction===

{| class="wikitable floatright"
|-
! Order || Variable ||Axis
|-
| 1. || Gender || Vertical
|-
| 2. || Class     || Horizontal
|-
| 3. || Survived   || Vertical
|}

The categorical variables are first put in order. Then, each variable is assigned to an axis. In the table to the right, sequence and classification is presented for this data set. Another ordering will result in a different mosaic plot, i.e., the order of the variables is significant as for all multivariate plots.

At the left edge of the first variable we first plot "Gender," meaning that we divide the data vertically in two blocks: the bottom blocks corresponds to females, while the upper (much larger) one to males. One immediately sees that roughly a quarter of the passengers were female and the remaining three quarters male.

One then applies the second variable "Class" to the top edge. The four vertical columns therefore mark the four values of that variable (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and crew). These columns are of variable thickness, because column width indicates the relative proportion of the corresponding value on the population. Crew plainly represents the largest male group, whereas third-class passengers are the largest female group. The number of female crew members is also seen to have been marginal.

The last variable ("Survived") is finally applied, this time along the left edge with the result highlighted by shade: dark grey rectangles represent people that did not survive the disaster, light grey ones people that did. Women in the first class are immediately seen to have had the highest survival probability. The survival probability for females is seen to have been higher than that for men (marginalised over all classes). Similarly, a marginalization over gender identifies first-class passengers as most probable to survive. Overall, about 1/3 of all people survived (proportion of light gray areas).

==Properties==
*The displayed variables are categorical or ordinal scales.
*The plot is of at least two variables. There is no upper limit, but too many variables may be confusing in graphic form.
*The number of observations is not limited, but not read in the image.
*The surfaces of the rectangular fields that are available for a combination of features are proportional to the number of observations that have this combination of features.
*Unlike, for example, the [[boxplot]] or [[QQ plot]], it is not possible for the mosaic plot to plot a confidence interval. The significance of different frequencies of the various characteristic values can therefore not be observed visually.
