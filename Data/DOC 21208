* '''Support as nominator''' – [[User:ArildV|ArildV]] ([[User talk:ArildV|talk]]) 15:22, 1 May 2014 (UTC) 
*'''Oppose''' - Foreground is noisy. Trees come way too close to the mosque's walls... I have a feeling if you stepped a meter to your right the angle may have helped reduce that.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 23:46, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
** Thank you for your review [[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] . I dont think (one year since I took the image) that is was possible to step a step a meter to the right, next to the water is a small guard house and a fence that protects a private section of the quay, please see the [[:File:Dolmabahce_Mosque_-_January_2011_-_15.jpg|very left of this picture]]. If I on the other hand had taken the picture from a boat, it had been disturbing modern buildings in the background.--[[User:ArildV|ArildV]] ([[User talk:ArildV|talk]]) 07:46, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
***Perhaps, but right now there are considerable distractions (between the cars and trees). Architectural FPs generally have considerably less distracting foregrounds; some, such as [[:File:National Press Monument, Solo (panorama) Diliff.jpg|the National Press Monument]], have activity in the foreground, but even then it adds to the image (showing a function of the building).&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 07:54, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' — Could be cropped in a bit tighter on L and below to mininmize noise. [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 01:31, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
** Thank you for your suggestion [[User:Sca|Sca]]. I added a alternative.--[[User:ArildV|ArildV]] ([[User talk:ArildV|talk]]) 08:35, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' A photo from the Bosporus would have a clearer composition, and given that about a zillion ferries and tourist boats sail past this mosque each day, it should be possible to obtain a high quality image with a composition such as that used in [[:File:İstanbul 5495.jpg]] and [[:File:Exterior view of Dolmabahçe Mosque.jpg]]. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 09:55, 5 May 2014 (UTC) 
** I strongly disagree, because of all the distracting modern buildings in the background (the point here is that you only see the mosque and the palace, but no modern buildings).--[[User:ArildV|ArildV]] ([[User talk:ArildV|talk]]) 13:28, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
***A good choice of DOF could mitigate that issue...&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 11:51, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
**** Not really, even if you manage to get the buildings in the background out of focus, they will still be a highly visible part of the picture. And you will lose the palace.--[[User:ArildV|ArildV]] ([[User talk:ArildV|talk]]) 14:00, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*****Never said anything about "eliminating" issues, but "mitigate" issues. Make them less prominent.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 00:18, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''  — I'm going to vote no, not because of pictorial issues, but because the article is only 17 words — essentially a stub. I'm curious to know more about this interesting building. [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 15:13, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*:It's not 17 words anymore; I expanded it a little. [[User:Epicgenius|Epicgenius]] ([[User talk:Epicgenius|talk]]) 20:21, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Yes, but it's still pretty sketchy. [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 14:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' due to reasons outlined above. As {{noping|Crisco 1492}} said, for example, {{tq|...there are considerable distractions (between the cars and trees)...}}. [[User:Epicgenius|Epicgenius]] ([[User talk:Epicgenius|talk]]) 20:21, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
