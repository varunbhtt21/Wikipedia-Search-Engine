'''William Holmes Honan''' (May 11, 1930 – April 28, 2014) was an American journalist and author who directed coverage of the arts at ''[[The New York Times]]'' as its culture editor in the 1980s.<ref name=Douglas>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=William H.

Honan also helped solve the [[theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg]]: the disappearance of over $200 million worth of medieval treasures from [[Quedlinburg]], Germany at the end of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hurlburt|first=Roger|title=Reporter Searches For Stolen German Art Treasures|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|date=June 15, 1997|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-06-15/entertainment/9706100291_1_quedlinburg-art-treasures-treasure-hunt?pagewanted=print&src=pm}}</ref> The quest to find the "Quedlinburg Hoard" later became the subject of one of Honan's books.

==Early life==
Honan was born in Manhattan on May 11, 1930, the son of William Francis Honan, a thoracic surgeon and Annette Neudecker Honan, a journalist. He is a brother of [[Park Honan]], an academic and author.

He graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in history. In 1955 he earned a master's degree in drama from the University of Virginia.<ref name=Douglas /> After serving in the Army, Honan moved to New York City where he managed Ed Koch's early political campaigns and began a career in journalism.<ref name=Villager>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Lincoln|title=Bill Honan, Villager editor who battled De Sapio, dies at 83|newspaper=The Villager|date=May 1, 2014|url=http://thevillager.com/2014/05/01/bill-honan-villager-editor-who-battled-de-sapio-dies-at-83/?_r=0?pagewanted=print&src=pm}}</ref>

==Career==

===''The Villager''===
Honan worked at ''The Villager'', a downtown New York City paper, from 1957 to 1960, and is credited with turning the publication from "a little society paper" to a significant force in Manhattan politics.<ref name=Villager /> Serving as editor, Honan established himself as a crusading voice for reform against the Tammany Hall [[political machine]] and the automobile-centric visions of the autocratic urban planner [[Robert Moses]].<ref name=Villager />

Honan convinced the Villager's assistant publisher, Jim Bledsoe, to endorse political candidates in 1959.<ref name=Villager /> In a 2,500-word, full-page editorial the paper backed Reform candidates against [[Carmine De Sapio]], the last head of the Tammany Hall machine. The editorial accused De Sapio of widespread corruption.<ref name=Villager />

De Sapio ended up winning the 1959 election by a vote ''The Villager'' called in its headline a "Razor Margin."<ref name=Villager /> However, the paper also correctly predicted that this race was "the last hurrah" for De Sapio and the Tammany machine.<ref name=Villager /> De Sapio would run in and lose in the next three election cycles.<ref name=Villager />

===''The New York Times''===

Honan joined the ''Times'' in 1969<ref name=Douglas /> as an editor at the ''Times Magazine''. He went on to become editor of the Travel section in 1970 and editor of the Arts and Leisure section in 1974. He was promoted to daily cultural news editor in 1982 and held that job until 1988,<ref name=Douglas /> at which point Honan was appointed chief cultural correspondent, a position that entailed "reporting on and analyzing trends in all the arts for daily and Sunday sections."<ref name=NYT />

==Books==

===''Ted Kennedy, Profile of a Survivor''===

Through interviews, Honan published accounts of [[Ted Kennedy]]'s life in a series of New York Times Magazine articles in advance of the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], when there was widespread speculation that Kennedy would make a run for the White House.<ref name="bg-series-3">{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/17/chapter_3_chappaquiddick/ | title=Chapter 3: Chappaquiddick: Conflicted ambitions, then, Chappaquiddick | author=Russell, Jenna | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=February 17, 2009 | accessdate=|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100221041557/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/17/chapter_3_chappaquiddick/|archivedate = February 21, 2010}}Also published in the book ''The Last Lion: The Fall and Rise of Ted Kennedy'', Simon & Schuster, 2009, chapter 3.</ref>

Honan expanded upon these articles in his 1972 book, ''Ted Kennedy, Profile of a Survivor: Edward M. Kennedy after Bobby, after Chappaquiddick, and after three years of Nixon''. The book covers Kennedy's early career in the Senate, the [[Chappaquiddick incident]], the aftermath of the [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]] and Kennedy's anti-war speeches opposing President [[Richard Nixon]]'s policy of [[Vietnamization]].

===''Visions of Infamy''===

''Visions of Infamy'' is a biography of [[Hector Charles Bywater]], the leading naval journalist of the first part of the 20th century who Honan argues was the architect of Japan's naval war against the United States in the Second World War.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Gladdis|title=Visions Of Infamy: The Untold Story Of How Journalist Hector C. Bywater Devised The Plans That Led To Pearl Harbor|newspaper=Foreign Affairs|date=1992|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/47254/gaddis-smith/visions-of-infamy-the-untold-story-of-how-journalist-hector-c-by?_r=0?pagewanted=print&src=pm}}</ref> Bywater's 1925 book, ''The Great Pacific War'', was a fictional account of how Japan might engage the United States in a theoretical future naval conflict and how the U.S. might respond. As Honan points out in ''Visions of Infamy'', both Japan and the U.S. adopted strategies that were remarkably faithful to what Bywater promulgated in his fictionalized war game. Honan speculates that this was more than a coincidence.

===''Treasure Hunt: A New York Times Reporter Tracks the Quedlinburg Hoard''===

Honan published ''Treasure Hunt: A New York Times Reporter Tracks the Quedlinburg Hoard'' in 1997. The book chronicles the story of how the "[[Theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg Hoard]]" - a cache of medieval treasures valued at over $200 million - disappeared in the Harz Mountains at the end of the Second World War, only to resurface 40 years later in a small Texas town. In his capacity as chief cultural correspondent for the ''Times'', Honan pursued a series of leads and discovered that an American soldier of the 87th Armored Field Infantry Battalion of the U.S. Army named Lieutenant Joe T. Meador had orchestrated one of the greatest art thefts in history at the end of the Second World War. Meador's haul included a 9th-century illuminated manuscript gospel book, the "Samuhel Gospels," a printed evangeliary (book of gospel readings for services) dating to 1513 (the Evangelistar aus St. Wiperti), both with jeweled book-covers, as well as reliquaries, an ivory liturgical comb and other objects.<ref name="NYT 2">{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD6103BF937A25755C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=A Trove of Medieval Art Turns Up in Texas |work=[[New York Times]] |author=William H.
