The '''Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|4487}}) is an [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]] that would make appropriations for the [[United States Congress]] for fiscal year 2015. The bill is considered one of the two easiest appropriations bills to pass each year.<ref name="nextweek25ap"/> The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, which is approximately the same amount it received in FY 2014.<ref name="nextweek25ap"/>

The bill was introduced in and passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
{{main|Appropriations bill (United States)}}

An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities.<ref name=CRSappropsIntro>{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=23 January 2014|date=23 February 2012}}</ref> Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The ''fiscal year'' is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year.<ref name=crsBasicBudgetTerms>{{cite web|last=Heniff Jr.|first=Bill|title=Basic Federal Budgeting Terminology|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-410.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=9 January 2014|date=26 November 2012}}</ref> The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill.

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger [[United States budget process|United States budget and spending process]]. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The [[U.S. Constitution]] ([[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]], section 9, clause 7) states that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law..." This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.<ref name="CRSappropsIntro"/>

The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch]]. The bill covers appropriations for the [[United States Congress]] and its related agencies. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.<ref name=tollestrupCRSapprops34>{{cite web|last=Tollestrup|first=Jessica|title=The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42388.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=24 January 2014|pages=3â€“4|date=23 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/congress-shutdown-debate.html | title=Government Near Broad Shutdown in Budget Impasse | work=The New York Times | date=September 30, 2013 | last1=Weisman | first1=Jonathan | last2=Peters | first2=Jeremy W. | accessdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref> The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the [[Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014]], and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the [[United States debt ceiling|debt limit]] until February 7, 2014.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Cohen | first1=Tom | title=House approves bill to end shutdown | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/16/politics/shutdown-showdown/index.html | publisher=CNN International | accessdate=October 17, 2013 | date=October 17, 2013}}</ref> In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman [[Hal Rogers]] has stated that his goal is to pass all [[2015 United States federal appropriations|twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015]] before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation.<ref name=nextweek25ap>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Next week:Appropriations season begins|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/204424-next-week-appropriations-season-begins|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 April 2014}}</ref>

==Procedural history==
The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 17, 2014 by [[Tom Cole|Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK)]].<ref name=4487allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4487 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4487/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> Cole is the chairman of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch]]. It was reported as an original measure by the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]]. The corresponding report was [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt417/CRPT-113hrpt417.pdf report 113-417].<ref name="4487allactions"/> On May 1, 2014, the House voted in [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll193.xml Roll Call Vote 193] to pass the bill 402-14.<ref name="4487allactions"/>

==Debate and discussion==
The amount of money appropriated in this bill is 3.7% lower than President [[Barack Obama]] requested in his [[2015 United States presidential budget request]].<ref name=4487gop>{{cite web|last=Betz|first=Kimberly|title=Legislative Digest - H.R. 4487|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4487-legislative-branch-appropriations-act-2015/|publisher=House Republican Conference|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>

The House and Senate customarily defer to each other regarding each chamber's spending levels, so this bill only includes funding for the House and not the Senate.<ref name=RCHess2Ap>{{cite news|last=Hess|first=Hannah|title=Legislative Branch Bill Keeps House Spending in Check|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/legislative_branch_bill_keeps_house_spending_in_check-231875-1.html|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=Roll Call|date=2 April 2014}}</ref> The legislation retains the freeze on member salaries that has existed since 2010.<ref name="RCHess2Ap"/> [[Hal Rogers]], the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that "the House will continue to lead by example and hold the line on spending."<ref name="RCHess2Ap"/>

The Library of Congress and Librarian of Congress James Billington were praised for their work at digitalizing the library by Rep. [[Tom Cole]] (R-OK).<ref name="RCHess2Ap"/>

According to Rep. Cole, the bill meets its goals "in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion."<ref name="RCHess2Ap"/>
