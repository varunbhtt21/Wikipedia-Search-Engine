Title : Aberaman (electoral ward)
Text : The community of '''[[Aberaman]]''', [[Rhondda Cynon Taf]] was an [[Ward (politics)|electoral ward]] for much of the twentieth century, for the purposes of electing members to [[Glamorgan County Council, 1889-1974|Glamorgan County Council]] and the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]]. It currently comprises two [[Ward (politics)|electoral wards]], [[Aberaman North (electoral ward)|Aberaman North]] and [[Aberaman South (electoral ward)|Aberaman South]], for the purposes of electing members to the [[Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council]]. Aberaman North is composed mainly of [[Aberaman]] itself while [[Aberaman South]] includes [[Abercwmboi]], [[Cwmaman]], Godreaman and Glynhafod.

Aberaman first became an electoral ward in the late nineteenth century with the formation of [[Glamorgan County Council]]. Aberaman was also one of the five electoral wards of the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]] from its formation in 1894. The other wards were [[Aberdare Town (electoral ward)|Aberdare Town]], Blaengwawr, [[Gadlys (electoral ward)|Gadlys]] and [[Llwydcoed (electoral ward)|Llwydcoed]].

==History 1889-1914==
Representation of the ward in the 1890s was dominated by supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] although elections were often not fought on political lines and the local influence and standing of individual candidates was an important factor.  This enabled [[Edmund Mills Hann]], a prominent figure in the [[Powell Duffryn]] company, although unsuccessful at county level in 1889, to hold a seat on the Aberdare UDC for most of this period. Significantly he continued to hold a seat at Aberaman after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] captured several of the district seats in the early years of the new century. One of the most significant contests was that in 1903 (see below) for the Aberdare UDC when William Rees, a Labour candidate and deacon, unseated [[Thomas Humphreys (Baptist minister)|Thomas Humphreys]], minister of [[Seion, Cwmaman]].
 
===Glamorgan County Council 1889-1914===
In [[1889 Glamorgan County Council election|1889]], Thomas Philip White was elected as [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] member for Aberaman, defeating [[Edmund Mills Hann]]. This contest was widely reported and was a significant victory for a local tradesman, T.P. White, over a leading colliery official who later became a prominent figure in the South Wales and Monmouthshire Coalowners' Association. White had been chosen as Liberal candidate after a public meeting at [[Saron, Aberaman|Saron Chapel, Aberaman]]. In a letter to the press he referred to pressure from colliery officials and sought to re-assure the electors that there was a secret ballot.<ref name="TG 13-12-88 TPW letter">{{cite news|title=Aberdar.
