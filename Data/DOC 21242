==Groove Camp==

Initiated in 2013, Groove Camp,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ulizalinks.co.ke/gospel-artists-time-go-camping-groove-awards |newspaper=[[The Star (Kenya)|The Star]] |date=March 31, 2014 |title=Groove Camp: Time for you to go camping with groove awards}}</ref> a 3-day annual forum, unites, equips and raises the standards of gospel musicians and gatekeepers by equipping them with relevant skills to improve their craft and ministry. The camp draws more than 150 artists and 15 facilitators who tackle issues concerning the music ministry and industry.

The second Annual Groove Camp was held in April 2014 and featured new and seasoned gospel artists, many of whom were named nominees of the 2014 Groove Awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://oygkmagazine.com/complete-list-2014-groove-awards-nominees |newspaper=[[The Star (Kenya)|The Star]] |date=May 1, 2014 |title=Nominees: Complete List of 2014 Groove Awards Nominees}}</ref> Borrowing from the Groove Awards 2014 theme, 'Let Your Light Shine' (LYLS), derived from [[Matthew 5:16]], the camp's purpose was to ignite in the hearts and minds of artists, a conversation that will keep burning throughout the year.
