* ... that the mass shooting in the '''[[Pińsk Ghetto]]''' was the second largest [[Final Solution|anti-Jewish operation]] in a single settlement ''(map pictured)'' to that particular date after [[Babi Yar]] during [[the Holocaust]]?

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] It's  a nice new article. Maybe I'm missing something, but I couldn't find any mention of Pinsk in reference 6 (Lower 2007), which is supposed to support the hook. Also, I find the hook a bit confusing. If the Pinsk and Babi Yar shootings are only surpassed by Lublin, why not just say the Pinsk shooting was the third largest during the Holocaust? -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 06:10, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
:: {{done}}. Sorry for taking so long, [[User:Zanhe]]. I was not aware of your comment for a week, because I missed it somehow on my Watchlist when you left it here without a ping (I have almost 3,000 pages on it). I learned about your question only thanks to a note from [[User:Hamiltonstone]] for which I am forever grateful. All your points have been addressed. I have added a new section called Footnotes and explained my sources for the hook in detail. All best, [[User:Poeticbent|<font face="Papyrus" color="darkblue"><b>Poeticbent</b></font>]] [[User_talk:Poeticbent|<font style="font-size:7.0pt;color:#FFFFFF;font-weight:bold;background:#FF88AF;border:1px solid #DF2929;padding:0.0em 0.2em;">talk</font>]] 04:25, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
