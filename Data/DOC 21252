This is the real stuff."<ref name=city/>

In 1984, Johns relocated to Austin, Texas, to join the band [[The LeRoi Brothers]].<ref name=trib/> In Austin, Johns performed on the 1985 compilation album, ''Trash, Twang and Thunder'' by several Austin guitarists who styled themselves as Big Guitars From Texas; the album earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for rock-instrumental music.<ref name=trib/>

In 1985, Johns re-formed the H-Bombs in Austin and continued as its leader.<ref name=city/> Johns and the H-Bombs played together for several years thereafter, becoming known for their eclectic repertoire, summarized by one reviewer as "cajun, rockabilly, punk, surf, blues, country – even spaghetti Western soundtrack music."<ref name=austin/>

In the mid 1990s, Johns began to suffer alcohol-related and other health problems and stopped playing regularly in 1998, but continued to write and record music until his death.<ref name=austin/>

Johns  died on March 11, 2017, from complications following surgery, in Austin, Texas.<ref name=died/>
