He reportedly married Isabella Lee (1730-1801) in 1750, however no original records have been found. Isabella's will of 1801 which followed the death of her husband, identifies her as "a relic of George Matthews."<ref name="B: 110, no 545">{{cite book|title=Franklin County Wil Book|date=August 17, 1801|publisher=Pennsylvania State Archives|location=Harrisburg PA}}</ref> They had twelve children during their marriage:  Abigail (Josiah Nash); George, Jr.; John; Margaret (John Wilkerson); James (Prudence Gordon); Jean (Isaac Eaton); Isabella (Casper Taylor); William George; Samuel; Mary (Thomas Fleming); Agnes; Elizabeth (Robert Walker).<ref>{{cite book|last=Fendrick|first=Virginia Shannon|title=American Revoluitonary Soldiers of Franklin County Pennsylvania|date=n.d.|publisher=Chambersburg:  Daughters of the American Revolution, Franklin County Chapter|page=187}}</ref>
