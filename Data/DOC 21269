The '''Golden Age of Trucking Museum''' is a defunct [[Road_transport#Trucking_and_hauling|trucking museum]] in [[Middlebury, Connecticut]], United States. Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, it was non-profit organization dedicated to trucking that focused on trucks of the 1950s. The museum was dedicated on September 23, 2002 and housed in a 32,000 square foot building. It featured a collection of historic and antique vehicles including the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1928 [[Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company]] dump truck. Among the trucks in the museum were [[Mack Trucks]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] and [[Autocar Company]] trucks, including a 1963 [[Mack B61]] motivated Guerrera to found the museum. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum also featured a collection of toy trucks, hats, state license plates and images relating to trucking. Throughout its entire operation, the museum ran a deficit and it closed after a 2009 fund raising campaign failed. The museum's final day of operation was on July 20, 2010. The economic impact of the museums closure was expected to be low, but according to Steven Frischling of the ''[[Boston Globe]]''. the Golden Age of Trucking Museum made its mark on the auto world.

== History ==
Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of Trucking Museum was a non-profit organization dedicated to trucking. The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation trucking company. Originally, a collection of trucks were restored and stored in barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum was opened to bring the collection under a single roof.<ref name="info">{{cite web | url=http://www.truckinginfo.com/channel/aftermarket/news/story/2010/07/connecticut-truck-museum-says-farewell.aspx | title=Connecticut Truck Museum Says Farewell | publisher=Trucking Info | date=15 July 2010 | accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> After the property for the museum was purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer.<ref name="hoon">{{cite web | url=http://hooniverse.com/2010/03/23/roadside-discoveries-the-golden-age-of-trucking-museum-a-great-place-to-discover-classic-trucks/ | title=Roadside Discoveries: The Golden Age of Trucking Museum; A Great Place to Discover Classic Trucks. | publisher=Hooniverse | date=23 March 2010 | accessdate=1 May 2014 | author=Brennan, Jim}}</ref> In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event.

The museum never was able to sustain itself through its visitors and it ran a deficit throughout its entire operation; the museums operating costs that were covered by Frances Guerrera.<ref name="trucker1" /> In 2009, a $100,000 funding raising campaign was undertaken, but it only resulted in a total of $20,000 being raised prior to July 2010. On July 6, 2010, the board of directors came to the conclusion to close the museum.

== Impact ==
Throughout its operation, the Golden Age of Trucking Museum was one of two trucking museums in Connecticut. Steven Frischling of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' wrote, "It may seem strange that two trucking museums would be located in the same state, but [t]he [[Haul of Fame]] truck museum and [t]he Golden Age of Trucking Museum make their individual marks on the auto world."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/travel/explorene/connecticut/galleries/trucking_museums/ | title=Trucking museums in Connecticut | publisher=Boston.com | accessdate=1 May 2014 | author=Frischling, Steven}}</ref> The economic impact of the museum's closure was not expected to be large according to John Cookson, co-chairman of Economic and Industrial Development Commission. Janet Serra, the director for the Western Connecticut Convention and Visitor's Bureau, said the effect of closure would not be immediate, but noted it could impact tourism and area hotels.<ref name="trucker1">{{cite web | url=https://www.thetrucker.com/News/Stories/2010/7/21/Connecticuttruckingmuseumfindsitsunabletokeepon.aspx | title=Connecticut trucking museum finds it's unable to keep on | publisher=thetrucker.com | date=21 July 2010 | accessdate=1 May 2014 | author=O'Rourke, Matthew}}</ref>
