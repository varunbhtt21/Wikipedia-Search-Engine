'''SS ''Verona''''' was an Italian passenger steamer, built in 1908 by [[Workman, Clark and Company]] in Belfast, and operated by the Navigazione Generale Italiana, of [[Genoa]]. {{SS|Ancona||6}} was her sister ship.

On 11 May 1918, the ship left [[Messina]] for [[Tripoli]] with on board some 3,000 soldiers, most of them deserters which were sent to a detention camp in the Italian colony of Libya.

She was torpedoed by German submarine {{SMU|UC-52||2}}, under the command of [[Kapitänleutnant]] Hellmuth von Doemming off [[Cape Peloro]] at {{coord|37|04|N|16|19|E|display=title,inline}}. The ship sank within 25 minutes, but many soldiers were saved because land was relatively close and several ships came to their rescue. Still around 880 lives were lost.
