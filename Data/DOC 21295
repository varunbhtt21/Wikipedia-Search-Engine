No sources are given that this is an actual genre.  Would "men with guns", "girls with knives", etc, be genres, too? [[User:331dot|331dot]] ([[User talk:331dot|talk]]) 16:07, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

I further don't think the situation has improved any in the about two years since this was nominated previously. [[User:331dot|331dot]] ([[User talk:331dot|talk]]) 16:08, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''.  Yes, it's a real genre: [http://www.cleveland.com/movies/index.ssf/2013/08/25_movies_with_bad_girls_and_b.html], [http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=139710], [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,284510,00.html], [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306871,00.html], [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/03/zack-snyder-superman-sucker-punch-amy-adams.html], [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/07/entertainment/ca-chute7].  I'm ambivalent about keeping the article.  If people need a merge target, I would suggest [[exploitation film]], where it can probably be summed up in two sentences.

:And there are more. Needing editorial attention is rarely cause to delete a notable topic. We do well to not [[User:331dot|personally]] [[WP:POV|declare]] a sourcable genre non-existent when so many actual sources treat it as an actual genre.

:I did review the article first; I started this page after looking at [[Talk:Girls with guns|the talk page]]. I did not "declare a sourceable genre non-existent", I stated that more sources were needed and not given in two years.  Something should be done. [[User:331dot|331dot]] ([[User talk:331dot|talk]]) 10:51, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' As I pointed out in the previous AFD [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Girls_with_guns] reliable sources refer to this as a genre.  And whether you believe the article has improved or not since last time, is not a valid reason to delete.  Obviously this is a real thing, and it gets ample coverage.

:An article with much unsourced content little improved in two years is a valid reason to do something, it shouldn't languish unnecessarily.  Adding the sources you put on this page to the article would be an excellent start. As such I '''withdraw''' my proposal. [[User:331dot|331dot]] ([[User talk:331dot|talk]]) 10:51, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
