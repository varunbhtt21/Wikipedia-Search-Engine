'''Belmont Filmhouse''' is an arts cinema on [[Belmont Street (Aberdeen)|Belmont Street]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] which shows a mixture of films that generally would not be shown in a chain cinema and mainstream films. The cinema is the property of [[Aberdeen City Council]], and it is run by the [[Centre for the Moving Image]].

==History==
What is now Belmont Filmhouse was built in 1896 as a [[trades hall]]. The first film was shown on the premises in 1898, and featured footage of [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Balmoral Castle]], establishing a tradition of hosting visiting cinema shows. In 1910, it turned to permanent film as the Coliseum, and was refurbished and reopened as the New Kinema in 1921.<ref name="STV12">{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/north/204438-iconic-independant-cinema-the-belmont-is-bought-over-by-cineworld/|title='Business as usual' for iconic Belmont cinema after takeover|last=Pease|first=Victoria|date=6 December 2012|publisher=STV News|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref>

After another refurbishment in 1935, it was renamed the Belmont Cinema. It closed in 1953, and the building was converted into a warehouse. It reopened under lease to [[Picturehouse Cinemas]] as the Belmont Picturehouse in September 2000, after a major refurbishment by Aberdeen City Council with assistance from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and [[Scottish Screen]]. 

After some turmoil and uncertainty, the lease for exploitation on the Belmont to Picturehouse had been extended in April 2011 for a further ten years.<ref>http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/CouncilNews/ci_cns/pr_belmontdeal_260411.asp</ref> However, with the purchase of Picturehouse Cinemas by [[Cineworld]],<ref name="STV12"/> the company were forced to sell the Belmont due to a ruling by the [[Competition Commission]] that it had created unfair competition in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/north/242349-cineworld-to-sell-belmont-picturehouse-in-aberdeen-over-price-fears/|title='Business as usual' for iconic Belmont cinema after takeover|date=8 October 2013|publisher=STV News|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> In April 2014, [[Centre for the Moving Image]] took over the lease and renamed the premises Belmont Filmhouse as a sister cinema to the [[Edinburgh Filmhouse]].
