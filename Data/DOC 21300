*'''Delete''': Material for the university intranet perhaps, but not an encyclopaedia. Non-[[:WP:GNG|notable]]. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 18:06, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''.  Not a generally notable topic. Wikipedia is not a guide to student life in the state of Georgia. Possibly '''salt''' since this has been recreated several times.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 10:25, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
