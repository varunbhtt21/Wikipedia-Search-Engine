'''Etna''' is a fictional character who appears in the ''[[Disgaea]]'' series of video games. First appearing as one of the main characters in the series's first entry, ''[[Disgaea: Hour of Darkness]]'' in 2003, she has appeared in most subsequent entries in either lead or supporting roles, and had many cameo appearances across other [[Nippon Ichi Software]] video games.

==Concept and creation==
''Disgaea'' artist [[Takehito Harada]] described her as a "scheming, disrespectful [[sidekick]]." He stated, "I represented Etna's personality by the unbalance between her youthful body style and her sexy outfit. The producers told me to create her as a spiteful attendant, and it was pretty easy. Other then her details the initial design has not changed."<ref>{{cite web |title=In Character: The Art of Takahito Harada |url=http://www.1up.com/features/in-character_2 |work=[[1UP.com]] |last=Maragos |first=Nich |date=2004-08-27 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> [[NIS America]] PR and marketing manager Nao Zook felt that Etna and the Prinnies are among the "standouts" of ''[[Cross Edge]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cross Edge Interview |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/other/ps3/xedge/xedgeinterview.html |work=RPGamer |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> Zook also cited Etna as among his favourite characters in the crossover game ''Trinity Universe''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trinity Universe Interview |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/other/ps3/trinityu/trinityuint.html |work=RPGamer |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>

==Appearances==
===''Disgaea: Hour of Darkness''===
Etna first appears in the [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''[[Disgaea: Hour of Darkness]]''. Etna is the leader of the [[Prinny]] squad, and one of the few vassals who remain in the Overlord's Castle after King Krichevskoy's death. In the beginning, she attempts to wake up Laharl through 'unique' methods (most of which involved guns). From then on, Etna becomes Laharl's closest vassal, though not necessarily most trustworthy vassal, aiding him in his rise to power.  She is the only vassal from Laharl's original servants who goes out on the battlefield for him. Etna often acts carefree and tends to be rather snarky towards Laharl and Flonne, but is also very devious and underhanded. Often it is hard to tell for whom she really is working. She holds deep respect and loyalty towards King Krichevskoy, Laharl's father. When it comes to her Prinnies, however, she tends to be rather abusive towards them, especially in later games. Etna is often known for ending an episode with a preview of the next episode, all of which have her in the starring role. Often these previews parody famous TV shows, anime, or video games with the other characters making side comments. These previews tend to be silly and rarely have anything to do with the next episode. In both the Normal and Bad Endings, Laharl gives up his position as Overlord to Etna before either killing himself or running away. In the good ending, she remains as his vassal.

====Remakes and ''"Etna Mode"''====
The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and [[Nintendo DS|DS]] ports of ''Disgaea'' feature a new mode called "Etna Mode", where she accidentally kills Laharl in the beginning of the story and then continues her own story, where she disguises a Prinny as Laharl to trick people into thinking that he was still alive. The mode elaborates on her past and her relationship with King Krichevskoy.

===''Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories''===
She appears in the sequel ''[[Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories]]'', where she quits her position as Laharl's vassal after a fight with him and becomes a Demon Lord with her Prinny Squad. She travels to Veldime, hoping to eliminate Overlord Zenon and runs into Adell and his party in the process. She later gives Adell a fake "Demon Lord's Nail" and is accidentally summoned by his mother. The failed summon greatly weakens her, and in order to regain her former power she deigns to join up with the player's party. She returns to Laharl as his vassal by the end of the game.

===''Disgaea: Infinite''===
The game ''[[Disgaea Infinite]]'' features an ending where Etna (under the influence of the main character Prinny) allows Laharl to steal/take the Super Rare Pudding. He promptly eats it, to which he exclaims that the pudding is extremely delicious. She recovers, and gets into a fight with him about it and quits.

===''Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice''===
In ''[[Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice]]'', Etna appears alongside Laharl and Flonne and assumes the legendary Overlord they are looking for is the protagonist Mao, who believes that they are the legendary Overlords.

===''Disgaea 4: Promise Unforgotten''===
In ''[[Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten]]'' she appears in the post-game to become president and make the stars her servants.

===''Disgaea D2: Brighter Darkness''===
She appears in ''[[Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness]]'', the fifth game in the series which takes place at least several{{how many|date=July 2017}} months before ''Disgaea 2'',{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} where she is once again one of the main playable characters and discovers that she has an older brother named Xenolith, the game's antagonist.

===''Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance'' ===
''Disgaea 5'' contains side-story and character [[downloadable content]] (DLC) from past entries in the series; Etna appears in the story DLC related to ''Disgaea: Hour of Darkness'' and ''Disgaea D2'', and as a playable character.<ref>https://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/03/29/disgaea-5-digs-into-franchise-history-for-dlc-character-packs/</ref>

===''Prinny'' spinoff series===
Etna appears in the spin-off PSP game ''[[Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?]]'', where she sends her Prinny Squad to recover her Ultra Dessert and appears as an extra [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] later in the game. The sequel ''[[Prinny 2: Dawn of Operation Panties, Dood!]]'' has her dispatch her Prinny Squad to recover a stolen pair of panties.
