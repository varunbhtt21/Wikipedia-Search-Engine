{{Nihongo|'''''Zatoichi's Cane Sword'''''|座頭市鉄火旅|Zatōichi tekka-tabi}} is a 1967 Japanese ''[[chambara]]'' film directed by [[Kimiyoshi Yasuda]] and starring [[Shintaro Katsu]] as the blind masseur [[Zatoichi]]. It was originally released by the [[Daiei Film|Daiei Motion Picture Company]] (later acquired by [[Kadokawa Pictures]]).

''Zatoichi's Cane Sword'' is the fifteenth episode in the 26-part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi.

==Plot==
While travelling Zatoichi comes across a dying gangster boss called Shotaro. In a nearby town that has been overrun by gang belonging
to Boss Iwagoro, Zatoichi disturbes the gangsters' gambling scam and hides away with the town's blacksmith Senzo.
Senzo turns out to be the apprentice to the master swordsmith who forged Zatoichi's [[cane sword]]. 
Senzo spots a crack in the blade and warns that it will snap after one more kill.

At the inn where Zatoichi takes a job as a masseur, the innkeeper Gembei has taken in Shotaro's daughter Shizu and son Seikichi. 
Shizu wants her brother to take their father's place as the new boss and keep the evil Boss Iwagoro from taking over, but the 
scholarly Seikichi has no interest in the family business. During his stay at the inn Zatoichi discovers Iwagoro is in cahoots
with a corrupt government official, Inspector Kuwayama.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
[[Roger Greenspun]], in a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that "[w]here it is quiet enough to allow Ichi his peaceful idiocyncrasies, ''Zato Ichi's Cane Sword'' is a pleasantly modest film, an amiable contrast to the fateful solemnities of the [[Toshiro Mifune]] samurai dramas. Ichi's very invulnerability makes for a certain relaxation, a few songs, a little buffoonery, and much of it to the good."<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Greenspun|first=Roger|title=Film: Blind Swordsman:Hero of 'Zato Ichi' Can Overcome Any Odds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E0D91E3FEF34BC4F52DFBE66838A669EDE|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 August 1971|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000411/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E0D91E3FEF34BC4F52DFBE66838A669EDE|archive-date=2014-05-02|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref>
