== Early life and training ==

Mulvany was born in Diralagh, [[County Meath]], Ireland c. 1839 to tenant farmers, Francis Lee and Thomas Mulvany.<ref>Bishop Thomas Mulvany genealogy</ref>  When he immigrated to New York City in 1851 at the age of 12,<ref>Tuite’s Gaelic American 3 part series in March/April 1909</ref> he was old enough to have witnessed and grasped the horrors of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]].<ref>Cusack, Danny. The Great Famine in County Meath. Meath County Council,  Ireland, 1995</ref>  He worked as a tow boy on the [[Erie Canal]] and came to the attention of Professor Juan Wandersford at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York City.<ref>Brooklyn Star 17 Oct. 1900</ref>  In 1859 Mulvany enrolled in classes there.<ref>National Academy of Design Registry</ref> before he went to Washington, D.C. to work for [[Mathew Brady]] by 1863.<ref>Diary of Horatio Nelson Taft, 1861-1865.

Mulvany never served in the army but may have worked as a sketch artist for a Chicago newspaper.<ref>Tuite 6 March 1909</ref>  Mulvany’s later Civil War paintings were praised for their realism  - paintings such as ''Sheridan’s Ride at Winchester'', 1896<ref>'Sheridan’s Famous Ride’ ''Baltimore American'' 5 December 1896,‘Sheridan’s Ride on Canvas’, ''Washington Post'', 5 December 1896, ''Chicago Inter Ocean'' 6 Dec. 1896</ref> ''McPherson and Revenge'', 1889,<ref>‘McPherson and Revenge’ ''Chicago Citizen'', 7 April 1888, ''Murphysboro American'', 14 Aug 2008,</ref> ''Battle of Shiloh''<ref>Gateway Heritage Magazine Index 10</ref> and ''The Death of General Mulligan''.<ref>''New York Herald'' 22 Nov. 1897</ref>

== Career beginnings ==

Over the next five years Mulvany worked in Eldon, Iowa; St Louis, Missouri; Denver, Colorado; and Louisville, Kentucky, painting portraits and [[Western (genre)|western genre]] pictures. In 1876 he exhibited ''Preliminary Trial of a Horsethief'' in New York City.  The painting, reportedly sold for $5000, won him national recognition and a reputation as a Western painter.<ref>Taft</ref>  Other western-themed works include ''Lynch Law – Comrade’s Appeal'' 1877,<ref>National Academy of Design 1877 #461</ref> ''Scouts of the Yellowstone'', 1877<ref>"Cincinnati Enquirer" 10 Nov. 1878</ref> and ''Back to the Wigwam'' 1881.<ref>Index of American Paintings, Smithsonian Institution #03860423 pg.5328</ref>

The painting of ''Preliminary Trial of a Horsethief'' was painted near Oskaloosa, Iowa.  The Magistrate in this trial, seated in the center of the picture, is John F. Cartwright (1827-1893), my Second Great Grandfather.  The Des Moines Register published this picture in their Sunday edition in about 1954.

=="Custer's Last Rally"==
In 1876 when news of General George Custer’s fatal defeat by the Sioux Indians at the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]] reached the East, Mulvany immediately recognized the significance of this event and headed west to Montana to capture it on canvas.<ref>''Omaha Daily Bee'' "The Last Rally of Custer" 30 Nov. 1890</ref> Over the next four years, he made two trips to the battle site and set up a studio in Cincinnati, Salida, Denver and then in Kansas City.,<ref>''Cincinnati Enquirer'' 10 Nov. 1878, ''Kansas City Daily Journal'' 2 March 1881, ''Denver Daily Tribune'' 23 Feb. 18879</ref> Mulvany’s large masterpiece, the 11ftx20ft ''Custer’s Last Rally'', 1881, began its seventeen-year coast-to-coast tour of the country before [[H. J. Heinz II|H. J. Heinz]] took over ownership in 1898.<ref>letter to Mulvany from Goodyear Rubber Hose and Packing Co. 21 Nov, 1898 in the Alice Muldoon Garvey Collection and Stenzel, Franz & Kathryn, Research Files for Unpublished book on western art, Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, CT. Don Russell includes a very similar story about the sale of Cassily Adam’s painting to Anheuser-Busch pg. 33 in ‘Custer’s Last’.</ref>

== "Aughrim" ==

Around 1882, Mulvany secured a commission from the Irish Club of Chicago<ref>''Bradfore Era'', 3 July 1888</ref> to paint the [[Battle of Aughrim]] - a tragic loss for the Irish in 1691.  John began preliminary sketches in Ireland in 1882 and finished the piece in 1885.<ref>Dublin University Review August 1885 and ''The Nation'' 4 July 1885</ref> This painting was presumed lost until it was offered for sale on [[eBay]] in 2010 by a dealer who thought it represented an American battle scene, purchased by an Irish art gallery, exhibited in Dublin and subsequently sold.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Clery|first1=Conor|title=Long-lost painting found on eBay|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/ireland/101012/battle-of-aughrim-john-mulvany|accessdate=9 January 2015|publisher=Global Post|date=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

== Politics ==

Mulvany was a lifelong member of the Irish secret society, [[Clan na Gael]],<ref>''Kentucky Irish-American'' May 1906</ref> whose aim was Irish freedom from England.  He narrowly escaped imprisonment by English authorities while researching uniforms for his ''Aughrim'' painting at the Tower of London just days before it was bombed in the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]] in 1885.<ref>John Mulvany, Great Irish Painter, "Gaelic American" 3 April 1909</ref> His involvement in internecine fighting within the Chicago branch in 1886 cost him the Aughrim commission<ref>Tuite 1909 and 2010 Gorry Gallery Catalog</ref> and after his friend, Dr. Patrick Henry Cronin, was murdered in 1889 over financial irregularities with this same branch, Mulvany left Chicago for the west.<ref>''Salida Daily Mail'' 15 July 1890 and ''Denver Republican'' 23 Sept, 1890</ref>   He married Mrs. Ellen Welch in 1890.<ref>Marriage certificate and ''Omaha Daily Bee'' 28 Dec. 1890</ref> and was divorced two years later in CO.<ref>''Rocky Mt News'' 15 Nov. 1891 and 1 July 1892</ref> He also had a romantic involvement with Lucy Deere,<ref>Wealth and Love Eluded Aging Sacramentan, So She Lives Alone with Memories, ''Sacramento Union'', 31 Oct 1943</ref> whom he met c. 1880 and contacted before his death in 1906.<ref>"Model at Art Academy here was Cause of Noted Painter’s Suicide" undated Colorado Springs newspaper 1924</ref>

==Brooklyn, New York years==
In 1897, at the age of 58, Mulvany finally settled in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] area of Brooklyn, New York, where he remained the rest of his life.<ref>Alice Muldoon Garvey Collection. address as 381 Leonard St.</ref> with a studio at 133 Greenpoint Ave.<ref>''Brooklyn Eagle'' 22 May 1906</ref> He continued his artistic career painting six known major works,<ref>''The Striker'' 1904, ''NY Times'' 23 May 1906, ''The Anarchists'' 1904, ''NY Sun'' 23 May 1906, ''Alice Muldoon’s Horse'', ''Boccocio'' 8 Jan 1903 JM letter to MacBeth Gallery, ''The Boer Scouts'',  ''NY Sun'' 23 May 1906 and British Artists & War by Peter Harrington, 1993</ref> as well as a duplicate of ''Custer’s Last Rally'',<ref>''Greenpoint Star'' 17 Oct, 1900</ref>  seeking exhibition opportunities,<ref>letter to Lieber Co of 5 Oct. 1904 and Mac Beth Gallery Jan 1903 Archives of American Art,</ref> painting portraits,<ref>''New York Times'' 23, May 1906</ref> and even sketching up until two weeks before his death.<ref>''Brooklyn Star'' obit 23 May 1906</ref>

Mulvany died by drowning in early May 1906; the press declared it a suicide.<ref>‘Eccentric Artist a Suicide’, '' New York Sun'', 23 May 1906,  'Painter of ‘Last Rally’ drowned in East River…a waif…suicide…a drunken derelict, ''New York Times'', 23 May 1906.</ref>    He was 66 years old, suffering from throat cancer, a fatal disease at the time,<ref>Alice Muldoon Garvey Collection Envelope from Dr Dwyer leading throat specialists and Brooklyn Eagle 22 May 1906</ref> vertigo<ref>Gaelic American 2 June 1906</ref> and possible effects of alcoholism.  He is buried in [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]], Queens, New York.<ref>cemetery records and ''Greenpoint Star'' 26 May 1906</ref>

Mulvany’s contributions are several. He not only influenced [[William Merritt Chase]]<ref>Roff, K. Metcalf, The Life and Art of William Merrit Chase, New York 1917</ref> and [[Frederick Remington]],<ref>"Kansas City, Cradle of Remington’s Art", ''Kansas City Star'', 3 May 1925</ref>  he also brought an international perspective to American Western Art. In addition, his life reflects a broader Irish immigrant experience than typically recorded. Other noteworthy paintings include ''Love's Mirror'' and ''The Old Professor''.<ref>Taft</ref> Much of his work is unlocated.
