==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The church is built in brick, with a front of [[sandstone]] [[ashlar]] and a [[slate]] roof.  It has a rectangular plan, is in two storeys, and is sited at right angles to the street.  The symmetrical entrance front faces east and contains a giant round-headed arch carried on two pairs of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.  The surround of the arch is [[molding (decorative)|moulded]], and above it is a moulded [[dentil]]led [[gable]].  At the top of the columns are moulded [[cornice]]s, which are carried out over the lateral [[bay (architecture)|bays]].  These bays contain two round-headed windows with [[Impost (architecture)|imposts]] and [[keystone (architecture)|keystones]], one in each storey.  The lower windows are partly blocked with notice boards, and the upper windows contain circular geometric glazing.<ref name=nhl/> Under the arch, steps lead up to a recessed porch with doorways and a [[Venetian window]].<ref name=pev/> Along the sides of the church are two tiers of round-headed windows.  At the rear of the church is a two-storey extension with gabled porches and round-headed doorways with [[fanlight]]s.<ref name=nhl/>

Inside the church is a horseshoe-shaped gallery carried on thin [[cast iron]] columns with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] caps,<ref name=pev/> and with a foliated [[balustrade]].<ref name=nhl/> The ceiling is [[coffer]]ed with glazed panels in the centre.<ref name=pev/> The original [[pipe organ]] was built by [[Gray and Davison]] and had two [[manual (music)|manuals]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=N10720| title = Lancashire Preston, Methodist Church, Lune Street (N10720)| accessdate = 1 May 2014| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref> This was replaced at an unknown date by a three-manual organ built by W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Richardson.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=N10717| title = Lancashire Preston, Methodist Church, Lune Street (N10717)| accessdate = 1 May 2014| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>
