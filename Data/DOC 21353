* '''[[Eurasian Nuthatch]]''' <small>''([[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Eurasian Nuthatch/archive1|nominated]] by [[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]])''</small> "The Eurasian nuthatch or wood nuthatch (''Sitta europaea'') is a small passerine bird found throughout temperate Asia and in Europe, where it is often referred to just as the nuthatch. Like other nuthatches, it is a short-tailed bird with a long bill, blue-grey upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal bird with a repeated loud dwip call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in the west of the range have orange-buff underparts and a white throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, and those in the Far East have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat."

Originally the name for the aircraft modification project for the B-29 Superfortress bomber to enable it to drop an atomic weapon, Silverplate eventually came to identify the training and operational aspects of the program as well. The original directive for the project had as its subject line "Silver Plated Project" but continued usage of the term shortened it to "Silverplate"."
