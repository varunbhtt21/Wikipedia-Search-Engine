<s>This almost comes across as a personal webspace (even if the creator is a different name), it mentions that she is successful in her business, but is it enough for Wikipedia? I'm not sure if this should stay or not (I'm thinking either delete or redirect to somewhere else-the only page I could find her on Wikipedia was this one [[Jonathan Potter]].)
So possibly a merge even? also this does read as an advertisement [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:10, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</s>'''Withdrawn by nominator'''-due to me not being able to find that much and it being tagged as an ad and my mistake-withdrawing now.[[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 00:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per [[WP:PROF#C1]]. According to Google scholar, she has ten publications with over 100 citations each, well over the threshold for that notability criterion. And our article on her appears to be written neutrally and factually, and the wording in the nomination about "her business" is highly misleading: she is an academic, not a businesswoman. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 18:40, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-The page was making me think she was a psychologist with a PHD, which there are quite a few of. I also could only find one other article on here with a reference on her. I was iffy about putting the AFD to be honest, but I guess it was better to be safe then sorry. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:43, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Another comment'''-I should add that I did see how it was tagged as such so I thought it might be a good idea to put it there. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:44, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Clear pass of [[WP:Prof]]. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 22:55, 1 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Comment'''-I think I might withdraw this due to me misunderstanding what this was-plus it had an advertisement tag on it making me think it would go under afd. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:01, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
