Looks like he might of been successful in live theater in the early 20th century-yet I can find very few sources about him. Maybe a merge or a userfy if not deleted.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:18, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''-Ha thanks, I guess since I was only searching in English has something to do with it. Maybe a userfy would be nice. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:58, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
