'''Jeffrey Moore''' is a [[Canadian writer]], translator and educator currently living in [[Val-Morin]] in the Quebec Laurentians.  Moore was born in [[Montreal]], and educated at the [[University of Toronto]], BA, the [[Sorbonne]] and the [[University of Ottawa]], MA.

== Novels ==

Moore's first novel, ''[[Prisoner in a Red-Rose Chain]]''<ref>Moore, Jeffrey.  ''Prisoner in a Red-Rose Chain''. Saskatoon:  Thistledown Press, 1999.</ref> won the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for Best First Book in 2000.

Moore's second novel, ''The Memory Artists'',<ref>Moore, Jeffrey.  ''The Memory Artists''. New York:  Saint Martin's Griffin, 2006.</ref> (published 2004 by Viking, 19 translations) won the Canadian Authors Association Prize for fiction in 2005. It follows Noel Burun, a psychology graduate student with [[synaesthesia]] and [[hypermnesia]], as he sets out with three equally eccentric friends to find a wonder-drug cure for his mother's early-onset Alzheimer's. "Moore explores every facet of memory," according to Joanne Wilkinson in ''Booklist'', "as both a burden and a blessing--in this delightful and inspired story."<ref>Wilkinson, Joanne. "review of The Memory Artists." ''Booklist''. 1 February 2006: 30.</ref> In the ''New York Times Book Review'', Michael J. Agovino described ''The Memory Artists'' as "a rich novel, erudite and funny, as much about brain chemistry, the wellness industry and poetry as it is about memory." Agovino concludes that "''The Memory Artists'' is a pleasure to read; it's strangely uplifting to spend time with these flawed but humane characters." <ref>Agovino, Michael J. "review of ''The Memory Artists''." [[New York Times Book Review]]. 14 May 2006: 14.</ref>

In Moore's third novel, ''The Extinction Club'',<ref>Moore, Jeffrey.  ''The Extinction Club''. New York:  Arcade, 2013.</ref> (published 2010 by Penguin, 12 translations), Nile Nightingale is on the lam from false charges of child abduction pressed against him by his ex-girlfriend in [[New Jersey]]. When he attempts to hole up in an abandoned church in the Laurentians, he encounters the beaten and bloodied Céleste, a fourteen-year-old, animal-rights activist who has been squatting there. Recently orphaned of her last living relative, her grandmother, Céleste turns to Nile for her survival and to continue her battle against poachers ready to hunt the rare North American cougar to extinction.  "At its best, ''The Extinction Club'' is gripping and incisive," according to the Globe and Mail review by  Darryl Whetter, who also credits the novel with integrating "philosophical inquiries into violence and predation with an undeniably dynamic plot."<ref>Whetter, Darryl. "review of The Extinction Club/ [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/review-the-extinction-club-by-jeffrey-moore/article1388658/ Saved from extinction] ."  ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' 28 July 2010.</ref>

== Academic Reception ==

Academic treatment of Moore's work, thus far, has focussed on its relation to Quebec literature and, more specifically, to [[English-speaking Quebecer|Anglo-Quebec]] literature.  For example, in his essay "Is There an Anglo-Québécois Literature?" Gregory J. Reid notes that "Moore's ''Prisoner in a Red-Rose Chain'' includes French-speaking characters and, therefore, code shifting" and that the novel problematizes "the minority status of English in Quebec [. . .] through exaggeration and comic irony rather than earnest denial."<ref>Reid, Gregory.  "Is There an Anglo-Québécois Literature?" Essays on Canadian Writing 84 (2009): 73.</ref> In "A Context for Conversation?  Reading Jeffrey Moore’s ''The Memory Artists'' as Anglo-Quebec Literature," Patrick Coleman compares the novel to [[Robert Majzels]]' ''Hellman's Scrapbook'' and [[Jacques Godbout]]'s ''Les Têtes à Papineau'' and concludes that "Further comparative studies along these lines, in which a particular work is confronted with others from both different languages and literary traditions, would sharpen our understanding of the problematic relationship  between theme, style and location in [[English-speaking Quebecer|Anglo-Quebec]] literature."<ref>Coleman, Patrick. "A Context for Conversation?  [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/journal_of_canadian_studies/v046/46.3.coleman.html Reading Jeffrey Moore’s ''The Memory Artists''] as Anglo-Quebec Literature." Journal of Canadian Studies. 46.3: 219.</ref>  In "Jeffrey Moore’s ''The Memory Artists'':  Synaesthesia, Science and the Art of Memory," Marc André Fortin analyzes the novel in terms of the interplay between science and literature.<ref>Fortin, Marc André. "Jeffrey Moore’s [http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/SCL/article/view/20981 "The Memory Artists: Synaesthesia, Science and the Art of Memory.”] Studies in Canadian Literature (2012) 37.2: 32-53.</ref>
