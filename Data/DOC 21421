'''Wat Phra Phutthabat''' ({{Thai| วัดพระพุทธบาท}}) is a [[Buddhist]] temple in [[Saraburi]], [[Thailand]]. It is among the oldest Buddhist temples in Thailand. Its name means "temple of [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprint]]", because it contains a natural depression believed to be a [[Buddha footprint|footprint]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

==History==

Phra Phutthabat temple was built in 1624 (B.E. 2168) by [[King Songtham]] of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], after a hunter named Pram Bun found a large depression in the stone, resembling a huge [[Buddha footprint|footprint]], near Suwan Banpot Hill or Satchaphanthakhiri Hill. The hunter reported his find to the king, who ordered workers to build a temporary [[mondop]] to cover the [[Buddha footprint|footprint]]; this later became the  temple.

==Belief==
The [[Bunnoowaat sutra]] tells of the flight of the Buddha to the peak of [[Mount Suwanbanphot]], and of how he left his footprints.<ref>Thomas John Hudak (1988).

Some believe that worshiping the footprints, sprinkling water, or placing gold leaf on them will lead to the forgiveness of sin, success in life, or eternal happiness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phra Phutthabat Temple|url=http://templesinthailand.com/wat-phra-phutthabat/|publisher=info@TemplesInThailand|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>
