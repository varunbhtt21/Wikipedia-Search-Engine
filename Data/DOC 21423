The '''Tough Nut Mine''' is a silver mine established just prior to and just outside [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] in [[Cochise County]], [[Arizona]].  After an early period of operation that began in the late 19th century, the mine was closed and then reopened in the 1970s.

==Original Mine==
The mine came to be one of two big strikes by the Tombstone Gold and Silver Mining Company. On March 5, 1879, U.S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor Solon M. Allis finished laying out a new town site on a [[mesa]] named Goose Flats at {{convert|4539|ft}}, just above the Tough Nut mine. The area was large enough to hold a growing town{{r|minrec}} and was named "[[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]" after [[Ed Schieffelin]]'s initial mining claim. The shelters at Watervale were relocated to the new town site and a scattering of cabins and tents were quickly built for about 100 residents.{{r|minrec}}

In 1880, Al and Ed Schieffelin sold their two-thirds interest in the Tough Nut for $1 million each to [[investor|capitalists]] from Philadelphia, and sometime later Gird sold his one-third interest for the same amount.{{r|burns}} Al Schieffelin used a portion of his wealth to build Schieffelin Hall.{{r|mininghistory}}

It was rich in [[silver]] and [[lead]].  Secondary commodities were [[copper]], [[gold]], and [[zinc]].  Small amounts of [[cadmium]] were also produced.{{r|usgs1}}

==Present Mine==
Operations resumed in the 1970s, but from a different entrance. Modern production is primarily [[silver]], [[copper]], [[lead]], and [[zinc]], with smaller amounts of [[gold]] and [[vanadium]].  The minerals are found in [[limestone]] and [[diorite]] dating from the late [[cretaceous]] period.{{r|usgs2}}
