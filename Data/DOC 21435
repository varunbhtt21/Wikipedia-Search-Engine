It has been one year since my RfA and the community granted me some additional tools in my puttering around Wikipedia. It has been a very busy and exciting year for me personally which unfortunately took its toll on my time here on Wikipedia. As such it's taken me awhile to find my pace, or lack there of, and I am more or less at the understanding that my time here will come in waves as my availability comes and goes. That said, any feedback would be welcome for the bits of time I have spent thus far.

*Glad to see you're doing some protections - [[WP:RFPP]] is often a little backlogged. The most recent ones from April looked in order and align with what I'd have done.

*I can't find fault with what you've done so far, but what's up with testing the rights permission?  You've given rights to an individual for the reason of (testing) and it's a bit concerning to see that. What's the context behind that?

::{{u|ThisIsaTest}} is one of a few dozen account set up by the community specifically for testing. This account in particular is part of the [[Wikipedia:New admin|New Admin School]]. A quick look on the user page displays a notice that states the "''purpose is for test by administrators in applying blocks''". It's also tagged with various NAS links and markings. Additionally you can look at the user logs which show a few hundred tests by other sysops. In general, all of my initial sysop actions are part of this New Admin School which should be similar to other admins who have gone through the same process when you have review their actions. Hope this clarifies the typical pattern in actions most admins are expected to go through when they first are granted the tools.

::: Another secret bit that comes with experience. Given the context of the answer, I think you're doing pretty well with your administrator tools. Though I will recommend (as I'd recommend any admin) to take a look at the category [[CAT:ABL|administrative backlog.]](Only if you have some extra time to go through it. A backlog is preferred to hasty acts, imho.) [[User:Tutelary|Tutelary]] ([[User talk:Tutelary|talk]]) 00:19, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
*I've had a look at a variety of [[User:Mkdw|Mkdw]]'s administrative actions, specifically in the area of [[WP:REVDEL|revision deletion]] and [[WP:RFPP|page protection]] and I'm generally happy with their judgement. The revision deletions (which aren't available to non-admins) show that they have a good nose for [[WP:BLP|BLP]] and how to handle vandalism. During Mkdw's RfA [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Mkdw&diff=554965727&oldid=554964869 I !voted support]—I'm happy with their mop-wielding. —[[User:Tom Morris|Tom Morris]] ([[User talk:Tom Morris|talk]]) 13:52, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
*Glad I supported your RfA. Keep up the good work. -- [[User:OlEnglish|<font size="5">&oelig;</font>]][[User talk:OlEnglish|<sup>&trade;</sup>]] 07:26, 25 July 2014 (UTC)
