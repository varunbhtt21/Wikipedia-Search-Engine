Born in [[Guarenas]], [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]], Canónico spent much of his life teaching and writing music in a wide variety of genres and styles, including [[hymn]]s, [[March (music)|marches]] and [[popular music]]. Nevertheless, he received international recognition thanks to his popular song ''El Totumo de Guarenas'', which has been performed and recorded by generations of [[classical guitar]]ists.<ref name=Enciclopedia>Enciclopedia de la Música en Venezuela</ref>

He was the son of Agostino Canónico, an immigrant [[Italians|Italian]] musician who taught him to play violin at a young age. As a teenager, he took up the [[bugle]] to join a local [[military band]], where he later switched to the [[clarinet]]. While at the band, he also learned to play [[trumpet]] and [[trombone]], as well as several instruments of the [[saxhorn]] and [[woodwind]] families. In addition, he was a solid player of regional instruments as [[Harp#Latin America|arpa mirandina]] and [[Cuatro (Venezuela)|cuatro]].<ref name=Enciclopedia/>

In the early 1920s Canónico moved with his family to [[Caracas]], where he worked as a music teacher and devoted himself to composing and orchestrate. Besides this, he played during 22 years for the Banda Marcial Caracas, by then conducted by [[Pedro Elías Gutiérrez]], and was a founding member of the Orquesta Típica Nacional in 1953.<ref name=Enciclopedia/> Both groups are considered Cultural Heritage of the Nation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bandamarcialcaracas.gdc.gob.ve/ |title=Banda Marcial Caracas website |access-date=2014-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000718/http://bandamarcialcaracas.gdc.gob.ve/ |archive-date=2014-05-02 |dead-url=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.orquestatipicanacional.com/ Orquesta Típica Nacional website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501235727/http://www.orquestatipicanacional.com/ |date=May 1, 2014 }}</ref> Besides, one of his descendants, [[Daniel Canónico]], was a notable professional baseball player.

Canónico gained further recognition after musician [[Alirio Díaz]] wrote a guitar transcription for the aforementioned ''El Totumo de Guarenas'' and premiered it in 1960 at [[Teatro Municipal de Caracas]].<ref name=Enciclopedia/> Since then, the song has been recorded by a number of famous guitarists including [[Liona Boyd]], [[Antonio Lauro]], [[Flavio Sala]] and [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]], among others.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/search/all/totumo%20de%20guarenas All Music Guide]</ref>
