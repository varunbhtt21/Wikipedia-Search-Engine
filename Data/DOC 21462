The only reference on here that mentions him is a blog that says that it is by family. This looks like a poorly written essay as well. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:54, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - This article fails [[WP:PEOPLE]] as well as [[WP:GNG]]. In addition, it would need a substantial rewrite to even closely follow [[WP:MOSBIO]] (including the addition of sources that are [[WP:RS|more reliable]]). [[User:MJ94|MJ94]] ([[User talk:MJ94|talk]]) 20:47, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - fails [[WP:PEOPLE]] and doesn't have enough reliable sources to pass [[WP:GNG]]. --[[User:AmaryllisGardener|<font color="#E0115F">'''Amaryllis'''</font><font color="#74C365">'''Gardener'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:AmaryllisGardener|'''talk''']]</sup> 13:57, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
