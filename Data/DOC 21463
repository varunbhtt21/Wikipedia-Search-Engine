Title : Duncan's First Nation
Text : '''Duncan's First Nation''' is [[First Nations in Alberta|a First Nation in northwestern Alberta, Canada]]. It operates as an [[Indian band]] under the ''[[Indian Act]]'' representing a community of [[Aboriginal Canadians]], in this case from the [[Woods Cree]] ethnic group. The band became a party to [[Treaty 8]] with the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Crown]] on July 1, 1899. [[Indian reserves]] were surveyed for the band in 1905, but the reserves were not confirmed by [[Order-in-Council]] until 1907 (eight parcels) and 1925 (two parcels). All but one reserves ([[Duncan's 151A|#151A]]) were later surrendered to the Canadian government in 1928. One of them, [[WILLIAM MCKENZIE 151K|#151K]], was later returned to the band in 1965.<ref>iportal.usask.ca/docs/ICC_CD/Duncans%20First%20Nation/pub/eng.pdf</ref> The two remaining reserves are #151A, located {{convert|52|km}} west of [[Peace River, Alberta]] and #151K, located in the [[McLennon, Alberta|McLennon]]/[[Reno, Alberta|Reno]] area, southeast of Peace River. The two reserves comprise a total area of {{convert|2426.1|ha}}, and the majority of the population lives on #151A.  In 2012, the band had a [[Indian register|registered]] population of 269, of whom 142 members living the band's reserves.<ref name=BCHYDRO>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents_staticpost/63919/85328/Vol5_Appendix-Duncan.pdf|title=Site C Clean Energy Project|author=Fasken Martineau|publisher=[[BC Hydro]]}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Duncan's First Nation joined a regional council with several other bands, the [[Lesser Slave Lake Indian Regional Council]]. In 1998, however, the band withdrew from the Lesser Slave Lake council and formed the [[Western Cree Tribal Council]] along with [[Horse Lake First Nation]] and [[Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation]], and remains a member.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westerncree.ca/about.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005454/http://www.westerncree.ca/about.html |archive-date=2014-05-02 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> Duncan's is also a member of a treaty council, the [[Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta]].<ref name=BCHYDRO />
