Fails [[WP:GNG]]. Two references within article point to a list of characters and a two-paragraph notation on WordPress, with the other references providing details about real-world dinosaur extinction and saber-toothed cats. 

[https://www.google.com/search?q=baby+puss+flintstones&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&ie=&oe= Google search] provides no links within the first 20 results that meet [[WP:GNG]], instead providing links to fan wikis, message boards and eBay auctions. 

The cat is mentioned in the theme song to ''The Flintstones'', but only appears as a background character in three episodes of the entire series, and is not a regular plot element/character within the show. [[User:AldezD|AldezD]] ([[User talk:AldezD|talk]]) 18:19, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep'''-the cat defiantly is memorable in the song and the show, even if barley used.-I still would keep it though.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 22:49, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''.  The character is not notable.  Being memorable is not a criterion in the [[WP:GNG|GNG]]. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 02:16, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''', but put hatnote over the [[Baby Puss (film)|film of the same name]] that leads to [[The Flinstones]] characters section where Baby Puss's character is covered. Fails notability requirements, but so long as the character gets covered we might as well have the hatnote.

** "Baby Puss (The Flintstones)" is not a very likely search term.  A hatnote on the film (which would be moved over the disambiguation page) is enough. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 05:13, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Ok, that sounds like a good outcome so I'll change my vote accordingly.[[User:Spirit of Eagle|Spirit of Eagle]] ([[User talk:Spirit of Eagle|talk]]) 05:30, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
