*'''Keep''' - The article is poorly sourced, but I'm finding coverage from events in the magazine's history, such as its 100th issue and its rename from X360 to XOne. I've also found instances of other news sources quoting its reviews. —<B>[[User:Tourchiest|Tourchiest]]</B> <sup>[[User talk:Tourchiest|talk]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-3ex;">[[Special:Contributions/Tourchiest|edits]]</sub> 15:22, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
**Having a 100th issue and being renamed does not established notability. Unless there are high quality 3rd party sources on this subject, it fails notability. [[User:ScienceApe|ScienceApe]] ([[User talk:ScienceApe|talk]]) 20:06, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
***I didn't claim those things established notability.  I said that coverage of those events, which exists, does. —<B>[[User:Torchiest|Torchiest]]</B> <sup>[[User talk:Torchiest|talk]]</sup><sub style="margin-left:-3ex;">[[Special:Contributions/Torchiest|edits]]</sub> 14:02, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
****They need to be cited in the article, otherwise you're just claiming that without citations. [[User:ScienceApe|ScienceApe]] ([[User talk:ScienceApe|talk]]) 13:16, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
