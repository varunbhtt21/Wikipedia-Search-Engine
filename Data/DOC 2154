The '''Vintage Ultralight SR-1 Hornet''' is an [[United States|American]] [[homebuilt aircraft]] produced by the [[Vintage Ultralight and Lightplane Association]] of [[Marietta, Georgia]], introduced in the early 1980s. The aircraft is supplied in the form of plans for amateur construction.<ref name="Aerocrafter">Purdy, Don: ''AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition'', page 286. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. {{ISBN|0-9636409-4-1}}</ref><ref name="VULA">{{cite web|url = http://vula.org/blueprint_pricelist.html|title = Blueprints Price List|accessdate = 24 April 2014|last = Perkins | first = Scott, V.U.L.A.

==Design and development==
The aircraft was designed to comply with the US [[FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles]] rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of {{convert|254|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The aircraft has a standard empty weight of {{convert|245|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The SR-1 Hornet features a [[strut-braced]] and [[flying wires|cable-braced]] [[biplane]] layout, a single-seat open cockpit, fixed [[conventional landing gear]] with a steerable tail wheel, and a single engine in [[pusher configuration]].<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The aircraft is made from bolted-together [[aluminum]] tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in [[Aircraft dope|doped]] [[aircraft fabric]]. Its {{convert|33.00|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} span wing has a wing area of {{convert|220.0|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The Hornet has the largest wing area and lightest wing loading of any ultralight of its period. The acceptable power range is {{convert|30|to|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the standard engine used is the {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Cuyuna 430]] powerplant. The engine is mounted between four tubes that support the tail surfaces.<ref name="Aerocrafter" /><ref name="VUM" />

The SR-1 Hornet has a typical empty weight of {{convert|245|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and a gross weight of {{convert|600|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, giving a useful load of {{convert|355|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. With full fuel of {{convert|5|u.s.gal}} the payload for the pilot and baggage is {{convert|325|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The standard day, sea level, no wind, take off and landing roll with a {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine is {{convert|75|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

The designer estimated the construction time from the supplied plans as 250&nbsp;hours.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

==Operational history==
The Hornet was widely sold in the United States in the 1980s.<ref name="Aerocrafter" />

In the United States ultralights are not required to be registered, and in April 2014 no examples were in fact [[Aircraft registration|registered]] in the United States with the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], although a total of two had been registered at one time.<ref name="FAAReg">{{cite web|url = http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/AcftRef_Results.aspx?Mfrtxt=&Modeltxt=SR-1+HORNET&PageNo=1|title = Make / Model Inquiry Results|accessdate = 24 April 2014|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date = 24 April 2014}}</ref>
