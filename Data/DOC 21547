'''Dirty Loops''' is a band from [[Stockholm]], Sweden, made up of Jonah Nilsson (vocals and piano), [[Henrik Linder]] (bass) and Aron Mellergårdh (drums). Their arrangements are advanced stylistically, borrowing from jazz and jazz-fusion, gospel, funk, electronica, pop and disco as well as being at times instrumentally quite ambitious. They have covered mainstream songs like [[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|"Baby"]] by [[Justin Bieber]], [[Rolling in the Deep|"Rolling in the deep"]] by [[Adele]], [[Wake Me Up (Avicii song)|"Wake me up"]] by [[Avicii]] and change it drastically to [[Jazz fusion|jazz-fusion]]. They also performed the 2016 rendition of the song "Over the Horizon" for [[Samsung Electronics]].<ref>https://news.samsung.com/global/behind-the-scenes-with-dirty-loops-over-the-horizon</ref>

==Background==
All three of the band's members studied music at [[Södra Latin]] together. Nilsson studied classical theory while Linder and Mellergårdh studied jazz.

After upper secondary school, they attended the Royal College of Music in Stockholm together.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dirty Loops: how funk fusion covers led to international acclaim|url=http://www.keyboardmag.com/artists/1236/dirty-loops-how-funk-fusion-covers-led-to-international-acclaim/48726}}</ref> Jonah Nilsson has also studied music at Betel College in Stockholm. Henrik Linder attended Adolf Fredrik Music School as a child.

[[Henrik Linder]] began his music career as a pianist at the age of four and bass at the age of 13.

Jonah Nilsson also started singing as a child, and his parents sang in the choir of Katarina Church, Stockholm. At the age of 11 he began playing piano. He appeared as a backing singer and played piano on [[Danny Saucedo]]'s tour in 2005, the same year that Danny made his debut on the TV show Swedish Idol.

==History==
The band was formed in 2008 and released their first song in 2010.<ref>http://www.dirty-loops.com/about/</ref> In February 2011, they signed a management contract with producer and songwriter Andreas Carlsson. On 3 September 2011 the band backed Danny Saucedo at the Aftonbladet music gala, "Rockbjörnen".

Manager Andreas Carlsson has prioritised developing the band's brand. Above all, he has advised them to be careful what they upload and publish on the Internet. They have appeared in several television interviews but have not yet played in any TV shows.

Andreas Carlsson has helped the band to get a global record deal. In 2012, the band traveled to the U.S. to face several major music profiles, among others, singer [[Brian McKnight]], drummer [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] and bassist [[Nathan East]]. Eventually they signed a record contract with world-renowned producer and record label director [[David Foster]] and Universal Music subsidiary Verve.

===Debut album: ''Loopified''===
Their debut album, ''Loopified'' was released on April 16, 2014 in Japan, on 19 May in the UK, and on August 19 in the US.

=== Hiatus and second album ===
Citing creative differences during the early production of their second album, the group have announced that they would go on hiatus and pursue individual interest. On December 26, 2018 they posted on their Instagram hinting towards the completion of their second album, marking the end of their hiatus.[https://www.instagram.com/p/Br2t4VAHshe/] The first single off of their second album will be released on May 20, 2019.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw96SBDHB4K/</ref>

==Tours==

=== David Foster and Andreas Carlsson ===

In late 2012 the band supported David Foster and Andreas Carlsson in Japan, China, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand for the "David Foster & Friends Tour." They played for tens of thousands of people during the tour. One highlight of the tour was when Jonah and Chaka Khan performed together as a duet.

=== Maroon V Tour ===

The band opened for Maroon 5 during the Asia and Oceania legs of the Maroon V Tour, a worldwide concert tour by American band [[Maroon 5]] in support of their fifth album ''[[V (Maroon 5 album)|V]]''. The tour was announced on September 2, 2014, and began on February 16, 2015. The tour took place in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania until October 2015.

==Members==
=== Jonah Nilsson – [[vocals]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]===

Jonah’s musical journey began when he sang in the choir at the Katarina Church in Stockholm, conducted by his parents at age one. He also started learning the double bass at age eight, but quickly made a switch to piano lessons in classical music at age 11, inspired by one of his favorite Chopin pieces, Fantasia Impromptu in C sharp minor. In his final year at high school, he switched over to jazz piano studies. He attended various music schools including Sodra Latin, Adolf Fredrik School of Music, Betel College and the Royal Music Academy in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Raguraman|first1=Anjali|title=Dirty Loops trio a product of Swedish system|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/dirty-loops-trio-a-product-of-swedish-system|website=The Straits Times|publisher=SPH Digital News|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dirty Loops|url=https://www.tastekid.com/music/Dirty%20Loops/books|website=TasteKid|publisher=[[TasteDive|TasteKid]]|accessdate=24 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="facebook.com">{{cite web|title=Jonah Nilsson (Dirty Loops) fan page|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/Jonah-Nilsson-DirtyLoops-Fan-page-210640792367095/about/?ref=page_internal|website=Facebook|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref>

At age 17, he collaborated with Arvid Svenungsson to produce a biblical-based musical centered on the character, Job. He met Aron Mellergardh and wrote songs together in the vein of groovy funk, inspired by music of the 80’s and bands like Toto. Later, he joined Danny Saucedo’s tour as backing vocals and keyboardist. His songwriting and music production skills caused him to be well sought after by many, including Jenny Berggren, a former member of the band, Ace of Base.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Jenny Berggren "My Story"|url=http://aceofbaseisinyourmind.tumblr.com/post/133606050897/jenny-berggren-my-story|website=Ace of Base|publisher=Ace of Base|accessdate=24 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="facebook.com"/>

=== [[Henrik Linder]] – [[bass guitar]]  ===
Henrik Linder was born in [[Sweden]] and started playing piano at age 4.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dirty Loops trio a product of Swedish system|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/dirty-loops-trio-a-product-of-swedish-system|website=The Straits Times|language=en|date=23 September 2015}}</ref> Growing up, he listened to music that his older sister listened to, including artists such as [[Soundgarden]] since he liked the band’s use of odd meters in their songs. When he was around 12 years old, a girl he had a crush on told him that bass was the “sexiest instrument”.<ref name="one">{{cite web|last1=BassPlayer.com|first1=Electric & Acoustic Bass Gear, Lessons, News, Video, Tabs and Chords -|title=Dirty Loops' Henrik Linder to Appear at BPL!|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/login/artists/1171/dirty-loops-henrik-linder-to-appear-at-bpl/48947}}</ref>

Later on, at 13 years old, Linder switched to bass guitar. One of his first childhood bass idols was [[Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers)|Flea]] from the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] after listening to the band’s song [[Aeroplane (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|"Aeroplane"]] from the album ''[[One Hot Minute]]''. In addition, Linder later discovered groups like [[The Brecker Brothers]] and [[Tribal Tech]], featuring [[Gary Willis]] on bass. Gary Willis would become one of his greatest influences. Linder also started taking lessons with a local Swedish bass player, Robert Sudin. At age 16, Linder was already a busy Stockholm session musician and played with many different groups.<ref name="one"/><ref name="two">{{cite web|last1=BassPlayer.com|first1=Electric & Acoustic Bass Gear, Lessons, News, Video, Tabs and Chords -|title=Reharm Phenom: Henrik Linder of Dirty Loops|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/reharm-phenom-henrik-linder-of-dirty-loops/26636}}</ref>

As classmates at the Royal Academy of Music, they would both practice and jam together as much as possible. Later on, Mellergårdh and Linder started working with another one of their classmates and childhood friends, pianist and vocalist Jonah Nilsson. Their collaboration eventually lead to the creation of Dirty Loops in 2008.<ref name="ten">{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Listen to Dirty Loops' Debut Album 'Loopified'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6214397/loopified-dirty-loops-exclusive|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref name="four">{{cite web|title=Pop With a Twist: An Exclusive Interview with Henrik Linder of Dirty Loops|url=http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2012/02/09/pop-with-a-twist-an-exclusive-interview-with-henrik-linder-of-dirty-loops/|website=No Treble}}</ref>

===Aron Mellergardh – [[drum kit|drums]]===
Aron Mellergardh grew up in Gislaved Sweden where he was inspired to learn to play the drums from a musical family. He met future Dirty Loops bandmates Jonah Nilsson and Henrik Linder at Södra Latin, a secondary school in Södermalm Stockholm. He then attended the Royal College of Music in Stockholm before committing to Dirty Loops.<ref name=Aron>http://www.sabian.com/en/artist/aron-mellergardh.
