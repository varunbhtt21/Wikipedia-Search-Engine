'''Abdallah ibn Khordadbeh''' ({{lang-fa|عبدالله بن خرداببه}}) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] general and governor for the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].

He was the son of Khordadbeh, a [[Zoroastrian]] from [[Khurasan]] who converted to [[Islam]]. By ca. 815, Abdallah served as the governor of [[Tabaristan]], and conquered the mountainous regions of Tabaristan from the local [[Bavandid]] ruler [[Sharwin I]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1997|pp=37-38}} During the same year, he campaigned in [[Daylam]], where he conquered two cities and captured its ruler Abu Layla. In 817, he aided [[Mazyar]], an Iranian prince, to escape from Tabaristan and reach the court of the Abbasid [[caliph]] [[al-Ma'mun]]. Abdallah was also a friend of the Persian musician [[Ishaq al-Mawsili]].

Not much more is known about Abdallah; he had a son named Abu'l-Qasim Ubaydallah, better known as [[Ibn Khordadbeh]], who was born in 820 in Khurasan and was later raised in [[Baghdad]], where Abdallah probably then resided. He thereafter disappears from sources, and later died at an unknown date in the 9th-century.
