The '''Pakri Peninsula''' extends from northwestern mainland [[Estonia]]'s [[Harju County]] into the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its length is 12 [[kilometres]] and its area is about 40 square kilometers.

Portions of the peninsula were protected in 1998 as the [[Pakri Landscape Reserve]] on the basis of its unique geological features, valuable communities of flora and fauna, and historic interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.ee/index.php?page=6&id=38&lang=en&|title=Conservation Management Plan of the Pakri Landscape Reserve|publisher=Institute of Geology at [[Tallinn University]] of Technology|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>
