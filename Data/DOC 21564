Title : Robbing the Cradle
Text : "'''Robbing the Cradle'''" is a [[Level (video gaming)|level]] created by [[Ion Storm]] for their final video game, ''[[Thief: Deadly Shadows]]'' (2004). Unlike other levels in the game, it features a strong [[survival horror]] theme, in addition to the [[stealth game]]play typical of the ''Thief'' series. Players traverse an abandoned, haunted orphanage and mental asylum called the Shalebridge Cradle, while attempting to free the soul of a young girl from the building's captivity.

The level was designed by Jordan Thomas and [[Randy Smith (game designer)|Randy Smith]], with a [[soundscape]] composed by [[Eric Brosius]]. Using theories of interactive horror design developed by Smith in 2000, the team sought to create the scariest level ever to appear in a game. They took influence from works such as ''[[House of Leaves]]'', ''[[Session 9]]'' and the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series, and they studied mental asylums and [[List of reportedly haunted locations|reportedly haunted]] buildings for inspiration.

"Robbing the Cradle" was widely praised, and it has been described by publications such as ''[[Computer & Video Games]]'', ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' and [[Bloody Disgusting]] as one of the scariest scenes in the history of video games. Jordan Thomas went on to create the "Fort Frolic" level in ''[[BioShock]]'', and to serve as creative director for ''[[BioShock 2]]''. The positive reception of "Robbing the Cradle" inspired [[Eidos Montréal]] to create a similar asylum level in ''[[Thief (2014 video game)|Thief]]'' (2014).

"Robbing the Cradle" is the penultimate level of ''[[Thief: Deadly Shadows]]'' (2004), a video game developed by [[Ion Storm]]. In addition to the [[stealth game]]play typical of the game, the level features a strong [[survival horror]] theme. "Robbing the Cradle" takes place inside the Shalebridge Cradle, a conscious, malevolent and abandoned orphanage and mental institution. It is patrolled by creatures called "Puppets", the reanimated bodies of former inmates.<ref name=journey /><ref name=escapist /> Protagonist [[Garrett (character)|Garrett]] enters the building in hopes of solving a mystery related to a supernatural murderer, the Gray Lady.<ref name=smith3 /><ref name=journey /> Once inside, he encounters the ghost of a deceased orphan, Lauryl, who was killed by the Gray Lady.<ref name=journey /> She is trapped within the Cradle because it "remembers" her.<ref name=quote1>{{cite video game | title=Thief: Deadly Shadows | date=May 25, 2004 | developer=[[Ion Storm]] | publisher=[[Eidos Interactive]] | quote='''Lauryl:''' I have to get rid of all of my things. The Cradle uses them to remember me; that's how it keeps me here. }}</ref>

The Shalebridge Cradle is divided into two sections: the "Inner Cradle" and "Outer Cradle". The player begins in the Outer Cradle, which is designed to terrify players, but which secretly contains no dangers or enemies. The Inner Cradle is roamed by Puppets. The building's backstory is unveiled in a [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear fashion]], via clues scattered within the level.<ref name=journey /> The player must free Lauryl by locating and disposing of artifacts that allow the Cradle to remember her.<ref name=quote1 /> However, after completing this objective, Garrett discovers that the Cradle has remembered him. To escape, the player travels back in time within the Cradle's memory,<ref>{{cite video game | title=Thief: Deadly Shadows | date=May 25, 2004 | developer=[[Ion Storm]] | publisher=[[Eidos Interactive]] | quote='''Lauryl:''' This place remembers you now. You've been here too long. There's only one way to leave the Cradle: you have to trick it. I'll help you. First you have to enter the past as your real self. }}</ref> while fleeing from silhouettes of the Cradle's staff.<ref name=journey /> The player ends the level by leaping from the Cradle's highest window, which convinces the building that Garrett is dead.<ref>{{cite video game | title=Thief: Deadly Shadows | date=May 25, 2004 | developer=[[Ion Storm]] | publisher=[[Eidos Interactive]] | quote='''Lauryl:''' Go to the top of the Staff Tower.

==Development==
The central ideas behind "Robbing the Cradle" were conceived by ''Thief: Deadly Shadows'' project director [[Randy Smith (game designer)|Randy Smith]] in 2000.<ref name=smith3>{{cite web | last=Weise | first=Matthew | title=Looking Glass Studios Interview Series - Audio Podcast 4 - Randy Smith | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401070322/http://gambit.mit.edu/updates/2011/06/looking_glass_studios_intervie_3.php | url=http://gambit.mit.edu/updates/2011/06/looking_glass_studios_intervie_3.php | archivedate=April 1, 2013 | publisher=Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab | date=June 22, 2011 | deadurl=no }}</ref><ref name=allthefun>{{cite journal |journal=[[PC Gamer UK]] |title=All the Fun of the Fear |issue=88 |date=November 2000 |last=Gillen |first=Kieron | authorlink=Kieron Gillen | pages=120–123 }}</ref><ref name=journey>{{cite journal | last=Gillen | first=Kieron | authorlink=Kieron Gillen | title=Journey into the Cradle | work=[[PC Gamer UK]]| issue=146 | date=March 2005 | pages=132–141|url=http://gillen.cream.org/wordpress_html/assorted-essays/journey-into-the-cradle/ }}</ref> Smith had designed a horror-based level, "Return to the Cathedral", in 1998's ''[[Thief: The Dark Project]]''. Although he had intended only to make it "atmospheric and suspenseful", the level was widely held to be terrifying.<ref name=smith3 /><ref name=allthefun /> In 2000, Smith was in the process of being hired at [[Ion Storm]] to work on ''Deadly Shadows'', and he was contacted by ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' writer [[Kieron Gillen]] to discuss "Return to the Cathedral".<ref name=allthefun /> As the interview progressed via email,<ref name=email>{{cite web | first=Kieron | last=Gillen | authorlink=Kieron Gillen | title=I'm Not Sad Now Putting My Head On The Tracks | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020222034722/http://www.pcgamer.co.uk/packed_lunch/packed_lunch_page.asp?item_id=5425 | url=http://www.pcgamer.co.uk/packed_lunch/packed_lunch_page.asp?item_id=5425 | work=[[PC Gamer UK]] | date=October 12, 2000 | archivedate=February 22, 2002 }}</ref> Smith developed a theory of horror design to retroactively explain the success of the level.<ref name=smith3 /> His core concept was that players try to establish boundaries between safety and danger, and that fear results when these boundaries become unpredictable, or when the player is compelled to cross them "of their own free will".<ref name=allthefun /><ref name=smith3 /> Smith decided to consciously apply this theory in ''Deadly Shadows'', and the result was "Robbing the Cradle".<ref name=smith3 />
[[File:Randy Smith - Game Developers Conference 2010 - Day 3.jpg|thumb|right|"Robbing the Cradle" was based on a theory of interactive horror design created by Randy Smith.]]
Smith's goal with "Robbing the Cradle" was to create the scariest level ever to appear in a game, which would "knock 'Return to the Cathedral' off the charts".<ref name=smith3 /> Designer Jordan Thomas joined the ''Deadly Shadows'' team in November 2001,<ref name=rps>{{cite web | last=Gillen | first=Kieron | authorlink=Kieron Gillen | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718041414/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/09/21/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows/ | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/09/21/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows/ | title=The Making Of ''Thief: Deadly Shadows'' | work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] | date=September 21, 2007 | deadurl=no | archivedate=July 18, 2008 }}</ref> in part because of his interest in horror design.<ref name=smith3 /> Smith worked with Thomas during the early planning of "Robbing the Cradle", which was referred to at Ion Storm as the "haunted house". Thomas explained that the key to their design was "dread", which he described as the feeling of being "seven steps from the unspeakable". Thomas drafted a [[level design]] based on this idea, while seeking to retain the stealth focus of other levels in ''Deadly Shadows''. He saw "Robbing the Cradle" both as a level and as a test of the possibilities of interactive horror design.<ref name=journey /> Smith later noted that his own biggest contributions were the level's [[Beat (filmmaking)|beats]]: he designed ways for players' boundaries to be regularly violated, such as by forcing them to explore threatening areas.<ref name=smith3 /> Thomas spent a large portion of his off-hours working on the level,<ref name=journey /> and Smith stated that Thomas was responsible for "all of the implementation" of the level's theories.<ref name=smith3 />

The team worked to discover the causes and mechanics of fear, and they analyzed horror films for inspiration.<ref name=smith3 /> "Robbing the Cradle" includes influences from the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' and ''[[System Shock]]'' series, from the films ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'', ''[[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'' and ''[[Session 9]]'', and from the books ''[[House of Leaves]]'', ''[[From Hell]]'' and ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. Thomas applied psychological horror techniques that he hoped would stay with the player even after the level's end. To generate fear, he used a combination of [[scripted sequence]]s and unplanned, [[Emergent gameplay|emergent]] factors.<ref name=journey /> Every light source in the level dims and brightens at an imperceptibly slow speed, which Thomas hoped would create a "subconscious sense of breathing" and thereby make the Shalebridge Cradle feel like a living entity. Lights were programmed to flicker when approached by Puppets; however, Puppets roam the level in real-time, and so Thomas was unable to predict which lights would flicker at which times. He believed that this gave the player the feeling of being hunted.<ref name=escapist>{{cite web | last=Gillen | first=Kieron | authorlink=Kieron Gillen | title=The Illuminated Ones | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513144631/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_107/1303-The-Illuminated-Ones | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_107/1303-The-Illuminated-Ones | work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] | date=July 24, 2007 | deadurl=no | archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}</ref>

Thomas explained that the Shalebridge Cradle's design was based on "dozens of actual, existing Victorian hospitals and reputedly haunted buildings".<ref name=journey /> The [[Danvers State Hospital]] was a key influence, and Smith went with other members of the team to visit an abandoned asylum in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=smith3 /> Thomas gathered photographs by [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] and studied past methods of [[treatment of mental disorders|treating mental disorders]], and he "read reams of patient and staff interviews". Audio director [[Eric Brosius]] composed the Cradle's [[soundscape]], which Gillen later described as "a drunken miasma of sound [... that makes] you uneasy until an unexpected noise splits asunder".<ref name=journey />

==Reception and legacy==
"Robbing the Cradle" was widely praised.<ref name=gi /> It was the subject of a ten-page feature by Kieron Gillen in ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'', the first and only article dedicated to a single level in that magazine.<ref name=cvg5>{{cite web | last=Francis | first=Tom | title=''BioShock 2'' | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PEX78vBr?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/213740/previews/bioshock-2/ | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/213740/previews/bioshock-2/ | work=[[Computer & Video Games]] | date=April 24, 2009 | archivedate=May 1, 2014 | deadurl=yes | df= }}</ref><ref name=journey /> Gillen hailed it as "one of the most brilliant and disturbing levels ever committed to PC", and he believed that it was "probably the scariest level ever made".<ref name=journey /> Tom McNamara of [[IGN]] wrote that the level "just has to be experienced to be believed", and he praised its sound design.

After finishing work on ''Deadly Shadows'', Jordan Thomas went to [[Irrational Games]], where he designed the "Fort Frolic" section of ''[[BioShock]]''.
