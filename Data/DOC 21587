==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''<ref name=3584sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3584 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3584|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> 

The bill would amend the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Act]] to treat certain privately insured [[credit union]]s as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.<ref name="3584sum"/>

The bill would permit a credit union which lacks federal deposit insurance and has applied for membership in a federal home loan bank to be treated as meeting all the eligibility requirements for federal deposit insurance if the supervisor of the chartering state has determined that it meets all federal deposit insurance eligibility requirements.<ref name="3584sum"/>

The bill would deem such a credit union to have met the eligibility criteria for federal home loan bank membership if, six months after its application date, the state supervisor has failed to act upon the application.<ref name="3584sum"/>

The bill would prohibit the application of a state law authorizing a conservator or liquidating agent of a credit union to repudiate contracts to any: (1) extension of credit from a federal home loan bank to a credit union which is a member of that bank, or (2) security interest in the assets of the credit union securing such extension of credit.<ref name="3584sum"/>

The bill would amend the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]] to require private deposit insurers of credit unions to submit copies of their audit reports within seven days to the [[National Credit Union Administration]] and, if the insured credit union is a member of a federal home loan bank, to the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]].<ref name="3584sum"/>

The bill would require the supervisory agency of each state in which a private deposit insurer insures deposits in a credit union which lacks federal deposit insurance and has become a member of a federal home loan bank to provide the National Credit Union Administration, upon request, the results of any examination and reports which the agency may have in its possession concerning the private deposit insurer.<ref name="3584sum"/>

==Debate and discussion==
At the committee hearing, [[Rose Bartolomucci]] testified on behalf of the [[Credit Union National Association]] in favor of the bill.<ref name=RoseTestimony>{{cite web|last=Bartolomucci|first=Rose|title=Testimony of Rose Bartolomucci on behalf of the Credit Union National Association|url=http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba15-wstate-rbartolomucci-20131204.pdf|publisher=House Financial Services Committee|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=4 December 2013}}</ref> Bartolomucci emphasized that the bill does not guarantee membership to individual credit unions, but only the right to apply for membership. Bartolomucci argued that being able to join the Federal Home Loan Bank System would allow credit unions to better serve their members by providing them with additional liquidity.<ref name="RoseTestimony"/> Bartolomucci also made historical arguments about why credit unions should be eligible.

In the same committee hearing, [[Thomas N. Richards]] testified on behalf of the [[American Bankers Association]] (ABA) that the ABA has "concerns about privately-insured credit unions being allowed to join a Federal Home Loan Bank."<ref name=RichardsABA>{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Thomas N.|title=Testimony of Thomas N. Richards on behalf of the American Bankers Association|url=http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-113-ba15-wstate-trichards-20131204.pdf|publisher=House Financial Services Committee|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=4 December 2013}}</ref> According to Richards, "the issue of concern is the financial viability of the private insurer to a failure of a non-federally-insured credit union that has a significant level of secured advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank."<ref name="RichardsABA"/>
