<!-- Please add the rationale for reassessment below this comment. Subsequent discussion should be added below, until the reassessment is closed.-->
The article does not follow the Manual of Style guidelines in general, especially regarding the lead. Its overall quality doesn't seem to be very good and more weight is given to certain segments than to others.[[User:KingdomHearts25|KingdomHearts25]] ([[User talk:KingdomHearts25|talk]])  18:31, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
