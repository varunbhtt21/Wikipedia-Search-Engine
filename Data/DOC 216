'''Paul Gleeson''' or '''Rua''' (born 7 December 1987) is an Irish TV [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], [[mentalist]] and [[escapologist]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Monkstown, County Dublin]], Ireland, Rua developed his interest in magic at the age of 18. He had previously worked as a fire performer, and after a freak accident suffered second- and third-degree burns to his hands, face and chest. While he was in hospital, he was given a book on card tricks by a friend, through which he developed his interest in sleight of hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Horror+accident+reason+why+Paul+IS+THE+REAL+DEAL..+TG4+magician...-a0356566752 |title=Horror accident reason why Paul IS THE REAL DEAL..
