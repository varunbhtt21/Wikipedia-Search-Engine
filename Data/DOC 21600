Title : Muflih al-Turki
Text : '''Muflih al-Turki''' ({{lang-ar|مفلح التركي}}) (d. April 2, 872) was a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] military officer of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the mid-9th century. He played a prominent role in the events known as the [[Anarchy at Samarra]], but was killed in battle against the [[Zanj Rebellion|Zanj]] rebels of southern [[Iraq]].

== Career ==
Muflih was a close associate of the general [[Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir]], possibly serving as his chief lieutenant.{{sfn|Gordon|2001|p=237 n. 108}} He is first mentioned by the chronicler [[al-Tabari]] during the [[Caliphal Civil War (865–866)|civil war of 865–866]], in which he was a member of the army that besieged [[Baghdad]].{{sfn|Saliba|1985|p=86}} After the war, he followed Musa to [[Jibal|al-Jibal]] when the latter was appointed governor there in 867. During his time in al-Jibal he served as Musa's second in command and undertook several military expeditions, defeating the [[Dulafid dynasty|Dulafid]] [['Abd al-Aziz ibn Abu Dulaf]] near [[Hamedan|Hamadhan]] and [[Karaj|al-Karaj]]{{sfn|Saliba|1985|pp=145-46}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=189}} and attacking the inhabitants of [[Qom|Qumm]].{{sfn|Saliba|1985|pp=154-55}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=196}}

In 869, Muflih entered the province of [[Tabaristan]], which was controlled by the [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran|Zaydid]] rebel [[al-Hasan ibn Zayd]]. He was able to defeat al-Hasan and occupy both [[Sari, Iran|Sari]] and [[Amol|Amul]]. He then set out for the region of [[Daylam|al-Daylam]], where al-Hasan had fled to,{{sfn|Ibn Isfandiyar|1905|pp=179-80}}{{sfn|Saliba|1985|p=156}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=204-05}} but he was recalled en route by Musa, who had decided to depart for the capital [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. He therefore abandoned Tabaristan, allowing al-Hasan to restore his rule there.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=24-26}}{{sfn|Ibn Isfandiyar|1905|p=180}}

Following their return to Samarra, Muflih was an important supporter of Musa during the short reign of the caliph [[al-Muhtadi]] (r. 869–870).{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=150}} He participated in the downfall of the rival general [[Salih ibn Wasif]] and was thought to be involved in a plot to depose the caliph.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=69, 71, 73, 79, 82, 86-87, 89-90}}  In 870 Musa, Muflih and [[Bayakbak]] departed for [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|al-Jazira]], where they fought the [[Kharijite]] [[Kharijite Rebellion (866–896)|Musawir]] and forced him to flee.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=90-91}} While in al-Jazira, Musa and Muflih learned that al-Muhtadi was plotting to relieve them of their commands and have them arrested or killed, so they abandoned the campaign and advanced toward Samarra with their troops. During the resulting crisis, al-Muhtadi was deposed and killed, and the two commanders were able to return to the capital.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=99 ff.}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=220-23}}

Shortly after the ascension of [[al-Mu'tamid]] (r. 870–892), Muflih returned to al-Jazira to fight Musawir; he succeeded in forcing the rebel to temporarily abandon [[Hdatta|al-Haditha]], but was unable to kill or capture him and eventually returned to Samarra.{{sfn|Waines|1992|p=116}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=219-20}} Around the beginning of 872 he headed for [[Tikrit|Takrit]], where he fought some Arab tribesmen that were reportedly sympathetic to Musawir.{{sfn|Waines|1992|p=136}}

In February 872 Muflih and the caliph's brother [[Al-Muwaffaq|Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil]] decided to undertake a campaign against the Zanj and set out for [[Basra]]. On April 1 they engaged the Zanj in the vicinity of the [[Nahr Abi al-Khasib|Abu al-Khasib Canal]], but Muflih was mortally wounded by an arrow that struck him in the temple, and the government army was routed. Muflih died of his wound on the following morning, after which his body was taken to Samarra and buried there.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=137, 139-42}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=236}}{{sfn|Al-Mas'udi|1874|pp=39-40}} Following his death, his son [['Abd al-Rahman ibn Muflih|'Abd al-Rahman]] seems to have assumed his position as one of Musa's chief officers.{{sfn|Gordon|2001|pp=252-53 n. 41}}
