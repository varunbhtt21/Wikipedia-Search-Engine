'''Emmerich Joseph Wolfgang Heribert de Dalberg, 1st Duke of Dalberg''' (31 May 1773 &ndash; 27 April 1833) was a German diplomat who was elevated to the [[French nobility]] in the [[Napoleon]]ic era and who held senior government positions during the [[Bourbon Restoration]].

==Early career==
Emmerich Joseph Wolfgang Heribert von [[Dalberg]] was born in [[Mainz]], then capital of the [[Electorate of Mainz]], on 31 May 1773. His father was [[Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg]], a statesman of [[Margraviate of Baden|Baden]]. Emmerich was the nephew of [[Karl Theodor von Dalberg]], arch-chancellor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Prince primate]] of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand-Duke of Frankfurt]]. His family meant him to pursue a clerical career, and he studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Lower Saxony.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1891|p=242}}

Dalberg was at Vienna in the Imperial Chancellery when the stance of his uncle, who had taken the French side, ended his diplomatic career with the Austrian court. He was then named Councillor to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|King of Bavaria]]. After the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (9 February 1801) between the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] and [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], he was accredited to Paris as minister of the [[Margraviate of Baden|Margrave of Baden]]. He negotiated the marriage of the young [[Charles, Grand Duke of Baden]], with Princess [[Stéphanie de Beauharnais]], niece of the Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]]. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] befriended him and arranged for him to marry Mlle. de Brignoles, one of the ladies of the Empress.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1891|p=242}}

After the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn|Treaty of Vienna]] in 1809, Dalberg was naturalized as a French citizen and charged with negotiating [[Napoleon]]'s marriage with [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise of Austria]]. On 14 April 1810, he was created a [[Nobility of the First French Empire|duke of the Empire]] as ''duc de Dalberg''. He was made a Councilor of State on 14 October 1810, with a large endowment. When Talleyrand was disgraced, he also fell from favor.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1891|p=242}}

==Bourbon Restoration==

After Napoleon was defeated, Dalberg and Talleyrand both joined the [[French provisional government of 1814]], and both assisted at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. On 22 July 1814, King [[Louis XVIII of France]] gave Dalberg the Grand Cordon of the [[Legion of Honour]].

Dalberg left France during the [[Hundred Days]], when Napoleon returned from exile, and he returned after the second [[Bourbon Restoration]]. On 17 August 1815, he was made a [[Peer of France]] and Minister of State. On 26 January 1816, he was appointed ambassador to [[Turin]]. In the chamber of peers, he showed himself in favor of the [[Charter of 1814]].{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1891|p=242}}

Towards the end of the Restoration, he retired to his castle, Schloss Herrnsheim, where he died on 27 April 1833.{{sfn|Robert|Cougny|1891|p=242-243}} His daughter, Marie Louise de Dalberg (1813–1860), married [[Sir Ferdinand Dalberg-Acton, 7th Baronet|Sir Ferdinand Acton, 7th Baronet]], who assumed the additional surname of Dalberg. After Sir Ferdinand's death in 1837, she married [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Granville Leveson-Gower]] (who became the 2nd [[Earl Granville]] in 1846).
