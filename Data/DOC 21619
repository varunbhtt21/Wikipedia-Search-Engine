:({{Find sources|Celebrity name game (word game)}})
No sources, not particularly encyclopedic, no incoming links. This reads to me like a case of [[WP:MADEUP]] and may cause confusion with the upcoming syndicated TV show [[Celebrity Name Game]] (note that pages have been moved around to minimize this).

:'''Comment''': I've played this, but in the form of geographic places instead of celebrity names. Mentioned in passing [http://spoonful.com/family-fun/classic-road-trip-games here] (see "Geography"). I offer no opinion on whether this could be turned into an encyclopedic article, merely stating that it exists. [[User:Ivanvector|Ivanvector]] ([[User talk:Ivanvector|talk]]) 18:56, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::I have no doubt that this exists and that people play it. I think points of comparison are the articles [[20 Questions]] and [[I spy]], both of which are written more encyclopedically and cite sources. It's possible that sources for this game exist as well, but finding them may be difficult given the upcoming TV series of the same name.

*'''Comment''' Yeah I've played this and of course the next letter in the alphabet one (one says Apple, next says boy, ect.), but this does seem interesting that it is here, and that it has been here so long. Now if there is a page for classic road trip games. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:19, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  Even if it's not made up by the article creator, I don't see any evidence of notability.  Google results indicate that there are forum games with vaguely similar rule sets, but it is not mentioned in any reliable sources.  There's nothing to say in this article except for an explanation of the rules. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 22:30, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I don't really understand what is encyclopedic about a word game, or why it's necessary to have a page about this. [[User:Adamh4|Adamh4]] ([[User talk:Adamh4|talk]]) 16:07, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
