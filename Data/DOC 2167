She is best known for being a [[Holocaust survivor]], and as a scholar and childhood friend of the famed memoirist [[Anne Frank]].

Nussbaum was a professor of Foreign Languages and Literature at [[Portland State University]]. After retirement Nussbaum now lectures on the Holocaust, Anne Frank and her experience during [[World War II]].<ref name=PSUlecture>{{cite web|title=Lecture: Laureen Nussbaum, "The Legacy of Anne Frank"|url=http://www.pdx.edu/syndication/lecture-laureen-nussbaum-legacy-anne-frank|publisher=Portland State University|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=Hall1>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Bennett|title=Holocaust survivor to share memories of Anne Frank|url=http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/holocaust-survivor-to-share-memories-of-anne-frank/article_35663914-cb20-11e3-9b6d-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=Corvallis Gazette-Times|date=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=Catlin>{{cite news|title=Upper School assembly with Holocaust survivors Laureen and Rudi Nussbaum|url=http://www.catlin.edu/event/upper-school/upper-school-assembly-with-holocaust-survivors-laureen-and-rudi-nussbaum?page=33|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=Catlin Gabel}}</ref>  While at Portland State, she also became the head of the German section of the Foreign Language Department.<ref>{{cite book|title=GDR Review, Volume 34|year=1989|publisher=Verlag Zeit im Bild|page=11}}</ref>  Nussbaum's publications on 20th-century German literature and literature written in Dutch by German refugees are often referenced in academia.

==Friendship with Anne Frank==
Nussbaum was born Hannelore Klein in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. As Germany became increasingly hostile toward Jews, Nussbaum's family moved from Frankfurt to [[Amsterdam]] in 1936. In her new neighborhood, Nussbaum met Anne Frank.<ref name=tillamook /> Nussbaum's family and the Frank family had been friends in Frankfurt, though Nussbaum had not known the Frank children at that time. Nussbaum became closest to Anne's sister [[Margot Frank|Margot]]. While growing up together, Nussbaum remembers Anne as "vivacious and smart", though the two were not particularly close.<ref name=Powers1>

After Anne and most of her family were killed, Nussbaum remained close to [[Otto Frank]], Anne's father and the only surviving member of Anne's immediate family. Otto was the best man at Nussbaum's wedding to Rudi.<ref name=tillamook>{{cite news|title=Holocaust survivors speak at Nestucca|url=http://www.tillamookheadlightherald.com/news/article_e943fc2e-49bd-11e0-8dd4-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|date=9 March 2011}}</ref>

Nussbaum has written about the fact that Anne Frank rewrote a large part of her spontaneous diary entries with the intention to publish an epistolary novel based on her diary.<ref name=versions1>{{cite web|title=There are different versions of Anne Frank’s diary.|url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/A-diary-as-a-best-friend/At-last-seriously-taken-as-a-writer/|publisher=Annefrank.org|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> While clear that "Otto should be congratulated for probably being the first to publish a document from the Holocaust," she has criticized him for combining Anne's two versions of her diary into one without explanation.<ref name=Lee1>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Carol Ann|title=The Hidden Life of Otto Frank|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/author/authorExtra.aspx?isbn13=9780060520830&displayType=readingGuide|publisher=Harper Collins|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

Of the memory that she keeps of Anne, Nussbaum stated in 1995 "Memory easily fools you and my memory is coloured, inevitably, by the fact that she has become so famous. I always found her lively and keen, but would never have thought she would turn into this icon. I am afraid the icon has become, for some people, a source of income and the person Anne is obscured by this. She stands as a symbolic figure upon whom the world can heap both its guilt and its commiseration."<ref name=Lambert1>{{cite news|last=Lambert|first=Angela|title=Anne Frank: after the diary stopped|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/anne-frank-after-the-diary-stopped-1618257.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 May 1995}}</ref>

==Holocaust==
The Klein family moved to Amsterdam in 1936 to escape the increasing [[antisemitism]] in Germany. However, when the [[Nazis invaded the Netherlands]] in 1940, Jews were barred from many public places and in 1942 were forced to wear [[Yellow badge|yellow stars]] on their clothing to denote their ethnicity. At the time of the invasion Nussbaum was twelve.

The Klein family was able to elude deportation because they were only part Jewish, claiming that Mrs. Klein was not Jewish at all.  After that claim was accepted by the German authorities, only Nussbaum's father had to wear the yellow star on his clothing.  The rest moved about society without issue.  This is the subject of her forthcoming book ''Shedding Our Stars: A Story of Hans Calmeyer and How He Saved Thousands of Families Like Mine.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shedding Our Stars: The Story of Hans Calmeyer and How He Saved Thousands of Families Like Mine|last=Nussbaum|first=Laureen|publisher=She Writes Press|year=2019|isbn=9781631526367|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref>

Nussbaum first met her future husband Rudi Nussbaum in Amsterdam, and acted as liaison for him while he was in hiding. Rudi hid for four years before the war ended, at first living with Dutch peasants, then in the countryside, and finally in the Klein home. The two married in 1947, two years after the war had ended. Of the experience Nussbaum stated "I would not have chosen, at the age of 13 or 14, a deep sense of obligation that someone was dependent upon you. But in all situations in life, you have to rise to the occasion. We decided the other person was decent and worth it."<ref name=Duin1/>

==Life in America==
In 1955, Nussbaum, along with her husband and children, spent a year in Indiana, where Rudi did post-doctoral research.<ref name=Duin1/> Together Nussbaum and Rudi had three children; two sons and one daughter.<ref name=obit2>{{cite news|title=Rudi H.

In 1959, Rudi gained a position at [[Portland State University]] and the family moved to Portland, Oregon.<ref name=Duin1>{{cite news|last=Duin|first=Steve|title=Rudi Nussbaum and his wife, Laureen: A couple who rose to the occasion|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/steve_duin/index.ssf/2011/10/rudi_nussbaum_and_his_wife_lau.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=Oregon Live|date=17 October 2011}}</ref> While teaching part time at the same institution, Nussbaum acquired her Ph.D. and eventually a full time position in the Foreign Languages and Literature department, where she became [[Professor Emerita]] in 1989.<ref name=millers1>{{cite web|title=SATURDAY, APRIL 5|url=http://www.millersville.edu/holocon/files/conference_programs/2003.pdf|publisher=Millersville University|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

On July 22, 2011, Nussbaum's husband Rudi died after taking a fall in the Amsterdam Airport while the two were on holiday. After his funeral, he was cremated in Holland. The funeral was followed by a memorial service at the University Place Hotel and Conference Center in Portland.<ref name=RUDIdeath1>{{cite web|title=Oregon PSR Honors the Memory of Dr. Rudi Nussbaum|url=http://www.psr.org/chapters/oregon/news/oregon-psr-honors-the-memory.html|publisher=PSR|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>
