Brabazon was descended from an [[England|English]] family that was seated in [[Leicestershire]] from the reign of the [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], and came to Ireland in the 1530s.<ref>William Courthope, ''Debrett's Complete Peerage of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'' (J. G. & F. Rivington, 1838), 529.</ref> He was the son of [[Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee|Edward Brabazon]] and Mary Smythe, daughter of Thomas Smythe, [[Clerk of the Green Cloth]].   His father had been created [[Baron Ardee]] in 1616. His grandfather, also [[William Brabazon (Lord Justice of Ireland)|William Brabazon]], had served as Vice-Treasurer of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] for 23 years and the family owned large estates there. 

Brabazon was knighted in 1604 by [[James I of England|James I]]. On 7 August 1625 he succeeded his father as [[Baron Ardee]].<ref>''Cracroft's Peerage The Complete Guide to the British Peerage & Baronetage'' - 'Meath, Earl of (I, 1627)' http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/meath1627.htm</ref> He was made a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] in 1627 and held various appointments in the government of Ireland. He also served as [[Custos Rotulorum]] of [[County Dublin]]. On 16 April 1627 he was created '''Earl of Meath''' in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], with remainder in default of male heirs to his brother Sir Anthony Brabazon and his male heirs.<ref>John Debrett, ''Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (1836), 432. </ref>  In 1631 at [[Kilruddery House]] (which is still the family home) he hosted the marriage of his widowed sister Elizabeth to [[John Bramston the Elder|Sir John Bramston]],  the [[Lord Chief Justice]] (a marriage which his father had forbidden many years earlier, but of which her brother evidently approved).  In 1644, at the height of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Brabazon was sent by the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] to the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] court at [[Oxford]] to consult with [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He was subsequently taken prisoner by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for 11 months.

He married Jane Bingley (died 1644), the daughter of Sir [[John Bingley (MP)|John Bingley]] MP, Comptroller of the Musters and Cheques,  and his first wife Anne Henshaw, and together they had one son, Edward.<ref>''Cracroft's Peerage The Complete Guide to the British Peerage & Baronetage'' - 'Meath, Earl of (I, 1627)' http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/meath1627.htm</ref> Edward succeeded his father in his titles in 1651.<ref>John Debrett, ''Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (1836), 432. </ref>
