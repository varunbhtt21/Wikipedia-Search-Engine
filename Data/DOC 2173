Fails [[WP:GNG]]. Ureferenced article and only external link points to a fansite.

[https://www.google.com/search?q=baby+puss+flintstones&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&ie=&oe=#q=hoppy+flintstones&rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&safe=off Google search] provides no links within the first three pages of results that meet [[WP:GNG]], instead providing links to fan wikis, YouTube videos and video game FAQs/walkthroughs. 

The character appeared in a game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], but this does not meet GNG #1. [[User:AldezD|AldezD]] ([[User talk:AldezD|talk]]) 18:25, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge''' to [[The_Flintstones#Characters]] (or break that section out into a new characters page with all these less-notable characters). There are a few sources briefly mentioning the character and various merchandising, but no in-depth coverage. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 11:35, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge'''-as said above-I don't even remember this character in the show at all! [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 22:48, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
