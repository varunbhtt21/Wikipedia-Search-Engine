Title : New York International Piano Competition
Text : The '''New York International Piano Competition''' (NYIPC) in New York City is a biennial piano competition open to pianists of all nationalities ages 16–21.<ref>http://www.stecherandhorowitz.org/competition/</ref> No contestant is eliminated during the competition's four rounds. A cash award is also presented to each of the contestants not receiving a major prize. The NYIPC has been held at the [[Manhattan School of Music]] since its inception in 2002, with opening ceremonies at [[Steinway Hall]]. [[Steinway and Sons]] is the official piano of the competition.

Rather than a traditional competition model where the focus is on winning, the NYIPC provides an opportunity for contestants to perform, network, exchange information, and cultivate a support system that will sustain them through their pre-professional years.

== History ==
Sponsored by the [[Stecher and Horowitz Foundation]], the competition was instituted in 2002 as an outgrowth of the Stecher and Horowitz School of the Arts in Cedarhurst, New York. The competition was originally open to American pianists, citizen-born, naturalized or full-time international students with student visas, ages 14–18. In 2009, the competition began to accept applications worldwide, effective the summer of 2010; it also expanded its age category upwards from 14–18 years to 16–21 years.<ref>http://www.hemsingpr.com/artist/the-new-york-international-piano-competition.php</ref>
