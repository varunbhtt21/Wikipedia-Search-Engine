:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Hello. On the hook, consider whether this format would be more interesting:
:: '''ALT1''' ... that Kashmiri politician '''[[Abdul Sattar Ranjoor‎]]''' was also a famous poet and was assassinated by militants at age 73?
::* On the review criteria:
:::- New - Yes, the article was created on May 1
:::- Long enough – Yes, the prose portion is 1,576 characters
:::- is neutral - Yes, although it would be better to specify a specific group rather than "militants"
:::- cites sources with inline citations - Yes
:::- is free of close paraphrasing issues, copyright violations and plagiarism - yes for the sources I could access
::: - Hook - is 112 characters (suggested alternate is 128 characters)
:::- Hook facts - they all are cited
:::- QPQ – ??? (sorry, I have not figured out how to tell this yet)
::* Fact checking the article:
:::* NB sources 1, 3, 4, 6 and 11 are not available online so I have not been able to check against them and source 8 is viewable but would not show for me (source 8 is important because it alleges fraud on the part of his opponent's party)
:::* source 2 says party's founding secretary, not state secretary
:::* source 5 says he was a noted poet but doesn't specify he wrote in Urdu
:::* there is a date discrepancy to fix - source 5 says he was killed on April 8, 1990 but the article says (unsourced) that is was March 23
:::* also source 5 spells his home village as Keegam Shopian while the article has Kegem Shopian. We don't have an article for the place either way so why not match the source?
:::* the article says he was shot and killed instantly but the source given for it (source 5) does not mention either fact
:::* sources 9 and 10 do not confirm the statements in the article (his third-place finishes in elections and number of votes) because they only give data for the first and second place candidates
:::* should there be redirects for the alternate spellings seen in some sources, such as Abdul Sattar Ranjur?

:::::*Thanks for the feedback. Some comments:
:::::*"source 2 says party's founding secretary, not state secretary" - It is clear from context that it refers to being the founding secretary of the Kashmir branch of the party. Since he was born in 1917, he could not have founded the CPI (in 1920 or 1925).
:::::*April 8 is not mention in source 5. It is the date the article was published online, but do keep in mind that New Age is a weekly print newspaper, so it would not be uploaded on their website on the same day as the event.
:::::*"also source 5 spells his home village as Keegam Shopian while the article has Kegem Shopian." - I've seen various different spellings. In the end it's an arbritrary choice, since there is no 100% right nor wrong in transliteration. The same applies to his name, it is written in many different styles. It wouldn't be of much help to list or redirect from all.
:::::*The reference for shot and killed, see source 4 "Abdul Satar Ranjoor, Ex General Secretary, Communist Party's State Unit. On March 23, 1990 at Kigam, Shopian, he was shot dead when a gang of terrorists forced their way into his house" and source 1 "He died immediately". Source 5 has the passage "assassinated by militants on this day in 1990 at his native hamlet Keegam Shopian." (which in no way contradicts source 1 or 4). --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 19:10, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::*For the election results, you have to check further below in sources 9 and 10, in the detailed constituency results. There you will find all candidates. --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 19:26, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::*Source 8 (now 9, after some expansion) says "The elections in 1962 were so throughly rigged that Bakshi's hand-chosen National Conference candidates won seventy out of seventy-five seats. Nehru was prompted to tell him: 'In fact, it would strengthen your position much more if you lost a few seats to bonafide opponents.'83" --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 19:26, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::* The following is another review in response to the nominator's reply, above.--[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 13:14, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
::::::* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Review '''for ALT1''': New enough (for 1 May) and long enough. QPQ OK. No problem with disambig links or external links. Although I prefer the original hook because it's more punchy, I have struck it because the nominator's explanations of the citations/sources do not appear to fully back it up. ALT1 is backed up by online citation #12. There are no problems with disambig links or with external links. Notes: (1) The article is no longer an orphan so the orphan template can be removed. (2) The article needs subheadings, such as "Early years", "Elections" and "Retirement" or similar; this will trigger an automatic index which will make the article look less like a stub. It would be nice if you could do this, however it is not necessary to deal with (1) and (2) to get the nomination promoted for DYK.--[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 13:14, 2 June 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
