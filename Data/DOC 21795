'''''Monuments to an Elegy''''' is the ninth studio album by American [[alternative rock]] band [[The Smashing Pumpkins]],<ref name=rollingstone_newalbums>{{cite web|last=Blistein|first=Jon|title=Smashing Pumpkins to Release 2 Albums, 'Monuments to an Elegy' and 'Day for Night,' in 2015|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/smashing-pumpkins-to-release-two-albums-in-2015-20140325|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref> released on December 5, 2014. Band leader [[Billy Corgan]] has noted that—similar to the band's previous release, ''[[Oceania (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Oceania]]''—the album was the final part of the  project, ''[[Teargarden by Kaleidyscope]]'', due to cancellation of the project in 2018 by Corgan.<ref name=stereogum_interview>{{cite web|last=Leas|first=Ryan|title=Inside Baseball With Billy Corgan: The Smashing Pumpkins Head On Adore, MACHINA, And The End Of Teargarden|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1698954/inside-baseball-with-billy-corgan-the-smashing-pumpkins-leader-on-adore-machina-and-the-end-of-teargarden-by-kaleidyscope/interviews/|work=[[Stereogum]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, but sold poorly compared to the band's previous albums, peaking at number 33 in the U.S. and number 59 in the U.K., thus making it (at the time) their lowest charting album in both regions since their debut, ''[[Gish]]'' (1991).

== Background ==
On March 25, 2014, the band announced that they had signed a record deal with record label [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. The band's next two albums would be part of the deal: ''Monuments to an Elegy'' and ''Day for Night''.<ref name=blabbermouth_bmgdeal>{{cite web|title=SMASHING PUMPKINS Sign Artist Services Deal With BMG|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/smashing-pumpkins-sign-artist-services-deal-with-bmg/|work=[[Blabbermouth]]|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>

On April 29, The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman [[Billy Corgan]] stated that the band had chosen the top songs for the album, and that they would be spending the following three days on [[drum kit|drum tracking]], [[singing|vocal arrangements]], lyrics and tweaking of the songs.<ref name=blabbermouth_tracklisting>{{cite web|title=SMASHING PUMPKINS: 'Monuments To An Elegy' Tentative Track Listing Revealed|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/smashing-pumpkins-monuments-to-an-elegy-tentative-track-listing-revealed/|work=Blabbermouth|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref> Corgan described the album's planned sound as being "guitars, guitars, guitars, and more guitars; but more so on the epic side of things than say, grossly metallic."<ref name=crave_newalbums>{{cite web|last=Firecloud|first=Johnny|title=Smashing Pumpkins Announce Two New Albums: ‘Monuments To An Elegy’ and ‘Day For Night’|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/665913-smashing-pumpkins-announce-two-new-albums-monuments-to-an-elegy-and-day-for-night|work=[[Crave Online]]|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>

To the suggestion that ''Monuments…'' is "a very Smashing Pumpkins-like album", Corgan responded, "I think people are hearing an emotional quality that reminds them of [[Siamese Dream|something in the past]]. By extension, they assume I'm trying to get back there. But the truth is the opposite – I stopped trying to avoid it. I went off to have this [[Hermann Hesse]]-style spiritual journey through different sounds and subcultures. And then I came home, and allowed myself to make the music I might naturally make."<ref>Pattison, Louis: "Q&A", ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', January 2015, p67</ref>

The album earned generally positive reviews. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it holds an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 70 out of 100, which indicates "generally favorable", based on 31 reviews.<ref name=metacritic/> 

"Nine ass-booting pop metal [[Bullet with Butterfly Wings|bullets]] with [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]] wings," marvelled ''Classic Rock''. "It's not just the most svelte, direct and immediate Pumpkins album ever, it's the most misleadingly titled – these are no funeral dirges, but songs of redemption, recovery and romance, drizzled with [[synth-pop]] and hooks that could send [[Clover (creature)|Cloverfield]] to [[Wrestling ring|the canvas]]."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mark|last=Beaumont|title=The Hard Stuff: Albums|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|date=February 2015|p=95}}</ref>

''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'' stated the album "...is certainly the easiest Pumpkins record to listen to since their original reformation in 2006. It acts as something of a midpoint in sound between ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' and 2003's [[Zwan]] album, ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)|Mary Star of the Sea]]''. This brevity helps to make it such an effortless listen."<ref name=diymag_review /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Kory Grow described it as a "deep dive into synth pop", and "a surprise" yet authentic because of "Corgan's characteristically acid vocals".<ref name="rolling stone review"/>
