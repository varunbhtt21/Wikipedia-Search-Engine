'''Hans Hinrich''' (1903–1974) was a German [[actor]] and [[film director]]. As well as Germany, he also worked in Italy where he was usually credited as '''Giovanni Hinrich'''.

Hinrich was a noted [[theatre director]], before moving into film direction in 1932. Hinrich was of [[Jewish]] heritage, although he converted to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]]. While he was initially granted permission to continue working following the [[Nazi]] takeover of Germany, he found it increasingly difficult and moved to Italy following the production of ''[[Freight from Baltimore]]'' (1938). During the [[Fascist era]] he made several films such as the historical ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (1940 film)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' (1940).<ref>Moudarres & Moudarres p.115-116</ref> When Hinrich was threatened with dismissal from the 1941 film ''[[Il vetturale del San Gottardo]]'', several of his actors including [[Osvaldo Valenti]] secured a reversal of the decision by protesting their support for him.<ref>Lehman & Grieb p.181</ref>

After the war he switched to acting, making his screen debut in the 1946 [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] film ''[[Before Him All Rome Trembled]]'' and also appearing in ''[[Les Misérables (1948 film)|Les Misérables]]'' (1948). He later returned to his native Germany.
