'''Gottlob Alexander Sauerweid''' (Russian: '''Александр Иванович Зауервейд'''; 19 February 1783, [[Courland|Kurland]] - 25 October 1844, [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[Baltic German]] painter who taught [[military art|battle painting]] at the Russian [[Imperial Academy of Arts]].

== Biography ==
In 1795, when Kurland was annexed by Russia, his family moved to Germany where he received his artistic training at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] from 1806 to 1812.<ref name="BD">[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/88258/%D0%97%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B4 Short biography from the Большая советская энциклопедия]</ref> As a young man, he enjoyed some popularity and produced a series of horse portraits, commissioned by [[Napoleon]]. He later went to Paris, travelling most of the way on foot for lack of funds, then to London, where his talent for painting battle scenes was recognized. In 1814, Czar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] invited him to Saint Petersburg to paint official portraits of Russian troops and their uniforms. In 1825, he became the first Painter of the General Staff.<ref name="BD"/>

In 1827, he was named an honorary member of the Imperial Academy and soon became head of the battle painting class. Later he was elevated to full Professor.<ref name="BD"/> Under Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], he was Art Instructor for the Grand Dukes [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich|Konstantin]], [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831-1891)|Nicholas]] and [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Michael]]. 

Most of his paintings were displayed in the Imperial Palaces, rather than in exhibitions. The majority are still there. His sense of [[Perspective (art)|perspective]] has been criticized, but his horses are considered to be particularly well done. In addition to oil paintings, he left behind many watercolors, etchings and drawings in pen. His son [[Nikolay Sauerweid|Nikolay]] also became a painter of military scenes.
