The '''CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|2672}}) is a bill that would amend the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] to direct the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) to establish an application process that would allow a person to get their county designated as "rural" for purposes of a federal consumer financial law.<ref name="2672sum"/> One practical effect of having a county designated "rural" is that people can qualify for some types of mortgages by getting them exempted from the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule.<ref name="HouseExIRS"/><ref name=BankersWeb>{{cite web|title=Dodd-Frank Dispatch: “Rural Area” Designation Would Provide Consumer Financial Protection Laws Relief|url=http://www.bankersweb.com/headlines/article/rural-area-designation-consumer-financial-protection-laws-relief|publisher=BankersWEB.com|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=17 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182042/http://www.bankersweb.com/headlines/article/rural-area-designation-consumer-financial-protection-laws-relief|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes}}</ref> 

The bill was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
{{main|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau}}

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is an [[independent agency of the United States government]] responsible for [[consumer protection]] in the [[financial industry|financial sector]]. Its jurisdiction includes [[bank]]s, [[credit union]]s, securities firms, [[payday lender]]s, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, [[debt collector]]s and other financial companies operating in the [[United States]].

The CFPB's creation was authorized by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and the subsequent [[Great Recession]].<ref name="WSOFP">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703507804576130370862263258?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Warning Shot On Financial Protection |accessdate=2011-02-10|date=2011-02-09|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Eaglesham, Jean}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

The CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act would amend the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] to direct the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) to establish an application process under which a person who lives or does business in a state may apply to have a [[County (United States)|county]] designated as a rural area for purposes of a federal consumer financial law.<ref name="2672sum"/>

The bill would prescribe criteria for the CFPB to consider when evaluating such an application.<ref name="2672sum"/>

The bill would require the CFPB to enter each such application into a sortable, downloadable database publicly accessible through its website.<ref name="2672sum"/>

==Procedural history==
The CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on July 11, 2013 by [[Andy Barr (U.S. politician)|Rep. Garland "Andy" Barr (R, KY-6)]].<ref name=2672allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 2672 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2672/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] and the [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit]].<ref name="2672allactions"/> The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.<ref name=HouseExIRS>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}</ref>

==Debate and discussion==
The [[National Association of Federal Credit Unions]] (NAFCU) supported the bill, arguing that the bill "would be helpful to small creditors, including credit unions, offering mortgages with balloon-payment features in underserved areas, because it would allow them to satisfy the rule’s 'ability to repay' requirements."<ref name=NAFCU17mar>{{cite web|title=House panel OKs 'rural designation' bill|url=http://www.nafcu.org/News/2014_News/March/House_panel_OKs__rural_designation__bill/|publisher=NAFCU|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=17 March 2014}}</ref> The NAFCU thought that the application process described by this bill would make "the process for obtaining a rural designation fairer and more transparent."<ref name="NAFCU17mar"/>

The [[Conference of State Bank Supervisors]] (CSBS) wrote a letter in support of the bill, arguing that "certain aspects of lending should not be regulated with a nationwide, broad brush approach, and must necessarily provide for local flexibility."<ref name=csbsletter>{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=John W.|title=Letter from the CSBS to the House Financial Services Committee|url=http://www.csbs.org/legislative/Documents/CSBSLetterofSupportforHR2672Dec42013.pdf|publisher=Conference of State Bank Supervisors|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=4 December 2013}}</ref> According to the CSBS, the current method of designating a county as "rural" is "formulaic" and is "inflexible when applied to counties with atypical population distributions or geographic boundaries" thus necessitating a more nuanced approach.<ref name="csbsletter"/>
