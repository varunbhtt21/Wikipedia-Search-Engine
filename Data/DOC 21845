In November, sisters stated that their mother Anthea had cancer. The group disbanded three months later after their mother died. They wrote: "We are so incredibly heartbroken & devastated that our beautiful mom Anthea passed away after fighting an extremely tough battle with pancreatic cancer. She was our best friend and inspiration, & the most caring, loving, selfless, kind hearted person we could ever imagine. After much thought & consideration, we have decided not to carry on with our girl group and making music, & to close this chapter in our lives, even though it was just the beginning and we hadn't released music in the US yet. We're soo sorry to anyone we're disappointing, but during these extremely difficult past few months, our hopes and dreams for the future have changed. We'll never forget the amazing memories we made as a music group while it lasted, & we're so happy we had the chance to meet & talk to such genuinely sweet and supportive fans like you guys. Thank u soo much to all of you who have ever written us a nice message, sent us well wishes, prayed for us or our mom, or supported us in some way. We are so grateful. We love you" on February 14, 2015. They haven't released anything in US. As of February 2015, no statements were made by group.
