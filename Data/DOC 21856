Text : {{Context|date=May 2018}}

'''Jpred''' v.4 is the latest version of the JPred [[Protein]] Secondary Structure Prediction Server<ref>{{cite web|title=JPred4: A Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Server|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> which provides predictions by the JNet algorithm, one of the most accurate methods for secondary structure prediction,<ref name=DROZDETSKIY2015>{{cite journal|last1=Drozdetskiy|first1=Alexey|last2=Cole|first2=Chris|last3=Procter|first3=James|last4=Barton|first4=Geoffrey|title=JPred4: a protein secondary structure prediction server|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Apr 16, 2015|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv332|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/16/nar.gkv332|volume=43|pages=W389–W394|pmid=25883141|pmc=4489285}}</ref> that has existed since 1998 in different versions.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/old_news.shtml | title=JPred old news | date=Oct 25, 1998 | accessdate=16 Jul 2015}}</ref>

In addition to protein secondary structure, JPred also makes predictions of solvent accessibility and coiled-coil regions. The JPred service runs up to 134 000 jobs per month and has carried out over 2 million predictions in total for users in 179 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=JPred4 statistics|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/stats.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>

The current version of JPred (v4) has the following improvements and updates incorporated:
* Retrained on the latest UniRef90 and SCOPe/ASTRAL version of Jnet (v2.3.1) - mean secondary structure prediction accuracy of >82%.<ref name=DROZDETSKIY2015/>
* Upgraded the Web Server to the latest technologies (Bootstrap framework, JavaScript) and updating the web pages – improving the design and usability through implementing responsive technologies.
* Added RESTful API and mass-submission and results retrieval scripts - resulting in peak throughput above 20,000 predictions per day.<ref>{{cite web|title=JPred4 RESTful API|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/api.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>
* Added prediction jobs monitoring tools.<ref>{{cite web|title=JPred4 monitoring tools|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/monitor.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>
* Upgraded the results reporting – both, on the web-site, and through the optional email summary reports: improved batch submission, added results summary preview through Jalview results visualization summary in SVG and adding full multiple sequence alignments into the reports.
* Improved help-pages, incorporating tool-tips, and adding one-page step-by-step tutorials.<ref>{{cite web|title=JPred4 Help and Tutorials|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/help.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>

The JPred v3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred3/index.html|title=JPred3: previous version of JPred|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> followed on from previous versions of JPred developed and maintained by James Cuff and Jonathan Barber (see JPred References<ref>{{cite web|title=JPred4 references|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/refs.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>). This release added new functionality and fixed lots of bugs. The highlights are:
* New, friendlier user interface
* Retrained and optimised version of Jnet (v2) - mean secondary structure prediction accuracy of >81%
* Batch submission of jobs
* Better error checking of input sequences/alignments
* Predictions now (optionally) returned via e-mail
* Users may provide their own query names for each submission
* JPred now makes a prediction even when there are no PSI-BLAST hits to the query
* PS/PDF output now incorporates all the predictions

The static HTML pages of JPred 2 are still available for reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/legacy/|title=JPred2: legacy|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>

Sequence residues are categorised or assigned to one of the secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helix, beta-sheet and coiled-coil.

Jnet uses two neural networks for its prediction. The first network is fed with a window of 17 residues over each amino acid in the alignment plus a conservation number. It uses a hidden layer of nine nodes and has three output nodes, one for each secondary structure element.
The second network is fed with a window of 19 residues (the result of first network) plus the conservation number. It has a hidden layer with nine nodes and has three output nodes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10861942 | volume=40 | title=Application of multiple sequence alignment profiles to improve protein secondary structure prediction | date=August 2000 | journal=Proteins | pages=502–11 | last1 = Cuff | first1 = JA | last2 = Barton | first2 = GJ | doi=10.1002/1097-0134(20000815)40:3<502::aid-prot170>3.0.co;2-q}}</ref>
