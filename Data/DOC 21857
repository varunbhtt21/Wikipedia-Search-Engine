'''Auchagallon Stone Circle''' or '''Auchengallon cairn''' is the remains of a Neolithic or Bronze Age burial cairn, surrounded by a circle of fifteen stones. It is located near [[Machrie]] on the [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]] ({{gbmapping|NR89293464}}).

==Description==
The cairn and stone circle is situated on a slight ledge of a west-facing slope,<ref name="rcahms1">{{Canmore |num=39228 |desc=Arran, Auchengallon |access-date=1 May 2014}}</ref> overlooking Machrie Bay.<ref name="histscot">{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=SM90023|desc=Auchengallon,cairn 150m WSW of|access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref> The circle comprises fifteen blocks varying in height from 0.5 metres to 2.3 metres. The stones are of red sandstone, except two which are a pale grey granite. The circle has a maximum diameter of 14.5 metres.

In the centre is a large stone cairn. Antiquarians digging here in the 19th century found a burial cist in the centre, although there are no records of any other remains. Although the monument is now called a stone circle, it was probably built as a kerbed cairn.<ref name="histscot"/>
