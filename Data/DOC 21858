'''Operation Kingpin''' was part of the run-up to [[Operation Torch]], the planned [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[North Africa]] during [[World War II]]. It was a successor to [[Operation Flagpole (World War II)|Operation Flagpole]], in which a secret meeting between U.S. General [[Mark W. Clark]] and diplomat [[Robert Daniel Murphy|Robert Murphy]], representing the Allies, and [[Charles Mast|General Charles E. Mast]], the leader of a group of pro-Allied [[Vichy France]] officers in [[French North Africa]], was arranged to secure their cooperation with the invasion. In Operation Kingpin, French General [[Henri Giraud]], code-named "Kingpin", was released from confinement and brought to [[Gibraltar]] to meet with Operation Torch commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Clark in order to secure his cooperation with the invasion.

==Background==
[[File:Henri Giraud 1943Jan19.gif|thumb|left|215px|General [[Henri Giraud]], the subject of Operation Kingpin]]

General Giraud was under house arrest by the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] at [[Toulon]] in southern France for his anti-Nazi leanings. Giraud was already planning for the day when American troops landed in France. He had agreed to support an Allied landing in [[French North Africa]], provided that only American troops were used, and that he or another French officer was the commander of the operation. He considered this latter condition essential to maintaining French sovereignty and authority over the [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] natives of North Africa.

Giraud designated [[General Charles Mast]] as his representative in [[Algeria]]. At a secret meeting on October 23 with U.S. General [[Mark W. Clark]] and diplomat [[Robert Daniel Murphy|Robert Murphy]], the result of Operation Flagpole, the invasion was agreed on, but the Americans promised only that Giraud would be in command "as soon as possible". Giraud, still in France, responded with a demand for a written commitment that he would be commander within 48 hours of the landing, and for landings in France as well as North Africa. Giraud also insisted that he could not leave France before November 20.<ref>Murphy, pp. 115-122</ref> However, Giraud was persuaded that he had to go earlier.

==The Operation==
[[File:Seraph.jpg|thumb|right|325px|HMS ''Seraph'']]

On October 26, 1942, Captain [[Jerauld Wright]] of the [[United States Navy]] was directed to take part in the mission to extract Giraud, code-named Operation Kingpin. Because Giraud flatly refused to deal with the British, and there were no American [[submarine]]s within {{convert|3000|mi|km|-2}}, [[Winston Churchill]] devised a subterfuge to appease the French general.<ref>Churchill, p. 544</ref> {{HMS|Seraph|P219|6}}, under the command of Lieutenant [[Norman Jewell|Norman "Bill" Jewell]], briefly became "USS ''Seraph''", flying the U.S. Navy ensign. Nominally, the sub came under the command of Wright, although Jewell took care of actual operations. In the spirit of things the British crew affected American accents that they imitated from the movies. Of course, it fooled nobody—including Giraud, who had been told of the deception by Wright.

As Captain G. B. H. Fawkes of the [[Royal Navy]], the commander of 8th Submarine Flotilla in the Mediterranean, noted:

<blockquote>It was, I think, unique in the history of the two nations that a United States Naval officer should be placed in nominal command of a British submarine thereby making her the only warship on active duty to be commanded by two captains.</blockquote>

On October 27, ''Seraph'' had been ordered to set sail to the coast of southern France for a secret rendezvous. ''Seraph'' was ordered to patrol up and down the coast until she received a signal giving her the name of the port from which she was to pick up her passengers. She arrived  at a location some {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} east of [[Toulon]] on October 30, and on November 5 the boat took onboard Giraud, his son, and three staff officers. Two days later, her charges were transferred to a [[PBY Catalina]] [[flying boat]] that was sent from Gibraltar to search for her after they lost contact with the sub due to a problem with her main radio. The Catalina proceeded to the Operation Torch headquarters on Gibraltar, where Giraud's meeting with Generals Eisenhower and Clark would take place.<ref>Murphy, pp. 153–163</ref><ref>[http://home.cogeco.ca/~gchalcraft/sm/seraph.html "HMS ''Seraph''"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630212310/home.cogeco.ca/~gchalcraft/sm/seraph.html |date=2012-06-30 }} ''British Submarines of World War Two''</ref>

==Results of the meeting==

At the meeting, Eisenhower asked Giraud to assume command of French troops in North Africa during Operation Torch and direct them to join the Allies. But Giraud had expected to command the whole operation &ndash; the job which had been given to Eisenhower &ndash; and adamantly refused to participate on any other basis. He said "his honor would be tarnished" and "Giraud will be a spectator in this affair.<ref name="Ike">Eisenhower, Dwight. ''Crusade In Europe''. New York: Doubleday, 1948. pp. 99-105, 107-110</ref> However, by the next morning, Giraud relented. He refused to leave immediately for [[Algiers]], but rather stayed in Gibraltar until November 9.<ref>Price, G. Ward. ''Giraud and the African Scene''. MacMillan. New York, NY, 1944. p. 260</ref>

Pro-Allied elements in Algeria had agreed to support the Allied landings, and in fact seized [[Algiers]] on the night of November 7–8; the city was then occupied by Allied troops. However, resistance continued at [[Oran]] and [[Casablanca]]. Giraud flew to Algiers on November 9, but his attempt to assume command of French forces was rebuffed; his broadcast directing French troops to cease resistance and join the Allies was ignored.<ref name="Ike"/>

Instead, it appeared that Admiral [[François Darlan]], who happened to be in Algiers, had real authority. Even Giraud realized this. Despite Darlan's Vichyite reputation, the Allies recognized him as head of French forces, and he ordered the French to cease fire and join the Allies on November 10.<ref name="Ike"/>

On November 11, German forces [[Case Anton|occupied southern France]]. Negotiations continued in Algiers; by November 13, Darlan was recognized as high commissioner of French North and West Africa, while Giraud was appointed commander of all French forces under Darlan. All this took place without reference to the [[Free French Forces|Free French]] organization of [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles De Gaulle]], which had claimed to be the legitimate government of France in exile.

Then on December 24, Darlan was assassinated under mysterious circumstances.<ref>Churchill, p. 577</ref> With the strong backing of the Allies, especially Eisenhower, Giraud was elected to succeed him.{{citation needed|date= January 2017}}

==Aftermath of Operation Kingpin==
Captain Jerauld Wright was awarded his first [[Legion of Merit]] in recognition of his participation in Operation Kingpin. The citation read, in part: "For meritorious service of a high degree in connection with a mission by submarine to Algeria, and negotiations with the French near that city prior to the occupation of North Africa by Allied Forces.  In this duty he displayed good judgment, tact, and soldiery qualities that reflect great credit to the United States Navy."<ref>Jerauld Wright official biography</ref>
