==Plot==
Old Dr. Schroeder (Martin Miller), who has been struck off, attends a late night chemist every night for a prescription, and to observe Dr. Leichner (Anton Diffring), an ex-Nazi war criminal who has taken a new identity. Leichner, we discover, has a blonde wife (Sylva Langova), and a blonde mistress (Jacqueline Jones), who is blackmailing him. He is also involved in a drug scam involving two lockers and two keys, and aims to become a millionaire selling drugs. Meanwhile, a wounded bank robber has been taken to the dispensary for treatment, and to rendezvous with his gang leader. Old Dr. Schroeder finds himself attending to the robber's injuries.

==Critical reception==
''[[Sky Movies]]'' wrote that the "harsh black-and-white photography effectively catches the bleak, claustrophobic atmosphere of the all-night chemist's in which some of the drama is set";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sky.com/tv/movie/incident-at-midnight-1963|title=Incident at Midnight|publisher=}}</ref> while [[Leonard Maltin]] rated it two stars, calling it a "trim yarn."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fttJBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT257&lpg=PT257&dq=incident%20at%20midnight%20edgar%20wallace%20short%20story&source=bl&ots=GYu6XakBpq&sig=b2-QgkuvArJT4BStO9Ho-VoB23E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimm-bw66vRAhVLLsAKHYu-DiUQ6AEINTAF#v=onepage&q=incident%20at%20midnight%20edgar%20wallace%20short%20story&f=false|title=Turner Classic Movies Presents Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide: From the Silent Era Through 1965: Third Edition|first=Leonard|last=Maltin|date=29 September 2015|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books}}</ref>
