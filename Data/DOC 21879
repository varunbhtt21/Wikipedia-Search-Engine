'''José de Jesús Rodríguez Martínez''' (born 22 January 1981) is a Mexican [[professional golfer]] who currently plays on the [[PGA Tour]]. Prior to joining the PGA Tour, he played on the [[Web.com Tour]], [[PGA Tour Canada]], [[PGA Tour Latinoamérica]], and the [[Tour de las Américas]].<ref name=ptla /><ref name=webprofile>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.32058.jose-de-jesus-rodriguez.html/profile |title=Web.com Tour – Player Profile |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=pgatc>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourcanada.com/leagues/Cantour_Player.cfm?clientid=3776&leagueid=0&seasonnum=2014&playerid=1207 |title=PGA Tour Canada – Player Profile |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref>

==Background==
Rodríguez grew up in poverty in [[Irapuato, Mexico]]. He was one of seven siblings who slept shoulder-to-shoulder on the dirt floor of their one-room, bathroom-less adobe home. At the age of 12, he dropped out of school and began caddying full-time at Club de Golf Santa Margarita. That club is where he learned to golf. At the age of 15, Rodríguez crossed into the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande river. He worked in the U.S. for 10 years, mostly at a country club in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]] as part of the maintenance crew. He worked six or seven days per week and did not have the time or money to golf. 

Rodríguez sent most of his pay home to Irapuato, allowing his parents to build two homes on their piece of property. In 2006, at the age of 26, he returned to Irapuato, Mexico and began caddying again at Club de Golf Santa Margarita. Rodríguez ultimately met Alfonso Vallejo Esquivel, a wealthy club member, who saw his talent and offered to buy Rodríguez a membership at the course. Esquivel ultimately staked Rodríguez and allowed him to get his start as a pro golfer on the Mexican Tour in 2007.<ref name=journey>{{cite web |url=https://www.golf.com/news/news-features/2019/01/08/jose-de-jesus-rodriguez-long-hard-journey-to-the-pga-tour/ |date=8 January 2019 |access-date=11 January 2019 |first=Alan |last=Shipnuck |title=‘The most unbelievable story in golf’: A treacherous border crossing was just the beginning of José de Jesús Rodríguez’s journey to the PGA Tour |website=Golf.com}}</ref>

Rodríguez's nickname is Camarón (shrimp), because despite his complexion, his cheeks redden in the sun.<ref name=journey/>

==Professional career==
Rodríguez turned professional in 2007 and mainly played on the [[Mexican Tour]] during 2008, although he did make three starts on the [[Canadian Tour]] making the cut in all three. He achieved his first professional win in 2008 winning the event hosted in [[Puebla]] on the Mexican Tour.

In 2009, Rodríguez played an increased schedule on the Canadian Tour but failed to record a win in any events during the season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourcanada.com/leagues/Cantour_Player.cfm?clientid=3776&leagueid=0&seasonnum=2009&playerid=1207 |title=PGA Tour Canada – José de Jesús Rodríguez (2009) |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> His form on the Canadian Tour improved in 2010 where, despite a winless season, he achieved three top-three finishes in just eight starts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourcanada.com/leagues/Cantour_Player.cfm?clientid=3776&leagueid=0&seasonnum=2010&playerid=1207 |title=PGA Tour Canada – José de Jesús Rodríguez (2010) |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> His good form in 2010 was also apparent on the Mexican Tour in 2010 where he achieved four victories.<ref name=ptla />

2011 was a very successful season for Rodríguez on the Canadian Tour the where he won consecutive events at the [[Mexican PGA Championship]] and [[Times Colonist Island Savings Open]] and went on to win the Tour's Order of Merit.<ref name=pgatc /> During the 2011 season, Rodríguez also won two events on the Mexican Tour taking him to a total of four wins for the season.<ref name=ptla />

In 2012, Rodríguez was granted membership on the inaugural season of [[PGA Tour Latinoamérica]] though his performances on the Mexican Tour and also played a reduced schedule on PGA Tour Canada. Despite not winning on either of the two development tours Rodríguez was able to win another two events on the Mexican Tour during 2012.<ref name=ptla />

In 2013, Rodríguez predominantly played on PGA Tour Latinoamérica and achieved his first victory at the [[Roberto De Vicenzo Invitational Copa NEC]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourla.com/event/m2013006/?lg=en#.U2KfEFw37eI |title="Camarón" Rodríguez finally has his day to celebrate on Tour |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> which was quickly followed up with a second victory at the [[Arturo Calle Colombian Classic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourla.com/event/m2013013/?lg=en#.U2KfZVw37eI |title=Rodríguez claims second playoff win, extends lead as Tour No. 1 |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> These two victories helped Rodríguez to a second place finish on the Tour's Order of Merit for 2013 which earned his playing card for the [[Web.com Tour]] in 2014. During 2013, Rodríguez achieved a further four wins on the Mexican Tour taking his career haul to a record of 13 wins on the tour.<ref name=ptla />

Rodríguez had two wins on the PGA Tour Latinoamérica in 2017 and led the tour's Order of Merit, earning him a return to the Web.com Tour for 2018, this time with full status.

In April 2018, Rodríguez won the [[Web.com Tour]] [[United Leasing & Finance Championship]]. He ended the season with enough money to qualify for the [[2019 PGA Tour]]. He made three of his first five cuts on the PGA Tour.
