* ... that '''[[Mrs Howard Paul]]''' created the role of Lady Sangazure in ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]?
:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The article meets all criteria and looks good. My only qualm is that the hook doesn't seem particularly "hooky." What about something a little more bizarre, like:
::*... that '''[[Mrs Howard Paul]]''' sang the role of a woman "cruelly deceived by the Footman who wore false whiskers"?
::*... that '''[[Mrs Howard Paul]]''' was acclaimed for impersonating [[tenor]]s?
::Those are just suggestions, but you get the idea. Good luck with this one!--[[User:Lemuellio|Lemuellio]] ([[User talk:Lemuellio|talk]]) 14:43, 14 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Either of those ALTs are fine with me and Jack. Or, if you prefer:
:::*... that after originating the role of Lady Sangazure in ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', '''[[Mrs Howard Paul]]''' walked out of the cast of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' when her part was reduced? 
::: -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] ([[User talk:Ssilvers|talk]]) 15:38, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
::::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] An excellent suggestion! Any of the three work for me; you and Jack can choose whichever you like best. Well done!--[[User:Lemuellio|Lemuellio]] ([[User talk:Lemuellio|talk]]) 17:35, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] '''Approved''' with the following hook:
:::::*... that after originating the role of Lady Sangazure in ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', '''[[Mrs Howard Paul]]''' walked out of the cast of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' when her part was reduced?
