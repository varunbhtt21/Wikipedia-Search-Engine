His [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|championship]] career with the [[Clare GAA|Clare]] senior team lasted from 1914 until 1918.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.clarepeople.com/2013/10/11/tragic-three-goal-hero-from-1914-all-ireland/|title= Tragic three-goal hero from 1914 All-Ireland|date=11 October 2013|publisher=The Clare People|accessdate=1 May 2014|first=Joe|last=Ó Muircheartaigh}}</ref>

Born in Ballycar, [[County Clare]], Guerin first played competitive hurling in his youth. By the age of eighteen he had joined the [[Newmarket-on-Fergus GAA|Newmarket-on-Fergus]] senior team and won his first [[Clare Senior Hurling Championship|county senior championship]] medal in 1912, before winning a second medal in 1916. Guerin later joined the newly-formed [[Ballycar GAA|Ballycar]] club.

Guerin first played competitive inter-county hurling at the age of twenty when he was selected for the Clare senior team. After playing no part in the provincial championship, he made his debut in the [[1915 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|1915 All-Ireland final]]. Clare defeated [[Laois GAA|Laois]] on that occasion and Guerin won his only [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medal. He played his last game for Clare in September 1918.

Guerin died on 16 December 1918 as a result of the [[1918 flu pandemic]].
