'''Izabella Jadwiga Zielińska''' (née '''Ostaszewska'''; 10 December 1910 – 20 November 2017) was a Polish pianist and pedagogue with one of the longest artistic biographies in Poland, starting back in 1935.

==Life==
Izabella Jadwiga Ostaszewska was born in [[Klimkówka, Podkarpackie Voivodeship]] and attended primary school in [[Sanok]] and at the Lyceum of the [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] Convent in [[Lviv|Lvov]], graduating in 1929. She took piano lessons from Klaudia Rylska. In 1930 she went to [[Belgium]] to continue her education  in the Ursulines Institute at [[Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Waver|Wavre-Notre-Dame]], where she studied French and music.

In 1931 she passed her music examination with a gold medal before the panel of the [[Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp]] and the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. She returned to [[Lviv|Lvov]] for further piano study with Professor Bronisław Poźniak, and followed him when he moved to the city of [[Breslau]]. From 1935 onwards she performed in public under the name Iza Ostoia. Her concerts included compositions of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Frédéric François Chopin|Chopin]], [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]]. Having completed her studies with Poźniak in [[Breslau]] in the summer of 1939, she had returned home to [[Klimkówka, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Klimklówka]] in [[Poland]] just weeks before the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of the War in 1939.

In 1942 she married Bogdan Zieliński and moved to [[Kościan]], on the Polish territories incorporated directly to the [[Nazi Germany]], in 1939. There the Nazis enforced a clampdown on all Polish culture. Zielińska was forbidden from pursuing music and was forced into physical labour. Despite her ban, she had managed to teach some music in secret. After the War she resumed her concert career giving piano recitals and continued as a piano teacher. With five children to bring up, however, her concert career effectively had to take a back seat. She concentrated on her teaching, in which she became increasingly involved. She was a descendant of the Polish composer [[Michał Kleofas Ogiński]] and mother-in-law of the contemporary composer [[Lidia Zielińska]].<ref>[http://wielcy.pl/wgm/?m=NG&t=PN&n=sw.6750 Genealogy of the Descendants of the Great Sejm http://www.sejm-wielki.pl]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2016 she celebrated her 106th birthday.<ref name="Centenary">{{cite news|last=Ludowicz|first=Bogdan|title=106 urodziny Izabelli Zielińskiej|language=pl|publisher=Kościan.net|date=13 December 2016|url=http://www.koscian.net/106_urodziny_Izabelli_Zielinskiej,28693.html|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> Zielińska died on 20 November 2017, three weeks before her 107th birthday.<ref>http://koscian.naszemiasto.pl/artykul/w-wieku-107-lat-odeszla-izabella-zielinska,4323219,art,t,id,tm.html</ref>
