== History ==
=== Sarabia Family ===

Azteca Theater was one of the Mexican businesses owned by the Sarabia family aimed to preserve traditions and the language. The story of the Sarabia family in Houston goes back to 1919, when Jose Sarabia first left his native town Valle de Santiago in Guanajuato Mexico, to go to United States of America to seek better fortunes.<ref name=Kreneck />

Jose Sarabia came from a family of 5 children; Socorro, Felipe, Maria, Jesus and himself. Born and raised in Guanajuato Mexico. He was the only one with formal education, his father and uncles had done up until second grade. He wanted to go to United States of America, in order to do that, he moved to Juarez, Mexico with 87 cents on his behalf. After saving enough money to immigrate to Houston, which was 8 dollars, he decided to leave. Once in Houston, he worked as a gardener at [[Rice Institute]] until he gathered enough money to buy a book stand on Milan Street in the 400 block.<ref name=Sarabia>{{cite news|last=Sarabia|first=Alfredo|title=Back and Forth in the Promised Land|newspaper=HMRC.

The stand was doing well, and he convinced his brothers to move to the city to help him. In 1920 the siblings moved to help him to honor Jose's saying "In numbers there are strengths." His brother Felipe opened the second store in 711 Preston Street. However, in 1925 the store was burned.<ref name=Sarabia />

After the fire, the Sarabia family decided to move the business to a location in 1811 Congress Avenue. That store marked the beginning of the Mexican business in Houston. In this location, they used to sell "curio-products" besides books or religious artifacts. The store was the first location to offer ''huaraches'' to the Houstonians.<ref name=Sarabia /> 
Jose Sarabia saw the need of more businesses and places to gather the Mexican community. He wanted to have a doctor, a pharmacy, entertainment places, etc., to construct a Mexican colony in the city. The pharmacists of the community would be Mr. Canales, the dentist was Dr. Estrella and for entertainment, Jose Sarabia founded the Azteca Theater.<ref name=Sarabia />

=== Beginning ===

As the store business flourished, Jose Sarabia founded the Azteca Theater in 1927. It was located next to "La Libreria Hispano America," which was another venue to congregate Mexican People in Houston.<ref name="De Leon" /> It flourished over the Hidalgo Theater which operated a few blocks away for a short time.<ref name=Kreneck /> Azteca Theater was recognized as one of the most important theater for the Mexican community in the Bayou City<ref name=Kreneck />

The Theater used to appear frequently in the pages of [[La Gaceta Mexicana]], a free magazine in Spanish. They advertised upcoming shows, but also sought the unity among the Mexican and Latino Community with add that read "Protect Azteca theater, because with it, you are protecting Mexican cinematographic industry and that way, you help your ''paisanos'' and your country.<ref name=Unauthored>{{cite news|last=Unauthored|newspaper=Sociedad Union Fraternal.

=== Decline===

As the 1950s started, a new era for the Mexican ''colonia'' also arrived. The Latino community started moving to the suburbs in Linndale and Denver Harvor; to the north side of town. People followed the wave of boundary expansion and [[Mexican American]] business started losing their customers. The theater started losing its audience by mid-1950. What once was the Mexican district in Congress Avenue, ceased to exist. The Azteca Theater closed its doors in 1957.<ref name=Kreneck /> The theater changed its name, but the former clientele preferred to attend the English theaters by then. Years later, the Theater was demolished, and converted in a parking lot.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
