'''Zafir Premčević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Зафир Премчевић}}; 1872—1937) was a [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian Chetnik commander]] in [[Old Serbia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] during the [[Macedonian Struggle]], who also participated in the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]].

==Life==
Premčević was born in the village of [[Ljupšte]] in the [[Poreče]] region, at the time part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (now [[R. Macedonia]]). He joined the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]] and organized the first Serbian ''četa'' (band) in Poreče in March 1904, which he then submitted to the command of ''vojvoda'' (duke) [[Micko Krstić]]. Premčević was the assistant of Micko Krstić, and after Micko was returned by the Serbian Committee to Serbia, Premčević became ''vojvoda'' of a band in charge of pursuing the Albanian [[kachak]]s. He was an active guerilla fighter until 1908, when the [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw all rebels putting down their weapons. He participated in the [[Battle of Kumanovo]] in the detachment of ''vojvoda'' [[Vojin Popović-Vuk]]. He died in 1937.
