{{nihongo|'''Hirokazu Nagai'''|長井 弘和|''Nagai Hirokazu''|born November 10, 1968}}, better known as {{nihongo|'''Mitsuya Nagai'''|長井満也|''Nagai Mitsuya''}}, is a Japanese [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]], [[kickboxing|kickboxer]] and [[professional wrestler]]. He is known for his work in [[Fighting Network RINGS]] and later in pro wrestling companies like [[Battlarts]] and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]. He currently wrestles for [[Dradition|Dradition Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]].<ref name=Puro>{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/nagai.html|title=Profile at Puroresu Central|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>

==Career==
Hirokazu trained in [[Satoru Sayama]]'s Super Tiger Gym during secondary school and tried to join [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] immediately afterwards, but its chairman [[Giant Baba]] asked him to finish high school first. While studying, Nagai started competing in amateur [[shootboxing]] and amassed a 5-2 record, which made him change his ambition, so after graduating he went to join [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|UWF Newborn]] instead of AJPW. He became a trainee under [[Akira Maeda]] and learned the [[shoot-style]], but he got injured and UWF closed his doors before he could debut. Nagai eventually followed Maeda to his new promotion, [[Fighting Network RINGS]].

===Fighting Network RINGS (1991-1997)===
Nagai debuted in RINGS on August 1, 1991 in a match against [[Herman Renting]]. He revealed himself as a promising rookie, showing will and toughness, but aside of a high-profile match against [[Gerard Gordeau]] on December 7, in which he was defeated in 0:34, Nagai was relegated to low profile matches. He qualified for the ''Mega Battle Tournament 1991'', but was eliminated on the first round by [[Masaaki Satake]]. Nagai competed both in professional wrestling and [[mixed martial arts]], though only sporadically in the latter. He was defeated by [[Dick Vrij]] on May 16, 1992 by TKO, and would also lost to [[Willie Peeters]] on July 16, 1992, both in special shoot matches.

In 1994, Nagai looked to ascend the scale by taking part on the ''Mega Battle Tournament 1994'', eliminating [[Ameran Bitsadze]] on the first round, but then losing to [[Chris Dolman]] in the second. Next year, he faced Dick Vrij in a shoot rematch held in RINGS Holland on February 19, 1995, but he fell knocked by a knee strike while Vrij was illegally holding the ropes in the corner, an action which went unnoticed or the referee. However, Mitsuya would get booked for a trend of victories back in Japan, beating the likes of [[Andrei Kopylov]], [[Yoshihisa Yamamoto (wrestler)|Yoshihisa Yamamoto]] and [[Carl Greco]]. He finally would get his retribution over Vrij submitting him via heel hook on a third shootfight in August 24, 1996. Nagai then got the greatest victory until the moment, submitting [[Tsuyoshi Kohsaka]] in a match, but his momentum got cut short by [[Kiyoshi Tamura]] at the ''Mega Battle Tournament 1996''.

In 1997, Nagai got a license by the [[All Japan Kickboxing Federation]] and competed at the Kick Over IX event as a RINGS representative. It would be his last year in the promotion, as he left RINGS after a match with [[Akira Maeda]] in which Maeda [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shot]] on him after the bell.

===Other promotions (1991-present)===
After leaving RINGS and started to fight in [[K-1]] and Seikendo, finally landing in Yuki Ishikawa's pro wrestling company [[Battlarts]]. He wrestled as a heel/tweener for years before joining his originally desired promotion, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]. He formed a tag team with fellow UWF alumnus [[Masahito Kakihara]] calling themselves Team Strongs and defeated [[Yuji Nagata]] and [[Shinya Makabe]] for the vacant All Asia Tag Team titles. He also appeared in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] as part of the [[Makai Club]].
