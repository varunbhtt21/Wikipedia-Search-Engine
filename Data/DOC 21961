The '''Springfield Old Capitol Art Fair''' is a festival held annually during the third weekend of May on the grounds of the [[Old State Capitol State Historic Site]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]].  The festival features both tangible and performing art.<ref name="SOCAF">{{cite web |url=http://www.socaf.org/ |title=Old Capitol Art Fair |work=Springfield Old Capitol Art Fair |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}</ref>

==Description==
The Old Capitol Art Fair was first celebrated in 1962.  It has been held continuously on the lawn of and in the streets surrounding Springfield's Old State Capitol, except when the historic 1837 building was being reconstructed in 1966-70.<ref name="SOCAF"/>  The fair is known for the Children's Tent, a Springfield innovation.  It forms a cordoned-off wing of the Art Fair from which most adults (except approved supervisors) are barred.  Items of [[Handicraft|craft art]] are offered for sale for a fixed price, affordable for most juveniles through high school age.  Many young visitors to the Children's Tent learn for the first time what kinds of art they themselves like and want to buy.<ref name="Tent">{{cite web |url=http://www.socaf.org/about/childrens.asp |title=Old Capitol Art Fair: Children's Tent |work=Springfield Old Capitol Art Fair |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}</ref> 

In addition to two-and-three-dimensional artworks, the Art Fair offers a lineup of concert music and Illinois [[Food festival|festival food]].<ref name="Food and Entertainment">{{cite web |url=http://www.socaf.org/about/entertainment.asp |title=Old Capitol Art Fair: Food & Entertainment |work=Springfield Old Capitol Art Fair |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}</ref>  In 2019, the Fair was held on May 18-19.<ref name="SOCAF"/>
