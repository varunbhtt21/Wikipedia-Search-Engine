Archbishop Balvo, speaking on the [[South Sudanese conflict (2013–14)|crisis in South Sudan]] said civil society needs to be involved not just in negotiations on the government level but “should be actively involved always.” Speaking to CISA news agency February 17, he said civil society and the Church have already asked the warring factions to lay down their arms and work out their differences, adding that in the end it is the people who are suffering. "In a country that has a lot of resources, it will not be easy to develop them unless there is peace," he said. He said the Church was doing much to help people through promotion of their welfare and would continue to ensure that peace prevails in the nation. "It is very hard to promote and create a society with generations of people that all they have known is violence," he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/nuncio-to-south-sudan-proposes-a-path-to-peace|title=Nuncio to South Sudan Proposes a Path to Peace|date=February 20, 2014|work=Zenit}}</ref>
