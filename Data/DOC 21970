"'''Love Never Felt So Good'''" is a song by American singer and songwriter [[Michael Jackson]], released posthumously on May 2, 2014. The song, reworked from a 1983 demo track originally composed by Jackson and Canadian singer-songwriter [[Paul Anka]], was the first single released from Jackson's second posthumous album, ''[[Xscape (album)|Xscape]]''. 

Two versions of the single were developed. The first was a solo version produced by American record producer John McClain and Dutch record producer [[Giorgio Tuinfort]]. The second version was a duet featuring American singer [[Justin Timberlake]], produced by American record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon|J-Roc]], which received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Its accompanying music video premiered on May 14, 2014 on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''. In the video, Timberlake appears with a crowd of young dancers, who reference Jackson's most known dance moves, interspersed with archival footage of the pop singer's many short films. The song is the second collaboration between Jackson and Anka to be released since Jackson's death in 2009 — the first being "[[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This Is It]]".

The duet version of "Love Never Felt So Good" charted within the top ten in eighteen international charts, reaching the top spot in five countries. Michael Jackson became the first artist in history to have a top 10 single on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in five different decades when "Love Never Felt So Good" reached number 9 on May 31, 2014 (six decades if his [[Jackson 5]] tenure is included). It spent eight weeks on top of the US Adult R&B Songs. The song also charted at number 8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==Background==
First worked on as a demo, Jackson co-produced the song during a 1983 recording session with Anka. The original version only featured Jackson's vocals, finger snaps and a piano, played by Anka. In 1984, Anka sent the song to [[Johnny Mathis]], who recorded a new version of the song with revised lyrics by Anka and [[Kathleen Wakefield]].<ref name=history>{{cite news |url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/05/01/michael-jackson-new-single-written-with-paul-anka-is-actually-31-years-old |title=Michael Jackson 'New' Single Written with Paul Anka Is Actually 31 Years Old |work=Showbiz411.com |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Mathis' version made it on his 1984 album, ''[[A Special Part of Me]]''. In 2006, Jackson's demo leaked online. During the 2013-2014 recording sessions for the ''Xscape'' album, the song was given a revision as a disco-sounding track. The first version, which only features Jackson, was produced by John McClain and Giorgio Tuinfort and was featured as the first track on the standard version of ''Xscape''. The second version, featured as the last track on the deluxe version of the album, was co-produced by Timbaland and J-Roc and featured Timberlake in duet vocals with Jackson. While producing Timberlake's duet version, Timberlake sampled the percussion and breaths from Jackson's 1979 song "[[Workin' Day and Night]]".

==Release==
On April 30, 2014, it was revealed that "Love Never Felt So Good" would be unveiled at the [[iHeartRadio Music Awards]] on May 1, 2014 as the album's first single. During the awards show, the song premiered with a tribute by American R&B singer [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]].<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web |title=Michael Jackson's New Single to Premiere at iHeart Radio Music Awards |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-new-single-to-premiere-at-iheartradio-music-awards-20140501 |first=Jon |last=Blistein |date=May 1, 2014 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> The digital download for the single became available on [[iTunes]] at 0:01 [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] on May 2, 2014 on both its album version and duet version with [[Justin Timberlake]].<ref name=Revealed>{{cite web |title=XSCAPE Deluxe Edition Tracklisting Revealed! |url=http://www.michaeljackson.com/us/news/xscape-deluxe-edition-tracklist-contents-announced |date=May 1, 2014 |work=michaeljackson.com |accessdate=May 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713214652/http://www.michaeljackson.com/us/news/xscape-deluxe-edition-tracklist-contents-announced |archive-date=July 13, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/michael-jacksons-love-never-felt-so-good-first-single-from-xscape-premieres-tonight-at-the-iheart-radio-music-awards-257596061.html|title=Michael Jackson's "Love Never Felt So Good" First Single From XSCAPE Premieres Tonight at the iHeart Radio Music Awards|date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=May 1, 2014 |work=Epic Records |publisher=PR Newswire}}</ref> The release date of the single to urban radio stations was confirmed as May 6, 2014, though actually the single hit the radios on May 2.<ref name=debutsingledate>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/urban/future-releases|title=Urban/UAC Future Releases - R&B, Hip Hop, Release Schedule and Street Dates|date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=May 2, 2014 |publisher=All Access |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PG47r6Qv?url=http://www.allaccess.com/urban/future-releases |archivedate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> On May 10, 2014 a [[Fedde Le Grand]] remix was announced and world-premiered by [[Danny Howard]] on his [[BBC Radio 1]] show ''Dance Anthems''.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, "Love Never Felt So Good" received positive reviews from critics. Surprised by the quality of the song, Aisha Harris from ''Slate'' magazine wrote that Timberlake's version "sounds like an outtake from ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]''" and further commented: "If producers are going to put out more MJ music, let's hope it continues to sound this good."<ref name=Slate>{{cite web |title=The New Michael Jackson Song With Justin Timberlake is Actually Good|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/05/02/new_michael_jackson_song_with_justin_timberlake_listen_to_love_never_felt.html |date=May 2, 2014 |publisher=Slate |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Carl Willott of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] offered a positive outlook on the duet version, stating: "... where [Timberlake and Jackson's] voices make for an uncannily natural combination ... the other great thing is that it's not trying to be an event, it's just a breezy dance floor strut that wouldn't feel out of place on ''Off the Wall'' or ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]''."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |title=Michael Jackson & Justin Timberlake's "Love Never Felt So Good": Listen |url=http://www.idolator.com/7516769/michael-jackson-justin-timberlake-love-never-felt-so-good |date=May 2, 2014 |publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> 

Chris Richards of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the solo Jackson rendition "terrific. It's airy, sweet, funky and pretty much impossible to dislike," but panned the Timberlake remix, which he commented "surfaces all the grody feelings that came rushing in 2010 with Jackson's first posthumous album, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''."<ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Jackson, "Love Never Felt So Good" - it's trending, but is it good?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/05/02/michael-jackson-love-never-felt-so-good-its-trending-but-is-it-good/ |date=May 2, 2014 |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Gavin Edwards from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, "even if it isn't on a par with Jackson's best work, it sounded like it could have easily been the sixth single off ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'', which is more impressive than it sounds."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/iheartradio-music-awards-2014s-10-best-and-worst-moments-20140502 | title=IHeartRadio Music Awards 2014's 10 Best and Worst Moments | publisher=[[Jann Wenner]] | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=May 2, 2014 | accessdate=May 4, 2014 | first=Gavin |last=Edwards}}</ref>
Stephanie Chase from ''Contactmusic'' said that "It's not groundbreaking or an exceptional example of his artistry, but it gives a good indication that ''[[Xscape (album)|Xscape]]'' could serve as a fitting tribute to Jackson and his legacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/single-review/michael-jackson-love-never-felt-so-good|title=Michael Jackson - Love Never Felt So Good Single Review - Contactmusic.com|author=Stephanie Chase|work=Contactmusic.com}}</ref> Jon O'Brien from [[Yahoo!]] commented: "the classy disco-soul of this single could easily have been lifted from ''Off the Wall'' or ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://uk.celebrity.yahoo.com/news/weekly-singles-review-michael-jackson-ft-justin-timberlake-105400349.html | title=Weekly Singles Review: Michael Jackson ft.

"Love Never Felt So Good" also got praised by musician [[DJ Cassidy]], who told the song had a positive impact on him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/3233122|title=Michael Jackson – Love Never Felt So Good Lyrics - Genius Lyrics|work=Genius}}</ref>

<blockquote>I haven't been a huge fan of albums that come out after an artist dies. You know, it just doesn't have their stamp on it, so it's never going to be what it would have been if the person was alive. But "Love Never Felt So Good" was a great record. It was definitely one of my top five songs from the last five years.</blockquote>
