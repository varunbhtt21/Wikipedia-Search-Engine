The '''Hanabanilla Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Hanabanilla River]] near the village of [[El Salto del Hanabanilla]] in [[Villa Clara Province]], [[Cuba]]. The purpose of the dam is to provide water for irrigation and municipal uses and to generate [[hydroelectric]] power. 

==Overview==
The dam withholds a reservoir of {{Convert|286000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} and the power station, located near its base, has an installed capacity of 43 MW. It is the largest hydroelectric power station in the country. Near the southern end of the reservoir is Jibacoa Dam, an auxiliary dam, which closes off one valley to create the existing large reservoir. 

The dam was constructed between 1958 and 1961.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.men-car.com/imagenes/travelport_130.pdf | title=Lake Hanabanilla | publisher=Travel Port | work=Cuba: Natural Tourism | date=2013 | accessdate=1 May 2014 | language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The power station was commissioned in 1963.
