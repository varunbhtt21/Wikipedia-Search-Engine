*'''Delete''' - among all the courses offered by all the universities in the world, we have an article on this one? There is a lack of "significant widespread coverage" of the subject and the sources used in the article are either from PSU, or have very little or nothing to do with the subject. Any aircraft that the students may one day design and finish building may be worthy of an article, but the only reason I can see to have an article about the course itself, is to advertise it.

*'''Delete''' - As per YSSYguy, advertisement of a non notable subject.--[[User:Petebutt|Petebutt]] ([[User talk:Petebutt|talk]]) 23:28, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
