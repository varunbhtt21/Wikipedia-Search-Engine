<small>5x expanded by [[User:Casliber|Casliber]] ([[User talk:Casliber|talk]]). Self nominated at 21:06, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* Expanded enough, old enough, reliable sources, OK for me. [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan.Kamenicek]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 17:38, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] I was on the verge of promoting this when I checked the source for the hook, and discovered that it said there was 45 adult and 16 juvenile plants, which looks like 61 total, not 45. This is a significant difference. Please adjust the article accordingly and provide a new hook. Thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 19:15, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::: My bad! Will adjust - I had meant to write "45 adult plants" initially as it sounds more dramatic. Hence:

*ALT1... that there were only 45 adult plants of the endangered shrub '''''[[Banksia montana]]''''' in the wild in 2008?
*<s>ALT2... that there were only 61 plants of the endangered shrub '''''[[Banksia montana]]''''' in the wild in 2008?</s> <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Casliber|Casliber]] ([[User talk:Casliber|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Casliber|contribs]]) 21:01, 2 May 2014‎ (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The problem now is that the information in the hook is different from the info in the article. It should correspond with each other. [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan.Kamenicek]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 08:51, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
