The '''Loran–Manatee gas field''' [[natural gas field]] located on the continental shelf of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It was discovered in 1983 and developed by [[PDVSA]]. It began production in 2013 and produces [[natural gas]] and [[Natural gas condensate|condensates]]. The total [[proven reserves]] of the Loran–Manatee gas field are around 10.25&nbsp;trillion cubic feet (293&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>), and production is slated to be around 750&nbsp;million cubic feet/day (21,4×10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>3</sup>) in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.co.tt/public_html/article.php?story=20140311005612787|title=Why Trinidad & Tobago is optimistic about future gas supply |date=2014-03-16|publisher=news.co.tt|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>
