Fails [[WP:GNG]]. References within article point back to episodes of the cartoon and one link to the live-action movie, but none provide sources that meet '''significant coverage'''.

[https://www.google.com/search?q=Pearl+Slaghoople&sourceid=ie7&rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&ie=&oe=#q=Pearl+Slaghoople&rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&safe=off&start=10 Google search] provides no links within the first three pages of results that meet [[WP:GNG]], instead providing links to fan wikis, Pinterest pages and Flickr pools. 

Although [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s cameo as the character in the [[The Flintstones (film)|live action film]] garnered some press coverage, that coverage was more directly related to Taylor herself rather than the character. [[User:AldezD|AldezD]] ([[User talk:AldezD|talk]]) 18:32, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:Although [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pearl Slaghoople|first AFD]] was closed as '''Keep''', the keep votes again reference [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s and [[Joan Collins]]' portryals of the character, not the character itself. These notations show that the ''actresses portraying the character are notable'', but their portrayal again does not help the character itself meet [[WP:GNG]]/significant coverage.

*'''Comment''' it might be an idea to merge this with some other articles on minor Flintstones characters, e.g. [[The Gruesomes (fictional characters)]], [[The Great Gazoo]], [[Hoppy (The Flintstones)]] (none of which have much notability), to create an article [[Flintstones minor characters]]. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 11:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge or redirect''' There are several non-notable characters that get covered despite their general notability. The article [[List of The Flintstones characters]] already exists as a redirect, so this can be used to merge and remove non-notable Flinstones' character articles. Failing a merge, I recommend a redirect to [[The Flinstones]] character section, as this character is covered there.
