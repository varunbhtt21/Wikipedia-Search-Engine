'''Todor Krstić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Тодор Крстић}}; {{floruit}} 1904–34), known by the nickname '''Toša''' (Тоша) and ''[[nom de guerre]]'' '''Algunjski''' (Алгуњски), was a [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian Chetnik commander]] in [[Old Serbia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] during the [[Macedonian Struggle]].

==Life==
Krstić was born in the village of [[Municipality of Staro Nagoričane|Algunja]] in the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]]). His village supported and joined the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]].<ref>Станојевић, Станоје, уредник. Српски народ у XIX веку, Том 16. Београд, Издавачко и књижарско предузеће Г. Кон АД, 1935. с. 173.</ref> Algunja was surrounded by Albanian-inhabited villages of [[Čukarka]], [[Suševo]] and [[Mutilovo]]; Krstić had even before joining the organized Chetnik action, jumped into the region from [[Vranje]], assassinating known ''zulumćari'' (persecutors of Christians). He himself became one of the regional ''vojvoda'' (duke) and worked closely with ''vojvoda'' [[Petko Ilić]]. After the [[Battle of Stratsin]] against a Bulgarian squad in March 1912, in which Petko Ilić died, Krstić succeeded him as the unit's commander. He fought in the great battle at [[Šumata Trnica]] on March 21, 1912, in which eight Serbian rebels were killed,<ref>Trifunović 1930, pp. 18-21</ref> including [[Svetozar Mihajlović-Purca]] from [[Tuzla]].<ref>Trifunović 1930, p. 44</ref>
