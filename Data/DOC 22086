The result was  '''speedy keep''' per [[WP:SK#1]]. The nomination does not present a valid rationale for deletion in that it recommends merging or redirection, rather than deletion. <small>(Non-administrator closure.)</small> [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 12:32, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

Seems to be a more recent Hardy Boys story with no refs or links to it--I think a merge or a redirect be the best. (I didn't even know there were any newer Hardy boys books even until now) I put a merge tag yesterday on here. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:27, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
