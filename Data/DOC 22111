In 2014, Evans blamed poor UKIP support in London on the city's high number of "educated, cultured and young". She explained that she thought that in London, voters were "more likely, I think, to have read some of the negative press that's been about us, and I think they'd be more likely to believe it" whereas outside London people were more cynical about media reporting.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-councillor-blames-poor-london-polls-cultured-elite Losing Ukip councillor blames poor London polls on 'cultured elite'.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221133246/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/ukip-councillor-blames-poor-london-polls-cultured-elite |date=21 December 2016}} Rowena Mason, ''The Guardian'', 23 May 2014.

===After the 2015 general election===
On 8 May 2015, Nigel Farage recommended her as the Interim Leader of UKIP following his resignation, but within three days the National Executive Committee of the party had rejected the Farage resignation, and so he remained leader.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1481942/ukip-rejects-nigel-farages-resignation |title=UKIP Rejects Nigel Farage's Resignation |publisher=Sky News |date=11 May 2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512164351/http://news.sky.com/story/1481942/ukip-rejects-nigel-farages-resignation |archivedate=12 May 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 18 June 2015, following comments made by Evans on the BBC's ''[[Daily Politics]]'', Evans commented that the public had a "perceived divisive" view of Nigel Farage. The UKIP press office then withdrew Evans as a media commentator for UKIP, pending an internal inquiry.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33190940 |title=UKIP's Suzanne Evans facing the sack after Farage comments |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-07-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407204707/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33190940 |archivedate=7 April 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===UKIP leadership bid===
{{details|UK Independence Party leadership election, November 2016}}
Evans launched her bid to become leader of UKIP in October 2016, following the resignation of [[Diane James]] after 18 days in the job. Launching her campaign on ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', Evans said she'd be the "strong centre" and described herself and fellow candidate [[Paul Nuttall]] as "Team Sensible" compared to fellow candidate [[Raheem Kassam]], following extreme comments from the soon-to-resign leadership candidate. When the results were announced, on 28 November 2016, she came a distant second out of the remaining three, and lost her deposit with 19.3% of the vote.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
