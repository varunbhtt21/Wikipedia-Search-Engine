'''''Melianthus comosus''''', the '''honey flower''', is a [[species]] of [[flowering plant]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Francoaceae]]. It is native to the mostly dry regions of southern Africa. The attractive multi-stemmed shrubs are popular garden subjects. The [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] name '''kruidjie-roer-my-nie''' (''herb-touch-me-not'') alludes to the unpleasant smell that results from bruising of any part of the plant.<ref name=harris>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Shireen |title=Melianthus comosus Vahl |url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantklm/melicomo.htm |work=plantzafrica |publisher=Free State National Botanical Garden| date = September 2004 | accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The vegetative parts are very toxic, as with other ''[[Melianthus]]'' species, and extracts of the leaves and stem have anti-bacterial properties.<ref>Kelmanson, Jäger & van Staden, (2000)</ref>

==Range==
It is native to [[South Africa]], western [[Lesotho]] and southern [[Namibia]], where it occurs from 400 to 2,000 m above sea level.<ref name=han/> In South Africa it occurs in the greater part of the Cape and Free State provinces, and locally in North West, Gauteng and Mpumalanga.

==Flowers==
The flowers which produce copious  black nectar<ref group = note>Also described as dark brown but J. Henning records that black nectar is found in ''M. comosus'', ''M. elongatus'' and ''M. villosus'', and brown nectar in the remaining species. See Hansen et al.</ref> are [[zygomorphic]] in shape, and green to pale pink in colour.<ref name=han/><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Curtis's Botanical Magazine |date=1795 |volume=9 |page=Plate 301}}</ref> The black nectar is visible through the pale green, semi-transparent sepals. A flower produces an average of 42 μl of nectar a day, with a 10% sugar content, which has been described as a "rich black honey" that almost fills the cup.<ref name=sco>Scott-Elliot (1890)</ref> [[Martin Vahl|Vahl]]'s description of the species in 1794 however omitted any mention of the coloured nectar, or its abundance.<ref name=han/>

==Uses and species associations==
Honey from its flowers is dark in colour, and apparently not toxic to humans.<ref name=mar>Marloth (1925)</ref> The flowers are visited by insects and birds,<ref name=han/> especially sunbirds which eagerly seek them out.<ref name=sco/><ref name=mab>Mabberley (1997)</ref>
