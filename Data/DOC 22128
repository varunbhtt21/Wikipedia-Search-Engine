'''CityStudio Vancouver''' is an innovation hub inside City Hall where staff, university students and community members co-create, design and launch projects on the ground. The central mission of CityStudio is to innovate and experiment with the ways cities are co-created, while teaching students the skills needed to collaborate on real projects in Vancouver with City staff and community stakeholders. These projects improve our city and enrich our neighbourhoods, making the city more livable, joyful and sustainable. 

Since 2011 CityStudio has engaged 75 city staff and 3500 students from 6 universities, contributing 195 projects on the ground and 96,000 hours of training, research and action for collaborative city building supporting the Greenest City Action Plan, and the Healthy City and Engaged City Strategies. 

==History==
In 2010, the City of Vancouver set the goal of becoming the greenest city in the world by 2020. In July, the City of Vancouver launched the "Talk Green To Us" initiative - where citizens suggested ideas and voted on them. In October 2010, the city held the Greenest City Idea Slam - where the top four voted ideas were presented to the Mayor and a panel including Councillor Andrea Reimer; Deputy City Manager Sadhu Johnston, Arran Stephens, President of Nature's Path Foods; Tamara Vrooman, Chief Executive Officer of Vancity; Janet Austin, Chief Executive Officer of YWCA Vancouver; Matt O'Grady, Editor of BC Business Magazine; Greenest City Action Team member Cheeying Ho, Executive Director of the Whistler Centre for Sustainability; Paula V. Murillo of Latincouver; and Emily Jubenvill of the Vancouver Public Space Network.


CityStudio Vancouver was selected by the Mayor to move forward as a pilot program.  Four months later, the Presidents and Vice Presidents involved in the Campus-City Collaboration (C3 - BCIT, ECUAD, Langara, SFU, UBC, VCC)<ref>Greenest City Action Plan.
