This was on deletion but a logged off user took it off. Film has yet to film, just a cast list is listed. (plot says IDK even).  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:50, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': Okay I thought this was also a first film for people due to the line "first film of 2014 for blah blah" which in fact it was the first film of them for the year (odd thing to say on a page), still it just says it started production, not filming yet. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:51, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''delete''' per [[WP:NFF]] needs at a minimum significant third party sources indicating principle photography has begun. Redirect to director or incubate may also be acceptable.

*'''Keep''' per substantial coverage in reliable independent sources such [http://entertainment.oneindia.in/malayalam/news/2013/dulquar-salman-unni-mukundan-movie-vikramadithyan-121566.html this one].

:::hardly "substantial" at 4 two-sentence paragraphs. hardly "reliable" when it consists of ''"If reports are to be believed,"''- typical promotional celebrity gossip. -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]] 05:22, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Pardon [[User:TheRedPenOfDoom|TRPoD]], but the mandate for "significant coverage" does not mean that a source '''MUST''' also be "substantial" in content. To quote the applicable guideline: "[[WP:GNG|'Significant coverage' addresses the topic directly and in detail, so that no original research is needed to extract the content. Significant coverage is more than a passing mention but it need not be the main topic of the source material.]]"  In considering [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra's]] statement "substantial coverage in reliable independent sources", I think it more prudent to equate "substantial" to the number of sources available, and not quibble over the content of the one he chose to offer... as there are many more. I point this clarification out because their is no guideline nor policy requirement calling for "substantial content". Thanks.

::::::[[WP:NFF]] "Additionally, films that have already begun shooting, but have not yet been publicly released (theatres or video), should generally not have their own articles unless the production itself is notable per the notability guidelines. " and [[Wikipedia:ROUTINE#Routine_coverage]] "routine news coverage of such things as announcements, sports, and tabloid journalism are not sufficient basis for an article. Planned coverage of pre-scheduled events, especially when those involved in the event are also promoting it, is considered to be routine." Theres nothing about the coverage of this film that is not routine promotional publicity. -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]] 10:51, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::[[WP:ROUTINE]] refers to event notability, and while helpful for events, as a guideline for events it is often contradictory to [[WP:NF]]... the specific guideline set for film notability. In regards films, "routine" might be something trivial and banal such as "the film screened for two weeks and grossed XX dollars".  If using the applicable guideline, if the overage allows us to extract without original research, the actors and plot and production details and public anticipation and past films, and is reported in sources reliable for such information in that part of the world (even if they are shorter than western news sources), it is not a routine report of a "event".  We'll certainly disagree, specially as not ALL sources do this, but enough cover the topic directly and in enough detail so that no original research is needed to extract the content and the article can then be thus accordingly improved over time and through regular editing to improve Wikipedia. If [[WP:NFF|WP:NFF (paragraph 3)]] is met, an article is allowable. However, rather than debating in efficacy or lack of a guideline intended for events rather than films, might you instead wish to discuss the ''possible'' merits of a merge and redirect as a consideration under [[WP:PRESERVE|editing policy]]? Thanks. '''[[User:MichaelQSchmidt|<font color="blue">Schmidt, </font>]]''' ''[[User talk:MichaelQSchmidt|<sup><small>Michael Q.</small></sup>]]'' 01:53, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::No, what is trivial and banal is the coverage "Our next guest is X who is going to start filming in Y's upcoming film! Let's see a promotional clip!!!" -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]]
:::::::::Ah... if the guest interview included information about the film, then we have the required [[WP:NFF|further coverage of production]].  And such is still not judged under "event" notability criteria. We really need to consider the guideline set for films, not for events. Wide media attention... some brief and some lengthy... is exactly as required for policy-mandated [[WP:V|verifiability]] of included content. Heck, even with the MOST notable topics we can find the occasional one or two line speedy comments in some media. We consider it all, not just a few minor ones.

* '''Keep''' per coverage in multiple sources to meet the notability requirements set by [[WP:NFF|WP:NFF (paragraph 3)]].  To partly agree with [[User:Wgolf|the nominator]], the article needs a lot of work to meet [[WP:MOSFILM]] and be properly encyclopedic, but we rarely delete topics determinable as notable simply because they [[WP:UGLY|need]] a little regular editorial attention.  Not believing a flat-out deletion to be best, I am willing to consider arguments of how a '''merge and redirect''' of this sourcable film topic to director [[Lal Jose]] might somehow serve the project far better than simply [[WP:SOFIXIT|improving this article]].

*'''Comment''' - Okay now I'm iffy about this. Not sure if this should be deleted or not - I could withdraw this but rather not, just rather see what happens, whatever happens, well happens! [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:53, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''':  Cursory research shows this film from an acclaimed director is notable, the article simply needs additional improvement.  I haven't been at AFD much lately but between this and things like [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Un'amore e una vendetta]] I'd say we're getting a bit lazy.--'''[[User:Milowent|Milowent]]''' • <small><sup style="position:relative">[[Special:Contributions/Milowent|has]]<span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-3.2ex;*left:-5.5ex;">[[User talk:Milowent|spoken]]</span></sup></small> 22:47, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak Delete''', I think we need to separate out "reliable sources" from "promotional material".  Yes, there is lots of coverage of this film, but the vast majority of it seems to be gossipy promotional hype.  What looks impressive when you look at the number of sources is a lot less impressive when you look at the ''quality'' of those sources.  That said, I'm only going "weak" as there might be better quality sources in Malayalam that I can't access.
