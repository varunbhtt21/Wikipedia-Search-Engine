==Interactive fiction==
Barlow was active in the interactive fiction scene of the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Making Of: Silent Hill Shattered Memories|journal=EDGE|issue=263|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/the-making-of-silent-hill-shattered-memories/}}</ref> most notably releasing the game ''[[Aisle (video game)|Aisle]]'' in 1999. It won the [[XYZZY Award]] for [[XYZZY Award for Best Use of Medium|Best Use of Medium]]. Like his later ''Silent Hill'' games, Aisle features a psychologically damaged viewpoint character, a contemporary setting and a positive meaning at its heart.<ref>{{cite thesis |first=Jeremy |last=Douglass |title=Command Lines: Aesthetics and Technique in Interactive Fiction and New Media |publisher=The University of California, Santa Barbara |year=2007|page=309}}</ref>
