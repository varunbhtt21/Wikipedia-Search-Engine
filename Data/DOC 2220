The result was    '''redirect to [[List of Italian films]]'''. Several of the arguments also mention that additional actions should be taken either before or after deletion/redirection; thus rounded to redirect; [[WP:RFD]] can be used later if needed [[User:Slakr|<span style="color:teal;font-weight:bold;">slakr</span>]]<small><sup>\&nbsp;[[User talk:Slakr|talk]]&nbsp;/</sup></small> 05:30, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

::Clearly not. The List of Italian films only redirects to the decades. Please merge all lists onto that page.

:'''Comment''' The thing is it isn't a list, it's a dab page. What Spudg is getting at is that we don't need multiple dab pages and it's redundant to have them when they can all be listed on one page at [[List of Italian films]]. I believe he's right. Obviously if this actually contained a film list like some of the others do yet to be split by decade we wouldn't want to get rid of it. The only alternative really would be to redirect to an article like [[Italian cinema in the 1910s]]. In future Spudg, just list the full dab on the main page, shut off the links in the list side bars and ask me to db author the decade lists, it would make things a lot easier.♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e">''Dr. Blofeld''</span>]] 06:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect'''. I don't see any point in having these as individual DAB pages, which as Dr. Blofeld points out is essentially what they are. Redirect rather than delete in case of incoming links. [[User:Olaf Davis|Olaf Davis]] ([[User talk:Olaf Davis|talk]]) 12:45, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''', largely per Dr. Blofeld's comment just above. --[[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|<sup><small><i>talk</i></small></sup>]] 15:16, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Not needed as articles. --[[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 02:03, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' (after chasing any use not from the templates) or redirect, leaving the categories out.  (Some editors want appropriate categories on redirects.  They do not seem appropriate, here.)  They are only index files, having '''no''' independent content.  Neither does [[List of Italian films]], which should probably be changed to {{cat|Lists of Italian films by year}}.  (There is ''some'' content in [[List of British films]], namely the collection of 1889-1919 into one article, although I would have little objection to the deletion of ''that'' article, either.)  — [[User:Arthur Rubin|Arthur Rubin]]  [[User talk:Arthur Rubin|(talk)]] 22:56, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
