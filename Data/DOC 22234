==History==

In late 2011, Jonathan Wasserstrum, Justin Lee, and Aron Susman<ref>{{cite web|title=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aron-susman/|publisher=Huffington Post}}</ref> formed the company and launched the first prototype in the spring of 2012<ref>{{cite web|title=TheSquareFoot: disruptive commercial real estate startup|url=http://agbeat.com/entrepreneur/thesquarefoot-disruptive-real-estate-startup-serving-untapped-sector/|publisher=AG Beat|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> at [[VentureBeat]]'s DEMO Conference in San Francisco. The first market for the company was in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], where they initially raised $350,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Startup's niche is in office space|url=http://www.chron.com/business/article/Startup-s-niche-is-in-office-space-3849184.php|publisher=Chron|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> from friends and family.

In 2013, SquareFoot was chosen to be included in the 4th class of the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator in [[New York City|New York]], a startup incubator that offers seed funding and three months of mentorship for selected firms. By April 2013, SquareFoot had expanded to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Dallas]], and New York City and [[TechCrunch]] named SquareFoot as one of the "Top 5 Startups to Watch".<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet The Top Five Startups From ERA’s Latest New York Demo Day|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/26/meet-the-top-five-startups-from-eras-latest-new-york-demo-day/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

They closed another round of $500,000 from New York and Texas investors in the summer of 2013<ref>{{cite web|title=10 startups debut at Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator’s Demo Day|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/26/10-startups-debut-at-entrepreneurs-roundtable-accelerators-demo-day-live/|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> to continue growth with Boston as one of the next markets in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Question of the Month: What new commercial real estate technologies are entering the Boston market?|url=http://nerej.com/71792/|publisher=NEREJ|accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>
