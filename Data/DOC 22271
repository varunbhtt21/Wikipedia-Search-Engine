== History ==
Action was founded by Gerard Deen and Rob Wagemaker, who were later joined by Boris Deen. They opened their first store in 1993 in [[Enkhuizen]] and started expanding by founding new stores that same year. In 2002, they had 94 stores; in 2005, the first store was opened in Belgium, in Rijkevorsel; and, in 2009, they opened their first store in Germany. In 2012, the company had 300 stores and opened its first store in France. In 2014, Action opened its 500th store. It continued growing exponentially. In November 2017, there were already more than 1,000 stores across Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.action.nl/winkels|title=Map of locations|language=dutch|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>
