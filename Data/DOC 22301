Title : Abu Bakr Muhammad
Text : '''Abu Bakr Muhammad''' (died 941) was the first [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler of [[Chaghaniyan]] (10th-century&ndash;939) and governor of [[Samanid]] [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] (933&ndash;939). He was the son of a certain Muzaffar ibn Muhtaj.

== Origins ==
The origin of the Muhtajids is unknown; the name has been given by modern historians after their presumed forebear Muhtaj ({{lang-ar|محتاج}} ''Muḥtāj''). They may have been descended from the [[Principality of Chaghaniyan|Chaghan Khudahs]], who ruled Chaghaniyan during the early [[Middle Ages]]; another possibility is that their ancestors were [[Arabs]] who migrated to the region and were Iranicized. In any case, by the early 10th century Chaghaniyan had become a vassal to the [[Samanids]] of [[Bukhara]].

== Biography ==
He is the first ruler fully attested in sources. Under the Samanids, he was the governor of [[Ferghana]]. When in 929 the Samanid amir [[Nasr II]] was temporarily expelled from power by his brothers, Muhammad remained loyal to him. As a result, when Nasr managed to restore himself he rewarded Muhammad with the governorship of [[Balkh]], and then in 933 made him governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. During his time as governor of Khurasan, Muhammad battled various [[Dailamite]] bands in northern Iran. In 939 he fell ill and was replaced from his post by his son [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]]; he died in 941.
