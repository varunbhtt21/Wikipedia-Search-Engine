Fails [[WP:NCORP]]. All sources are either primary sources or press-releases, hence do not help to establish notability of the subject.

*'''Comment'''-Not to mention-the corp has an "amazing" 7 employees! [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:17, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''Most of the references are not primary sources. TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Houston Chronicle, are all press organizations covering the company. Given the tech boom and insane amount of fundings, in NYC, I think these companies should be covered and documented.   <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/72.225.239.168|72.225.239.168]] ([[User talk:72.225.239.168|talk]]) 11:49, 5 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Approve''' There is plenty of coverage of this company via independent relaiable sources. If the Houston Chronicle is not reliable and independent, what is? 03:28, 30 May 2014 (UTC)
