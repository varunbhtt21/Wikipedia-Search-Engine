Entire article is a copyvio, and there is no indication that relations between these countries are notable.

:'''Comment''' Egad! The ''entire'' article? All 1 sentences of it? Are you sure you've checked the whole thing? Honestly, this seems like you're making a mountain out of a molehill.

::Copyvio aside, there is no indication of notability for relations between these countries other than [[WP:ITEXISTS]]. I only mentioned the copyvio because the editor that created this article was banned for creating a series of articles like this one that were copied and pasted from other websites. --[[User:Ahecht|Ahecht]] (<small>[[User_talk:Ahecht|<span style="color:#FFF;background:#00f;display:inline-block;line-height:1.1em;vertical-align:-0.3em;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><b>TALK<br />PAGE</b></span>]]</small>) 23:32, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' in its current state; a mere statement of existence is not sufficient for an article.  If someone manages to add some reliably referenced text then I'm happy to retract my !vote. —[[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] ([[User talk:Psychonaut|talk]]) 06:00, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
