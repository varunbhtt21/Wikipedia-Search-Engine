[[Jar Jar Binks#Reception|Binks]] in the title is an aside to the [[Star Wars]] [[Computer animation|CGI]] character who was poorly received, the title gives voice to the extent of the lack of warmth his negative critics had over the controversy raised by Binks' characterization and what it was felt to engender.

==Reception==

[[Elizabeth Hand]] wrote in ''[[F&SF]]'' that "Kimmel's a terrific guide to classic though underappreciated works such as [[Things to Come]], and is especially sharp on 1950s sf movies, David Cronenberg, and the art (or lack of same) of movie remakes. ... [H]is brief essays are addictively readable and yes, a lot more fun than watching ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2011/eh1107.htm |title= Books |work= F&SF |volume= July–August |date= 2011 }}</ref> ''[[Analog (magazine)|Analog]]'' reviewer [[Don Sakers]] also praised the collection, saying, "Whether [Kimmel]'s explaining why ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' is such an important film, or joining in with the obligatory [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|George Lucas bashing]], his writing is intelligent and entertaining. You may disagree with him (in fact, you almost certainly will on something), but you can't say he doesn't give reasoned arguments in support of his positions. And his knowledge of SF movies is encyclopedic as hell."<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.analogsf.com/2011_07-08/reflib.shtml |title= The Reference Library |journal= Analog |volume= July–August |date= 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001023/http://www.analogsf.com/2011_07-08/reflib.shtml |archivedate= 2014-05-02 |df=  }}</ref>
