The '''Itaú-San Alberto gas field''' is a [[natural gas field]] located in the [[Tarija Department]] of [[Bolivia]]. It was discovered in 1998 and developed by [[Total S.A.]]. It began production in 2004 and produces [[natural gas]] and [[Natural gas condensate|condensates]]. The total [[proven reserves]] of the Itaú-San Alberto gas field are around 20.33 trillion cubic feet (581&nbsp;km³), and production is slated to be around 200 million cubic feet/day (5.7×10<sup>5</sup>m³).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97ccJAMqf6UC&pg=PA86 |title=Tarija (Bolivia) – Natural Gas Extraction|year=2000|publisher=sed.manchester.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>
