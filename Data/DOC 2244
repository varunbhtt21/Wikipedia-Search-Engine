Title : Otake Dainichi Nyorai
Text : '''Otake Dainichi Nyorai''' (お竹大日如来 or 於竹大日如来), who is also known as '''Otake''', is a figure in the Japanese Buddhist tradition.  

She was a humble maidservant of the Sakuma family in Odenma-cho in [[Edo]], who lived during the 17th century. She was a very religious woman of great Buddhist virtue. She gave all she had to the poor, ate hardly any food, and performed the most menial chores with extreme diligence.<ref>Joly, Henri L., ''Legend in Japanese Art'', Charles E. Tuttle Co., Rutland Vermont, 1967, pp. 396-99</ref>  A group of mountain ascetics, who were searching for the reincarnation of the [[Vairocana|Nyorai Buddha]], found her. When Otake bent down to pick up a few grains of rice that had fallen on the floor, a halo-like light surrounded her, convincing the ascetics that they had come upon a divine being. Otake is often portrayed with an object behind her head that resembles a halo, or with a shadow or reflection identifying her as a buddha.<ref>[http://www.artsanddesignsjapan.com/view.php?c=125&n=31 Arts and Designs of Japan]</ref>
