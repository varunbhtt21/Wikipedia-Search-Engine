Per [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Actors and Filmmakers/Archive 3#Cast/Crew in navigation boxes|a discussion a long time ago]], cast and crew names should not be added to navboxes.[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] <small>([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|T]] / [[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|C]] / [[WP:FOUR]] / [[WP:CHICAGO]] / [[WP:WAWARD]])</small> 17:31, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - The long-standing consensus is based partly on the argument that if we allow such navboxes to exist then some actor articles could be overwhelmed with navboxes for series' in which they appeared. These navboxes serve the same purpose as the many "[Television series] actors" categories that were deleted so they are a way of getting around previous deletion decisions. I find the arguments agains them compelling and while consensus can change I don't see that it has in the past more than four years. Ironocally, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was used as an example as to why such navboxes are unnecessary but this one escaped TfD at the time. Since the navbox contains only cast names, it is redundant to both {{tl|Buffynav}} and {{tl|Angelnav}} and since it contains cast names for both series, redirecting it to either one is not really an option. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 18:30, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

Redundant to {{tl|infobox building}}, with only a couple of specific parameters, which should be added to that template.

* '''Keep''' - not redundant to building. A theatre is a use of a building, and may not necessarily cover the life of the building itself. - [[User:Bilby|Bilby]] ([[User talk:Bilby|talk]]) 01:00, 3 May 2014 (UTC)]
**The redundancy is not in the relationship between the subjects, but on the parameters on the two templates.

***I did. There are parameters in infobox theatre which don't appear in infobox building. This makes sense, as those parameters apply to the use of a building, rather than the building itself. I had assumed from your comments in regard to infobox venue that you saw building and theatre as separate. - [[User:Bilby|Bilby]] ([[User talk:Bilby|talk]]) 11:24, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
****There are indeed parameters in infobox theatre which don't appear in infobox building, as I acknowledged in both my nomination and below.

* '''Keep''' - If there are specific parameters used by this template that need to be added to {{tl|infobox building}} then this template is not redundant until those parameters are added. Addition of those unspecified parameters requires a separate discussion as infobox building is used on 11,831 pages. The nominator should initiate a discussion at [[Template talk:Infobox building]], gain consensus to alter that template and then renominate this template. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 07:31, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

***Nothing that you've said here is relevant to what I said. The simple fact is that this infobox is not presently [[wikt:redundant|redundant]] to Infobox building as that infobox, by your own admission, does not include all the parameters used by this infobox. Regardless of [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS|precedent]] there needs to be a discussion, with test cases to prove that these parameters are not going to affect any of the 11,831 articles that use Infobox building. For a recent precedent see [[Template talk:Infobox television episode#Recent addition of blank fields|this discussion]] where the addition of blank fields was rejected because they had not been discussed. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 12:51, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*****What you said was about forking templates and that's not relevant here because neither infobox is a fork of the other. Your claim that we wouldn't keep "mostly-similar templates" is not true either; there's plenty of precedent to demonstrate that.

* '''Keep'''. Sorry, I do not see "redundancy" with {{tl|infobox building}}. As Bilby mentioned, "a theatre is a use of a building, and may not necessarily cover the life of the building itself". If anything, it should be more similar to infoboxes like {{tl|infobox stadium}}, which has audience-specific and performance parameters like "capacity" and "attendance".

*** Sorry, I still '''oppose'''. Either {{tl|infobox building}} should be renamed to something else, or the common definition of "[[building]]", as indicated on that article, is changed (which is unlikely given that there is a citation for that in that article). A theatre, like the uncovered [[Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park]] or [[Scarborough Open Air Theatre]], may not necessarily be housed in "a man-made structure with a '''roof and walls''' standing more or less permanently in one place" (emphasis added). It will be very confusing to editors (especially inexperienced users) if you are not using precise titles for templates. Otherwise, you just invite the creation of more similar templates. Or the future possibility that users will introduce into {{tl|infobox building}} numerous parameters that have nothing to do with ''buildings'' per se. Merely merging everything to {{tl|infobox building}}, so it becomes this generalized multi-purpose infobox template, without renaming it to its more precise scope does not help. Again, as some suggested in [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 May 5#Template:Infobox venue|this TFD discussion]], {{tl|Infobox theatre}} should probably be instead merged with {{tl|infobox stadium}} and {{tl|Infobox venue}} (because after all, a theatre and a stadium can be considered [[:wiktionary:venue|venues]]). [[User:Zzyzx11|Zzyzx11]] ([[User talk:Zzyzx11|talk]]) 12:35, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
****Pedantic arguments around the definition of a building (The Colosseum is not a building?!?) are irrelevant. Your allegation of confusion being caused to new editors ignores my suggestion of keep the nominated template as a redirect; allowing such editors to still type ''<nowiki>{{Infobox theatre...</nowiki>'' in articles. I note that each of the articles about open air theatres which you cite refer to them being (re)''built''. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 20:07, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*****He didn't mention the [[Colosseum]], which is irrelevant because it doesn't use any of the infoboxes that have been discussed. Instead it uses {{tl|Ancient monuments in Rome}}. He did, however, mention [[Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park]], which appears to be an example of a non-building theatre. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 20:56, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
******There you go, off at a tangent. I didn't use the Colosseum as an example (and I'm aware that, not Zzyzx11, first used it as one) because of whichever infobox it uses, but as an example of a ''building with no roof''. As I noted, our article on the Regent's Park theatre refers to it being re''built''. It also describes the rooms which that theatre has. Even if theatre is not considered a building, that doesn't require a separate infobox; the matter is a red herring. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 22:00, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
***** A better descriptive title for a template is a must, because it clearly defines the scope of the template to all editors. It is the primary reason why there [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2012 December 10#Template:Cite video|was consensus]] to rename {{tl|cite video}} to {{tl|cite AV media}}, because it was being used to also cite audio sources. A more descriptive title was probably why it was easier to gain consensus to merge all these infobox templates to {{tl|Infobox officeholder}}, because all of those subjects could generally be considered "officeholders". Or why it was easier to merge various templates to {{tl|Infobox person}}, because any biographical article is essentially about a "person". I could probably cite other TFD examples. Also, any open-air theatre, tower, aqueduct or any other structure or site can be "rebuilt" -- it does not automatically make them a "building" per se. And you still have not addressed the alternative option suggested in [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 May 5#Template:Infobox venue|this TFD discussion]] about merging this instead with {{tl|infobox venue}} and {{tl|infobox stadium}}. [[User:Zzyzx11|Zzyzx11]] ([[User talk:Zzyzx11|talk]]) 21:47, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*******There is also no requirement or policy that everything needs to merged either, like {{tl|infobox park}} and {{tl|infobox forest}}, which [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 April 5#Template:Infobox forest|failed to gain consensus]] because basically a forest is not necessarily a park (what probably in your view is a "red herring", but viewed as a legitimate concern by others).

*'''Strong Keep''' Why is this conversation even being had?  Theatre is a perfectly legit infobox, it is good to have one just for theatre that is different from the generic building infobox.

** We're having this conversation because the two infoboxes are very similar; the building infobox is capable of catering for all the needs of articles about theatres; and using it would allow those articles to use its other relevant features, which are not available on the current theatre infobox; and because reducing the number of similar infoboxes reduces the maintenance overhead when changes such as alt attributes or lua modules for images are introduced.

***Infobox building is not yet "capable of catering for all the needs of articles about theatres" because it is missing parameters provided by infobox theatre. You acknowledged the lack of the parameters in your nomination, effectively refuting that claim yourself. Infobox theatre contains the parameters seen to be needed for theatres; there has been no evidence presented that the additional parameters provided by infobox building would be of use by theatre articles. The maintenance argument is a specious one. There's no evidence that maintenance is an issue at all. In fact the only additional maintenance required seems to be adding {{para|type|sidebar}} to your nominations.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_theatre&diff=606768460&oldid=606753956] But that's another issue. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 19:28, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*****"''Infobox building is capable of catering for all the needs of articles about theatres, '''with the addition of only a couple of parameters'''.''" - (Empphasis added) So, in its present form, Infobox building is ''not'' capable of catering for all the needs of articles about theatres, ''because it's missing'' a couple of parameters. As I said earlier (and demonstrated with links), Infobox building is used by 11,845 articles (was 11,831) so you need to get consensus at that template, after providing testcases that demonstrate these extra parameters aren't going to break anything. I know you read this because you replied to the post despite ignoring this important point.

Then because of our bureaucracy (policies that say) redundancy is not good we have problems like this - that is a perfectly good and working template is being asked to be deleted because some  editor see it as redundancy because of some guideline not because there is a problem with it.  Its all just common sense to let the editors involved with the topic keep the template they seefit over deleting a template they have worked on and has no problems  - its causing conflict simply because of our set of rules - that deters editors new and old alike. [http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/ "A recent study points to quality control rules as a reason for Wikipedia's decline in new editors" - "The main source of those problems is not mysterious. The loose collective running the site today, estimated to be 90 percent male, operates a crushing bureaucracy "] -- [[User:Moxy|Moxy]] ([[User talk:Moxy|talk]]) 18:45, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

Could be one that would fall under [[WP:NENAN]]. The band never released an album and the producers and associated acts are only indirect relationships to the band. The members of the band are already easily linked to and from the [[Blayse]] article. <font color="blue">Star</font><font color="orange">cheers</font><font color="green">peaks</font><font color="red">news</font><font color="black">lost</font><font color="blue">wars</font><sup>[[User talk:Starcheerspeaksnewslostwars|Talk to me]]</sup> 08:10, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

Transcluded only in the eponymous article in which these songs and many others are already listed and linked. I don't see a need for a navbox on only the one page to specify the songs that reached number one. --<font color="blue">Star</font><font color="orange">cheers</font><font color="green">peaks</font><font color="red">news</font><font color="black">lost</font><font color="blue">wars</font><sup>[[User talk:Starcheerspeaksnewslostwars|Talk to me]]</sup> 07:47, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

This award is a promotional fun award as part of [[NBA All-Star Weekend Celebrity Game]], given to people already famous, certainly not a career changer, or even that notable in the subjects career.
