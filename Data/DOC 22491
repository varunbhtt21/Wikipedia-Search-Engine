The song currently fails [[WP:NSONGS]] as it has yet to receive significant '''independent''' coverage in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. It will not even be released as a single for a whole month and it has not charted. The only citation used is an overall preview of the album and the rest of the article is [[WP:OR]].

:<s>'''Redirect to [[The Hunting Party (album)]]''' for now. When it gets significant coverage from reliable third party sources independent of the album, recreate page. [[User:XXSNUGGUMSXX|XXSNUGGUMSXX]] ([[User talk:XXSNUGGUMSXX|talk]]) 23:38, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</s>

*'''Redirect''' - per nom. The article creator seems to lack a grasp on the [[WP:GNG]], judging by a number of articles like this that have been prematurely created. Wait until there's more to be said, and more coverage.

*'''Keep'''. It just had the World premiere on BBC Radio 1 and also the lyric video has been released now. --[[User:Stryn|Stryn]] ([[User talk:Stryn|talk]]) 18:37, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''{{strikethrough|Redirect}} Keep'''- It has been premiered. Good enough for me! ''[[User:RazorEyeEdits|RazorEye]]'' ⡭ ₪ ·o' ⍦ ࿂ 00:13, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per [[WP:TOOSOON]].--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 07:27, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*''' Keep ''' - Per [[WP:NSONG]], the article is "the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the artist and label" (iheart, Ultimate Guitar, Rolling Stone and Loudwire) and "there is enough material to warrant a reasonably detailed article".  At a minimum, the article should be MERGED into ''[[The Hunting Party]]''. --[[User:Jax 0677|Jax 0677]] ([[User talk:Jax 0677|talk]]) 08:30, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:*But is there significant coverage independent of the album? WP:NSONGS also states "Coverage of a song in the context of an album review does not establish notability. If the only coverage of a song occurs in the context of reviews of the album on which it appears, that material should be contained in the album article and an independent article about the song should not be created." [[User:XXSNUGGUMSXX|XXSNUGGUMSXX]] ([[User talk:XXSNUGGUMSXX|talk]]) 13:53, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Since the song has now premiered, there's been more coverage of it, such as the following:
: http://loudwire.com/linkin-park-until-its-gone-lyric-video/
: http://radio.com/2014/05/05/linkin-park-lyric-video-until-its-gone/

:*Due to new coverage, I'm changing my vote to '''keep'''. [[User:XXSNUGGUMSXX|XXSNUGGUMSXX]] ([[User talk:XXSNUGGUMSXX|talk]]) 17:53, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per [[WP:NSONG]]. —&nbsp;[[User:Status|<span title="User page" style="color:black;">Status</span>]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Status|<span title="Talk">talk</span>]] · [[Special:Contributions/Status|<span title="Contribs">contribs</span>]]) 22:38, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Its no longer something that has no been covered yet in the news.
