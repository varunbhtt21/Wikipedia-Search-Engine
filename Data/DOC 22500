The result was    '''delete'''. The article presents a future event entirely in the past tense, as if it already happened. Literally, the [[WP:CRYSTAL]] policy is, well, crystal clear: the article speaks as if it's recounting history from the future via a crystal ball and is [[WP:V|inherently unverifiable]] and obviously uncertain to happen in the manner described by the article. The question of whether it's "too soon" is superceded by the very literal interpretation of those policies.

*'''Delete''' per [[WP:CRYSTAL]]. Create this no earlier than when the two championship teams are decided, which isn't until April 2015. [[User:Jrcla2|Jrcla2]] ([[User talk:Jrcla2|talk]]) 14:54, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom and Jrcla2.  Beyond the date and location of the game there is nothing to report. [[User:Rikster2|Rikster2]] ([[User talk:Rikster2|talk]]) 12:51, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' or '''Merge''': There is already an article created for the [[2015 Rose Bowl]], the [[2015 Sugar Bowl]], and the [[2015 College Football Championship Game]] and those are not happening until January 2015 (teams are not going to be determined for those events until December 2014) but an alternative option would be to merge the article to [[2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] or [[2014-15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]] until a date sooner to the national title game. [[User:Michiganwolverines2014|Michiganwolverines2014]] ([[User talk:Michiganwolverines2014|talk]]) 17:27, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
**[[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]] is not a valid argument for keeping an article. [[User:Jrcla2|Jrcla2]] ([[User talk:Jrcla2|talk]]) 20:25, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' One year in advance is not incredibly soon for an article to be made. If we delete it and it is remade within the next six months, it would be more efficient to just leave it up and continue to add to it as the year goes by. [[User:Adamh4|Adamh4]] ([[User talk:Adamh4|talk]]) 16:21, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
**May I add that the article does not contain a single source for any of its claims. If one year is not too soon to have an article, what is? As Jrcla noted, the article can always be remade when the national champion teams are decided. ~'''''[[User:Editorofthewiki|<font color="#F900">EDDY</font>]]'' <sup>([[User talk:Editorofthewiki|<font color="Green">talk</font>]]/[[Special:Contributions/Editorofthewiki|<font color="Green">contribs</font>]])</sup>'''</span>~ 20:51, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
