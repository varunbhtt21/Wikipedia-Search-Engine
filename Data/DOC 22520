'''[[Arundhati Roy]]''' (b. 1961) is an Indian author and political activist who won the 1997 [[Man Booker Prize]] with her debut novel ''[[The God of Small Things]]''. Born in [[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]], Roy wrote several screenplays in the late 1980s after meeting (and later marrying) director [[Pradip Krishen]]. She wrote ''The God of Small Things'' over a four-year period ending in 1996; it was published the following year and received positive international reviews, although in India the work was controversial. She has continued to write essays and articles, but has yet to publish another novel.
