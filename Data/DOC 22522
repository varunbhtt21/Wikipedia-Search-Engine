The '''Apulo-Calabrese''' is a [[breed]] of black domestic [[pig]] from [[Calabria]], in southern Italy.{{r|dad}} It may also be known as the '''Calabrese''', '''Nero Calabrese''' or '''Nero di Calabria''', and by many other regional names. It derives from the old Pugliese pig breed of [[Puglia]], which in turn derives from the [[Casertana (pig)|Casertana]] breed of [[Campania]]; it is closely related to that breed. The Apulo-Calabrese is one of the six autochthonous pig breeds recognised by the [[Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali]], the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.{{r|anas}}

==History==
The Apulo-Calabrese is particularly associated with the [[provinces of Italy|provinces]] of  [[Province of Catanzaro|Catanzaro]], [[Province of Cosenza|Cosenza]] and [[Province of Reggio Calabria|Reggio di Calabria]],{{r|bigi}} and with the area of [[Lagonegro]] in the [[province of Potenza]]. In the early 20th century, local sub-types from these areas were known as the Catanzarese, the Cosentina, the Reggitana and the Lagonegrese respectively; these types are now considered extinct.{{r|barb}} The Calabrese was the principal pig of the region; in the mid-1920s the population was recorded as 131,736. Numbers fell drastically after the [[Second World War]], and in particular from the 1970s, following the introduction of faster-growing foreign breeds such as the British [[Yorkshire pig|Yorkshire]]. 

A herdbook was established in 2001,{{r|dm}} and is kept by the Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Suini, the Italian national association of pig breeders. The population remains low: at the end of 2007 it was 499,{{r|bigi}} and conservation status of the breed was listed as "endangered-maintained" by the [[FAO]] in the same year.{{r|barb}} In 2012 total numbers were reported to be 2198.{{r|anas2}}
