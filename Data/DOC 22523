The '''Bora Laskin Faculty of Law''' is the professional [[school of law]] of [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

==History==
Lakehead University's Bora Laskin Faculty of Law officially opened in September 2013. Its founding dean was Lee Stuesser.<ref>[https://www.lakeheadu.ca/academics/departments/law/about-law-faculty About the Faculty | Lakehead University Faculty of Law] Lakehead University</ref> It was the first Canadian law program to integrate licensing into its curriculum, meaning its graduates are qualified to practice law without requiring an articling process.<ref>[http://www.macleans.ca/education/university/the-new-faces-of-law-school-in-canada The new faces of law school in Canada]. macleans.ca</ref> The Bora Laskin Faculty of Law is one of only two law schools in Canada that has a mandatory, full year course in Aboriginal Law, as recommended by Canada's [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) in 2015.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/law-schools-across-canada-debate-how-to-enact-trc-recommendations/article27775570/] Law schools across Canada debate how to enact TRC recommendations</ref> Its founding was endorsed by the [[Nishnawbe Aski Nation]] of Northern Ontario, because of its support for studying Indigenous law.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/04/11/celebrated-indigenous-law-school-dean-resigns-claiming-systemic-racism.html|title=Celebrated Indigenous law school dean resigns claiming systemic racism|last=Yang|first=Jennifer|date=April 11, 2018|work=[[Toronto Star]]|access-date=April 12, 2018}}</ref>

In 2015, Lee Stuesser left the faculty as Founding Dean,<ref>[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/legalfeeds/2770/lee-stuesser-resigns-as-lakehead-dean-today.html]</ref> and was replaced by interim Dean Lisa Phillips of Osgoode Hall, while a permanent replacement Dean was sought.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/lee-stuesser-resigns-as-dean-at-thunder-bay-law-school-1.3133814] Lee Stuesser resigns as dean at Thunder Bay law school</ref>

On January 12, 2016, the Bora Laskin Faculty of Law announced [[Angelique EagleWoman]], an Indigenous law scholar, as the new Dean of Law.<ref>[http://www.tbnewswatch.com/News/379867/Angelique_EagleWoman_named_new_faculty_of_law_dean_for_LU Angelique EagleWoman named new faculty of law dean for LU]</ref><ref name=":0" /> Her tenure, which began in May 2016, made her the first Indigenous law dean in Canada. Her appointment welcomed by the Indigenous legal community, including the Indigenous Bar Association. In April 2018, EagleWoman decided to resign her position by June 2018, citing systemic racism in the law school.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/lakehead-law-school-dean-steps-down-1.4603395|title=Lakehead University 'acknowledges' law school dean's resignation  {{!}} CBC News|last=|first=|date=April 4, 2018|work=[[CBC News]]|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-CA}}</ref> 

On June 1, 2018, EagleWoman was succeeded on an interim basis by George P. Smith, a [[supernumerary judge]] of the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] based in Thunder Bay who took leave from the bench.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/bora-laskin-interim-dean-1.4647104|title=Justice Patrick Smith named interim dean of Lakehead law school|last=|first=|date=May 3, 2018|work=[[CBC News]]|access-date=October 2, 2018|language=en-CA}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-judge-seeks-halt-to-cjc-process-that-would-remove-him-from/|title=Ontario judge seeks halt to CJC process that would remove him from bench|last=Fine|first=Sean|date=September 26, 2018|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=October 2, 2018}}</ref> Smith, a seventeen year veteran on the bench, had served for three years on the Specific Claims Tribunal adjudicating Indigenous damage claims against the government and had authored two volumes meant to guide judges on Indigenous law.<ref name=":1" /> In September 2018, Smith left as interim dean, two months before what had been planned. The same month, a conduct review was launched by the [[Canadian Judicial Council]] against Smith, to examine whether taking the role meant that Smith violated council guidelines by becoming involved in a situation likely to result in litigation and therefore reduce public confidence in the justice system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/patrick-smith-court-application-1.4839454|title=Former interim dean of LU law school facing conduct review over taking on the role|last=Prokopchuk|first=Matt|date=September 27, 2018|work=[[CBC News]]|access-date=October 2, 2018|language=en-CA}}</ref><ref name="Smith interim">{{cite web |title=Interim Dean (Academic) |url=https://www.lakeheadu.ca/academics/departments/law/dean |website=Bora Laskin Faculty of Law |publisher=Lakehead University |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180802165517/https://www.lakeheadu.ca/academics/departments/law/dean |archivedate=2018-08-02 |dead-url=no |language=en |df= }}</ref> After a finding that Smith had engaged in misconduct, the council referred the matter to a council to determine a sanction, but Smith filed for [[Judicial review in Canada|judicial review]] with the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]], arguing that the council had acted unreasonably.<ref name=":1" /> Smith was replaced as interim dean by David Barnett, the university's acting [[Provost (education)|provost]] and academic vice-president.<ref name="barnett">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/patrick-smith-recalled-1.4823948|title=Lakehead University's interim law dean recalled to the bench, school says|last=Prokopchuk|first=Matt|date=September 14, 2018|work=[[CBC News]]|access-date=October 2, 2018|language=en-CA}}</ref>

The Bora Laskin Faculty of Law is one of only a few Canadian law schools, in addition to Windsor Law and Thompson Rivers Law School, that does not publish a profile on the entering class.

On November 21, 2013, the Convocation of the Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC) made an historic announcement that Lakehead University was successful in its innovative application to proceed with an Integrated Practice Curriculum (IPC) model of legal education.
