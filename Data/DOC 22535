:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Article new enough and long enough. Paragraph one needs sourcing, as does the table of who was on the cards. QPQ done. No image. Hook is not sourced at the minute, but is interesting. Article is neutral and no copyvios found in spotchecks. AGF on one offline ref.

::*{{ping|Matty.007}} I've added a citation to the introductory paragraph.  The hook is cited to sources 4 and 5 in the second to last sentence of paragraph 2.  I did save a copy of the offline article, citation 1, for my own use while writing the article, and you can review it [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wmtryfld35dd7wa/supersisters.pdf here] if you wish.  Thank you. [[User:Gamaliel|<font color="DarkGreen">Gamaliel</font>]] <small>([[User talk:Gamaliel|<font color="DarkGreen">talk</font>]])</small> 18:53, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*The PDF didn't work for me, so AGF on offline source. Mead and Steinem sourced to ref 5, book not working for me ("unavailable for viewing"), so AGF on offline source there too. I think the table needs sourcing.

::::* try this link for ref 1: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wmtryfld35dd7wa/supersisters.pdf
::::* try this link for ref 5: https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EgAhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DHUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1525%2C1560245

::::Sorry for the late reply, I've been out of town for a conference.  The individual cards are viewable online at the University of Iowa library, and the names and numbers are verifiable that way.  I'm not sure what format to use to cite the table, and seventy two citations for each individual card seems excessive.  What do you suggest?

:::::Perhaps a cite only to the library website? Pinging {{U|BlueMoonset}} who probably knows better than me.

::::::{{ping|Matty.007}} I tried that suggestion, what do you think?  I did not add the footnote to the "occupation" column because all of that language is original and based on various Wikipedia articles or other sources.  22:34, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::{{ping|Matty.007}} Is there anything else I can do to improve the article to get this DYK passed?  Thanks. [[User:Gamaliel|<font color="DarkGreen">Gamaliel</font>]] <small>([[User talk:Gamaliel|<font color="DarkGreen">talk</font>]])</small> 21:24, 27 May 2014 (UTC) 
::::::::Very sorry, missed this on my watchlist. Just fix the orphan tag then good to go.
