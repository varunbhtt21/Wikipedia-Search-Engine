And so it begins. From my listing of [[Otaria (Pokemon)]], there [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2014 April 23#Otaria (Pokemon)|appears to be consensus]] to delete redirects from the names of Pokémon in languages other than English and Japanese. I've come up with the first 51, which are listed at [[User:BDD/Pokémon redirects]] instead of here for the sake of our sanity. I will still tag them all and notify creators as appropriate.

I suspect that this will prove uncontroversial, so do let me know if you want to unbundle any or otherwise give this further discussion. But if it proves to be a matter of consensus-backed house cleaning, I won't bother bringing future instances of such redirects to discussion. In addition to indicating whether you support deleting this batch, please say whether you're alright with me deleting other foreign-language redirects from Pokémon names as I come across them. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 18:26, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' there is only one langauge aside from English that is particularly relevant to Pokemon on English Wikipedia, that is Japanese. This is not in Japanese romaji/kanji/kana, so are not relevant on English Wikipedia.

::I am not a fan of Pokémon, nothing against it but I am a bit too old. However, I think the English names for the characters are entirely unrelated to the Japanese names, so putting it in romaji or katakana would not be helpful since that would be simply a transliteration and would not be the names of the characters in Japanese.

*'''Delete''' This redirect is misleading. The "Biproportional apportionment" article is not about what makes an election "fair". Rather, this article is about a concrete election method. [[User:MarkusSchulze|Markus Schulze]] 10:09, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' This link is a clear attempt to imply fairness for a specific voting method, yet fairness is not defined for voting methods. (See [[Fairness]].) [[User:VoteFair|VoteFair]] ([[User talk:VoteFair|talk]]) 01:30, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''', per Markus Shulze and VoteFair. The "fairness" of a particular election system has been debated for at least two thousand years and this might as well go to [[proportional representation]] or [[single transferable vote]] or [[blackballing]] or [[democracy]] or a hundred and one other places, so as a search term it is useless and [[WP:POINTY]]. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 08:26, 6 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' [[User:SimonTrew|SimonTrew]], note that this actually redirects to [[Biproportional apportionment#Fair majority voting]], so this seems a perfectly valid search term and {{t|R to section}}. It's also a former title, so deletion risks breaking incoming links. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 16:54, 7 April 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''''. Hmmm. The reference is there but not inline. (it's immediately below it as it happens to be the last section before the references, of which that is the only one for the entire article and is not inline referenced). It's not the place for RfD to debate improving references etc but where to target things: I still feel although the journal article is called "Fair Majority Voting (or How to Eliminate [[Gerrymander]]ing)" that this is far too specific a target. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 17:12, 7 April 2014 (UTC)
:::The paper by the way is available online at [http://www.ams.org/samplings/math-awareness-month/08-EliminateGerrymandering.pdf the <s>American Methematical Society</s>Mathematical Association of America], and should be added to the reference: I don't like to do that while things are  under discussion. It seems from [http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/fair-majority-voting-or-how-to-eliminate-gerrymandering here, the Mathematical Association of America], that it was awarded the [[Lester R. Ford Prize]], whatever that is, in 2009. I still think it is over-specific. I have written stuff published in learned journals but they are not on Wikipedia because they are far too technical and boring for even this encyclopaedia. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 17:19, 7 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Was it not [[John Milton]] who said "There are more things in heaven and earth/Than are dreamed of in divine philosophy"? [[Bertrand Russell]] then went on to prove, with [[class theory]], that there are actually far ''fewer'' things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in divine philosophy. It is still too specific a target. It is better it was just included at the article on [[gerrymandering]], this is a [[one-trick pony]]. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 17:32, 7 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''... This is a name for a voting system that's published in the academic literature. It's not our place to decide whether it's a good name or not. (Personally, I think it's a bad name for a good system, but that doesn't matter.) [[User:Homunq|Homunq]] ([[User talk:Homunq|࿓]]) 10:26, 9 April 2014 (UTC)
::(Note, I don't exactly understand what happened here, but I'm voting to turn it back into a normal redirect, not to keep it as a separate page.) [[User:Homunq|Homunq]] ([[User talk:Homunq|࿓]]) 10:28, 9 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Let's say that a Nobel laureate decided to promote [[instant-runoff voting]]. Let's say that he decided to use the term "strategyproof voting" for instant-runoff voting. How should Wikipedia take this fact into consideration? [[User:MarkusSchulze|Markus Schulze]] 17:41, 10 April 2014 (UTC)
::[[WP:COMMONNAME]] would come into play. The article wouldn't be moved or anything, but it would be appropriate for [[Strategyproof voting]] to redirect there. We could explain that specific terminology in the article to help allay confusion, but generally, no, it wouldn't be our place to judge the accuracy of the phrase if it's used in reliable sources. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 18:54, 10 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. What got my dander up is that the two original correspondents, who seem to have a bit of a spat about this, one of them is called [[User:VoteFair]]. Now, call yourself what you like, I have no problem with that, but when you come to an RfD arguing about the VoteFair process and your username is [[User::VoteFair]] it seems a little suspicious, so I did my homework. As it happens I think VoteFair is actually being entirely [[WP:NPOV]] and trying simply to improve the encyclopaedia, which I hope we all do. I think we should add the references I gave (at least the one to the AMS, which is freely available) when consensus is reached.

*No, no. I was going ''sotto voce''. [[User:VoteFair]] is, according to the user's page, Richard Forbes the writer of [The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox: A Complete Course In The Art Of Creating Solutions To Problems Of Any Kind]], which amazingly doesn't have an entry on Wikipedia, and declares himself the inventor of the VoteFair method.

*'''Keep''' - a plausible mistake for a person to make who isn't very familiar with the Estate; thus, directing them to the content they're looking for is doubly important, so they don't keep making the same mistake.

*'''Comment''' - why would someone make a plasuible mistake to search for a place/or princely state, which did not exist this is a clear case of [[WP:HOAX]].  Further one must be aware that princely state were defined differently in British India and were considered as an Independent nation and were given right to choose to remain independent or merge into Pakistan or India. Please go thru link [http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/p/pratapgarh_up.html], which is considered as a [[WP:SPS]]  also mentions it as a [[Taluq]]. I would request you to please reconsider your votes. The article was created with an intention of puffery, vanity and misguiding users of wiki - that is why I moved the page to Estate but the redirect remains - I strongly feel it should not, other wise people will be encouraged to create things. [[User:Jethwarp|Jethwarp]] ([[User talk:Jethwarp|talk]]) 03:11, 21 March 2014 (UTC)

*'''Add at DAB''' What's the difference (for an ignorant reader like myself) between [[Pratapgarh]] and [[Pratapgarh Estate]]? And now we have [[Pratapgarh (princely state)]] because of the move. Now, [[Pratapgarh]] is a DAB and neither the estate nor the princely state is listed on that DAB, which at least one of them should be, but I don't like to change things while they are under discussion. The thing is what are people likely to search for, and how can they best find it? It doesn't matter if the name is technically incorrect, just in the opinion of Wikipedia editors would a reader try to search for it? To my mind, they would whack in [[Pratapgarh]] and then find neither the old nor new title there (unless my eyes deceive me which they often do). [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 09:04, 21 March 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Weak retarget'''</s> to the dab [[Pratapgarh]]. A reader searching for this ''might'' be looking for one of the districts, perhaps. Delete as misleading if it isn't retargeted. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 18:36, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

*'''Retarget''' to [[Pratapgarh, Rajasthan]].  I just found out that in fact there was a [[princely state]] named Pratapgarh in [[Rajasthan]] but not in [[Uttar Pradesh]], where this estate existed till 1947 - [http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/p/pratapgarh_r.html]. If I had known this earlier I would not have asked for a discussion here. Another similar named redirect [[Pratapgarh State]] redirects to [[Pratapgarh, Rajasthan]] - so I suggest we redirect this one also to same article.

*'''Ddisambiguate''' that too, at the DAB [[Pratapgarh]]. The point of redirects or hatnotes is not whether things are "correct" but whether people can find the information they are looking for.

::Yes. That article mentions there that it was a 15-gun salute princely state, in the second or third para. Whereas Pratapgarh Estate is not even in [[Rajasthan]] but [[Uttar Pradesh]] (in Oudh, now [[Awadh]]).

*'''Keep''' For now, this seems a likely search term, and nothing else would be referred to as "Episode VII," so I don't see a dab or potential for confusion. Time will tell if this working title has lasting significance, like ''Blue Harvest'' or ''Revenge of the Jedi'' and merits keeping. If it ends up being an ephemeral working title, deletion may make sense later. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 17:53, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

:That might be better. Even better would be to delete it, as a redirect that doesn't seem to have any logical connection with the target, and that has been viewed a grand total of four times in the past 30 days. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 21:25, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Very few incoming links, none from article space, two from user space and two from here; and an essay in Wikipedia namespace is not suited for a cross-namespace redirect as I originally suggested to retarget to {{tlx|really?}}, but changed my mind. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 09:47, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Retarget''' per nom and tag the new target with {{tl|shortcut}}.  The suggested target would not create an XNR, so I'm a bit confused by [[User:SimonTrew|SimonTrew]]'s !vote. --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  19:35, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::From Wikipedia namespace to Template namespace would be a cross-namespace redirect, wouldn't it? [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 21:07, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Ah, I think we are at cross purposes. I suggested that a better target would be [[:Template:Really?]] even though it is a cross-namespace redirect. You suggested another target, which I disagree because it is just [[WP:ESSAY]], but that is in the same namespace from the redirect to the target.  The essay isn't particularly interesting or amusing even though it is tagged as being Wikipedia humo(u)r. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 21:09, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
