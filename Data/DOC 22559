===Neighborhood Market Association===
NMA is a nonprofit industry organization with 2300 business members, headquartered in San Diego with multiple offices throughout California. The organization was founded in 1995. It was originally called the Chaldean Grocers Association and was modeled after other ethnically-based grocer organizations. In 1996 the organization changed its name to the San Diego Merchants Association in hopes of promoting inclusiveness. In 2001 the organization changed its name again to Independent Grocers and Convenience Stores and began accepting members from outside of California. In 2007 the organization merged with the California Beverage Merchants, creating the Neighborhood Market Association. The NMA actively lobbies for candidates and measures through its NMA [[Political Action Committee]] (NMAPAC).
