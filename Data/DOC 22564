'''Winchester''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Wayne County, Mississippi]], United States.

Once a center of political influence and [[county seat]], the former settlement is today covered by forest.

==History==
Winchester was one of the first significant communities in eastern Mississippi.  It was located about {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the [[Chickasawhay River]], and south of "Three-Chopped Way", a pioneer road completed in 1807 connecting Georgia and the Carolinas, via [[St. Stephens, Alabama]], with [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] in eastern Mississippi.<ref name="Rowland">{{cite book | last = Rowland | first = Dunbar | title = Mississippi: Comprising Sketches of Counties, Towns, Events, Institutions, and Persons, Arranged in Cyclopedic Form | publisher = Southern Historical Publishing Association | year = 1907 | url = https://archive.org/stream/mississippicomp00rowlgoog/mississippicomp00rowlgoog_djvu.txt  | volume = 2}}</ref>{{rp|568, 569}}

The town "was situated on a beautiful level site, covered with large oak and other shade trees", and Meadows Mill Creek flowed through Winchester, "a beautiful and never-failing creek of the purest water".<ref name="Riley">{{cite web | last =  Riley | first = Franklin L. | title = Extinct Towns & Villages of Wayne County, Mississippi | publisher = Genealogy Trails | year = 1902 | url = http://genealogytrails.com/miss/wayne/extinct_towns.htm}}</ref>

A military post&mdash;Patton's Fort&mdash;was erected at Winchester in 1813 during the [[Creek War]].<ref name="Wilkins">{{cite web | last = Wilkins | first = Jesse M. | title = Early Times in Wayne County | publisher = Wayne County, Mississippi, Genealogical and Historical Research | year = 1902 | url = http://www.natchezbelle.org/ahgp-ms/wayne/earlytimes.htm}}</ref>

Winchester became "a place of considerable importance in the territorial period and in the days of early statehood",<ref name="Wilkins"/> and was Wayne County's first county seat.<ref name="Riley"/>  Incorporated in 1818, Winchester flourished and in 1822 a court house was built "of pine lumber of the best quality".<ref name="Rowland"/>{{rp|943}}<ref name="Riley"/>  A jail was built in the 1840s, with walls "three feet thick of heavy hewed pine".<ref name="Firebird">{{cite book | title = Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Mississippi, Part 1 | publisher = Firebird Press | year = 1891 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eMX-Snn_mEsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = }}</ref>

Winchester was described as "a center of political influence, second only to Natchez".<ref name="Wilkins"/>  It had between 20 and 30 businesses, and became a successful commercial center, "having no competing trading points near".<ref name="Riley"/><ref name="Wilkins"/>

==Decline==
In the early 1840s, a writer noted that Winchester "is literally tumbling to pieces, and one finds only a skeleton of the flourishing Winchester which existed twenty years ago".<ref name="Fickle">{{cite book | last = Fickle | first =  James E. | title = Mississippi Forests and Forestry | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MOuc3wTN7_IC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 57}}</ref>

When the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] was completed in the 1850s, the track passed a distance north of the town, and a station was erected there.  This necessitated a distinction between "Old Winchester" and the new settlement near the railroad.<ref name="Riley"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Wilkerson | first = Lyn | title = Slow Travels-Mississippi | publisher = Lyn Wilkerson | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jjBE-XbPSeIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

In 1867, the county seat moved to [[Waynesboro, Mississippi|Waynesboro]].<ref name="Rowland"/>

A writer noted in 1902 that the courthouse in Old Winchester "was still standing a few years ago, 'solitary and alone' and unoccupied.  Except that building, not a vestige of the town remains to be seen."<ref name="Riley"/>  Meanwhile, New Winchester had developed, and by 1907 had a population of 300, and contained a school, stores, two churches, a grist mill, two saw mills, a cotton gin and a turpentine distillery.<ref name="Rowland"/>{{rp|985}}

Some reasons offered for the decline of Old Winchester include "want of hotel accommodations".<ref name="Rowland"/>{{rp|985}}  
Another may have been the 1830 [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] which forced the removal of the [[Choctaw]] people from Mississippi and opened up large areas to the north which drew off the populations of Wayne and [[Lawrence County, Mississippi|Lawrence]] Counties.<ref name="Fickle"/>  Still another reason may have been offered by a writer in 1894 who stated about Winchester:
<blockquote>There was no church in the town until forty years after it was settled. After it lost its trade and importance as a town: after other towns were established in the county: after the railroad came through the county in 1854, then the people paid some attention to the building of a church.  It appears that the morals of the people who lived in the town were averse to churches... liquor was sold openly on the Sabbath and [there was] much drunkenness on that day.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brown | first =  A. J. | title = History of Newton County, Mississippi, from 1834 to 1894 | publisher = Pelican | year = 1998 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Tsa3lhCj8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 51, 52}}</ref></blockquote>

Old Winchester today is covered by forest, while New Winchester has some residential homes located along its rural routes.  A historic marker is located along [[U.S. Route 45]] at Winchester Cross Road which reads: "About one mile to the West. Site of Pattonâ€™s Fort, 1813. Chartered 1818. Near old road from Natchez to Georgia. Became a thriving trade center, serving as county seat until 1867."<ref>{{cite web | title = Attractions | publisher = Wayne County | url = http://www.waynecounty.ms/county/attractions/ | accessdate = December 6, 2016}}</ref>
