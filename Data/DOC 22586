Quite a minor [[WP:NOTNEWS]] story and part of a continuing (possibly racist) campaign by various accounts against [[Anjem Choudary]], as anyone reading them will see. [[User:Black Kite|Black Kite]] ([[User talk:Black Kite|talk]]) 00:12, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Weak delete''' - Per reasons above. Badly sourced and undue weight. --[[User:Drowninginlimbo|Drowninginlimbo]] ([[User talk:Drowninginlimbo|talk]]) 00:43, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep'''  Thanks to Black Kite for pointing out what a racist I am.  What happened to [[WP:GNG]]? This is a story that has gone on for over a year now and has been covered by the likes of the Telegraph and (for you wacky online-only kids) the Huff Post. We demand coverage in secondary sources. We have such. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 01:25, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Per Andy. Sorry if an article which is sourced to many reliable  sources with significant coverage from early 2013 to present offends some editors, or if an article about Moslems in London patrolling  streets to impose Sharia law might reflect badly on someone's religion, but it satisfies [[WP:N]] and overcomes the hurdle of [[WP:NOTNEWS]].  [[User:Edison|Edison]] ([[User talk:Edison|talk]]) 03:03, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - Passes [[WP:GNG]] per ''ongoing'' news coverage over a significant period of time (over a year). The topic does not qualify for a WP:NOTNEWS deletion due to this ongoing significant coverage that the topic has received. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 03:23, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' This topic had very significant international coverage last year when the story broke and the topic has continued to appear regularly in the news ever since, most notably when the trials of the members took place. There was further international coverage by ABC just two weeks ago and it was in the Mail within the last week too so no shortage of ongoing coverage either. The article does still require significant expansion, for example there's no mention of the "landmark" nature of the ASBO imposed on those convicted[http://www.london24.com/news/crime/landmark_restrictive_asbo_for_muslim_patrol_extremist_1_3322466], and it would be useful to mention wider issues and other incidents such as the "“Sharia-controlled zone" posters that were installed earlier.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8686504/Sharia-a-law-unto-itself.html] Anyway, the fact that it's far from complete isn't grounds for deletion. If people are struggling to find sources, then search for "Muslim Patrol" as that is the more common term the media use for this topic.--[[User:Shakehandsman|Shakehandsman]] ([[User talk:Shakehandsman|talk]]) 03:39, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - After giving this some thought, I am changing my vote from Strong delete to Weak delete. Although it doesn't seem to be a particularly large group of Muslims who did take part in the Sharia patrols, the extremity of the situation did draw media attention towards them. The article would definitely need rewriting if it does remain though. The way it is written currently makes the incidents look much larger and more significant than the events that took place, as if it were an ongoing series of frequent attacks. As it stands, the article is weak, but it does portray an incident that received some press coverage. I also think that, despite the significant amount of right wing editors who are putting edits towards the article, and the not small potential of them expressing racist feelings in doing so, this should not in any way affect whether the article itself should exist or not --[[User:Drowninginlimbo|Drowninginlimbo]] ([[User talk:Drowninginlimbo|talk]]) 03:48, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' As per reasons given by Northamerica1000 - above all [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:Alfietucker|Alfietucker]] ([[User talk:Alfietucker|talk]]) 09:21, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Just to add, the link to Choudary was made by me, and is entirely due to the evidence provided by the reliable sources I discovered when checking/filling in details in this article. The claim by the OP that this is "part of a continuing (possibly racist) campaign by various accounts against [[Anjem Choudary]]" is patently absurd: I had made no edits whatsoever to the Choudary article until I started getting involved with this one. I would remind that editor to please [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] - taking the line "guilty until proven innocent" is not the way to open dialogue with other editors. [[User:Alfietucker|Alfietucker]] ([[User talk:Alfietucker|talk]]) 09:21, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per all the above - Clearly passes GNG. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 18:16, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''keep''' per [[WP:NOTCENSORED]]. [[User:Sɛvɪnti faɪv |75]][[User talk:Sɛvɪnti faɪv |*]] 19:32, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
