Archana Sharma was a renowned Indian [[Botany|botanist]], [[cytogeneticist]], [[Cell biology|cell biologist]], and cytotoxicologist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Archana Sharma(1932-2008)|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Downloads/article_id_094_05_0672_0672_0.pdf}}</ref> Her widely recognized contributions include the study of speciation in vegetatively reproducing plants, induction of cell division in adult nuclei, the cause of polyteny in differentiated tissues in plants, cytotaxonomy of flowering plants, and the effect of arsenic in water. <ref>{{cite book|title=The Shaping of Indian Science: 1982-2003|pages=1669|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Downloads/article_id_094_05_0672_0672_0.pdf}}</ref> 

== Early life and education ==
Archana Sharma was born on 16 February, 1932 in [[Pune]] to a family of academicians, including Professor N.P. Mookherjee, a Professor of Chemistry at Bikaner<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.insaindia.res.in/BM/BM35_0913.pdf|title=Archana Sharma|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>. Her early education was in Rajasthan. She then went on to do her [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]]. from [[Bikaner]] and later pursued her [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] in the Department of Botany at the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1951. Sharma completed her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1955 and [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]] in 1960, specialising in Cytogenetics, Human Genetics and Environmental Mutagenesis. As a result, she became the second woman to have been awarded a D.Sc. by the [[University of Calcutta]].

== Career ==
In 1967, Sharma joined the [[University of Calcutta]] as faculty, later becoming a Professor of Genetics in 1972 in the Centre of Advanced Studies in Cell and Chromosome Research at [[University of Calcutta]]. In 1981, she was promoted to Head of the Department of Botany, succeeding Prof. A.K.Sharma until 1983.

During her academic career, she supervised over 70 Ph.D. students in the areas of [[cytogenetics]], [[human genetics]], and environmental [[mutagenesis]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.insaindia.res.in/BM/BM35_0913.pdf|title=Archana Sharma|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

Sharma's research led to breakthroughs in botanical science. Among her notable findings are topics related to speciation in vegetatively reproducing plants, induction of cell division in adult nuclei, the cause of polyteny in differentiated tissues in plants, cytotaxonomy of flowering plants, and the effect of arsenic in water. Her research and findings on chromosomal study on [[flowering plant]]s led to a new set of perceptions on their classification.<ref name=":0" /> Sharma also worked extensively in human genetics, specifically genetic polymorphism in normal human populations.<ref name=":0" />

Sharma was a member of organizations such as the University Grants Commission, National Commission for Women, Science and Engineering Research Council, Department of Environment, Overseas Scientific Advisory Committee, among various others. Sharma also served as Chairperson on the Task Force on Integrated Manpower Development of the Department of Biotechnology.<ref name=":0" />

Sharma was actively involved with prominent policy-making bodies, including Science and Engineering Research Council of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India; Environmental Research Council of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India; the Panel for Co-operation with UNESCO, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India; and various technical committees of University Grants Commission, Department of Science and Technology, and the Department of Biotechnology. <ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianbotanists.com/2015/03/archana-sharma-indian-woman-botanist.html|title=Archana Sharma: An Indian Woman Botanist, a Cytogeneticist, Cell Biologist and a Cytotoxicologist|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-16}}</ref>

== Publications ==
During her career, Sharma published 10 books and between 300 and 400 research papers. She published the book [https://www.elsevier.com/books/chromosome-techniques/sharma/978-0-408-70942-2 ''Chromosome Techniques - Theory and Practice''] in 1965 with her husband, fellow professor [[Arun Kumar Sharma]].<ref name=":0" /> She was also the founder of ''Nucleus'', an international journal of [[Cell biology|cytology]] and allied topics, and continued to be its editor until 2007. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/07/30/dr-archana-sharma-pioneering-botanist/|title=Dr. Archana Sharma: The Pioneering Indian Botanist {{!}} #IndianWomenInHistory|last=Shah|first=Aditi|date=2018-07-29|website=Feminism In India|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-16}}</ref> She served on the Editorial boards of ''Indian Journal of Experimental Biology, Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy''.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://insaindia.res.in/detail/N77-0749|title=INSA :: Deceased Fellow Detail|website=insaindia.res.in|access-date=2019-02-16}}</ref><ref name=":2" />
