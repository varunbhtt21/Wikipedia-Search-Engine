==Description==
According to those who encourage this form of fasting, the aim is to refrain from eating what are described in Daniel as "royal foods" including meats and wine. Instead, the diet consists only of vegetables and water. "Pulses" is used instead of "vegetables" in some translations.<ref name=Bloomer /> "Pulses" in this context is often taken as "food grown from seed", including fruit, vegetables or [[lentils]].

==Scriptural basis==

[[Nebuchadnezzar II]] became king of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldean Empire]] in 605 [[Common Era|BCE]]. He invaded the [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[Kingdom of Judah]] in 604 BCE, the fifth year of the reign of King [[Jehoiakim]] of Judah. After Jehoiakim's son [[Jeconiah]] became king, Nebuchadnezzar attacked the Israelite capital of Jerusalem in 597 BCE. In the biblical narrative of the first chapter of the Book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem happened in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, whose successor Jeconiah is not mentioned.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Coogan |editor1-first=Michael D. |title=The [[Oxford Annotated Bible|New Oxford Annotated Bible]], [[New Revised Standard Version]], With The Apocrypha |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-19-528960-2 |page=1234 |edition=4 |quote=''The third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim'' is 606 BCE (see 2 Chr 36.5-7).

The guard charged with their care expressed concern for their health, so Daniel requested a short test of the diet. For 10 days, they were permitted to eat just vegetables, and at the end, the guard was surprised at their good personal appearance and physical and mental health, compared to those who had accepted the royal foods. Therefore, Daniel and his friends were permitted to eat vegetables for the duration of their training. 

{{quote|text=And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties,{{refn|group=NB|"royal rations of food" or "food from the royal table" in modern translations}} and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king.

But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank...Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse{{refn|group=NB|"vegetables" in modern translations}} to eat, and water to drink...

So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days. And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s dainties. So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.|source=Book of Daniel, [[American Standard Version|ASV]], chapter 1, verses 5-16}}

After continuing with the diet during three years of training, they are judged by the king to be mentally superior to all of his own councilors.<ref name=Bloomer />

[[Cyrus the Great]] captured Babylon in 539 BCE, fifty-eight years after the fall of Jerusalem. In the narrative of the tenth chapter of the Book of Daniel, in the third year of the reign of Cyrus, Daniel went into a mourning fast for the first three weeks of the year, including Passover. During the fast, he had no meat, wine, or rich foods. The tenth chapter, and possibly the whole of the Book of Daniel, was composed between 167 and 164 BCE, during the persecution of Jewish people carried out by the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] King [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The New American Bible, Revised Edition |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-19-529803-1 |page=980 |edition=Compact |quote=This work was composed during the bitter persecution carried on by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (167-164 B.C.) and was written to strengthen and comfort the Jewish people in their ordeal.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Coogan |editor1-first=Michael D. |title=The [[Oxford Annotated Bible|New Oxford Annotated Bible]], [[New Revised Standard Version]], With The Apocrypha |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-19-528960-2 |page=1233 |edition=4 |quote=The increasingly detailed descriptions of the period following the division of Alexander's empire to the rule of Antiochus suggest that the apocalyptic sections were composed between 167 and 164 BCE during the Maccabean revolt against the Hellenizing policies of Antiochus and his allies in Jerusalem's priestly circles (see 1 Macc 1).}}</ref>

==Modern practice==
The Daniel Fast became popular as a religious weight-loss diet in the 21st century [[New Year's resolution]]s of Evangelical Protestants in the United States and limits food choices to whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and, seeds. The Daniel Fast prescribes the [[veganism|vegan]] diet in that it excludes the consumption of animal products. The diet also excludes processed foods, additives, preservatives, flavorings, sweeteners, caffeine, alcohol, oils, and products made with white flours.<ref name=Bloomer />  [[Ellen G.
