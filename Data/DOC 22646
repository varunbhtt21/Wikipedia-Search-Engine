'''The Doon School Old Boys' Society''' (often abbreviated to '''DSOBS''') is the alumni society of [[The Doon School]], an all-boys [[independent school|independent]] [[boarding school]] in [[Dehradun]], Uttarakhand, India. The Doon School was founded in 1935 by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a Kolkata lawyer. The first president of the society was the Englishman [[Arthur Foot]], a former master at [[Eton College]], who became the first Headmaster at Doon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/academy/interview_doon-school-is-popular-for-building-an-aristocracy-of-service_1392063 |title=Doon School is popular for building an 'aristocracy of service' - Academy - DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2010-06-05 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}</ref>

The society is ranked as one of the most influential old-boy networks in the world with its alumni including prominent diplomats, bureaucrats, top officers of the defence forces, a former Indian prime minister, writers & media persons, artists.<ref>[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-11-05/news/27619357_1_doscos-jyotiraditya-scindia-project-arrow How the most influential alumni network in India Inc works - Economic Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Alumni of the school are known as [[List of The Doon School alumni|Doscos]] and after graduating gain life-membership to The DSOBS.

==History==
Although the society met ever since the first batch of 1935 graduated, the Memorandum of Association of the Society was formulated in 1945 and the Society was registered under the Societies Registration Act in 1946, with Arthur E. Foot, the then Headmaster of The Doon School, as the Founder President. Arthur Foot passed the reins to the second headmaster of Doon [[J.A.K. Martyn]]. After Martyn's retirement, Surender Kandhari became the first 'old boy' president of the society. The society is officially recognised through [[memorandum of association]] under [[Indian Societies Registration Act]].

===Dosco Register===
John Martyn introduced the 'Dosco Register' before his retirement in 1970. It was to include the details of every Doon School Old Boy, Dosco, graduated ever since the school opened in 1935. With the fourth edition recently published, it is still in print today. The register is continually updated.<ref>[http://store.doonschool.com/productdetails.aspx?id=8962&colid=0 Doon School Record Book]</ref>

===''Rose Bowl''===
Named after the Greek-styled amphitheatre on campus, ''Rose Bowl'' is the magazine for alumni of The Doon School. It is distributed to about 4,000 Doscos around the world. Articles cover news about the alumni (births, deaths, obituaries), subjects such as current affairs, history, literature as well as the school itself. Contributors have included many Doon School alumni from different walks of life, such as the writer [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Kobad Ghandy]].

In the February 2014 issue, prominent Doscos wrote in the newsletter vouching for release of Kobad Ghandy who has been imprisoned for four years without a single conviction. The incident was reported by [[The Times of India]].<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Dosco-boys-push-for-Kobad-Ghandys-release/articleshow/30646104.cms Dosco boys push for Kobad Ghandy's release - The Times of India<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
