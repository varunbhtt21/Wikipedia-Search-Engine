Semsonsing Ingti began by visiting inaccessible areas. Others would have chafed at going to such places, but he was determined to reach out and educate everyone in the world. He believed that only education would bring people from backwardness.

He battled social taboos common superstitions. For example, women were not allowed to walk beside or in front of their husbands and were forbidden to carry umbrellas, because it was considered disrespectful to their husbands. Although the Karbi people did not believe in the mistreatment of women, the social status of women remains unequal.

He spread knowledge on improving [[Jhum cultivation]] and asked farmers to live together rather than in small groups, so they could produce higher quantities of their produce.

Drinking beer is traditional in Karbi culture, but this was misinterpreted to him. Beer drinking was only for social occasions, but it had become a daily life habit for people at that time. He gave up drinking beer as an example for others.<ref name="a" />
