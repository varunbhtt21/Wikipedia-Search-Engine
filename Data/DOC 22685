The [[Allmusic]] review recommended the album awarding it album 4½ stars and stating "the drummer is in top form on this quartet date... He never loses the listener's attention during his two long drum solos... this LP should be snapped up without delay by bop fans".<ref name="Allmusic">Yanow, S., [http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-stepper-mw0000898224 Allmusic Review] accessed May 2, 2014</ref>
