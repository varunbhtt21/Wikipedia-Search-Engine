The main building features the [[Hal Borland]] Room, a memorial to the nature writer whose work first appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1941.

The room includes photos, his books and typewriter.<ref name="carol">{{cite book | title=Natural Wonders of Connecticut and Rhode Island - A Guide to Parks, Preserves and Wild Places | publisher=Country Roads Press | author=Henshaw, Carol | year=1995 | pages=2â€“7 | isbn=1566260795}}</ref>
