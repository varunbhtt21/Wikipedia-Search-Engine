* Datestamp: 05:46, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
* Reason: Was told to change name by WIKIPEDIA and got the following message.

Welcome to Wikipedia. I saw that you edited or created Johnny Lynch (Producer), and I noticed that your username, "Lynch Johnny", may not comply with our username policy. Please note that you may not use a username that represents the name of a company, group, organization, product, or website. Examples of usernames that are not allowed include "XYZ Company", "MyWidgetsUSA.com", and "Trammel Museum of Art". However, you are invited to use a username that contains such a name if it identifies you personally, such as "Mark at WidgetsUSA", "Jack Smith at the XY Foundation", and "WidgetFan87". Please also note that Wikipedia does not allow accounts to be shared by multiple people, and that you may not advocate for or promote any company, group, organization, product, or website, regardless of your username. Moreover, I recommend that you read our conflict of interest guideline. If you are a single individual and are willing to contribute to Wikipedia in an unbiased manner, please create a new account or request a username change that complies with our username policy. If you believe that your username does not violate our policy, please leave a note here explaining why. Thank you.

::{{notdone}} {{ping|ECCO-IBD}} Your suggested one doesn't seem any better, though. Your username needs to indicate you as an individual, not just your organization; while having an organization title in your username is not forbidden, the username must also identify a particular person whom the account belongs to. The form such usernames usually take would be something like "Steve at CompanyCo", which clearly identifies a single person as the owner of the account. Please suggest a new username that addresses this.
