The '''Todd Block''' is a historic commercial and civic building at 27-31 Main Street in [[Hinsdale, New Hampshire]].  It consists of two separate buildings that were conjoined in 1895, creating an architecturally diverse structure.  The front portion of the building is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with Second Empire styling; it is only one of two commercial buildings built in that style in the town, and the only one still standing.  It was built in 1862, and originally housed shops on the ground floor and residential apartments above.  The front of the block has a full two-story porch, with turned posts, decorative brackets and frieze moulding.  The corners of the building are pilastered, and the mansard roof is pierced by numerous pedimented dormers.  The rear section of the building was built in 1895 as a hall for the local chapter of the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] (IOOF).  The principal feature of this three-story structure is its east facade, which has a richly decorated two-story Queen Anne porch.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=88000646}}|title=NRHP nomination for Todd Block|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>
