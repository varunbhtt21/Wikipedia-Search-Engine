The '''Midway Plantation House and Outbuildings''' were constructed in the mid 19th century about {{convert|0.75|mile}} west of present-day [[Knightdale, North Carolina|Knightdale]], [[Wake County, North Carolina]], along the wagon trail that would eventually become [[U.S. Route 64]],<ref name=Silver>{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Charles Hinton|title=Midway Plantation|url=http://www.midwayplantation.com/|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

The two-story [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] was built in 1848 by Charles Lewis Hinton as a wedding gift for his son, David, and daughter-in-law, Mary Boddie Carr,<ref>{{cite web|last= Baumbach |first=George|title=History of the Hinton Plantations, Knightdale, NC|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~baumbach/hinton/history.htm|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> and was named for its relative position halfway between [[Beaver Dam (Knightdale, North Carolina)|Beaver Dam]] and The Oaks, two other Hinton family properties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schulz|first=W|title=The Plantation Houses that made up the early Knightdale area.|url=http://www.knightdalehistoric.com/pdf/plantations3.pdf|publisher=Knightdale Historical Society|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>

Other structures on the site included a [[carriage house]], kitchen, [[smokehouse]], potato house, well house, ice house, cotton gin, loom house, doll house, office, school, two stables, and several slave quarters.  Of these, only the kitchen, school, office, and carriage and doll houses remain. In June 2005, the house and surviving outbuildings were moved approximately {{convert|2|mile}} north of their original location to make way for a large shopping center.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | author = Cynthia de Miranda| title =Midway Plantation House and Outbuildings | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = December 2006 | url = http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/WA4818.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-05-01}}</ref> The move and Hinton family history are documented by Hinton descendant and noted film critic [[Godfrey Cheshire III]] in ''[[Moving Midway]]'' (2007).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/moving-midway-2008 | title=Moving Midway Movie Review & Film Summary (2008) | date=October 15, 2008 | accessdate=November 19, 2016 | author=[[Roger Ebert]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.movingmidway.com/about.htm | title=About Moving Midway - A Documentary by Godfrey Cheshire | accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>
