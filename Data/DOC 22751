* ... that despite [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s claim that [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] contained 150,000 [[Frenchmen]], '''[[Saar status referendum, 1935|less than 1% of the Saar's voters supported a French annexation of the Saar]]'''?
:*
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]). Self nominated at 02:21, 2 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Expanded 5x, large enough, hook cited, no copyvio found. I can't see any QPQ, though (which is the only reason I haven't given it a [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]]). The hook is short enough and interesting, but a large portion of it is bold/linked - although that might just be a personal preference. Is there a better way to phrase it (maybe including the word 'referendum')? (I'm very new here - maybe a second opinion would be good.)
::*'''ALT1'''... that despite [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s claim that [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] contained 150,000 [[Frenchmen]], less than 1% of the Saar's voters supported a French annexation of the Saar in a '''[[Saar status referendum, 1935|1935 referendum]]'''?

::::I have now did this QPQ here -- [[Template:Did you know nominations/Drupad Borgohain]] -- for this DYK? nomination of mine. Also, I approve of the ALT1 hook for this DYK? nomination. Please let me know if there are any additional problems with this DYK? nomination of mine. Thank you. [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]) 22:26, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Also, here is another possible hook for this:
:::::*'''ALT2'''... that despite [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s claim that [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] contained 150,000 [[Frenchmen]], just 2,124 of the Saar's voters supported a French annexation of the Saar in '''[[Saar status referendum, 1935|a 1935 referendum]]'''?
:::::This alternate hook uses raw numbers, as opposed to percentages, for both Clemenceau's claim and for the actual pro-France vote. This, in turn, allows for a better comparison of these two things. Thoughts? [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]) 22:30, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Reiterating the original icon, to keep this from showing up as approved—the last-used icon is picked up by automated processed—since the ALT hooks still need reviewing. (It's a good point, that shorter bolded text is better than a huge phrase; I'd suggest a minor change, placing the "a" before the bolded "1935 referendum", rather than in it.) [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 04:46, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::I approve of all of the ALT hooks here. Any changes which one thinks are necessary to make to the hooks are fine with me. [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]) 20:38, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::(I've removed the "a" from bold in ALT1.) Personally, I have little preference between ALT1 and ALT2 - if pressed, I'd have to go for ALT2. What happens now? Do we have to pick one before giving it a tick? (This is my first time reviewing.) [[User:Bilorv|'''Bilorv''']] [[User talk:Bilorv|(talk)]]  08:27, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::How about ALT3? Would ALT3 be a good hook for this DYK? nomination? [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]) 05:16, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

Shouldn't the hooks use "fewer", not "less", as voters are countable? [[User:Number 57|<font color="orange">Number</font>]] [[User talk:Number 57|<font color="green">5</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Number 57|<font color="blue">7</font>]] 11:14, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:I'd say it depends how you divide the sentence: it should be "less than 1%" but "fewer than X voters". I read it as "...[numerical figure] of the Saar's voters...", as opposed to "less than [countable noun]". I'm usually quite pedantic when it comes to "less" and "fewer", but I didn't pick up on that. [[User:Bilorv|'''Bilorv''']] [[User talk:Bilorv|(talk)]]  11:36, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
{{u|Number 57}} is right, "fewer" is correct. "Less than" is for a quantity, "fewer than" for a number. One per cent (one in a hundred) is clearly a number. [[User:Moonraker|Moonraker]] ([[User talk:Moonraker|talk]]) 01:46, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks for clarifying this. Personally, though, I think that ALT2 might be the best hook to use here. However, again, I myself am fine with any hook being used here. [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]) 20:38, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

Here is a minor change based on BlueMoonset's recommendation:

*'''ALT3'''... that despite [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s claim that [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] contained 150,000 [[Frenchmen]], just 2,124 of the Saar's voters supported a French annexation of the Saar in a '''[[Saar status referendum, 1935|1935 referendum]]'''?

*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Second opinion requested by original (new) reviewer; a confirming check that everything looks okay would be appreciated. Many thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 03:58, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Yes, someone else should really look at this DYK? nomination whenever possible. After all, it has already been almost three days since this comment. [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]) 00:48, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
::::It has already been another six days, and I am still waiting to someone else to review this DYK? nomination of mine. [[User:Futurist110|Futurist110]] ([[User talk:Futurist110|talk]]) 00:00, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
**[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Article new enough, long enough. Hook verified. QPQ done. Good to go!
