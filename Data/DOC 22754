Yeah, this is probably no big deal, and it went unnoticed for a while by other editors, until I just caught it. An IP user [[Special:Contribs/174.22.10.16|174.22.10.16]] ([[user talk:174.22.10.16|talk]]) left something written in Arabic in the Persondata/metadata section in the "Date of Death". They also made another vandalistic edit which he/she reverted but not the "Date of Death". This is probably no big deal but as it could remotely be seen as threatening I am mentioning it here.

== [[Shaker Aamer]] more eyes needed ==

An editor adds allegations based on 2007 US government assessment document.[http://wikileaks.ch/gitmo/prisoner/239.html] 
 
Later a US government review finds that allegations in prior assessments are unreliable.

"'''In 2010 the [[Guantanamo Review Task Force]] found that prior detainee assessments to be overstated. Some assessments, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. Other assessments contained conclusions that were stated categorically even though derived from uncorroborated statements or raw intelligence reporting of undetermined or questionable reliability.[http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf (p.&nbsp;9)'''"

I have added to the allegation section of the BLP that the assessments are unreliable so that the section is balanced, NPOV and conform with BLP. 

Another editor who has already [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard/Archive197#Eyes_needed_at_Shaker_Aamer|shown bad judgement regarding this BLP] keeps removing that the documents are unreliable so that the article is now misleading. 

Putting serious allegations into a BLP based on unreliable documents is fine with me.

Not telling the reader that the US government review task force found the allegation documents unreliable seems to me not conform with BLP policy. Right? [[User:Mautodontha subtilis|Mautodontha subtilis]] ([[User talk:Mautodontha subtilis|talk]]) 09:28, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:What our supposedly "new" editor is not saying is that I added the comment "if you really want it to stay, then you need to tell the entire paragraph, not a half-truth."
:He is not giving the entire meaning of the source's statement.  It's one of the most blatant examples of cherry-picking I've seen in a while.  I wouldn't mind keeping it if he told the entire truth even thought it's not applicable (as I'll explain).
:If you read the entire paragraph he's citing, the source says ''three'' things:  1) some of the assessments were good; 2) some of them overstate the threat; and 3) some of them understate the threat.  Editor Mautodontha subtilis is pretending that only #2 happened.  I said it would be okay if we include #1 and #3 even though it's still meaningless.
:The reason it's still meaningless is because the real problem is not only that the source isn't particularly talking about Shaker Aamer (the article subject).  The source is actually a report from a group that maintains the conclusion that Shaker Aamer should stay in Gitmo until he is sent to Saudi Arabia.
:In other words, the group he's citing ''agrees'' with the previous decisions.  Shaker Aamer falls into case #1 or #3, not the #2 that the editor tries to pretend is the only case that exists.
:The editor is also misrepresenting what I've added before, but that's another subject.

::As a compromise i edited the article text according to the first part of your comment. 
::The second part of your comment is a [[Fallacy]]. There is no way to know for us on what basis the task force made their decision. The threshold is very low under AUMF. 
::The allegations in Aamer's assessment could easily be overstated. The assessment especially names information from fellow inmates who have been shown utterly unreliable. Some might be true others fiction. No way to know. [[User:Mautodontha subtilis|Mautodontha subtilis]] ([[User talk:Mautodontha subtilis|talk]]) 07:36, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:::No way to know?  Sure there is.  The source itself says, "the review participants have decided on the proper disposition—transfer, prosecution, or continued detention—of all 240 detainees subject to the review."
:::That means the same review panel that found some cases to be overstated also found no reason to change Aamer's status.  Remember that this was in the same time period that the habeas hearings were going on.  Some judges ruled then that detainees should be sent home based on the same criticisms that you cited, but they, too, didn't apply this to Aamer.
:::Yes, I'm making an inference here, but it's a lesser one than what you're making.  The source doesn't say how it applies to Aamer.  We only know that they didn't change his status.
:::The legal threshold is lower than for a full trial, but it's not "very low" by any means.  And since his main supporters are unwilling to say they oppose the enemy's side of the war (and it becomes clearer everyday how much they do support it), it's hard to see why the international laws of war shouldn't apply.

::::You still get it wrong. Not changing his status does not mean all the allegations in the former assessment were true. 
::::The burden for the government is to show that he is '''"more likely than not"''' member of the Taliban or al-Qaeda or an associated force. That's all it needs to hold him. (12 years so far). You know any other war in history where any war prisoner has been held for that long? [[User:Mautodontha subtilis|Mautodontha subtilis]] ([[User talk:Mautodontha subtilis|talk]]) 01:33, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:::: Your arguments really do not make sense. Randy2063 do you actually know that the [[Guantanamo Review Task Force]] cleared Shaker Aamer for release? It seems to me that you claim the opposite? [[User:Mautodontha subtilis|Mautodontha subtilis]] ([[User talk:Mautodontha subtilis|talk]]) 05:17, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::You're twisting the facts.  As the sources say, Aamer was only cleared conditionally.  Since his country, Saudi Arabia, is willing and able to accept him under these terms, he can go home as soon as he's willing to go.  He made the choice.  It is a choice that most of his fellow detainees do not have.
:::::You cite the Guantanamo Review Task Force, and yet they have agreed to continue holding him under those same terms based on the very reappraisal that you're trying to make a big deal over.
:::::The fact that Aamer's detention is so long is irrelevant here.  It is solely due to the length of the war. If it really bothered Aamer that much then he would have called for Al Qaeda to end their war, which he has not done, and will not do.  None of Aamer's supporters are willing to do so in any meaningful sense.  (They all support the war in one way or another.)
:::::I think you should take this to the article's regular talk page.  I will make more changes but they can be addressed there.
:::::I also think you should make clear whether or not you've edited these articles under a different account.

::::::Well, it is clear who is twisting the facts. Could you just explain why they US government does not want to release him to the UK? Because in the UK is a democratic country with a working rule of law and free speech? Whereas in Saudi Arabia he could be subject to arbitrary detention and further abuse. In terms of human rights Saudi Arabia is in the same league as North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Somalia, Iran... [http://www.hrdreport.fco.gov.uk/] just in case you did not know. And by the way the UK government is more than willing and wants him back in the UK as soon as possible.

: Disagree. The only primary sources are supplemental and near impossible to replace with secondary ones (such as information about the details of his personal life).  The secondary sources are reliable and have their own WP pages to establish their notability - [[Reason (magazine)]], [[The Next Web]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Globe and Mail]], and [[RT (TV network)]], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and [[Alex Jones (radio host)]].

Alex Jones is also indisputably  notable but not by any means a generally reliable source, especially for anything in a BLP. He's reliable for his own opinions in our article about him, and little else. If you can't see that distinction, then perhaps you should study up before continuing to edit Wikipedia.

== BLPs Quoting Blog Posts By Dana Nuccitelli ==

These BLP articles quote blog posts by Dana Nuccitelli, on a blog titled "Climate Consensus The 97% By John Abraham And Dana Nuccitelli Hosted By The Guardian": [[Richard_Lindzen | Richard Lindzen]], [[Wies%C5%82aw_Mas%C5%82owski | Wiesław Masłowski]], [[Murry_Salby | Murry Salby]], [[Stephan_Lewandowsky | Stephan Lewandowsky]]. We know that [[WP:BLPSPS]] says there is an exception to the blogs-are-unacceptable rule:
"Some news organizations host online columns that they call blogs, and these may be acceptable as sources so long as the writers are professionals and the blog is subject to the newspaper's full editorial control." But that is not the case here. The Guardian itself says that this blog is in a category which is not under the newspaper's full editorial control.

The original proposition for The Guardian's new [http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/dec/07/want-environmental-blogger-for-guardian "environment blogs"] explains "editorial support" by linking to [http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/nov/14/guardian-science-blogs-network the science blogs network page] which says: <blockquote>"Editors have traditionally had complete control over what appears on their pages. Experts and sources can espouse their views, but only within the parameters set by editorial control. The journalist decides which comments make it into their story and which are out. But nearly three years ago, the Guardian's science desk began an experiment to loosen this grip ... They [i.e. the Guardian's original group of science bloggers] were effectively given the keys to the Guardian's site and told they could publish what they wanted, when they wanted. It was a model that no other mainstream newspaper had tried (and to my knowledge that's still the case)"</blockquote>
Further, for The Guardian's [http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jun/07/meet-worlds-best-environment-bloggers list of its blogs in this program] (which includes Climate Consensus The 97% etc.) The Guardian says: "... our environment bloggers will have independence to publish without our editorial interference." Nuccitelli described his application to join the Guardian's program [http://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?n=1984 here].

Accordingly, I hope for acceptance that BLP references to Nuccitelli's blog posts are WP:BLPSPS violations. To avoid having to repeat the argument for every affected article, I am posting here and putting notifications on the articles' talk pages.

The following which had previously been discussed on the article talk page and at BLP/N has been repeatedly re-added today:

A former NYPD officer working as a bouncer at the time said that Grimm remarked about the husband, "I’ll fucking make him disappear where nobody will find him." Grimm reportedly then returned to the nightclub twice, pulled out his gun once, and brought FBI and NYPD officers the second time. Grimm said the article was written by a reporter "on a witch hunt" and that "this incident was fully investigated and I was cleared of all of the ridiculous and absurd allegations. To further entertain this partisan attack on my exemplary career and service to this great nation would be to give [the allegation] credence, of which it deserves none."''

Prior views were that the emphasis on a long version was ''not'' superior to a short statement, and that emphasis on "'''fucking'''" was unneeded in any BLP.  Added eyes here would be welcome, as this particular BLP seems to have attracted a number of "silly season" edits recently, including one which changed his district, and said he was ''succeeded'' by Charles Rangel, etc. :)  [[User:Collect|Collect]] ([[User talk:Collect|talk]]) 18:01, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

The other odd material added was:

:''Grimm married Susan Kim in October, a marriage that Grimm describes as brief, and having ended in annulment. I New York state, annulments can only be granted because a spouse is underage, mentally disabled, physically unable consummate the marriage, or spousal consent was gained through force, fraud, or under duress.''

Which I suggested is unsourced, and OR at the most generous valuation. [[User:Collect|Collect]] ([[User talk:Collect|talk]]) 18:13, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:::No comment on the first issue, but the marriage-related stuff is certainly WP:OR, and shouldn't be included.

Unless this statement.

This is not needed in this BLP: "A former NYPD officer working as a bouncer at the time said that Grimm remarked about the husband, 'I’ll fucking make him disappear where nobody will find him.'" The reporter is apparently not willing to give the Grimm quote as factual, and instead attributes to a single anonymous third party of unknown credibility. Grimm denies having said it. BLP policy was designed to keep crap like this out of BLPs.  He said he said he said something he denies having said.

== Kenneth Brander ==

The article is almost entirely inaccurate. These parts are false:

"Brander was born and raised in Sioux Falls, South Dakota by Joan and Quintus Brander. Brander was named for his birthplace, Kenneth, Indiana, where his family farmed quinoa until the drought of 1988. [1] He then moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota during his youth where his father farmed additional lands.[2] ...
In 1999 Brander received special ordination from Kenneth Brander, a rare case of self-ordination, in the field of medical ethics and is completing a PhD in Pemphigus vegetans in the work of French dermatologist François Henri Hallopeau at Florida Atlantic University. Rabbi Brander is also pursuing a Masters of Science in Scatology at University of Florida.

Brander returns to spend the summer vacation each year in his hometown of Sioux Falls where he and Janice, his wife through levirate marriage, work with concrete and other course granular composites. [3] In light of this work, Brander has been admitted to the South Dakota chamber of commerce, [4] even though he is only a part-time resident of the state.

Brander himself is blood type B negative, [6] one of the rarest blood types for a white male Rabbi. [7]

In 2014, Brander was nominated for the Andrew Carnegie Prize for his work on Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik's manuscripts. Brander has not yet won a Nobel Prize [8] though he has been nominated on multiple occasions for the prize in peace. Brander has yet to voice his opinion on the controversial topic of partial-sprout abortion in plants...

Brander is a U.S. citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. He also maintains a rare collection of Bhutanese ngulttrum which he obtained during his time a visiting professor of comparative futures studies at Royal Thimphu College where his son Ugyen was born.

All of this is patently false and perhaps libel again Rabbi Brander, please remove this article.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.224.200.117|71.224.200.117]] ([[User talk:71.224.200.117|talk]]) 18:36, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

===More participants requested===

This is another one of those articles where some feel that every horrible committed by the BLP needs to be documented.  It seems Sterling has quite a list that can be collated, but what they text sometimes editors use to leaves a decidedly negative, and often unfair assessment.   A current example is the Clippers organization refused to pay for a medical procedure for one of their coaches, and the text in the surrounding context made it seem like Sterling was a heartless bastard.  However upon reading the sources (and in fact all of the sources used editorialize upon the "root" source) it seems the Clippers, like most businesses provide their employees insurance.  The coach wanted a procedure out-of-network.  The Clippers refused, as it would create a precedent.  This seems like par for the course for most businesses.  The only reason I can surmise it being used is to paint the subject in a negative light, and this is ignoring the fact that there is no evidence that Sterling was involved in the decision whatsoever.

My problem is that the source appears to make no such claims at all, and the category "sportspeople" does not generally include team owners at all (''People involved in sports in some way in significant aspects of their lives.'' is the discriminant there).   

Does the source have him specifically self-identify as having Jewish ethnicity?  (The recording refers to black Jews and white Jews in Israel being treated differently (''It's the world! You go to Israel, the blacks are just treated like dogs," the man says''), but does not appear to say he self-identifies as Jewish ethnicity at all.

== Natalia Poklonskaya - fan art in a BLP? ==

I just came across the article [[Natalia Poklonskaya]]. This person is a senior law enforcement official in Ukraine, who has played a significant role in the recent Crimean crisis. However, our biography of her instead chooses to focus on the fact that she is apparently popular with East Asian Internet users, and even includes a gallery of amateur cartoon fan art of her. This seems to me like a BLP issue - it may not be saying anything false about the subject, but it's plainly disparaging her and not treating a living person with the respect she deserves. The fact that our biography has fan cartoons of the subject but no actual photograph of her strikes me as pretty insulting, frankly. Is this kind of material really acceptable in a BLP?

Let me tell you right now that in Japan, this kind of thing is hardly viewed as "degrading"; it's more expressed as flattering or admiring an individual.

One example might be appropriate, maximum, though I'm uncomfortable with Wikipedia generating its own examples of a phenomenon it is documenting, because at that point you are participating, not just documenting.

:I agree. Also from [[WP:GALLERY]]: {{quotation|The images in the gallery collectively must have encyclopedic value and add to the reader's understanding of the subject. Images in a gallery should be suitably captioned to explain their relevance both to the article subject and to the theme of the gallery, and the gallery should be appropriately titled (unless the theme of the gallery is clear from the context of the article). Images in a gallery should be carefully selected, avoiding similar or repetitive images, unless a point of contrast or comparison is being made.}}
:The gallery in the article obviously fails several of the criteria. It is just an indiscriminate collection of pictures without explanation and represents a rather bad example of WP:OR and SYNTH. It is visual editorialising fueled by original research and synthesis.

:Quote: ''"I'm uncomfortable with Wikipedia generating its own examples of a phenomenon it is documenting, because at that point you are participating, not just documenting"'' - None of the images used were generated by Wikipedia contributors, they were all selected based on significance. There are many related images on Commons, but not all were comparably significant to the ones used, which is why they weren't included within the article. [[:File:Natalia Poklonskaya fan-art by Itachi Kanade.jpg]] is probably the most significant: This image was covered by multiple Russian and international sources, including BBC. [[:File:Natalia Poklonskaya by phanc002.jpg]] was also covered by various Russian newspaper websites. Out of all the [[Pixiv]] images, [[:File:Natalia Poklonskaya by As109.jpg]] has [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=42462813 the most views on Pixiv], and is therefore the most popular (likely because the artist involved is a famous one). On the day it was uploaded and the three days after that, the artwork by As109 was the second-most viewed and top-rated artwork on a daily basis ranking on Pixiv, and thus was featured on the front page of Pixiv. --[[User:benlisquare|<span style="font-family:Monospace;padding:1px;color:orange">'''benlisquare'''</span>]]<sub>[[User talk:benlisquare|T]]•[[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|C]]•[[Special:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|E]]</sub> 05:38, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:As Benlisquare already explained, none of the images were generated by Wikipedia.

You can assume that plenty of your readers have never seen any before, and have no idea what one is. The Nissan Hydra GTR comes in two models: The GTR-X with twin-turbo engines plus a flat bonnet, and the GTR-Lite with a lower chassis and different rear body shape. If you only include an image of the Nissan Hydra GTR-X, readers would become inclined to believe that all cars of the Hydra series of vehicles share the same appearance. This is a problem. However, they then read the prose which states that there are two models within the series - this confuses them even more, since there is only one picture, but mention of two models.<p>Our article prose makes it clear that the internet phenomenon involves multiple drawings. Obviously, we cannot place fifty artworks within the article, since this is overkill and absolutely silly; hence, we go for a "minimum approach" and choose a number of images that '''a)''' does the job properly, whilst '''b)''' not being overkill.

{{od}} I support Gamaliel here. One picture is enough. Let's not forget this is a BLP and not an art gallery. A single cartoon of the person amply demonstrates the cartoon-genre which has been created for the subject of the BLP. Unless we have valid commentary from art experts which analyses these cartoons as to the  symbolism of the depiction of this person, their artistic merit, and creative differences etc., any addition of multiple cartoons in the article would be unnecessary visual editorialising driven by WP:SYNTH and OR. And even if we had critical commentary from art experts, the commentary should go to a new article, not the BLP, per [[WP:UNDUE]]. This is an article about a person's life, not the analysis of an internet cartoon phenomenon.

===Arbitrary break===
Alright, we've had a bumpy ride so far. That said, much of the discussion is going here and there, and not much progress has been made. Many of the points provided aren't being adequately addressed, and this is one of the many problems we are having.
;A summary of points that have yet to be addressed
'''First''' of all, the claim that the images are demeaning. Of these images:
{{multiple image
 | width = 100
 | align = none
 | footer = Proposed images on talk page
 | image1 = Natalia Poklonskaya fan-art by Itachi Kanade.jpg
 | caption1 = Image most covered in mainstream media
 | image2 = Natalia Poklonskaya by phanc002.jpg
 | caption2 = Optional image, inclusion is purely up for discussion
  | image3 = Natalia Poklonskaya by As109.jpg
 | caption3 = Image with some coverage, but is done by a well-known, professional and mainstream artist
 }}
Which of these are demeaning or sexist, and ''why''? No explanation has been given. You can't just drop the "it's offensive" bomb, and then run off without elaborating on it. ''Why'' are they sexist, and why do they affect the status of women? Is there too much cleavage in one of the pictures? Or is there too much makeup on? What? Come on guys, I can't read minds, just pretend that I'm an idiot and explain it to me from the foundation upwards.

'''Second''', the necessity of having <u>''a''</u> image. Wikipedia reports on what other news sources report, and not what is necessarily justice. [[:File:Natalia Poklonskaya fan-art by Itachi Kanade.jpg]] is reported by the following outlets: [http://rt.com/news/prosecutor-natalia-poklonskaya-crimea-101/ RussiaToday], [http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26663168 BBC] [http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/natalia-poklonskaya-crimean-attorney-general-becomes-surprise-japanese-anime-viral-hit-1441281 International Business Times], [http://kotaku.com/crimeas-attorney-general-spawns-anime-fan-art-1547001178 videogame news website], [http://m.jp.rbth.com/arts/2014/03/20/47617.html Japanese news site], [http://www.news.de/politik/855513584/krim-staatsanwaeltin-natalia-poklonskaya-sex-symbol-sie-ist-in-japan-ein-manga-star/1/ German news site], [http://vtc.vn/10-480914/tin-tuc/slide-show/1/index.htm Vietnamese newspaper], [http://www.metronews.ru/novosti/novyj-prokuror-kryma-stala-zvezdoj-japonskogo-anime/Tponct---ifq0izo7wFTC2/ Russian news site], [http://tengrinews.kz/strange_news/prokuror-kryima-stala-zvezdoy-yaponskogo-interneta-252276/ Kazakhstan newspaper], [http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20140327/-12-3224333/l/1198177.html Sina Hong Kong], [http://www.guancha.cn/europe/2014_03_20_215443.shtml Chinese news site], [http://abcnews.go.com/International/vladimir-putin-understand-alaska/story?id=23359781 ABC News], [http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2014/03/24/natalia-poklonskaya_n_5019950.html Huffington Post Japan]. This is just a preliminary search, and there is much more. This is only just for the one image, and there are more out there for the others as well.

'''Third''', the necessity of having <u>''multiple''</u> images. From [[Talk:Natalia Poklonskaya#Which images to choose?]]:
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:left; width:85%; float:none; padding:10px 15px; display:table;">
'''Would a carefully crafted selection criteria meet [[WP:GALLERY]]?'''
*''The images in the gallery collectively must have encyclopedic value and add to the reader's understanding of the subject.''
:*Two or three images are able to adequately explain to the reader what is being written in the prose. Too many and it becomes inappropriate, any less and it doesn't do the job as effectively.
*''Images in a gallery should be suitably captioned to explain their relevance both to the article subject''
:*Captions can be included to explain why the carefully selected images are of relevance. Reasons may include "this image was covered by X, Y and Z media outlets", or "this image was top-ranked for X consecutive days".
*''and to the theme of the gallery,''
:*The gallery itself is self-explanatory, and a heading would make it even clearer.
*''and the gallery should be appropriately titled (unless the theme of the gallery is clear from the context of the article).''
:*This is easily done.
*''Images in a gallery should be carefully selected, avoiding similar or repetitive images, unless a point of contrast or comparison is being made.''
:*The point being made would be that there are differing artworks with varying styles that exist, because by default the reader would not know this kind of information. We're talking about a new reader who is just discovered this topic, and doesn't know anything else about it. If they only saw one image, he would not fully understand the topic of the section. The careful selection of images would be non-arbitary and non-random, and be chosen via [[WP:CONSENSUS]] based on reasoning including media coverage and so forth. Images selected will have significant visual difference between each other - in other words, we don't need a selection of images all featuring microphones, or from one pose, or from one author. If all the images were too visually similar to one another, this would negate the purpose of having different images.
</blockquote>
Are there any flaws within my reasoning, and why? Which of my points are wrong?

Someone please address these points. They have been out there for a long time now, and I hope that this is the final time that I have to repeat these. --[[User:benlisquare|<span style="font-family:Monospace;padding:1px;color:orange">'''benlisquare'''</span>]]<sub>[[User talk:benlisquare|T]]•[[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|C]]•[[Special:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|E]]</sub> 21:20, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*{{tq|depicting a female law enforcement professional as a child-like fetish object}} - is this what you are getting from the three pictures above, Gamaliel? Benlisquare is right - there's some sort of a cultural gap here. I am Asian, and the view that Poklonskaya is being depicted like a child has never crossed my mind. I have seen a lot of anime pictures with big eyes, small nose, small mouth and a big head, that's just the way anime is drawn. As for "fetish" - as in a sexual way? Sure, all the three pictures above show Poklonskaya in uniform - but there is nothing sexual about them to me.

:::*The latter part of your statement is also purely subjective. ''"The anime style is characteristic enough to not need multiple examples of the art."'' That's quite a boldly generalised statement there. A similar train of logic would be to say "African Americans all look the same, therefore we only need one image in the infobox at the [[African American]] article", which I'm quite certain plenty of editors may take offense to. I would disagree with the opinion that the art style is characteristically the same. Hence, having two images with differing styles would be able to bring home the point quite clearly, just like how the 12 images within the infobox at [[African American]] does. ''Two'' is a much smaller number than ''12'', don't you think?<p>By saying that we cannot display two artworks here to provide examples used in mainstream media, it's clearly a double standard being put into force. What job is being done by having 12 images or African Americans, 9 images of Turkish people, and 8 images of Argentines? They're providing examples, just like here. Why aren't the [[WP:GALLERY]] police chasing after them instead? Is it different because it's an infobox? Either address this double standard by asking the people involved in the [[African American]] article to fix their blatant "image-gallery-within-an-infobox" over there, or allow this article to join the club just like any other functional article, with just ''two darn images''. No more, just ''two''. --[[User:benlisquare|<span style="font-family:Monospace;padding:1px;color:orange">'''benlisquare'''</span>]]<sub>[[User talk:benlisquare|T]]•[[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|C]]•[[Special:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|E]]</sub> 03:09, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*''Images in a gallery should be carefully selected, avoiding similar or repetitive images, unless a point of contrast or comparison is being made.''
:*The point being made would be that there are differing artworks with varying styles that exist, because by default the reader would not know this kind of information. We're talking about a new reader who is just discovered this topic, and doesn't know anything else about it. If they only saw one image, he would not fully understand the topic of the section. The careful selection of images would be non-arbitary and non-random, and be chosen via [[WP:CONSENSUS]] based on reasoning including media coverage and so forth. Images selected will have significant visual difference between each other - in other words, we don't need a selection of images all featuring microphones, or from one pose, or from one author. If all the images were too visually similar to one another, this would negate the purpose of having different images.
::*'''Reply:''' {{xt|The point being made would be that there are differing artworks with varying styles that exist, because by default the reader would not know this kind of information.}}: The BLP is not the place to educate the reader about anime and its various styles.

There is no reliable source contrasting or comparing these images. If we do that, it is our own OR and SYNTH. And {{xt|Images selected will have significant visual difference between each other}} is not really true. The subject may be depicted in various poses, full-body or portrait, but the general anime style is unmistakable in all of them. We do not need multiple cartoons to illustrate the anime cartoon drawing method and its subgenres. One cartoon is enough. If the reader wishes to get an education on the anime style they can always go to the anime article. The BLP is simply not the place to educate people about anime.

:::*''"The BLP is not the place to educate the reader about anime and its various styles."'' That's not the point. This has nothing to do with "anime styles", this has to do with how different works of Natalia by different people appear different. c.f. the articles on classic Greek and Roman gods such as Aphrodite and Poseidon. (Yes, I am aware that they aren't BLPs, you don't need to point that out in your next reply. The point addresses the ''art'' issue.) The section within the much larger article is the place to educate the reader about the internet "meme". The internet "meme" does not have its own article because existing a section clearly suffices.<p>Furthermore, your statement is slightly misinformed as well, since none of these images are "anime". [[Anime]] refers to a [[keyframe animation|moving picture]]. Hence, the statement that the BLP isn't the place to "educate the reader about anime" is rather out of place. There is nowhere else on the entire project to demonstrate differences in Natalia artworks (not "anime", but artworks) except for this section within this article. The "anime" article is about anime, and not still art.<p>''"it is our own OR and SYNTH"'' Why? Multiple reliable sources show multiple artworks. It's not OR if it's done elsewhere.<p>''"The subject may be depicted in various poses, full-body or portrait, but the general anime style is unmistakable in all of them."'' - This is a subjective statement, and also contains the same logical misconnections as the above statement on "anime". Nowhere in the Natalia article does it claim that the images are "anime", so you should stop referring to them here as "anime".<p>Saying that this [[File:Natalia_Poklonskaya_fan-art_by_Itachi_Kanade.jpg|80px]] looks the same as [[File:Natalia Poklonskaya by As109.jpg|80px]] this, is like saying that this [[File:Mike Tyson Portrait.jpg|80px]] looks the same as this [[File:President Barack Obama.jpg|80px]]. Both artworks appear clearly different, however you keep repeatedly saying that "the general style is the same etc etc", even though the difference is clear as day for anyone with two eyes to see. If someone said that "Greeks look the same as Turks, because they have the same hair colour and eyebrow shape", I can assure you that you would probably get offended. Why, then, should you follow the same train of logic here? These images are not "anime", and they do not share any identical or similar characteristics which would put them into a same generalised category. In Japan, these images would merely be described using the umbrella term of "fanart", which involves more than just one art style. [[:File:Natalia Poklonskaya by As109.jpg|This image]] is just a regular painting style artwork that doesn't even follow the alleged conventions of "anime". This logic is not accepted anywhere else, so why use this logic here? I'm certain that if we changed the subjects around (e.g. Greeks and Turks), ''you too would not accept this logic''. Please do not use a train of logic that you yourself would not accept. --[[User:benlisquare|<span style="font-family:Monospace;padding:1px;color:orange">'''benlisquare'''</span>]]<sub>[[User talk:benlisquare|T]]•[[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|C]]•[[Special:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|E]]</sub> 03:27, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

Remember - so far, you have resorted to plenty of subjective and interpetative arguments, and have avoided making any statements with a concrete backing.

*Art, by its nature, is subjective. Dr.K's statement that ''The anime style is characteristic enough to not need multiple examples of the art'' is therefore also purely subjective as well.

We've added a fair use real-life image of her which was deleted. Regarding the article, WP:UNDUE was brought up, so we've cut the Internet popularity section and beefed up the other sections. Not long ago the Internet popularity section was 46% of the body. 45% of it was trimmed away and now the Internet popularity section is just 17% of the body. The "Internet popularity" content is out there but we're not adding it to the article. We've originally had a gallery of five images, step by step as we're arguing for five, four, three and now two. I think that the already reduced nature of the Internet popularity section allows for a marginally larger weight of two images than one, and that section in particular would rely on images the most.

:::::::*{{xt|I guess it's easier to be a naysayer than a content builder,...}}: You should consider this as an example of content-builders of other articles trying to offer advice about this BLP. One should not have to be a content-builder in this exact article to be able to express an opinion. In any case, the problem I have with this proposal is that what in effect this section amounts to, is an overblown, single-event, [[WP:TRIVIA]] section replete with pictorial examples of popular art. It is actually "Poklonskaya in popular anime/manga etc. culture". It is basically completely unrelated to the actual deeds of the BLP subject and it is imposed on it just because anime/manga etc. fans find the subject of the BLP "kawaii" or "cute". This cultural assault of the anime industry on the subject of the BLP is a useless diversion in the context of the actual BLP which is supposed to describe the life and work of the prosecutor, not an internet fad which is fueled by the anime/manga industry.

I've read over the discussion here, on the article talk page, and the DYK submission, and there is a key point that the proponents of the gallery are not quite grasping.  Benlisquare makes a reasonable case that more than one image is necessary to fully represent this fan art phenomenon.  This argument would be relevant if this article were called "Natalia Poklonskaya fan art meme", but it is not.  It is the biography of Natalia Poklonskaya and must represent her entire life, representing each aspect in a proportionate way.  Including a entire gallery for this single aspect of her life, especially when the article contains no other pictures, disproportionately over-represents this small part of her biography.  The concern to respectfully, proportionally, and accurately document her biography overrides any concerns about fully documenting this fan art phenomenon with a large number of pictures.

::Furthermore, per the article talk page, it is no longer the case that people seek "a entire gallery"; two images is hardly considered a gallery. Since the number of images is to be reduced, the issue of [[WP:UNDUE]] and being overwhelming has become much less of an argument. Since your statement explicitly says that the problem relates to "a large number of pictures", this no longer applies, because it does not matter what part of the world you are from, [[two]] is not a large number, unless you're counting polonium isotopes by gram.

;On image use and [[WP:UNDUE]]
In practical (read: realistic) terms to a reader, there is little difference in conspicuousness between these two:
{{multiple image
 | align = left
 | footer = Two lizards
 | width1    = {{#expr: (150 * 235 / 320) round 0}}
 | image1 = Komodo Dragons in the wild on Rinca island Indonesia..jpg

 | image2 = Thorny Devil crop.jpg
 | caption2 = 
 }}
[[File:Lizard - e.JPG|thumb|right|250px|One lizard]]
{{-}}
The total image size is the same, and the number of thumbnail frame boxes are the same. That's all the reader will notice. Don't dwelve into the technicalities behind template usage - the average reader will care very little about these intricate details. The reader is only concerned about what he sees. You can argue about how "technically two files are used", but this is something that readers have little concern over, and things such as [[WP:UNDUE]] are designed to relate to what kind of content ''readers'' find, and not things like load on the servers or anything like that. Readers are the primary audience here, and not technical staff or contributors. As long as the pixel size is low, and there is only one frame, there is nothing [[WP:UNDUE]] about using two images. I have yet to find a convincing argument explaining why the two lizards on the left would be more [[WP:UNDUE]] than the one lizard on the right. Formatting the two images like this is no different from me stitching two images together in Microsoft Paint and then reuploading it, the main difference is that it saves me the effort of opening up Microsoft Paint. --[[User:benlisquare|<span style="font-family:Monospace;padding:1px;color:orange">'''benlisquare'''</span>]]<sub>[[User talk:benlisquare|T]]•[[Special:Contributions/Benlisquare|C]]•[[Special:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|E]]</sub> 10:28, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

If the community deems that there is indeed a difference in conspicuousness, then using the new method would allow for a greater compromise.

How are these two different, from a layperson reader's perspective?

== Single purpose account block requested ==

*{{la|Carson Block}}
*{{la|Muddy Waters Research}}

*{{user|Rondonvolante}}

Hi all,

A couple of days ago I semi-protected both these articles due to a variety of unregistered and un-autoconfirmed editors repeatedly adding BLP violations/other unencyclopedic content. One of the main culprits was the above-linked user, however I decided not to block because I expected the semi-protection to halt the issues.

Unfortunately, now that the user is confirmed, they have returned to readding the BLP violations, and have not only broken 3RR but gone well beyond it. Given the account is a single purpose account purely for re-adding these BLP violations, I request an indefinite hard-block to prevent any repeat offences from this individual.

(I could have technically done this myself as I am not involved and it's a BLP dispute, but given the editor in question has already given me one spray on my talk page about being biased and whatnot for semi-protecting the article ''sans'' their BLP violating content, it would be more appropriate for someone else to do it.)

== [[Akinwunmi Ambode]] ==

Akinwunmi Ambode is a candidate here in Lagos Nigeria vying for political office in the 2015 elections. The  article [[Akinwunmi Ambode]] contains some irregularities as shown below:
* The article is not written from a Neutral point of view (NPOV) 
# "he ensured probity in the financial management of the limited resources and also plugged the loopholes that allowed for financial frivolities and recklessness."
# "He was known as an achiever and performer."
# "In addition, he was able to motivate the civil service staff around him and all were glad to have worked under him"
# "Ambode believes that..."
# "Ambode is a very active member of the..."
# "This book tells the story of his life about giving back to humanity, his community and his mission of selfless service."
* Ambode's heritage (which the article claims to be Epe, Lagos) has been reported to be something else by the biggest newspaper publishers in the country (http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/lagosians-warn-against-emergence-of-non-indigene-as-fasholas-successor/175913/)

In summary, Wikipedia's policy of BLPs advises they be written responsibly, cautiously, and in a dispassionate tone. I would therefore like to request the article be modified to adhere to these guidelines and not be used as a political tabloid tool as it currently is in this case.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Tadegoke|Tadegoke]] ([[User talk:Tadegoke|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tadegoke|contribs]]) 08:21, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

The article appears to be self-published. I flagged it 2 months ago for multiple issues including lack of neutrality, poor sourcing, reads like a resume, and inserted citations needed flags.

when nothing happened I expressed my concern on the talk page. Unregistered users, presumably fellow researchers from his corporation, or employees have made numerous edits, adding soft awards etc. I sincerely doubt the notability of this person; Publishing 300 biomedical articles is not enough, otherwise thousands of researchers should have their own wikipedia page.

All of a sudden 26 changes were made, again unregistered users IP addresses tracing to the location of his lab.
From beginning to end, this article has been written by Giordano's corporation.

== Peter Rees (producer) ==

There's a disagreement between some editors and the apparent subject of the article going on on {{la|Peter Rees (producer)}}. The editors want to include a statement that the subject, a TV producer, had to leave a TV show after a prsenter received a severe electric shock. The source cited is a YouTube clip of the prsenter giving an account. Insufficient source for this acusation, in my view. But in any case, the prsenter doesn't allege a causal link in the clip anyway. The other editors seem to be more interested in COI allegations than BLP so more eyes on this article would be a good idea. [[User:DeCausa|DeCausa]] ([[User talk:DeCausa|talk]]) 08:44, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:I'm sorry but this is not at all true. The content that DeCausa refers to was added in 2013 by an editor whose only ever edits to Wikipedia were [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=561254580&oldid=547748838 these edits] to the article. Nobody else has argued that the content be included in the article. The restoration of the edits have been the natural result of an editor claiming to be the subject adding original research and inappropriate claims about the hosts of [[MythBusters]] to the article,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=603398164&oldid=591548342] and then completely destroying the article with a subsequent edit.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=next&oldid=606321581] When the edits were reverted, the claim was restored to the article in the process of reversion. The offending claim has been removed by DeCausa,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=606741564&oldid=606738372] who has explained his action on the talk page,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APeter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=606741860&oldid=606737692] and whose actions I supported.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=next&oldid=606741860] The issue now is that of COI and legal threats by the editor, who has yet to prove that is who he says he is. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 12:06, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

== [[Donald Sterling]]  accusations of a third party being a Prostitute ==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Sterling&diff=606825770&oldid=606823398]   shows a blanket revert of material which includes what I consider to be exceedingly serious BLP violations -- including accusations that another person is a prostitute, and a third was a "mistress".    BTW, there is no way that Castro is "notable" or in any way subject to any exception from strict compliance with the policy. 

It also contains speculation about criminal intent in a real estate project,  etc.


I consider such re-insertion of fairly contentious material (saying a person committed felonies is contentious IMHO) is intolerable.

I was "warned" on this by a person who wrote:

::'' '''All that is not mandated to be deleted can be included, and all that is allowed to be included should not be deleted'''; BLP therefore assures that there should be '''no deletion of contentious material with a reliable source'''. Edit summaries should not include contentiousness as a sole rationale.''

Which I am either bemused by or affronted by.   The idea that '''all that is not forbidden is required''' is Orwellian enough, but  how one can stretch that to calling another person a "prostitute" and think it does not violate [[WP:BLP]] is quite beyond my ken.   By the way, the sources refer to "allegation" and I consider "allegations" of criminal acts to not be worth the paper they are printed on for statements in any BLP.  Cheers.

== K Camp ==

{{la|K Camp}} was recently converted from a redirect into a full-blown article.  I'm a little concerned about the writing style and referencing.  In particular, several sentences in the lead seem to express opinions as if they were facts, and quite a few quasi-factual claims (particularly those relating to the history of this artist) are unsupported by references.  I don't want to just stubbify the whole thing because I'd rather not step on the [[User:STATicVapor|primary author]]'s toes (especially if they plan to fix these issues tomorrow), but on the other hand we're really not supposed to just wait around on BLP issues.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  03:38, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

: All I did was add the discography section, add citations since there was zero before and removed all the opinion garbage that the person that wrote the article had in there so the article was not tagged for deletion for not being notable or for another reason. I did not write a single bit of the prose besides the first sentence "'''K Camp''' is an American rapper." I seriously would not like my name attached to that article at all, because I did not write it. I honestly do not care what happens to the article, but the subject clearly meets [[WP:MUSICBIO]].

== [[Jaiyah Saelua]] ==

[[Jaiyah Saelua]] is an international footballer who identifies as a [[fa'afafine]]. All the press items which involve interviewing the subject make it clear that [[fa'afafine]] is the primary identification [http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/finally-making-history-for-all-the-right-reasons-20111125-1nz0s.html]. In some, teammates are quoted using female pronouns for the subject [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11249328].  They play in the [[FIFA]] men's league.  The article identified the subject as [[transgender]] and the talk page as a [[trans women]]. As far as I can see [[fa'afafine]] should be used in both of these places. The fact that the western media is translating this non-western gender into western concepts in order to explain things to the readers is of no concern when it comes to [[WP:MOSIDENTITY]].

Thanks,--[[User:Jmundo|Jmundo]] ([[User talk:Jmundo|talk]]) 18:42, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*Jmundo has a bias to downplay the violent crimes for which OLR was convicted. He claims that I deleted the reference [http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/us/12-imprisoned-puerto-ricans-accept-clemency-conditions.html New York Times 1999] which stated

:"Mr. Lopez Rivera was convicted in Chicago in August 1981 of numerous charges, including weapons violations and conspiracy to transport explosives with intent to destroy Government property, and sentenced to 70 years in prison. Mr. Clinton had offered to reduce his sentence."

And I replaced it with citations that are very detailed about the convictions in a US House of Representatives Report. However, if he does not like , why don't we use [http://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/25/us/son-of-reagan-termed-the-target-of-terrorist-plot.html# New York Times 1981], a report on the conviction of OLR which states:

:''After deliberating five hours, the 12-member jury, which received the case today, found Mr. Lopez-Rivera guilty on five counts involving seditious conspiracy, armed robbery, weapons violations and interstate transportation of stolen property.''

Does he still have problems with the notion that OLR was convicted of armed robbery? Please participate in the Dispute resolution ongoing for this article.[[User:Rococo1700|Rococo1700]] ([[User talk:Rococo1700|talk]]) 05:23, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

== All Congresspeople ==

The issue at [[Michael Grimm (politician)]] is asserted to include all Congress<s>men</s>people.

The dispute is over whether Charles Rangel "succeeded" Grimm in Congress.  Despite Rangel and Grimm having absolutely zero constituents in common at all.


The edit involved is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Grimm_(politician)&diff=607059585&oldid=607013446]  with the claim in the edit summary: ''Then please change every single Rep. who has been redistriced on Wiki. That is what happens with re-disgtricting. Do not RV. This is how it is to be display''

On the Talk page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Michael_Grimm_(politician)&diff=607060506&oldid=606318017]

:''I have reverted your edits because, to be frank, you are wrong. Regardless of how the districts overlap, this is something that does not only affect Grimm but also every other Rep on Wiki. This is not a page issue but an issue that has to do with the general format. If you feel strongly, please try to adjust the default format with the Wiki admins and not try to experiment on Grimms page. I understand what you are saying logically, but physically your changes look ridiculous on the page itself. Please, again, do not revert my recent edits or I will report you for vandalism. - DONALDderosa (talk) 19:04, 4 May 2013 (UTC) ''

So far I have found absolutely ''zero'' RS sources for claiming that Rangel succeeded Grimm.   Congress counts seniority independent of "district numbers"  and thus it is inane to haveWiki[edia make a claiminWikipedia's voice that Grimm was succeeded by Rangel.

I'd have to admit, it's odd to see Collect assert that it's not right to call redistricting a "succeeded," event, and get into a full-blown edit war over that, but ''not once'' "fix" the "Preceded by Yvette Clarke" line on the exact same article.

The link to the Daily Star says Prince shows up at an event with Bria Valente (his girlfriend). The picture shown in the link shows Prince with Andy Allo. I believe the journalist who wrote the piece doesn't know the difference and therefore quoting Bria Valente's age alongside a picture of Bria Valente is questionable. I don't thin think the source is reliable.

== Biased article: [[Elena Udrea]] ==

{{la|Elena Udrea}}

Please do not let this site involved with the misery of political battles!
Not a balanced biography, just few facts mixed with enumeration of denigrating claims(many of them false), purposely insisting on pointing rumors instead of presenting impartial information about a personality. From how is the article written it looks more like the opera of an editor serving political interests(the subject of the article being a politician possibly candidate for presidency) than a honest intention to contribute to Wikipedia.

And 80% of the quotes are from media sources or authors that are from slightly hostile to fully denigrating her daily and the parties that are not socialist, it is like would be quoting mostly republican sources in Obama's biography and write mostly what they say about him.

Example: for the personal life of a politician what is important is that a scandal media claimed that her dress did cost 14.000 pounds even if I remember from the press of that time that she showed the UK site price of 780 pounds for it pointing the proof of the lie? How would be if instead of so much useful information on articles here we would had found mostly what some scandal press are claiming and their cheap articles quoted? Watch out for this kind of editors...

Another example, for 710 million old lei contracts(~17.000 EUR, not mentioning that the amount is in our old currency is also biased as the new currency value is 10.000 times bigger so the amount would be 71.000 lei now) the unbiased information would had said the complete truth, that during 2003-2004 she received a total of 2.35 billion old lei(~55.000 EUR, were more contracts during two years) from RA-APPS for her services as lawyer but later she also returned that amount on her initiative, claiming that she wants to be free to delimit herself from politicians immoral practices of getting luxury buildings from same RA-APPS without auction(during returning period her attorney bureau was successfully contesting a law allowing politicians to get public propriety buildings without auction at unfair prices). Her previous services were also with direct contracts(usual practice at state owned institutions, legal for smaller amounts work as auction on services required on bigger contracts only), if she did return the fees because feeling that was not 100% right on moral side even if covered on legal side, for her legal fight and protest against the acquiring of hundreds of thousands or millions EUR buildings at smaller prices to have more weight as she said, to give political adversaries less ammunition with a teasing subject, a bit from all of them, or other reasons - does not matter, what matters is showing the complete picture of a subject not only the "convenient" parts of it. The list can continue for most parts of the article. More or less subtle manipulation techniques like that content are common especially among some communist inheritance politicians here and their mass-media but less on Wikipedia I hope.

Another editor and I are [[User_talk:Stuartyeates#Your_revert|having a disagreement]] over [[Vanessa Kerry]]. I feel that much of the biographical content is unsupported by the refs (none fo the refs mentions 'Phillips Academy', for example), which are mainly not-very-independent interview-based refs that cover a very small part of her life, in which she seems to be being a media spokes-person for a charity she founded. A considerable portion of the coverage is full of oblique references to american politics, which I confess not to understand, being a foreigner. I recently PROD'd the related [[Seed Global Health]], because none of the article is actually about the organisation, but instead about he problem the organisation is trying to solve.

==Additional eyes requested==
*{{la|Peter Youngren}}
I will also be requesting this at [[WP:COIN]].

I encountered this article recently at the [[WP:CP|copyright problems board]], and rewrote it to address copyright issues. The article had been under the attention of Youngren's business, it seems, and the rewrite (which is unfortunately mostly negative, since that's all the sourcing I could find) is not pleasing to them, as a result of which they have been blanking content. I would really appreciate assistance if anyone is able to help out to make sure that the content is properly balanced - I suspect that there ''must'' be more positive out there than I have found. It would also be helpful if any uninvolved editors can assess the sources being used. I checked [[WP:RSN]] but didn't find any discussion of them; however, ''ChristianWeek'' is cited in a number of articles already and seems to be widely referenced as a specialty publication on the web (for but one example, see reprint of a story here: [http://www.thrive-magazine.ca/qry/page.taf?id=27&_function=atcldetail&sbtatcl_uid1=165]).

== Gary Null Article ==
So this article was neglected for a long time, with a lot of biased information, formally and informally.  My Dad did radio shows with him in the 70's and 80's.  So I looked at this article and thought it does not reflect a fair, balanced, or accurate portrait of Mr. Null.  It seemed to have been taken over by people with biases, indeed.  So i started editing it and putting in more information, deleting what was not justified, and providing fairness where it appeared warranted.  

So right now the article is getting hammered under the guise of objectivity by people who appear to have biases against people who advocate naturopathy and have spoken against establishment medical practices.  The problem is I know the subject personally, and that is partly what motivated me to at least get the article fairly balanced.  Having a conflict of interest does not *necessarily* provent someone from editing an article according to wikipedia, but it certainly is something to consider.  But some of these edits against my inputs have been legit, others peevish, others obviously informed by outside agendas/self-evident conflict of interest.

So all I can say is it would be great to get some additional non biased researchers involved not only in tearing down *all the edits* I made (someone reverted the article fully, but to provide more fair, balanced and accurate writing on the subject.  hello 01:14, 11 May 2014 (UTC)  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ian McGrady|Ian McGrady]] ([[User talk:Ian McGrady|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ian McGrady|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:For reference: {{article|Gary Null}}

:In the last day or two, Ian McGrady has made a flurry of edits (roughly 50, ranging from minor to enormous) to the Gary Null article.  In rapid succession, he has watered down, minimized, and deleted content critical of Null; added spurious and dubious attacks on individuals who have expressed negative opinions of Null; larded the article with badly-sourced and misleading content supportive of HIV denialism; copy-pasted big chunks of self-serving CV; and fluffed up the article with promotional phrasing. Ian McGrady has made no effort to use the article talk page to discuss his very substantial edits to the article, either before or after.
:Mr. McGrady was making so many edits in rapid succession that it is difficult to tease out exactly what he was doing with each one&mdash;and it's not clear that he thought them all through, or that his edit summaries are an accurate record of what he did.

Here is the talk page discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Robert_Lewandowski#BLP]

Basically the material involves some inane minor incident. Some student gave Lewandowski the finger. There were some charges filed on both sides. Then both sides dropped the charges. The finger-happy student apologized. Why on earth this is important info which just absolutely must appear in a BLP is beyond me. It violates [[WP:BLPGOSSIP]]. Pointing this out on the talk page has not resulted in much constructive discussion as the other two editors merely repeat the assertion that the sources used are reliable.

==[[Dick Cheney]] and [[The Huffington Post]]==
Upon archiving Dick Cheney article I have stumbled on ref 163 as being Huffington Post, a reliable source which was discussed previously in various discussions about Huffington's reliability, and I have mixed feelings about it. I found the same ref only in [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/79119.html Politico] which I think is more reliable then Huffington, considering that the previous discussions regarding Huffington were calling it a blog as I just read. Should I change it, or should I add it, or should I live it as is, since I will do archiving either way in some time? I thanking all responders in advance!--[[User:Mishae|Mishae]] ([[User talk:Mishae|talk]]) 18:41, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
:IMO If one ref was controversial as a "blog", use the Politico ref. [[User:Capitalismojo|Capitalismojo]] ([[User talk:Capitalismojo|talk]]) 19:03, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::O.K. What about the Washington Post, is it as unreliable as Huffington? Also, is Politico reliable, or its too is a "blog"?--[[User:Mishae|Mishae]] ([[User talk:Mishae|talk]]) 19:07, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
:::'''Comment''': [[The Washington Post]] is one of the most trusted newspapers in the US while [[The Huffington Post]] is an Internet news site and blog, so they have nothing in common except for having "Post" in their names.

:::::Yes, WaPo is generally considered a strong reliable source. Politico is a mainstream media RS and is not a blog. Huffington Post has to be closely looked at. Generally it is considered reliable but it has quite a number of invited blog pages, columnists and op-ed writers who are reliable for their own opinions only.

== Ignazio Ciufolini ==

*{{la|Ignazio Ciufolini}}

A while ago a series of SPAs whose contributions are limited to editing this biography insisted on inserting a "Misconducts" (seriously) section detailing an incident where the subject was accused of using "sockpuppets" to submit papers to [[ArXiv]] critical of his competitors. The original discussion ended with agreement that the source for the controversy was essentially ArXiv itself, which made it inappropriate at best. There were also concerns about [[WP:UNDUE|weight]]. Now there's apparently a new source, a Discover Magazine [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2014/05/10/pseudonyms-vs-sock-puppets/ blog] that mentions the controversy. My problem with this is that the source is indeed a blog, written by someone under a pseudonym. Which also invites us to peruse other blogs for more information, in addition to the blogs used as secondary sources to re-insert the information. In other words, all this can be sourced only to ArXiv itself or blogs. In my opinion this is not sufficient to justify including it in the subject's biography, especially not by SPAs. But perhaps other BLP-savvy editors disagree. Here is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ignazio_Ciufolini&diff=prev&oldid=608272954 relevant diff]. <span style="color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|<span style="color:#00CA00">FreeRangeFrog</span>]]</span><sup>[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]</sup> 20:23, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

</ref>. It is a Letter to the Editor in a peer-reviewed journal like [[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]], and several blogs from all over the world in different languages. At this point, continuing to censor this aspect is unacceptable. Why FreeRange Frog deliberately ignore the peer-reviewed Letter to the Editor in the [[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]], and the non-anonymous blogs in Italian and Serbian? Why does he focus on the anonymity of Neuroskeptic in [[Discover (magazine)]]? It seems that he is only interested in my alleged "conflict of interests" or to whatsover wiki-paranoid excuses (the anonymity of Neuroskeptic...), not to the facts! It is a shame!

::Thank you. So the issue here is: Are these [[WP:RS|reliable secondary sources]] that are sufficient to support assertions of [[WP:BLPCRIME|misconduct]] by the subject? Does the inclusion of the material represent an issue of [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]? Blogs are almost never considered reliable, and I would have no problem accepting the Discover Magazine one except that it's written under a pseudonym and references a paper by one of the involved parties. By the way, emotional! arguments! with exclamation marks! based on "I am being censored" claims don't work around here. We base arguments on our policies. And the suggestion that you don't have a conflict of interest (given the focus of your contributions here) is rather ludicrous. <span style="color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|<span style="color:#00CA00">FreeRangeFrog</span>]]</span><sup>[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]</sup> 20:49, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

*The article in [[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]] is a peer-reviewed article which is not a primary source on these alegations, but a secondary source (it reports that the archiveX moderators as the (possibly intermediate) source of the alegations). As a secondary source it seems strong enough to support very carefully worded [[WP:BLPCRIME|misconduct]] assertions. I've looked for to see whether [[Ignazio Ciufolini]] has used any right-of-reply  avenues, but I'm not seeing any.

::{{ping|Stuartyeates}} It might be peer-reviewed but it's still a primary source, since the author is the one making the allegations about Ciufolini. <span style="color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|<span style="color:#00CA00">FreeRangeFrog</span>]]</span><sup>[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]</sup> 03:49, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
:::My reading of the full text is that the [[ArXiv]] moderators were making the allegations "“This submission has been made by G. Felici, a pseudonym of Ignazio Ciufolini, who repeatedly submits inappropriate articles under pseudonyms, in violation of arXiv policies.”" and "“This submission has been removed because ‘G.Forst’ is a pseudonym of Ignazio Ciufolini, who repeatedly submits inappropriate articles under pseudonyms. This is in explicit violation of arXiv policies. Roughly similar content, contrasting the relative merits of the LAGEOS and GP-B measurements of the frame-dragging effect, can be found in pp. 43–45 of (Ciufolini, 2007).”".  Whether or not the allegations were subsequently withdrawn is another matter.  [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 05:04, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
