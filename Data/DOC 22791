'''The Victorian College of the Arts Centre for Ideas''' was a building constructed in 2000 for [[Melbourne University]]. It was awarded in 2004 the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] prize for Best New Institutional Building. The Centre functions as teaching and office spaces and a library. The primary motivation behind this design was to represent movement from the virtual into reality. Minifie van Schaik conveyed this decision through the gradients of colour on the public stairs and external canopy. Additionally they maintained their drive through the choice of a stainless steel fa√ßade that is textured and reflective.
