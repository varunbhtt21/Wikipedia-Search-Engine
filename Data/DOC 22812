This reads like a resumé/CV. Except for bot fixes and general housekeeping, it has not changed much in five years and the creation comment was "Asked on the new page notice board about thsi and didnt get a response so thought i'd make the page and wait for feedback.". So here is some feedback: it looks like a resumé. It's not written in encyclopaedic style, it is poorly referenced, and although he won a BAFTA so what? People win awards in all kinds of industries, it just happens to be one where you get on telly when you do. Not really notable person, by Wikipedia standards. Might be by BBC or BAFTA standards, but Wikipedia is not the BBC or BAFTA. The first two hits on Google are to this Wikipedia article, so obviously he is not notable even at the BBC or BAFTA. The slighltly high hit rate lately (to the tune of ten hits) are probably 2 mine and some others coming from the discussion of <s>[[Oneworld.net]]</s> [[OneWorld.net]] at [[WP:RFD]]; typically gets less than five hits a month. He is mentioned as the editor of Domesday vol. 2 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/domesday/2011/11/happy-birthday-domesday.shtml here at the BBC] but so are loads of other non-notable people.

*'''Weak keep''': Appears to meet [[WP:ANYBIO]] (subject has received a [[BAFTA]]).  A poorly-written article should be cleaned up, not deleted.  Suggest tagging with {{tl|like resume}}.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  04:02, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', it was not just any old BAFTA but a Lifetime Achievement Award. Move to [[Peter Armstrong (producer)]] like others in [[Special:Search/intitle:producer]] – I would do it now but do not want to confuse this AfD. – [[User:Fayenatic london|Fayenatic]] '''<font color="#FF0000">[[Special:Contributions/Fayenatic london|L]]</font>'''[[User talk:Fayenatic london|ondon]] 11:54, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep'''. Reads like a resume, yes. Needs moved to producer title, yes. However, it is sourced now, even though Domesday doesn't even mention him in its article here. — '''[[User:CAWylie|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">Wylie</span>]][[User talk:CAWylie|<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">pedia</span>]]''' 07:36, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
