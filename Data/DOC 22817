*'''Keep'''. 20 papers in GS with over 200 citations give a very clear pass of [[WP:Prof#C1]], but puffery needs much pruning. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 02:51, 3 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Strong keep'''. That's 20 papers in GS with over 200 citations '''each'''. A very clear pass of [[WP:Prof#C1]], as Xxanthippe says, and a complete failure of [[WP:BEFORE]] on the part of the nom. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.89.99|101.117.89.99]] ([[User talk:101.117.89.99|talk]]) 06:51, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Thanks for clarifying what I meant to say. I second your sentiments. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 10:17, 3 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Keep''' per [[WP:PROF#C1]]. But it looks like much of the text of the article was copied or closely paraphrased from [http://www.shro.org/SHRO/AGBio.html this source]; it may need to be stubbed down. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 21:32, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
