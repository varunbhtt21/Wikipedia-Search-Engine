Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
| Description    = The artwork for "A Sky Full of Stars", a single by British alternative rock band Coldplay, released by Parlophone on May 3, 2014.
| Source         = "A Sky Full of Stars" UK Digital download 
| Author         = [[Coldplay]] / [[Parlophone]]
| Article        = A Sky Full of Stars
| Purpose        = Main infobox. The image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary of the work for which it serves as cover art. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed in the infobox at the top of the article discussing the work, to show the primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Use for this purpose does not compete with the purposes of the original artwork, namely the artist's providing graphic design services to music concerns and in turn marketing music to the public.
| Replaceability = As musical cover art, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the music would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary.
| Minimality     = This image will be shown as a primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the work in question.
| Commercial     = This image is not being used in a manner that is likely to replace the original market role of the original copyrighted media.
