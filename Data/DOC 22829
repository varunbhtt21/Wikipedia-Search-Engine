'''Jeanne Devos, [[Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary|I.C.M.]]''', (born 1935) is a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] [[Religious Sister]] and [[missionary]] who has spent her adult life serving the neediest people in India. She founded the National Domestic Workers Movement to advocate for one of the most powerless segments of society. For her work, she has been nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==Life==

Devos was born in 1935 in [[Kortenaken]], a village in the Province of [[Flemish Brabant]]. She attended the [[:nl:Heilig Hartinstituut Heverlee|Heilig Hartinstituut]] (School of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Holy Heart of Mary]]) in [[Heverlee]], run by the Apostolic Sisters of the Annunciation, an active offshoot of the [[Order of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], an [[enclosed religious order]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annuntiatenheverlee.be/|work=Sisters of the Annunciation of Heverlee|title=The Apostolic Annunciades}}</ref> As a teenager, she became introduced to the writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], from which she felt called to serve God in India.

To follow this dream, in 1960 Devos entered the [[congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] of the Missionary [[canoness regular|Canonesses of St. Augustine]]—now the [[Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]]—which had been founded in India by 1897, and whose General [[Motherhouse]] was located in Heverlee at that time. After completing the [[novitiate]] of the congregation, in order to prepare for service in the missions she was sent to be trained as a [[speech therapist]]. In 1965 she was sent to the missions of the congregation in [[Bombay]], India.<ref name=PWG>{{cite web|url=http://www.1000peacewomen.org/en/network/1000-peacewomen/search/jeanne-devos-725-27.html|work=PeaceWomen across the Globe|title=Jeanne Devos}}</ref>

In 1966 Sr. Jeanne founded a student’s movement (YCS/YSM) with the aim of linking students to the underprivileged.

==Domestic workers==

In 1978 a survey was conducted by the [[Catholic Bishops Conference of India]] on the actual working conditions of domestic servants in India. The survey depicted slave-like conditions for domestic workers all across the nation. As a result, in 1980 Devos began to work with women and girls in the [[Dindigul district]] of the State of [[Tamil Nadu]]. She helped to organize small groups of domestic workers to help them in whatever way she could. She became upset about the situation of these workers and the general attitude held by both employers and society in general held towards them. They had no voice and had no means to stand up for their rights. They were invisible. She saw how women from the poorest segments of the population slaved as domestic servants, usually with illegally low wages and no rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndwm.org/?page_id=66 |work=National Domestic Workers Movement |title=About Us: Pre-1985 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502090042/http://ndwm.org/?page_id=66 |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}</ref>

Devos gained a new sense of urgency "after meeting the 13-year-old girl Sangeeta who was raped, pregnant and had aborted – without understanding what had happened to her." To combat this situation, in 1985 she founded the Domestic Workers National Movement, based in Mumbai, which organizes and advocates for women and girls. It now operates in 18 states of the nation, working in 28 different languages.<ref name=PWG />
