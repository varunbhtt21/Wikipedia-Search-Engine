'''''Astylus atromaculatus'''''  is a species of [[beetle]]s in the family [[Melyridae]]. It is variously known as the '''Spotted Maize Beetle''', or '''Pollen Beetle'''. It is indigenous to [[Argentina]] and neighbouring countries, but has been accidentally imported into various other regions such as the warmer regions of [[North America]] and much of [[Africa]], where it has become invasive.<ref name= "isbn0-409-08398-4">{{cite book |author1=Annecke, D.

==Description==
Adult ''Astylus atromaculatus'' are roughly oval in shape, slightly elongated, with parallel sides. They generally are slightly flat in shape, and like most Melyridae, tend to be soft and leathery in texture. They attain about 12&nbsp;mm in bodily length by 5&nbsp;mm wide. They are finely bristly with finely punctured elytra and upper surfaces. The body colour is generally black, but with pale hairs on the pronotum surrounding two large, eye-like dorsal black patches. However, the most conspicuous feature is the colour scheme of the [[elytra]]; they are yellow to orange with a black [[Anatomical terms of location|median]] stripe along their margins where the folded elytra meet. Two blotches on that median stripe form cross-marks, one about 2&nbsp;mm from the anterior end of the line, and one about 1&nbsp;mm from the posterior end. Each elytron has three much larger black blotches on its [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsolateral]] surface near its [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] margin. The filiform [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] have eleven [[Antenna (biology)|antennomere]]s.

The larvae are covered with long, silky [[seta]]e, brown to reddish in colour.<ref>Astylus atromaculatus.

==Biology==
The adult ''Astylus atromaculatus'' are herbivorous, particularly being attracted to flowers and feeding on pollen. In this role they are not much of an agricultural problem and for some crops, such as sunflowers, it is suggested that they are more beneficial as pollinators than they are harmful as crop pests. In particular they feed on pollen from wind-pollinated plants such as maize, [[sorghum]] and other grain crops in the [[Poaceae]], and also various [[Cyperaceae]]. During the high season they may crowd inflorescences at certain times of the day.

The larvae might be more harmful, feeding in the ground on decaying plant matter, but also feeding on seeds and germinating seedlings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinavimo.gov.ar/en/pest/astylus-atromaculatus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424211413/http://www.sinavimo.gov.ar/en/pest/astylus-atromaculatus |archivedate=2014-04-24 |df= }}</ref> On the other hand, in South Africa they have been reported to be minor predators of stem borers in grain sorghum and maize.<ref>ARC-Plant Protection Research Institute (ARC-PPRI) Natural Enemies of Cereal Stemborers [http://www.arc.agric.za/arc-ppri/Pages/Insect%20Ecology/Natural-enemies-of-cereal-stemborers-.aspx]</ref>

Especially in the countries where they are invasive and where presumably their natural enemies are absent, ''Astylus atromaculatus'' may become sufficiently numerous to cause significant crop damage. However, it is arguable whether it is ever worth applying special pest control treatments, rather than at most modifying other routine applications to accommodate their control.<ref name= "isbn0-409-08398-4"/> There is however a concern that infestations could seriously damage rice harvests by causing apparent sterility; unlike the situation in maize, in which the male and female flowers are separate, rice female flowers can be seriously damaged by pollen-feeding beetles.<ref>Gene Stevens, Earl Vories, Jim Heiser and Matthew Rhine (2012).

==Veterinary significance==
Like possibly all Melyridae, ''Astylus atromaculatus'' is undoubtedly poisonous; livestock deaths have resulted from swallowing large numbers of beetles in their fodder or in pastures. Though this is not a routine event, it has been confirmed by actual investigation, for example when cattle on the Springbok flats in South Africa ingested heavily infested pasture. The beetle populations commonly peak during midsummer and autumn, when they feed mainly on pollen from grain crops. When there are too few crops such as sunflowers and maize, the beetles are prone to concentrate on grasses, and on [[forb]]s in flower.

Poisoning caused severe diarrhoea with dark faeces and large quantities of mucus, rapidly followed by weakness and stasis of the rumen. Post mortem, beetles were found in large numbers in the rumen, associated with symptoms of dramatic congestion and irritation of the abomasum and haemorrhagic pseudomembranous intestinal enteritis. Because no treatment has proven effective for severely poisoned animals, it is necessary to keep livestock out of pastures while the plants are full of beetles, typically in the cool of mornings and evenings while the insects are inactive and not prone to scatter when alarmed by grazing activities. Yellow trays of detergent solution have been shown to trap the beetles, though it is not clear that they are an effective measure in reducing heavy infestations.<ref>Annual Report 1 April 1991 to 31 March 1992, South African Department of Agriculture, Directorate of Animal Health.</ref><ref>Van den Berg, J., Torto, B., Pickett, J.
