Title : Valdez Creek
Text : '''Valdez Creek''' is one of the small headwater tributaries of [[Susitna River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]].

==Geography==
The stream rises in the foothills of the [[Alaska Range]] and flows in a general southwesterly direction for about {{convert|12|miles}}. It is approximately {{convert|160|miles}} north-northwest of [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], or {{convert|120|miles}} directly south of [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]]. Valdez Creek has cut its present channel through deep gravels and has intrenched itself in the underlying schist bed rock.<ref name="Brooks1909">{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Alfred Hulse|title=Mineral Resources of Alaska: Report on Progress of Investigations in 1908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqcPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA157|edition=Public domain|year=1909|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=157–}}</ref>

==History==
Gold placers were discovered in Valdez Creek in 1903. Mining was restricted at the time to two localities on the stream—Lucky Gulch and the vicinity of Discovery claim at the mouth of Willow Creek. A hydraulic plant was installed on Valdez Creek below Willow Creek in 1908 with about 120 men engaged in mining on Valdez Creek during that summer.<ref name=Brooks1909 />
