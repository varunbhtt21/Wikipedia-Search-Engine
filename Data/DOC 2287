'''Nimlot''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian ruler ("king") of [[Hermopolis]] during the [[25th Dynasty]].

==Biography==
It is possible that Nimlot was a son of king [[Osorkon III]] of the [[23rd Dynasty]], and is likely that he was installed as a governor of Hermopolis by this king,<ref name=K313/> around 754&nbsp;BCE. He was married to a "queen", Nestanetmeh, and proclaimed himself King around 749&nbsp;BCE.<ref name=KT16/>

At the time of Nimlot's rule, the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]ite king and [[pharaoh]] [[Piye]] was launching a campaign of conquest against [[Middle Egypt|Middle]] and [[Lower Egypt]] (c. 729-728&nbsp;BCE).<ref name=K325>Kitchen, op. cit., § 325-7</ref><br>
At first, Nimlot was an ally/vassal of Piye, but later he pulled back and joined the coalition led by [[Tefnakht]]. This ''volte-face'' caused Piye's immediate reaction: he marched northward and besieged Hermopolis until Nimlot's capitulation. After the conquest of the city, Nimlot had to give rich tributes to Piye, including a horse and a precious [[sistrum]]; Piye also blamed him for his defection and for neglecting his [[stable]]s.<ref name=K325/><ref name=CAH>T.G.H. James, op. cit., pp. 684ff.</ref>

After Nimlot's submission, the situation turned more favorable for Piye, and he managed to defeat Tefnakht's coalition. On Piye's ''Victory stele'', Nimlot is one of the four [[Nile Delta|Delta]] kings subdued by the Nubian conqueror – the others are [[Iuput II]] of [[Leontopolis]], [[Osorkon IV]] of [[Tanis]] and [[Peftjauawybast]] of [[Herakleopolis]]; among the quartet, Nimlot is depicted standing instead of kneeling,<ref>Alan B. Lloyd (ed), ''A companion of Ancient Egypt'', vol. 1, Wiley-Blackwell 2010, p. 135.</ref> since Piye chose him as [[Interlocutor (politics)|interlocutor]], while the others were considered "impure", due to the fact that they ate fishes.<ref name=K325/> Nimlot's charges were reconfirmed by Piye before the latter's return in the South.

Later, around 725&nbsp;BCE, Nimlot was succeeded by [[Djehutyemhat]].<ref name=KT16/>

Nimlot should not be confused with his later successor called ''Nimlot E'' (or ''Lamintu'' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) who was ruling the city of Hermopolis when the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] led by [[Ashurbanipal]] invaded Egypt in 667/666 BCE.<ref>Kitchen, op. cit., § 358.</ref>
