To celebrate, Earnhardt climbed onto his car's roof, and shared an embrace with Waltrip (who had been unable to celebrate his victory in the [[2001 Daytona 500|500]] that February because of Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash) before diving into his pit crew.<ref name="Junior achievement">{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Stephan|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/07/07/daytona_lede/|title=Junior achievement|work=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|date=July 7, 2001|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>
