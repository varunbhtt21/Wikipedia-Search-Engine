{{DYK nompage links|nompage=Paratarsotomus macropalpis|Paratarsotomus macropalpis}}
* ... that '''''[[Paratarsotomus macropalpis]]''''' is the [[Fastest animal|fastest land animal]] relative to body length, with a speed of 322 body lengths per second, the equivalent of a human running at {{convert|1300|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}}?
* '''ALT1''' : ... that not only does '''''[[Paratarsotomus macropalpis]]''''' run at a speed equivalent to a human running at {{convert|1300|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}}, it also does so at temperatures [[thermoregulation#Arthropoda|lethal]] to most animals?

:# It's new.
:# It's long enough - 1729 chars.
:# It seems to be copying a source too closely.  We're not the only one parroting the original but we should do better than such [[churnalism]].

source: "''The research team was also surprised to find the mites running on concrete up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), a temperature significantly higher than the upper lethal temperature of most animals.''"

article: "''the researchers were surprised to find the mites running at such speeds on concrete at temperatures upto 60 °C (140 °F), which is significant because this temperature is well above the lethal limit for the majority of animal species.''"

:# The hook is short enough at 191 characters but only just.  It could be made tighter.
:# The hook content is interesting but it might be good to work in the bit about them running hot.

:# There doesn't seem to be a QPQ.
:# There's no picture.

[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] So, there's more to do, please, before we can promote this. [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 21:12, 2 May 2014 (UTC) 

:* {{ping|Andrew Davidson}}. I have rephrased the copyvio sentence. Thanks for pointing it out. 
:* Added alt1 incorporating the thermophilic behaviour.
:* No free images could be found.
:* I have made a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Resource_Exchange/Resource_Request&diff=prev&oldid=606182945#Fastest_land_animal_relative_to_body_length request for the main paper at Resource Request] but it has not <s>yet</s> been provided. I could not find any other papers suitable for the article about this obscure mite. 
:* <s>My QPQ is pending. I had mentioned in the comment form in the nomination template but it seems to have been gobbled up!</s> [[User:AshLin|AshLin]] ([[User talk:AshLin|talk]]) 01:38, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:* QPQ done. [[Template:Did_you_know_nominations/Relicanthus_daphneae|Relicanthus daphneae]]
:* May please re-evaluate {{ping|Andrew Davidson}}. Thanks for reviewing. [[User:AshLin|AshLin]] ([[User talk:AshLin|talk]]) 14:33, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Reviewer needed to check new ALT1, that all issues have been addressed, and that no additional issues exist. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 00:19, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
::Per [[WP:DYKSG]], "There is a reasonable expectation that an article—even a short one—that is to appear on the front page should appear to be complete and not some sort of work in progress. Therefore, articles which include unexpanded headers are likely to be rejected. Articles that fail to deal adequately with the topic are also likely to be rejected." I do not think this article deals adequately with the topic. There is no information on what it looks like, who discovered it and when, what it eats, its life cycle, etc. The article is dominated by information about its speed, which, while interesting, does not present the reader with a reasonably balanced overview.

::* {{ping|Sasata}}, I am in India and have no access to resources other than the internet. I have made a request for two papers on Resource Request. I'm afraid that without those, I have no way to get more information. Your point is well taken but I have no means of access to paywalled articles. If someone gives me those, I shall add whatever material I can find. Except for this issue of completeness, which I cannot address at the moment, are there any other issues I can address? [[User:AshLin|AshLin]] ([[User talk:AshLin|talk]]) 15:58, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:::* I have located more details and will add these when I have a moment.  [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 16:20, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
::::* I have added details of its discovery and morphology, quoting the original report.  Note that, as this was first published in 1916, it is public domain on the USA and so we can freely reproduce it.  That issue of the journal also has a picture which we could use but I have not located that image online yet.  [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 07:30, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] I have found and added the image.  These additional details seem to satisfy [[User:Sasata|Sasata]]'s point.  I am satisfied that the sourcing is good enough support the '''ALT1''' hook, which I like.  I reckon we're good to go now. [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 12:20, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::Much better, thanks! [[User:Sasata|Sasata]] ([[User talk:Sasata|talk]]) 15:06, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Thanks to all connected with the review & with the improvement of the article. Its so much better now! Its great that Andrew gets a credit too!
