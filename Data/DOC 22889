In Corinthians Paul urges the believers to consider not eating meat when with people who assume that meat must be offered to idols before consumption: 'Food will not bring us close to God,' he writes. 'We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block for the weak.' (1 Corinthians 8:8-9)}}</ref> a conviction that the [[Primitive Church|early]] [[Church Fathers]], such as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]] preached.<ref name="Binder2012">{{cite book |last=Binder |first=Stephanie E. |title=Tertullian, On Idolatry and Mishnah Avodah Zarah |date=2012-11-14 |publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]] |language=English |isbn=978-90-04-23478-9 |page=87 |quote=Clement of Alexandria and Origen also forbid eating meat dedicated to idolatry and partaking in meals with demons, which, by association, are the meals of fornicators and idolatrous adulterers. Marcianus Aristides merely testifies that Christians do not eat what has been sacrificed to idols; and Hippolytus only notes the interdiction against eating such food.}}</ref> In addition, Christians traditionally bless any food before eating it with a [[common table prayer|mealtime prayer]] ([[Grace (prayer)|grace]]), as a sign of thanking [[God in Christianity|God]] for the meal they have.

Slaughtering animals for food is  often done without the [[trinitarian formula]],<ref name="Salamon1999">{{cite book |last=Salamon |first=Hagar |title=Ethiopian Jews in Christian Ethiopia |date=7 November 1999 |publisher=University of California Press |language=English |isbn=978-0-520-92301-0 |pages=101 |quote=The Christians do "''Basema ab wawald wamanfas qeeus ahadu amlak''" [in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit one God] and then slaughter.

In the New Testament, [[Paul of Tarsus]] notes that some devout Christians may wish to [[abstinence|abstain]] from consuming meat that has been offered to idols if it causes "my brother to stumble" in his faith with God (cf. {{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|8:13|KJV}}).<ref name="Phelps2002">{{cite book |last=Phelps |first=Norm |title=The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible |year=2002 |publisher=Lantern Books |language=English |isbn=978-1-59056-009-9 |page=171 |quote=Nevertheless, toward the end of the chapter, Paul suggests that even Christians with strong faith may want to abstain from eating meat offered to pagan deities if any chance that their example will tempt fellow Christians of weaker faith into inadvertent idolatry. He concludes by saying, "Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble." (1 Corinthians 8:13)}}</ref> As such, some [[Christian monk]]s, such as the [[Trappists]], have adopted a policy of [[Christian vegetarianism]].<ref name="WaltersByl2013">{{cite book |last1=Walters |first1=Peter |last2=Byl |first2=John |title=Christian Paths to Health and Wellness |year=2013 |publisher=Human Kinetics |language=English |isbn=978-1-4504-2454-7 |page=184 |quote=Traditional Hindus and Trappist monks adopt vegetarian diets as a practice of their faith.}}</ref> In addition, Christians of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] tradition generally "avoid eating meat and highly spiced food".<ref name="Daugherty1995">{{cite book |last=Daugherty |first=Helen Ginn |title=An Introduction to Population |year=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |language=English |isbn=978-0-89862-616-2 |pages=150 |quote=Seventh-Day Adventists are also urged, but not required, to avoid eating meat and highly spiced food (Snowdon, 1988).}}</ref> Christians in the [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] denominations traditionally observe a [[meat-free day]], especially during the [[Christian Year|liturgical]] season of [[Lent]].<ref name="Methodist">{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&mid=2872|title=What does The United Methodist Church say about fasting?|publisher=The United Methodist Church|language=English|accessdate=2 May 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="Anglican Catholic">{{cite book |last1=Barrows |first1=Susanna |last2=Room |first2=Robin |title=Drinking: Behavior and Belief in Modern History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-wmSdtGer0C&pg=PA340 |accessdate=2 May 2014 |year=1991 |publisher=University of California Press |language=English |isbn=978-0-520-07085-1 |page=340 |quote=The main legally enforced prohibition in both Catholic and Anglican countries was that against meat.

==Method of slaughter==

With reference to medieval times, Jillian Williams states that "unlike the Jewish and Muslims methods of animal slaughter, which requires the draining of the animal's blood, Christian slaughter practices did not usually specify the method of slaughter". In actual practice, states Williams, European Christians have flexibly practiced both the method of draining the blood, and wringing the animal's neck to retain its blood as valuable food.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jillian Williams|title=Food and Religious Identities in Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9shBDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT62|year=2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81704-2|page=62}}</ref> According to Basheer Ahmad Masri, the "Jewish and the Christian methods of slaughter fulfill the Islamic condition of bleeding the animal".<ref name="Masri1989">{{cite book |last=Masri |first=Basheer Ahmad |title=Animals in Islam |year=1989 |publisher=Athene Trust |language=English |isbn=978-1-870603-01-0 |quote=Both the Jewish and the Christian methods of slaughter fulfill the Islamic condition of bleeding the animal.}}</ref> In contrast, David Grumett and Rachel Muers state that the Orthodox Christian ''Shechitah'' and Jewish ''Kosher'' methods of slaughter differ from the Muslim ''Halal'' (Dabh) method in that they require the cut to "sever trachea, oesophagus and the jugular veins" as this method is believed to produce meat with minimal suffering to the animal.

==Alcohol==

Most [[Christian denomination]]s condone moderate drinking of alcohol, including the Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, and the Orthodox.<ref name="Scratchley1996">{{cite book |last=Scratchley |first=David |title=Alcoholism and Other Drug Problems |year=1996 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |language=English |isbn=978-0-684-82314-0 |page=298 |quote=Although the Jewish, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Episcopal, and Lutheran traditions generally allow moderate drinking for those who can do so, it is simply incorrect to accuse them of condoning drunkenness.}}</ref> However, smaller denominations such as [[Latter-day Saints]], Seventh-day Adventists, [[Baptist]]s, Methodists, and [[Pentecostal]]s either abstain from or prohibit the consumption of alcohol ([[teetotalism|abstentionism]] and [[prohibitionism]]).<ref name="Conlin2008">{{cite book |last=Conlin |first=Joseph |title=The American Past: A Survey of American History, Enhanced Edition |date=11 January 2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |language=English |isbn=978-0-495-56609-0 |page=748 |quote=Protestants who called themselves "fundamentalists" (they believed in the literal truth of the Bible--Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals) were dry.}}</ref> However, all Christian Churches, in view of the [[Alcohol in the Bible|Biblical position on the issue]], universally condemn [[drunkenness]] as [[Christian views on sin|sinful]].<ref name="DomenicoHanley2006">{{cite book |last1=Domenico |first1=Roy P. |last2=Hanley |first2=Mark Y. |title=Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Politics |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |language=English |isbn=978-0-313-32362-1 |page=18 |quote=Drunkenness was biblically condemned, and all denominations disciplined drunken members.}}</ref><ref name="Cobb2003">{{cite book |last=Cobb |first=John B. |title=Progressive Christians Speak: A Different Voice on Faith and Politics |year=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |language=English |isbn=978-0-664-22589-6 |page=136 |quote=For most of Christian history, as in the Bible, moderate drinking of alcohol was taken for granted while drunkenness was condemned.}}</ref>
