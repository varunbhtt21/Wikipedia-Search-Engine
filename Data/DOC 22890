The '''Dacres Hotel''' is a historic hotel in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States.<ref name=NRHPNom/> Rebuilt from the ruins of Walla Walla's first brick hotel, the 1873 '''Stine House''', the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building was re-opened in 1899 by James E. Dacres. It operated until 1959. Currently, the building houses Main Street Studios. The building is a rare and exceptional local example of the pre-fabricated cast iron facades manufactured by the [[Mesker Brothers]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Mesker Brothers Iron Works Catalog |date=1898 |location=St. Louis, MO |edition=14th |url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/reri2xkinurinnq/1898%20Mesker%20Brothers%20catalog.pdf?dl=0 |accessdate=28 May 2019}}</ref> [[Bennes, Hendricks & Tobey]] remodeled the building in 1907.<ref name=NRHPNom/> It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 5, 1974.<ref name=NRHPNom/>

==History==
===Stine House===
Frederick Stine was born in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] on November 24, 1825, one of 14 children. In the 1830s the family moved to a farm in Ohio where Frederick picked up the blacksmith trade from his father. In May 1852 Frederick, his brothers and twenty-three other men set off from [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] bound for [[Sacramento, California]], reaching their destination in a mere two months and one day. After spending time in [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] and [[Yreka, California|Yreka]] plying his trade, Frederick departed for eastern Washington on a trip that would prove much more difficult than his first.<ref name="Stine">{{cite news |title=Fred Stine Gave City Its First Hotel of Splendor |work=Walla Walla Union-Bulletin |page=27|agency=Newspaper Archive |date=14 June 1953| url=https://newspaperarchive.com/walla-walla-union-bulletin-jun-14-1953-p-27/}}</ref>

Stine arrived in Walla Walla in May 1862 from California with only the clothes on his back and 75 cents to his name. He scraped together enough loaned money to purchase a corner lot on Fourth and Main streets and build a shanty to house his blacksmith shop. With the small frontier town swarming with miners and emigrants with their wagons, his shop proved very lucrative and with additional business from the cavalry stationed at [[Fort Walla Walla]] he was able to pay his creditors back within a few months.<ref name="Bennett"/>{{rp|pages=63}} In 1863 he helped form the first fire department in town and in 1865 was elected to city council, to which he was re-elected several times.<ref name="Stine"/> By 1872 Stine had amassed a small fortune. He moved his small shop off his lot and began constructing a 3-story brick building. First conceived as an office building, the plans soon changed into a hotel.<ref name="U-B59">{{cite news |title=Historic Dacres Hotel, 'Finest of Era' Closes |work=Walla Walla Union-Bulletin |agency=Newspaper Archive |date=25 May 1959}}</ref> The hotel was built of bricks fired in [[Weston, Oregon]], lime [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] shipped from [[San Francisco]] and most expensively, the windows were made in France and shipped around [[Cape Horn]].<ref name="Stine"/><ref name="Bennett"/>{{rp|pages=82-83}} Opened in August 1873, the Stine House was the first 3-story brick building in Walla Walla and with 50 rooms it was the largest hotel in [[Washington Territory]]. It was designed in a simple [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style, with [[corbelled|corbel]] window arches (which are still extant on the building's east facade), a ground floor [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and a wooden cornice; a wooden balcony wrapped around the front of the building above the first floor. Although Stine built it and named it after himself, he never operated the hotel, opting to continue his blacksmith business at 4th and Rose Streets until retiring in 1880. He died in June 1909.<ref name="Stine"/>

The Stine became the town's social gathering place and the stopping point for all the major stage lines from [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] and [[LaGrande, Oregon|LaGrande]].<ref name="Stine"/> It even offered free carriage service between the hotel and the train depot, and reasonably priced service to anywhere else in town. The hotel was so well appointed that several local families chose to live in the hotel while renting out their own homes. The Stine became the meeting place for many dignitaries, most notably president [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and his entourage including his wife [[Lucy Webb Hayes]] and [[Commanding General of the United States Army|commanding general]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], who dined in the hotel's restaurant during his visit to Walla Walla in October 1880.<ref name="Stine"/><ref name="Bennett">{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=Robert A. |title=Walla Walla: Portrait of a Western Town |date=1980 |publisher=Pioneer Press Books |location=Walla Walla |ref=1}}</ref>{{rp|pages=104}}Business was good enough that the hotel was doubled in size in 1882, extending it south to the alley and bringing the room total to 100. The Stine remained the town's preeminent hotel until 22 July 1892, when it was gutted by a fire that had spread from an adjacent saloon. Any attempts at rebuilding were stalled by the [[Panic of 1893]], and it stood as an empty ruin for the rest of the decade.

===Hotel Dacres===
In 1899 a group of investors headed by Walla Walla pioneer George Dacres and his son James E. Dacres purchased the burnt out shell of the Stine House and began to rebuild it. The hotel was once again doubled in size and the entire Main Street frontage was rebuilt with a [[Cast-iron architecture|pre-fabricated cast iron facade]] manufactured by [[Mesker Brothers]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and shipped to Walla Walla by rail. It was and is the largest Mesker facade in Washington State. The second floor was adorned with a wrought iron balcony, echoing the wooden one that had adorned the Stine House.<ref name="U-B2"/> The hotel's lobby was lavishly decorated with red carpet, oak furniture, potted plants, polished brass spittoons and a grand piano. The rooms were no less accommodating and even came with a free pitcher of ice water. Other guest services included a larger restaurant, a barber shop, a [[Turkish Bath]] and later a first-class bar and a grill room featuring live music. The revived building once again became Walla Walla's premier hotel and thanks to its proximity to the Keylor Grand Opera House, the regions's main [[Vaudeville]] venue, the Dacres would see such notable guests as [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[John Philip Sousa]], [[Harry Lauder]] and [[Al Jolson]], among others.<ref name="Bennett2">{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=Robert A. |title=Walla Walla: A Town Built to Be a City |date=1982 |publisher=Pioneer Press Books |location=Walla Walla |ref=2}}</ref>{{rp|pages=36}}

The hotel suffered another large interior fire in 1905, caused by a shorting electrical fan, but remained open while repairs were made.<ref name="Statesman">{{cite news |title=Total Loss Was $8000 |url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085421/1905-07-26/ed-1/seq-5/#date1=1789&index=6&date2=1963&searchType=advanced&language=&sequence=0&words=Dacres&proxdistance=5&state=Washington&rows=20&ortext=&proxtext=&phrasetext=&andtext=dacres&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1 |accessdate=14 June 2018 |work=The Evening Statesman |agency=Library of Congress |date=26 Jul 1905}}</ref> In 1907, the hotel's then manager, Art Harris (a previous manager of the [[Geyser Grand Hotel]] in [[Baker City, Oregon]]), commissioned Portland architects [[Bennes, Hendricks & Tobey]] to completely remodel the hotel, with plans calling for a complete interior remodel, adding one or even two floors and an elevator, but this never fully came to pass.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacLeod |first1=R.

The hotel officially left the Dacres family in 1921 when it was sold to E.C. Davis, who had previously run the Revere Hotel in [[Pomeroy, Washington]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Hotel News |journal=The Hotel World |date=30 Jul 1921 |volume=93 |issue=5 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-FLAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA3-PA20&dq=dacres+hotel&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJ8a2U--zbAhW9CTQIHQYeBJQQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&q=dacres%20hotel&f=false |accessdate=24 June 2018}}</ref> In 1924 Eugene Tausick, a leading businessman and the owner of the company in charge of the rival Grand Hotel, purchased the hotel from Davis.<ref name="UB"/> While various upgrades were made to the interior and the storefronts over the years, and while several [[pediment|pediments]] and [[finial|finials]] were removed or lost from the top of the building, the Dacres's outward appearance remains much as it had been in 1899, as it was spared the fate of [[urban renewal]] which claimed many historic buildings in the surrounding blocks in the 1950s and '60s. The hotel closed its doors on 25 May 1959, with the owners citing the state's impending $1 minimum wage law as the primary reason.<ref name="U-B59"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Alan J. |title=Washington Minimum Wage and Hour Act goes into effect on June 11, 1959. |url=http://historylink.org/File/10657 |website=Historylink |publisher=Historylink.org |accessdate=14 June 2018}}</ref> In 1966 the Tausick estate sold the building to O. D. Keen Construction Co. who disposed of most of the hotel's furnishings, fixtures, signage and even room keys at public auction.<ref name="UB">{{cite news |title=Student Retells Story of Famous Hotel |work=Walla Walla Union-Bulletin |agency=Newspaper Archive |date=16 Aug 1974}}</ref> 

For the next few decades the building remained vacant save for several small businesses on the ground floor. In 1974, the hotel was nominated for state and [[National Register of Historic Places|national]] landmark status as part of a history project by [[Washington State University]] student Robert Hergert.<ref name="U-B2"/> It was accepted to the National Register in September 1974, only the second building in the County to be registered (the first being [[Fort Walla Walla]]).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Orchard |first1=Vance |title=Walla Walla, Dayton Buildings Named to Historic Registry |work=Walla Walla Union-Bulletin |agency=Newspaper Archive |date=2 Jan 1975}}</ref> In 1982 the building was purchased by Robert Finch who began restoration on the ground floor in earnest.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hotel Dacres Rises From Ashes of Stine House |work=Walla Walla Union-Bulletin |agency=Newspaper Archive |date=25 Feb 2001}}</ref> Currently, the ground floor is occupied by a restaurant and a real estate office while the upper floors remain closed.
