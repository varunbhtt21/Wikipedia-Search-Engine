'''''Good Morning, Kris''''' is a morning [[talk show]] on [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], hosted solely by [[Kris Aquino]]. The show served as the replacement of [[Morning Girls with Kris and Korina]], after [[Korina Sanchez]] was placed on her magazine show ''[[Rated K]]'' (replacing Sharon) and it ran for sixteen months. It premiered on May 31, 2004 and ended on October 8, 2004 after a mere 5 months.

==Conceptualization Overview==
===Premiere===
Good Morning, Kris premiered on May 31, 2004, after a very successful run of the morning show [[Morning Girls with Kris and Korina]] for 16 months. Kris Aquino was the sole host of the show, and it was aired live where its predecessor was before. It dealt with many subjects, whether lovelife or family problems. 

===Format===
Kris would sit on a sofa lounge chair, and the guest would sit  in front of her or sometimes beside her, so that she can accommodate everyone and can easily talk to them. Although the show is somewhat similar to its predecessors, Kris aims to give an aura to everyone who is in her show, whether her celebrity guest, the live studio audience, or the people who are watching her everyday.

===Notable guests===
Some guests include Star Circle Quest alumnae [[Hero Angeles]], where he discussed about his relationship with fellow alumnae and current [[2NE1]] member [[Sandara Park]] and also include [[American Idol (season 3)]] 2nd Runner-up [[Jasmine Trias]], where she sang a song together with [[Troy Montero]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD0Q9TVJK8g</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWgcR4iOq0c</ref>

===Cancellation===
The show was axed by the management after its successful 5 months run on October 8, 2004, due to low ratings against its competition. ABS-CBN executives decided to tap Philippines' King of Talk [[Boy Abunda]] and Comedy concert Queen [[Ai-Ai de las Alas]] in a new morning talk show that would replace Good Morning, Kris called Morning Star.

This marked the first morning talk show of [[Boy Abunda]] in the network and his first television tandem with [[Ai-Ai de las Alas]].
