'''Alkali feldspar granite''', some varieties of which are called 'red granite',<ref name=chief>{{cite web|title=The Chief Commercial Granites of MA, NH and RI (see, for example, pp. 179-180)|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/0354/report.pdf|publisher=US Geological Survey}}</ref> is a [[felsic]] [[igneous rock]] and a type of [[granite]] rich in the [[mineral]] [[potassium feldspar]] (K-spar). It is a dense rock with a [[phaneritic]] texture. The abundance of K-spar gives the rock a predominant pink to reddish hue; peppered with minor amounts of black minerals.<ref name=usgs1>{{cite web|title=FAQ - What is Granite?|url=http://www.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9783/2758%20|publisher=US Geological Survey}}</ref><ref name=gsa>{{cite web|title=Granite: Characteristics, Uses and Problems|url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/111938|publisher=US General Services Administration}}</ref>

==Chemical composition==

As shown in the [[QAPF diagram]], alkali feldspar granite contains between 20% - 60% [[quartz]]. Less quartz content would lead to "quartz alkali feldspar syenite".  More than 90% of the total [[feldspar]] content is in the form of alkali feldspar. Less than that amount would designate the rock as a granite.<ref name=epa>{{cite web|title=Field Classification and Description of Soils and Rock|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/120f26eb0d420d8b882575e1006899ae/$FILE/SOP-12r0%20Soil%20and%20Rock%20Descriptions.pdf|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency}}</ref>

Other incorporated [[silicate]] minerals may include, very minor amounts of [[plagioclase feldspar]], mica in the form of [[muscovite]] and/or [[biotite]], and [[amphibole]] (often [[hornblende]]). [[Oxide minerals]] such as [[magnetite]], [[ilmenite]], or [[ulvospinel]]. Some [[sulfide minerals|sulfides]] and [[phosphate minerals|phosphates]] (mainly [[apatite]]) may also be present.

==Occurrence==
Alkali feldspar granites generally occur with other alkali-rich granitoids, such as [[monzogranite]] and [[syenogranite]], forming part of the [[Granite#Chappell & White classification system|A-type granites]]. They are found in a wide range of [[tectonics|tectonic]] settings and their origins remain uncertain.<ref name="Bonin">{{cite journal|url=http://www.gsinet.ir/photos/pics/granite-latine-article-19.pdf |title=A-type granites and related rocks: Evolution of a concept, problems and prospects |author=Bonin B. |journal=[[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]] |year=2007 |volume=97 |issue=1-2 |pages=1â€“29 |doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2006.12.007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211080357/http://www.gsinet.ir/photos/pics/granite-latine-article-19.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-11 }}</ref>

==Uses==
Granitic rocks in general are of interest to [[geologists]], geochemists, etc., because they provide 'crystallized' telltale clues of their environment of formation.<ref name='nps1'>{{cite web|title=Granite and Granodiorite|url=http://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/education/granite-and-granodiorite-faq.htm|publisher=US National Park Service}}</ref>

Alkali feldspar granite is used as construction material in the form of dimension stones, and polished slabs or tiles for building facades, pavements, and kitchen countertops.<ref name=gsa />
