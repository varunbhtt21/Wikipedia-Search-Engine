<small>Created by [[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]). Self nominated at 05:32, 2 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough, well referenced. German sources AGF; no close paraphrasing seen in English sources. Hook ref verified and cited inline. No QPQ necessary, as this is page creator's second DYK nomination.
:*Regarding the hook, you need to mention and cite in the article the fact that he was called by this one-name nickname for DYK purposes. Since this name is discussed in the [[Sports Illustrated]] article, you can easily add a line explaining what the name means and the fact that he was known just by this name in Germany. You might also want to identify him further in the hook, such as "that '''Bubi''', a German boxing champion, ..."
:*I noted a few places under Career where a reference is needed to support the text. I also did a thorough copyedit for English grammar; however, the capitalization in the titles of the books and singles is unclear and needs to be tidied up. Were these German titles originally? Then you should cite them that way and put the English in parentheses. Is there a word missing in the book title ''Ring Free: The way a boxer''? Under CD Sampler, it's not clear what the parenthetical phrase refers to ("its European Championship campaign").
:*The page is an orphan, as only 2 other Wikipedia pages link to it. Could you link this page to some other pages? Thanks, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 17:19, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Comment: I don't remember reference to him by just first name, but "Bubi Scholz", as the infobox says. - In the lead, there are many short sentences starting with "He", can that be improved? --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 16:21, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*I edited the lead a bit; please feel free to do more. Also, are you able to double-check the German sources for close paraphrasing? Thanks, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 18:05, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::* Sorry, I don't have much time right now. I think the date format should be changed for a German, and wonder if the article should be moved to Bubi Scholz as the common name. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 20:48, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::* The issues raised have been resolved. References have been provided where they were required. [[Bubi Scholz]] redirects to Gustav Scholz. Please review again.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 04:52, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*  Thank you. I still wonder if Gustav Scholz should redirect to Bubi Scholz, and if Bubi Scholz should be the name in the hook. It's "The Bubi Scholz Story", not "The Bubi Story". I linked from [[Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf]], where he was buried temporarily. I couldn't believe that we didn't have an article on him when we wrote that. --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 05:30, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::* '''ALT1'''<s>... that '''[[Gustav Scholz|Bubi]]''', a German boxing champion, won his first fight as a professional boxer without previously competing as an amateur?</s>
:::::::::* The fact is that we didn't have an article about him previously. This one is well sourced and well written. Bubi Scholz redirects to Gustav Scholz. He was popularly called Bubi in Germany and "The Bubi Scholz Story" was made in Germany but outside Germany he was known as Gustav. If there are any further issues that need to be resolved please discuss them here.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 06:35, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::* You convinced me about the page move, but not the name, only one source has in the header just ""Bubi"", six say "Bubi Scholz", therefore I suggest
:::::::::::: '''ALT2''': ... that boxing champion '''[[Gustav Scholz|Bubi Scholz]]''' won his first fight as a professional boxer without previously competing as an amateur? --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 07:01, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::::::* ALT2 looks good to me. Please review the article again.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 07:42, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Thank you, Gerda, for your input, and Skr15081997, for adding the Muller ref and tidying up the citations. The article looks great now. My original review of newness, date, length, etc., still stands. ALT2 hook ref is verified and cited inline. ALT2 good to go.
