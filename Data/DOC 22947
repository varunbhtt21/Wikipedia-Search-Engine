NN school through grade 8.  We don't generally retain stand-alone articles for such schools. This article was deleted by unanimous delete !vote at a prior AfD, but was subsequently recreated. [[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 05:36, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. It is common practice to redirect non-notable schools to their localities. In this case, the target is [[List of educational institutions in Lahore#Primary and secondary educational institutions]] where the school is already listed.

*'''Redirect''' to [[List of educational institutions in Lahore#Primary and secondary educational institutions]] per Gene93k.
