The creation of this article about a future season of a TV series is premature. Nothing has been published in reliable sources about this season except the fact that it is in production. Plot, airdate, title and cast are unknown. The article has problems with [[WP:CRYSTAL]] and [[WP:N]]. A redirect to the series overview was reverted. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<font style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small> 05:38, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''': There has been some level of discussion about the content of this article (the future season), as indicated by the multiple online publications on the topic, some of which are listed in the references section of the article. With regard to [[WP:CRYSTAL]] -- the article is ''not'' "a collection of unverifiable speculation". Everything in the article has been sourced. When I reverted the edit in which you blanked out the article (and replaced it with a redirect), initially it did ''not'' have any sources. Then, I took up on myself the task of verifying each and every single statement made in the article (by performing a Google search), and adding citations to article, for each of those assertions. So I think your statement that the article has problems with [[WP:CRYSTAL]] is untrue. Secondly, as you said, this is an upcoming season, and the plot, along with other such information, has (''obviously'') not been revealed yet. However, this does not necessarily warrant the deletion of the article. Wikipedia is replete with stubs, and this page can serve as a placeholder that other editors can add and expand upon, as new information about the season becomes available. [[User: Arjun G.

*'''Redirect with history'''. I do think that it is too soon, albeit probably just slightly. Right now there's not really anything here that can't already be mentioned in the main article for the episodes. Will it release? Yup, given how insanely popular it is, it probably will. However we can't guarantee that and more than a few shows have received setbacks that have prolonged release for months or even years. We can only go by what we have now, at this point in time. As far as other shows/seasons having articles, that doesn't really mean anything per [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]] because those articles could have reasons to exist separately from the main article or they just haven't been found and deleted/redirected at this point in time. Right now it's just a waiting game and we don't lose anything by just redirecting to the main episode page.
