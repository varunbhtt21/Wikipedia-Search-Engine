Natasha Laws Mick fails [[wp:notability]]. Her only movie credits are as extras or as the star of what appears to be a U-tube series with only 81 views. There appears to be no online press discussing her as an actress. <span style="font-family:Georgia;">[[User:Dkriegls|<font color="#153E7E"><big>'''D'''</big><small>kriegls</small></font>]]</span> <span style="font-family:Verdana;">([[User talk:Dkriegls|<font color="#7d5515">talk to me!</font>]])</span> 05:43, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 03:42, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' even the most famous of actors and actresses have started as an extra. She has contributed to her career through various roles and is on the rise. An actual actress, not just some reality show star.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/50.45.41.202|50.45.41.202]] ([[User talk:50.45.41.202|talk]]) 07:15, 10 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
*'''Delete''' being on the rise isnt reason to keep as this would fall under [[WP:TOOSOON]], as she isnt noteable yet it would be a defintie [[WP:NOTE]] both reasons for deletion [[User:Amortias|Amortias]] ([[User talk:Amortias|T]])([[Special:Contributions/Amortias|C]]) 13:41, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Plenty of references added and plenty of search engine results can be found online.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/50.45.41.202|50.45.41.202]] ([[User talk:50.45.41.202|talk]]) 15:36, 10 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
* '''delete''' there is no suitable evidence of notability, desperate adding of inconsequential links that fail [[Wikipedia:Citing sources]] is not going to help. It shouldn't stop re-creation if the person later meets notability. — [[user:billinghurst|billinghurst]] ''<span style="font-size:smaller">[[user talk:billinghurst|sDrewth]]</span>'' 03:15, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
