==TV Show “On Target” scandal==
On 8 October 2006, in his to become last edition of the TV show "On Target", of which he was the anchor, Mr. Indzhev asked his guest about information he got by email. The email was about an apartment, which allegedly belonged to the President of the Republic [[Georgi Parvanov]], who was running for re-election at that time. Couple of days later the contract between Ivo Indzhev and bTV was terminated, after bTV accused him of gross violation of journalistic ethics and basic principles of serious journalism. Mr. Indzhev said that bTV was a subject of pressure from the President's office for months, and the result was inevitable.<ref>[http://www.mediapool.bg/ivo-indzhev-napusna-btv-zaradi-natisk-ot-prezidentstvoto-news122158.html „Иво Инджев напусна бТВ заради натиск от президентството“], mediapool.bg, 10.10.2006.</ref>
