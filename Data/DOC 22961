The '''172d Air Support Squadron''' is a unit of the [[Michigan Air National Guard]] [[110th Airlift Wing]] located at [[Kellogg Air National Guard Base]], Battle Creek, Michigan. The 172d was last equipped with the [[C-21A Learjet]] before the aircraft were transferred in 2013.

The squadron was first organized during [[World War II]] as the '''375th Fighter Squadron'''.  It saw combat in the [[European Theater of Operations]] as an element of [[VII Fighter Command]] before returning to the United States, where it was inactivated.

In May 1946, the squadron was allotted to the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] as the '''172d Fighter Squadron'''.  During the [[Korean War]], the squadron was called into federal service and acted in an [[air defense]] role until being returned to the Michigan Air National Guard in 1952. It had various flying missions, including [[fighter aircraft|fighter]], [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] and [[airlift]] until 2013, when it was converted to a support unit.

===World War II===

The [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] was first activated at [[Richmond Army Air Base]] as the '''375th Fighter Squadron''' and equipped with [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s.  The squadron trained under [[I Fighter Command]] in the mid-Atlantic states.  It also flew [[air defense]] missions as part of the [[Philadelphia Fighter Wing]]. The squadron deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], where it became part of [[VIII Fighter Command]] in England during November 1943.<ref name=Maurer375FS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 464-465</ref>

The unit served primarily as an escort organization, covering the penetration, attack, and withdrawal of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] [[bomber]] formations that [[Eighth Air Force]] sent against targets on the European continent. The squadron also engaged in counter-air patrols, fighter sweeps, and [[strafing]] and [[dive bombing]] missions. It attacked such targets as [[airfield]]s, [[marshalling yard]]s, [[V-1 flying bomb]] and [[V-2 rocket]] launch sites, industrial areas, [[ammunition dump|ordnance depots]], oil [[refineries]], trains, and highways.  During its operations, the unit participated in the assault against the [[Luftwaffe]] and the German aircraft industry during [[Big Week]], from 20 to 25 February 1944, and the attack on transportation facilities prior to [[Operation Overlord]], the Normandy invasion.  Following the invasion it supported ground forces thereafter, including providing cover during [[Operation Cobra]], the [[Saint-Lô]] breakout in July.

The squadron supported the airborne attack on the [[Netherlands]] in September, 1944, and deployed to [[Chièvres Air Base|Chievres Airdrome]], Belgium between February and April, 1945, flying tactical ground support missions during the airborne assault across the [[Rhine]]. The unit returned to [[RAF Little Walden]] and flew its last combat mission on 20 April 1945. The squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated at [[Camp Kilmer]], part of the New York Port of Embarkation, in October.<ref name=Maurer375FS/>

===Michigan Air National Guard===
In May 1946, the squadron was allotted to the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] as the '''172d Fighter Squadron'''.  It was organized and equipped with [[North American P-51D Mustang]]s at [[Kellogg Air National Guard Base|Kellogg Field]], Battle Creek, Michigan in 1947. This was the same year the United States Air Force became an independent branch of the armed forces and the 172d received its federal recognition as an [[Air National Guard]] squadron.

====Activation during the Korean War====
In February 1951 the squadron was called to active duty for the [[Korean War]] and assigned to [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC).  Upon activation it was redesignated the '''172d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron''' and moved to [[Selfridge Air Force Base]], Michigan, where it was assigned to the [[128th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]], then to the [[56th Fighter-Interceptor Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9749|last1=Robertson|first1=Patsy|title=Factsheet 56 Operations Group (AETC)|date=18 May 2009|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=yes|accessdate=20 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805121730/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=9749|archive-date=5 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref group=note>Cornett & Johnson list this assignment as to the [[56th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]].

====Return to National Guard service====
{{Commons category-inline|110th Attack Wing (Michigan Air National Guard)}}

The 172d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron flew the F-51 Mustang until 1954. The 172d transitioned into the [[North American F-86 Sabre]] and became the '''172d Fighter-Bomber Squadron'''. The Unit flew this aircraft only until 1955 before transitioned into the more sophisticated two seat [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion]] and returned to the [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]]. In 1956, the squadron became part of the newly created [[110th Fighter Group]]. The Unit flew the F-89 Scorpion until 1958. That year the 172d Squadron traded its F-89s for a new mission and a new aircraft, the [[Martin RB-57A Canberra]].  With the assumption of the reconnaissance mission the squadron became the '''172d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron'''.

The 172d flew RB-57A’s until 1971. In 1971, the unit’s mission changed again to [[forward air control]], with the transition to the [[Cessna O-2 Skymaster]], which it flew until 1980 when it transitioned to the [[Cessna OA-37 Dragonfly]]. The 172d was the last Air Force or Air National Guard unit to fly the Dragonfly. The dedicated forward air control mission lasted until the 172d transitioned to the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], or Warthog, in 1991 and was returned to its first name as a National Guard unit, the  172d Fighter Squadron.

The squadron served in several United Nations operations and contingencies throughout the world. From Bosnia, to Kosovo, to Alaska and most recently Iraq and Afghanistan, in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. In 2009, the squadron was realigned from a fighter squadron to become the '''172d Airlift Squadron''' flying the [[Learjet C-21]]. On 12 July 2013, the last C-21 departed, and the unit became a support unit as the '''172d Air Support Squadron''' as Battle Creek was named as the location of a control center for drone aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.freep.com/article/C4/20130714/BUSINESS06/307140055/Michigan%20Business |last1=|first1=|title=Last C-21 plane leaves Battle Creek base|date=14 July 2013|publisher=Freep.com|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>
