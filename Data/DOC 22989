'''''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] video game published by [[Activision]].  The eleventh major installment in the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series, the game was developed by [[Sledgehammer Games]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], while [[High Moon Studios]] developed the versions released on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and [[Raven Software]] developed the game's multiplayer and the Exo-Zombies mode.

''Advanced Warfare'' is Sledgehammer's first ''Call of Duty'' title where they are the primary developer, following the supporting work they did on ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'' alongside [[Infinity Ward]] in 2011. The game was released on November 4, 2014, but a special edition titled the ''Day Zero Edition'', which came with bonus in-game content, was released on November 3 for people who pre-ordered the game. The game was not released on any [[Nintendo]] consoles, making it the first title in the series since ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' to not be released on any Nintendo consoles. It is the last ''Call of Duty'' title to feature a single-player campaign mode for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

Before the development of ''Advanced Warfare'', Sledgehammer were originally working on a game set during the events of the [[Vietnam War]]. Development for ''Advanced Warfare'' began in late 2011, shortly before the release of ''Modern Warfare 3''. The game became the first entry in the ''Call of Duty'' series since ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'' to feature a game engine that has had its majority re-written and built from scratch. For the game's [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, Sledgehammer employed veteran actors [[Troy Baker]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] in lead roles. The game's story, featuring a futuristic setting which is set between 2054 and 2061, follows Jack Mitchell of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and his involvement with Atlas, a private military corporation that sells its services to the highest bidder.

''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare'' was released to a positive critical reception and was declared an improvement over its predecessor, ''[[Call of Duty: Ghosts]]''. Many critics praised the visuals, the single-player campaign, the fast, dynamic, and exciting gameplay, and the content-rich multiplayer. The game won several awards and was considered a commercial success.

The game gained renewed attention in January 2018 when [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Donald Trump]] remarked on the delivery of the first F-52s to Norway in a press conference with Norwegian Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]]; the plane only exists within the game.<ref name="Trump Touts the F-52">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/01/11/trump-lauded-delivery-of-f-52s-to-norway-the-planes-only-exist-in-call-of-duty/ |title=Trump lauded delivery of F-52s to Norway.

==Gameplay==
''Advanced Warfare'', like the other ''[[Call of Duty]]'' titles, is presented in a [[first-person shooter]] perspective. The game features several significant changes; unlike other installments, ''Advanced Warfare'' does not use a traditional [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD); instead, all information is relayed to the player via [[Holography|holographic projections]] from the weapon equipped.<ref name="ArsTech">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-single-player-review-press-x-to-care/|title=Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare single-player review: Press X to care|first=Peter|last=Bright|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617064203/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-single-player-review-press-x-to-care/|archive-date=June 17, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The general gunplay remains unchanged, apart from new mechanics, such as 'Exo' movements.

===Campaign===
The single-player campaign features one playable character, Jack Mitchell, as opposed to multiple characters in most previous ''Call of Duty'' games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/87083/troy-baker-talks-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-and-far-cry-4|title=Troy Baker Talks Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Far Cry 4|first=John|last=Gaudiosi|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501160840/http://www.shacknews.com/article/87083/troy-baker-talks-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-and-far-cry-4|archive-date=May 1, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It uses pre-rendered cinematic cut scenes, similar to ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]'', to assist in the story aspect of the campaign.<ref name="ArsTech"/> After each mission, the player is given a certain number of upgrade points that can be used to upgrade the Exo suit or weapons. The player can upgrade detection, armor, resistance, tactical, lethal grenade, sprint, recoil, flinch, reload, quick aim, and battery. The number of points that are given is determined by the players performance in the missions. The player may earn additional points by completing specific side objectives, one of which is collecting the game's collectable 'Intel'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-intel-collectibles-location-guide/|title=Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Intel collectibles location guide|first=Jeff|last=McAllister|work=[[GamesRadar]]|accessdate=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208085404/http://www.gamesradar.com/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-intel-collectibles-location-guide/|archive-date=December 8, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The player can switch between different grenades, all of which possess distinctly different abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-detecting-dead-space-in-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare|title=Detecting Dead Space in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=October 6, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912222248/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-detecting-dead-space-in-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare|archive-date=September 12, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Multiplayer===
Apart from the Exo movement, ''Advanced Warfare''{{'}}s multiplayer retains certain similarities to previous ''Call of Duty'' titles. The Pick 10 system in ''Black Ops II'' returns as Pick 13, allowing players to pick weapons, attachments, perks and score-streaks within a total of 13 allocation points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-goes-back-to-the-future|title=Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Multiplayer Goes Back To The Future|first=Brian|last=Albert|work=[[IGN]]|date=September 9, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082527/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-goes-back-to-the-future|archive-date=July 17, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Score-streaks are also upgradable with different modules, allowing for additional abilities/effects, at an extra score cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/11/5989551/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-preview-video|title=Pick 13, ExoSkeletons And You: Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Multiplayer Hand-On|first=Arthur|last=Gies|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 11, 2014|accessdate=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515214239/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/11/5989551/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-multiplayer-preview-video|archive-date=May 15, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Advanced Warfare'' introduces weapon variants, which contain various different stats compared to the base weapons.

Exo Zombies plays similarly to the original Zombies game mode that has been featured in [[Treyarch]]'s ''Call of Duty'' games since ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'': up to four players have to survive against endless waves of undead enemies, with an optional story quest that can be completed at any time during a match. Players earn points by injuring and/or killing zombies, and use those points to open doors/clear obstacles, or buy new weapons and perks to strengthen their chance of survival. Players can also acquire exo suits in the game mode, allowing them to utilize new movements. Different types of zombies are present in the game, including Charger zombies that have increased movement speed, and Electro-magnetic zombies (EMZs) that can disable the players' Exo suit in close proximity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/01/28/call-of-duty-advanced-warfares-exo-zombies-reanimate-a-tired-format/|title=Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's exo zombies reanimate a familiar format|first=Dave|last=Cook|work=[[VG247]]|date=January 28, 2015|accessdate=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702085333/http://www.vg247.com/2015/01/28/call-of-duty-advanced-warfares-exo-zombies-reanimate-a-tired-format/|archive-date=July 2, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2054, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] Private  Jackson "Jack" Mitchell ([[Troy Baker]]) and Private William "Will" Irons ([[Paul Telfer (actor)|Paul Telfer]]) take part in an operation to repel a [[Korean People's Army|North Korean]] invasion of [[Seoul]], under the command of Sergeant Cormack (Russell Richardson). During the firefight, Will is killed and Mitchell loses his arm, resulting in him being [[Discharge (military)|discharged from military service]]. After attending Will's funeral, Mitchell is offered a position in the Atlas Corporation, a [[private military company]], by CEO Jonathan Irons ([[Kevin Spacey]]), Will's father, and is also given an advanced [[Prosthesis|prosthetic arm]] to replace his lost one.

Meanwhile, a terrorist group called the KVA, led by a [[technophobic]] man named Joseph "Hades" Chkheidze (Sharif Ibrahim), begins staging numerous terrorist attacks, with the world turning to Atlas to stop them. Mitchell, along with Gideon ([[Gideon Emery]]), Joker (Jeremy Kent Jackson) and other Atlas soldiers rescue the [[Prime Minister of Nigeria|Nigerian prime minister]] and capture a KVA technologist in [[Lagos|Lagos, Nigeria]] during a technology summit. However, by 2055, the KVA's attacks have become more sophisticated and Mitchell and his team fail to prevent the KVA from forcing a [[nuclear meltdown|nuclear reactor meltdown]] on [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]]. The KVA then launch simultaneous attacks against nuclear power plants worldwide, irradiating numerous cities, killing thousands of people and putting national governments and militaries in turmoil. Atlas emerges as the dominant military force in the world by aiding civilians affected by the attacks and holding back the KVA's rampage.

Four years later in 2059, Mitchell and Gideon are dispatched to the irradiated [[Detroit]] to find and successfully capture Dr. Pierre Danois (Erik Passoja), the KVA's second-in-command, who reveals that Hades is at [[Santorini]], [[Greece]], where the KVA leaders are holding a conference. Mitchell fatally wounds Hades, but before dying, Hades utters that "Irons knows," and gives Mitchell a data chip. Ilona ([[Angela Gots]]), an ex-[[Spetsnaz]] Atlas operative, analyzes the chip, which shows Irons killing the technologist they captured in Nigeria after learning of the KVA global attack, and revealing that he deliberately allowed the attacks to occur to improve Atlas' reputation and power. Irons attempts to have Mitchell and Ilona arrested, but they escape Atlas' headquarters in the rebuilt [[Baghdad|New Baghdad]], guided by a mysterious soldier, while Gideon stays by Irons' side for further investigation. The mysterious soldier reveals himself to be Mitchell's former squad leader, Cormack, who is now a member of Sentinel, a multi-national task force initially created to investigate the KVA power plant attacks, but now re-purposed to prevent Atlas' rise to power.

In 2060, Mitchell, Cormack, Ilona, and Knox ([[Khary Payton]]) infiltrate Irons' private residence in [[Bangkok]]. The team discovers that Dr. Danois (now working under the alias Bellamy) is collaborating with Irons on a project called "[[Manticore]]." They set up a tracker on a plane carrying the bio-weapon bound for [[Argentina]], before intercepting the plane, which crashes in [[Antarctica]]. Gideon appears and helps the Sentinel task force defeat the Atlas soldiers, allowing the team to successfully retrieve a sample of the [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]]. After analyzing it, they discover that Manticore is a bio-weapon designed to attack the specific [[DNA]] of any individuals and kill them. The only exceptions are any members of Atlas. Sentinel, now joined by Gideon, infiltrates and destroys an Atlas bio-weapons laboratory in [[Bulgaria]], eliminating many of the Manticore samples. With his plan revealed, Irons declares war on the world at the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The team discovers that Irons is planning a [[preemptive strike]] on the United States and try to stop an Atlas attack in [[San Francisco]]. Atlas destroys the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], trapping the [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. 3rd fleet]] in the Bay Area, in an attempt to destroy the fleet, but are stopped by Sentinel. After the attack, the United States, along with the rest of the world, declares war on Atlas, forcing Irons to retreat to his headquarters in New Baghdad.

Seven months later in 2061, the Sentinels and the [[United States Army]] attack New Baghdad to bring Irons to justice. However, Atlas releases Manticore, killing Knox and most of the troops. Mitchell, Ilona, and Gideon, whose DNA are recognized by Manticore as former Atlas soldiers, are spared, as well as Cormack, who was outside the blast radius. Cormack, Ilona, Mitchell and Gideon are captured and brought to an Atlas [[prisoner-of-war camp|prison camp]], which also runs Manticore [[Human subject research|experiments on its inmates]]. The team escape the facility, but Irons shoots Cormack and severely damages Mitchell's prosthetic arm. After Cormack dies, the others discover that Irons already has enough Manticore to attack every military base in the world and will be launching an [[ICBM]] loaded with the bio-weapon shortly.
Using heavily armored battlesuits, Mitchell and Gideon launch a lone assault on the Atlas HQ and manage to destroy the ICBM. They find Irons as the other Sentinels prepare to bombard the building, but Irons disables their [[Exosuit|exoskeletons]]. Mitchell, forced to release the exoskeleton to chase Irons, tackles Irons at the edge of the building. Irons hangs onto Mitchell's prosthetic arm, but Mitchell severs his prosthetic, sending Irons falling to his death. As Gideon arrives to carry him out of the building, Mitchell notes that Irons' death was only the beginning and the war against Atlas is far from over.

Following a failed attempt to contain a riot at a prison in New Baghdad, Atlas releases the Manticore bioweapon in order to quell the uprising. However, instead of killing the rioters, the Manticore bomb reanimates them as zombies. Three platoons are sent in to cage the undead forces, but only one survives, and the others are brought back to an Atlas research facility for further studies. The research is carried out in secret, without the knowledge of the employees, in a hidden area known as Sublevel 6. One night, the captured zombies break out of their containment and overrun the facility. Amidst the chaos, four Atlas employees - the janitor Oz ([[John Malkovich]]), the IT specialist Lilith ([[Rose McGowan]]), the security guard Decker ([[Jon Bernthal]]), and the executive Kahn ([[Bill Paxton]]) - attempt to evacuate, but both of their rescue helicopters are destroyed. The four survivors mount a last stand against the zombie horde, but are eventually overwhelmed. However, they are rescued by Atlas forces, who then take them to an urban facility, for medical treatment. When the four survivors recover, they are thrown into another battle against the infected, ensuring the survival of not only themselves but also innocent citizens trapped in the vicinity.

Eventually, the group is rescued by Sentinel Task Force operatives, but their leader, Captain Lennox ([[Bruce Campbell]]), claims that Oz is the source of the zombie infection. Lennox executes Oz and has Lilith, Decker and Kahn injected with anesthetic. However, Atlas forces ambush them and reclaim the ex-Atlas employees. Sentinel tracks them down, leading them to an Atlas aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean. Oz, however, begins to reanimate while being transported on one of the Sentinel's transports. Upon arrival within the carrier, Lennox locates the three Atlas survivors and leads them in battle against the combined forces of the zombies and Atlas soldiers. Lennox reveals to the other three that Oz was once part of Sentinel, and that he was present at the prison when Atlas released the Manticore bomb, making him one of the very first victims of the infection. He also claims that Oz was planted in Kahn's facility by Atlas in order to start the zombie outbreak. The group decides to sink the carrier to the bottom of the ocean, in order to prevent the infection from spreading. They set the ship to self-destruct, but before they can extract in an emergency pod, they briefly encounter Oz, now fully zombified while retaining his intelligence.

The group escapes and decides that Oz must be eliminated, and head to a nearby Atlas underwater survival facility, the Trident Retreat. Oz, however, has already arrived at the facility and murdered all Atlas employees within the base. The group bands together for one final battle against the undead horde, including Oz himself. After undertaking various challenges set by Oz, they are teleported into a digital representation of Oz's memory, where Kahn, Lilith and Decker learn the truth: while they are immune to the Manticore virus' effect, they can be used as a cure for the infection, unlike Oz. Having finished all of Oz's challenges, the group finally confronts him and discovers he has mutated into a monstrous figure. After a long fight, Oz is finally killed, and the group proceeds to burn his mutated corpse, vowing vengeance against Atlas. In the aftermath of the incident, Lennox is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and he helps Decker enlist in Sentinel as a full-fledged soldier; Kahn files a lawsuit against Atlas, with the help of Lilith, who now works as a hacktivist. Unbeknownst to the group, Atlas has already created clones of Oz, all kept hidden under the Trident facility.

[[File:Call of Duty Advanced Warfare screenshot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Advanced Warfare'' is the first ''Call of Duty'' title since ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'' to use an engine which has had the majority of it re-written and built-up from scratch by Sledgehammer.]]
Before being switched to become the co-developers of ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'', Sledgehammer Games was already working on a ''Call of Duty'' game called ''Call of Duty: Fog of War''. ''Fog of War'' was announced before ''Modern Warfare 3'' and after ''Black Ops''. It was to be set during the events of the [[Vietnam War]] and was said to be an action-adventure [[third-person perspective|third-person]] shooter video game. A ''Call of Duty'' [[massively multiplayer online game]] was also in development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-call-of-duty-not-sledgehammer-action-adventure/1100-6252764/|title=Upcoming Call of Duty not Sledgehammer action-adventure|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 3, 2010|accessdate=June 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322054057/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-call-of-duty-not-sledgehammer-action-adventure/1100-6252764/|archive-date=March 22, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg later stated that ''Modern Warfare 3'' was not the same title as Sledgehammer Games' action-adventure ''Call of Duty'' game. When asked if the action-adventure game was also in development, Hirshberg then stated that the Sledgehammer team was fully focused on ''Modern Warfare 3'' and that their own title had been put on hold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318814/e3-2011-activision-publishing-ceo-sounds-off-on-wii-u-vita-and-call-of-duty-elite/?tag=hot-stories%3Btitle%3B1|title=E3 2011: Activision Publishing CEO sounds off on Wii U, Vita, and Call of Duty: Elite|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 9, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619023629/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6318814/e3-2011-activision-publishing-ceo-sounds-off-on-wii-u-vita-and-call-of-duty-elite/?tag=hot-stories%3Btitle%3B1|archivedate=June 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref>

A new game in the ''Call of Duty'' series was announced to be released in November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/08/activision-confims-new-call-of-duty-and-skylander-games-for-2014|title=Activision Confirms New Call of Duty and Skylander Games for 2014|last=Sliva|first=Marty|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=June 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425105022/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/08/activision-confims-new-call-of-duty-and-skylander-games-for-2014|archive-date=April 25, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Director Michael Condrey said that the majority of the engine has been built from scratch. He stated that although there are lines of the old code left, there are new rendering, animation, physics and audio systems.<ref name="engine">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlieintel.com/2014/06/06/shgames-says-majority-of-advanced-warfares-engine-has-been-built-from-scratch/|title=SHGames says majority of Advanced Warfare's engine has been built from scratch|accessdate=June 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608173408/http://www.charlieintel.com/2014/06/06/shgames-says-majority-of-advanced-warfares-engine-has-been-built-from-scratch/|archive-date=June 8, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> With the improved engine, the audio has been built from the ground up. According to Don Veca, who worked on ''Advanced Warfare'', the audio in the game is very advanced which gives the game a genuine and great feel. Saying that audio doesn't come last as it did in previous titles, Glen Schofield says "We make sure that audio is just as important as anything else and Don's in there from the start with us."<!--Saying EDGE magazine (and it's Edge) isn't properly citing sources-->

Another objective that Sledgehammer accomplished with ''Advanced Warfare'' were the animations. The facial animating system and set is the same as James Cameron's upcoming ''[[Avatar 2]]''. According to Activision, the new three-year ''Call of Duty'' development cycle meant that ''Advanced Warfare'' developer Sledgehammer Games was able to create a 'near photorealistic' world unlike any ''Call of Duty'' before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-uses-version-of-avatar-2-facial-animation-system/1100-6420125/|title=Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Uses Version of "Avatar 2" Facial Animation System|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 5, 2014|accessdate=June 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612003909/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-uses-version-of-avatar-2-facial-animation-system/1100-6420125/|archive-date=June 12, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Michael Condrey confirmed in a tweet that ''Advanced Warfare'' would be featuring female soldiers in multiplayer, as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlieintel.com/2014/06/12/female-soldiers-will-also-be-part-of-advanced-warfares-multiplayer/|title=Female Soldiers will also be part of Advanced Warfare's Multiplayer|accessdate=June 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614235808/http://www.charlieintel.com/2014/06/12/female-soldiers-will-also-be-part-of-advanced-warfares-multiplayer/|archive-date=June 14, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare'' received "generally favorable reviews", according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name="MCPC"/><ref name="MCPS4"/><ref name="MCXONE"/> Josh Harmon from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the game a 9/10. He praised the engaging combat mechanics, coherent story (which he described as "a welcome shift for ''Call of Duty''"), new mobility options, as well as in-depth specialisation and the multiplayer, which he described as "The deepest, most enjoyable and the most skill-based ''Call of Duty'' multiplayer to date". He also praised the futuristic gadgetry which he described as "a feature that breathes new life into the franchise". However, he criticised the single-mission level design for being similar to the previous installments, as well as a predictable, disappointing plot twist, unimpressive co-operative mode and clumsy vehicle-involved single-player mission.<ref name="EGM"/>

Brian Albert from [[IGN]] gave the game a 9.1/10. He praised the iteration of the game set in the mid 21st century, calling it the biggest and most successful departure from what's expected in the ''Call of Duty'' series since the Modern Warfare trilogy brought the series into the 21st century. Albert gave praise to the campaign, singling out the performances of [[Troy Baker]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] in their roles as Mitchell and Jonathan Irons respectively, but criticised the campaign's hindrance of its characters' relationships and the exposition dialogue. He praised the creativity of the campaign levels, singling out certain missions that allow freedom to complete objectives. Albert gave praise to the Exo suit, while despite not having full use during the campaign, was a welcome addition for multiplayer which made it more intuitive and fun. He also mentions that the Exo suit allows him to have advantages in multiplayer that weren't possible in earlier ''Call of Duty'' titles, and mentioning that certain modes like Capture the Flag felt more intense than expected. He also praised the accelerated pace of rewards given to players who level up during multiplayer, citing supply drops of cosmetic items, new weapons and temporary perks like double experience points as examples. Albert also praised the Pick 13 System, an expansion of the Pick 10 System introduced in ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]'', which allowed him more options and flexibility on which weapons, attachments, and score-streaks he wanted in his loadout. He also praised the addition of a firing range in the multiplayer lobby, which allowed him to test the strengths and weaknesses of his loadout.<ref name="IGN"/>

Daniel Tack from [[Game Informer]] gave the game a 9/10, praising the unprecedented amount of fast movement, extensive multiplayer weapon customization, excellent visuals, well-executed single-player, varied multiplayer modes and distinct and interesting single-player levels, but criticizing the predictable plot conclusion and non-impactful weapon upgrades. He summarized the game as "a own special surge forward while maintaining the gunplay that makes the series fantastic."<ref name="GI"/>

PlayStation Lifestyle handed the game a 9/10 stating "Sledgehammer Games has given players a greater feeling of customization that goes beyond the cosmetic of an emblem and given way to random unlocks and a great number of modifications."<ref name="PlayStation LifeStyle"/>

Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq gave the game a 4/5. He praised the strong selection of dense, vertically challenging multiplayer maps, three-dimensional and liberating movement, coherent and fast-paced campaign, smart storytelling, exciting and dynamic gameplay, lifelike characters and movie-like presentation, but criticised the game for being a bit similar to the previous instalments as he stated that "''Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare'' just doesn't have the power to break through the expectations of the brand".<ref name="Joystiq"/>

Miguel Concepcion from [[GameSpot]] gave the game an 8/10, praising its content-rich multiplayer, futuristic combat system, entertaining Uplink mode (a new mode introduced in ''Advanced Warfare''), but criticising the inconsistent narrative, which he stated that "has prevented the campaign from being fully engaging", as well as shallow difficulty curve, making the co-operative mode "tedious".<ref name="GSpot"/>

The game garnered mixed reception from [[USgamer]], awarding it with a 3.5/5 and stating "''Advanced Warfare'' executes the formula competently while adding a handful of bells and whistles like mechs, laser cannons, and double jumps; but Sledgehammer Games seems reluctant to really cut loose and push the setting to its fullest potential, making ''Advanced Warfare'' a solid but ultimately unexciting entry in the series."<ref name="USGamer"/>

==="Press F to pay respects"===
One particular moment of the game that was singled out by reviewers and players alike was Will Irons' funeral service, where the player is prompted to press a button to approach the coffin; on the PC version, this particular prompt read "Press {{key press|F}} to Pay Respects."
