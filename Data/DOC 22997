===Origin===

''King of Baking, Kim Takgu'' is an award-winning Korean drama series broadcast on [[KBS2]] in 2010 starring [[Yoon Shi-yoon]], [[Joo Won]], [[Eugene (actress)|Eugene]] and [[Lee Young-ah]]. It was declared a "national drama" after garnering high ratings, including topping 50.0% for its finale episode.

In 2011, [[GMA Network]] aired the series, dubbed in Tagalog, under the title ''The Baker King''. For most of its run, it was the highest rated and most watched show in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/219093/showbiz/top-rating-koreanovela-the-baker-king-bids-goodbye | title=Top-rating Koreanovela, ‘The Baker King’ bids goodbye | publisher=GMA News | date=April 29, 2011 | accessdate=June 9, 2015 | author=GMA News}}</ref>  GMA re-aired the drama on weekends in late-2011 and into 2012.

===Production===
At its December 2013 trade launch to potential advertisers, TV5 announced it had acquired the Philippine adaptation rights to the drama.  ''Baker King'' was revealed as one of two Korean drama adaptations (along with ''[[My Fair Lady (Philippine TV series)|My Fair Lady]]'') to air on the network in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/tv5-dares-to-be-different-with-its-programs-this-2014/ |title=TV5 dares to be different with its programs this 2014 |publisher=Manila Bulletin |date=January 4, 2014 |accessdate=June 9, 2015 |author=Crispina Martinez-Belen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609171820/http://www.mb.com.ph/tv5-dares-to-be-different-with-its-programs-this-2014/ |archivedate=9 June 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>

TV5 talent [[Vin Abrenica]] was initially reported to have either been cast as the lead or second lead on the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.philstar.com/psn-showbiz/2013/12/05/1264291/wig-pala-ang-suot-aktres-nagpapa-chemo-ibinuko-ng-kapatid-ding-aktres | title=Vin Abrenica hindi ginawang bida sa remake ng koreanovela ng TV5 | publisher=Pilipino Star Ngayon | date=December 5, 2013 | accessdate=June 9, 2015 | author=Nitz Miralles}}</ref>  But in March 2014, a story published in the ''Journal'' group of daily tabloids reported that TV5 was interested in "borrowing" GMA talent [[Derrick Monasterio]] for ''Baker King'' in which he would star with TV5 talents Ritz Azul and Eula Caballero.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://latestnewsphilippines.com/showbiz-news/benjamin-alves-wants-to-follow-rochelle-anne-go-in-germany | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609211522/http://latestnewsphilippines.com/showbiz-news/benjamin-alves-wants-to-follow-rochelle-anne-go-in-germany | dead-url=yes | title=DERRICK, GUSTONG HIRAMIN NG TV5 SA GMA7 | publisher=Journal Online | date=March 1, 2014 | archivedate=June 9, 2015 | author=Journal Online}}</ref>

There would be no news about the project until April 2015 when TV5 announced ''Baker King'' would premiere on May 18 with a cast including Boots Anson-Roa, Akihiro Blanco, Shaira Mae, and Inah Estrada.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/17556/mark-neumann-and-shaira-mae-to-topbill-philippine-adaptation-of-the-baker-king| title=Mark Neumann and Shaira Mae to topbill Philippine adaptation of The Baker King| publisher=PEP | date=April 27, 2015 | accessdate=June 9, 2015 | author=James Patrick Anarcon}}</ref>  Mark Neumann was cast in the title role, contrary to what had been reported.
