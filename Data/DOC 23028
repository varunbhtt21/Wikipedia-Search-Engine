* '''Strong delete''' No sign of notability.  [[WP:ILIKEIT|Being a "good film"]] by someone's standards does not make it [[WP:GNG|notable]].  Wikipedia is [[WP:NOTDIRECTORY|not a directory of every movie ever made]].  It's not even worth me trying to clean up the formatting, etc to make it ''look'' pretty <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User talk:EatsShootsAndLeaves|<font style="color:#ffffff;background:black;"> the panda </font><font style="color:#000000;background:white;"> ɛˢˡ”</font>]]</span></small> 12:22, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Speedy delete''' because this is so obviously not notable. I find exactly two trivial mention references for this film, nothing more. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 14:28, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Delete''' per ESL - Clearly non notable and again it's just not worth fixing. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 18:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
