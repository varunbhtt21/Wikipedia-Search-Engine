Vanity article that fails both [[WP:ACADEMIC]] and general [[WP:NOTABILITY]] guidelines. Only real claim for wiki-notability is being one out of dozen or so Young Scientist Award laureates, [http://www.president.ee/en/president/institutions/146-cultural-foundation-of-the-president-of-the-republ/5067-young-scientist-award-/layout-institution.html].

*'''Question''' What makes you say this is a "vanity article"? That's quite a negative assessment... As for claims for notability, I see several claims (university chair, chair of a foundation, inventor of something). Also, if I click the link to Google Scholar above, I find several highly-cited papers that seem to indicate some influence in his field. Could you perhaps expand on your rationale? Thanks. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 12:39, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::Mostly because it was created as such by the very first edit ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ahto_Buldas&oldid=519699770]) by an editor who has barely edited anything else. This makes my COI-sense tingle - not to mention, for me it reads like a vanity article. If you think that my assessment is invalid or overly negative (especially for BLP!), I will remove it from the deletion nomination.
::As for notability, he is not in a named chair (WP:ACADEMIC criteria #5 - I am actually not sure these even exist in Estonia), OpenKSI foundation (http://www.openksi.org/) looks to be basically an one-page website set up by his own company, [[Guardtime]] (offtopic: that company does deserve to be a bluelink/article for sure) and unfortunately I am not qualified to assess his contributions in the field of cryptography. Perhaps most telling (for me) about his notability is that there is no article about him in the Estonian Wikipedia - nor was I able to find any news articles discussing him. There are a few that mention his name, but they are about Guardtime and mention him as one of the founders/CTO.

*'''Delete'''. GS [[h-index]] of 12 (please correct if wrong) in a very highly cited area is not there yet. Too early. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 02:55, 3 May 2014 (UTC).

*'''Delete'''. [[WP:TOOSOON]] for his papers to have developed enough citations to make a convincing case for [[WP:PROF#C1]] and no evidence of other kinds of notability. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 22:59, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
