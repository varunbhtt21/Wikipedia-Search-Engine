==History==
Track 61 is part of the "Lex Yard", a twelve-track storage yard under the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. It shares a platform with track 63, to its west. A similar platform exists between tracks 53 and 54, to the east.<ref name=":42">{{Cite map|title=Metro-North Railroad Track Map|year=2009|first1=Richard E.|last=Green|section=Grand Central Terminal|url=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/08/f5/2508f544f00000fcff04dd26ae750e94.jpg}}</ref> The yard was built during the [[construction of Grand Central Terminal]] in the 1910s, and served the terminal's [[power station]] and [[Heating system|heating plant]]. The platforms at tracks 61/63 and 53/54 were originally used to carry ashes away. The power plant was demolished in 1930 to make way for the hotel.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnKxDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT98|title=Grand Central Terminal: 100 Years of a New York Landmark|last=Robins|first=A.W.|last2=New York Transit Museum|publisher=ABRAMS|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61312-387-4|location=|page=|pages=|accessdate=December 6, 2018}}</ref>{{Rp|150}}

The platform was not originally intended to be used as a station, but its location made it ideal for unobtrusive access to the Waldorf Astoria when the hotel was built.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|164}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/gct61.html|title=Grand Central Terminal, Waldorf-Astoria platform|author=Joseph Brennan|date=2002|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Track 61 was famously used by General [[John J.
