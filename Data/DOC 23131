== Development ==
The game was in development for almost a year. It was announced in April 2014 for multiple platforms including [[Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation]] platforms. Developers decided not to make a port of the mobile game but instead to produce a proper remake. Grip Games implemented many improvements, including redone graphics, some changes to the car lineup, physics updates, and additional modes. A [[Xbox One]] version was released on March 13, 2015.

== Gameplay ==
The game has the same gameplay as the original ''Jet Car Stunts''. It is a hybrid between a [[Racing video game|racing]] and a [[platform game]]. Player controls a Jet Car, a combination of a race car and a jet plane, to get through platform tracks, performing stunt tricks along the way. It also features new cars, 36 testing tracks, three game modes, HD graphics, damage modelling and asynchronous multiplayer.<ref name=TXH>{{cite web|author=Neil|title=Exclusive Q&A interview with Grip Games about Jet Car Stunts coming to Xbox|url=http://www.thexboxhub.com/exclusive-qa-interview-grip-games-jet-car-stunts-xbox/|work=The Xbox Hub|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref name=PB>{{cite web|title=Jet Car Stunts leaps to PS3, PS4 and PS Vita soon|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2014/03/31/jet-car-stunts-leaps-ps3-ps4-ps-vita-soon/|work=Playstation Blog|accessdate=2 May 2014|date=2014-03-31}}</ref><ref name=VVV>{{cite web|last=Bigg|first=Martin|title=Jet Car Stunts is being remade for PSN, XBLA and PC this May|url=http://www.teamvvv.com/en/news/comments/Jet-Car-Stunts-is-being-remade-for-PSN-XBLA-and-PC-this-May|work=Veni Vidi Vici|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>
