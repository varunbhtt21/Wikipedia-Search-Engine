*'''Delete''' Seems to be a hoax.  I am sure the [[University of California]] would not allow this name to be used by someone else. [[User:Kitfoxxe|Kitfoxxe]] ([[User talk:Kitfoxxe|talk]]) 18:32, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' lacks notability as the only thing that can be confirmed is that it exists. --[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]]) ([[WP:Editor review/Jakec|my editor review]]) 18:40, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as per above. --[[User:Fauzan|<font color="2F4F4F">  Fauzan</font>]]<sup style="margin-left:+0.5ex">[[User talk:Fauzan#top|<font color="BDB76B">✆ talk</font>]]</sup> <sub style="margin-left:-5.35ex">[[Special:EmailUser/Fauzan|<font color="BDB76B">✉ email</font>]]</sub> 20:22, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete and redirect''' to [[UCSF]]&nbsp; This is not a part of the University of California.&nbsp; The one reference in the article is from a free web site and says, "jlknjinjinj".&nbsp; With 63 gHits, only two are for this topic, and both link to Wikipedia.&nbsp; The other Wikipedia link is [[List of colleges and universities in San Francisco]].&nbsp; However, there is reason to '''delete and redirect''' to [[UCSF]], for example, [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NwjEZmm-9zkJ:http://goodoralhealthcare.com/dentiste-plus-white-mouthwash-long-lasting-fresh-breath-check-deal/%2B%22University+of+California,+Bay+Area%22+-wikipedia+-barec+-bawp+-%22research+and+extension+center%22+-%22area+writing+project%22&num=50&hl=en&&ct=clnk] , [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dXvad6NUMrkJ:http://www.laserxchange.co.uk/can-mindfulness-meditation-reduce-belly-fat/%2B%22University+of+California,+Bay+Area%22+-wikipedia+-barec+-bawp+-%22research+and+extension+center%22+-%22area+writing+project%22&num=50&hl=en&&ct=clnk]...In both of these cases, if you look up the researchers mentioned, you find that they are faculty at UCSF.&nbsp; [[User:Unscintillating|Unscintillating]] ([[User talk:Unscintillating|talk]]) 12:46, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' and redirect to [[University of California, Berkeley]] as most likely target if someone types this in error. this entity does NOT exist.[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 20:59, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*:Redirecting may make the bay area institute appear to be related to UCSF. Maybe a (deleting and) disambiguation may do. --[[User:Fauzan|<font color="2F4F4F">  Fauzan</font>]]<sup style="margin-left:+0.5ex">[[User talk:Fauzan#top|<font color="BDB76B">✆ talk</font>]]</sup> <sub style="margin-left:-5.35ex">[[Special:EmailUser/Fauzan|<font color="BDB76B">✉ email</font>]]</sub> 12:12, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
