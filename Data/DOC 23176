== Review ==
The saxophone by the leader herself tell us that Shorter and Miles acoustic bands are very much her inspiration. All the compositions are made by Paulsberg, and the music is always in motion, carefully lifted by the rhythm strong section.<ref name=thejazzbreakfast>{{cite web |url=http://thejazzbreakfast.com/2014/02/27/hanna-paulsberg-concept-song-for-josia |title=Hanna Paulsberg Concept – Song For Josia |work=Musical review |first=Peter |last=Bacon |publisher=TheJazzBreakfast.com |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>

This is Paulsberg's second album, following up her successful solo debut ''Waltz For Lilli'' (2012), just over a year ago. Now it is with regards to one of her musical friends in Madagaskar, where she has just presented her music live on the Madajazzkar Festival.<ref name=nrk>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/kanal/nrk_jazz/1.11536205 |title=Hanna Paulsberg Concept - Song For Josia |language=Norwegian |work=Musical review |first=Erling |last=Wicklund |publisher=[[NRK Jazz]] |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>

TheJazzBreakfast.com [[critique]] Peter Bacon, in his review of Paulsberg's album ''Song For Josia'' states:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|''... Right from the opening notes this is an album which draws the listener in – it’s the way the band interacts, it’s the sound of their instruments, especially Paulsberg’s saxophone. Not only does she have a compelling sound, rounded with both a puffy tone and a clear edge as well, but she constructs great lines with strong sense of searching and forward momentum...<ref name=thejazzbreakfast/>
