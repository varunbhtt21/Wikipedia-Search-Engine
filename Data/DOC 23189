Title : Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee
Text : '''Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee''' (c.1548 – 7 August 1625) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] peer.<ref>John Debrett, ''Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (1836), 432.</ref>

Brabazon was the  eldest son of [[William Brabazon (Lord Justice of Ireland)|Sir William Brabazon]] (died 1552), the Lord Justice of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], and Elizabeth Clifford (died 1581). His mother was the daughter and co-heiress  of Nicholas Clifford of Holme in  [[Kent]] and Mary Harper.  She was a much married lady, and Edward as a result  had numerous half-siblings, including the distinguished soldier [[Sir William Warren (died 1602)|Sir William Warren]],  and [[Garret Moore,  1st Viscount Moore]].<ref>John Debrett, ''Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (1836), 432.</ref>

He grew up at Thomas Court, near present-day Thomas Street in [[Dublin]] city, where his father had built a house out of the lands  of the former Abbey of St Thomas,  which were granted to him after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. The Abbey's lands included Killruddery, near [[Bray, County Wicklow]].   The building of  the original [[Kilruddery House]]  seems to have begun in Edward's  later years: Kilruddery is still the family home, although no trace of the original house survives. He built and occupied [[Ballinasloe]] castle in the 1570s or 80s, on land previously held by [[Seán na Maighe Ó Cellaigh]].

He was made a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] in 1584. In 1585, he held of the office of Member of Parliament for [[Wicklow County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Wicklow County]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]]. He was knighted on 24 August 1595. Brabazon was [[High Sheriff of Staffordshire]] in 1606 and served as MP for [[Bangor (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Bangor]] between 1613 and 1615. He was a member of the Council of Munster in 1615. On 19 July 1616, he was created '''Baron Ardee''' in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] and took his seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]].<ref>William Courthope, ''Debrett's Complete Peerage of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'' (J. G. & F. Rivington, 1838), 529.</ref>

==Family==

Brabazon married Mary Smythe, the daughter of Thomas Smythe Esq. of Surrey, [[Clerk of the Green Cloth]] to [[Elizabeth I]] and his wife Eleanor Hazelrigg, and together they had  at least  six children.<ref>W. Owen, ''The Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland: The peerage of Ireland'' (1790), 32.</ref>  His eldest son predeceased him and his second son, [[William Brabazon, 1st Earl of Meath|William]], was made [[Earl of Meath]] in 1627.<ref>W. Owen, ''The Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland: The peerage of Ireland'' (1790), 32.</ref> 

A younger son Anthony settled in [[County Louth]] and  founded a junior branch of the family.

He had  at least three daughters:

*Elizabeth (died 1647)  who  married  as his second wife [[George Montgomery (bishop)|George Montgomery]], [[Bishop of Meath]]. After  his death  she. remarried  [[John Brereton (Irish lawyer)|Sir John Brereton]], the King's [[  Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)]]. Finally in 1631 she married her early sweetheart, [[John  Bramston, the  elder|Sir John Bramston]], the  [[Lord Chief Justice]]. Her father  when they were young had forbidden them to marry but her brother in later life evidently approved of the match, which was celebrated at  at Kilruderry. Her stepchildren were  rather perturbed  to learn  that their father had cherished a lifelong  romantic attachment to Elizabeth, whom they described as being a  small, fat,  red faced, elderly woman,  but  they quickly  came to appreciate her many virtues.

*Susannah  who  married [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall]] and  had  issue.

*Ursula (died1625)   who married [[James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Clandeboye]]; they  divorced c.1615.
