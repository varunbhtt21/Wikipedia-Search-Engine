The result was    '''delete'''. The consensus was to delete all five articles.  If anybody wants to work on these (i.e. research and add the required sources), any admin can move the deleted text into your private user space. -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 11:33, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

No reliable evidence of notability. The Guardian page listed as a reference is not staff-written, but rather a reprint of a page at Last.fm. I don't think they charted on a recognized chart, and I don't think that digital distribution through [[RouteNote]] counts as distribution on a notable minor label.

The following articles are also part of this AfD nomination:

*'''Delete'''. I can't find anything that shows how any of these artists meet the guidelines for inclusion set out at [[WP:MUSICBIO]] or the [[WP:GNG|general notability guide]].[[User:Sparklism| — sparklism]] <sup><small>''[[User_talk:Sparklism| hey!]]''</small></sup> 11:02, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

This artist was signed with the label SONY but were dropped in the 1990's. I believe that there album Close To You was in the Irish Album Charts in the 1990's also. This artist has appeared on BBC radio stations to give interviews such as Radio Leeds, Radio Aire and Magic 828. Sources for this artist are difficult to find but I think the page should remain. The other artists should be deleted as they have no significance on their own. As with this page any information that isn't sourced properly should be removed.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.30.117.165|92.30.117.165]] ([[User talk:92.30.117.165|talk]]) 13:13, 8 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
*'''Delete all''' unless proper third party sources are provided.  The article tells us they had a small amount of fame, and released notable songs, but gives no evidence of that. Saying your notable isn't really a notability claim.  It is unfortunate that there may be sources that are hard to find, because they're offline, due to their age.  But, the onus is on whoever wants inclusion to find them.  --[[User:Thivierr|Rob]] ([[User talk:Thivierr|talk]]) 00:01, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

Is there a way of taking the article offline without deleting it so that what is already there is kept until sources are found that way it would be less time consuming.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Grandpa152|Grandpa152]] ([[User talk:Grandpa152|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Grandpa152|contribs]]) 16:22, 9 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:*{{ping|Grandpa152}} Yes, the article could be [[WP:UFY|userfied]] if you intend work on it.[[User:Sparklism| — sparklism]] <sup><small>''[[User_talk:Sparklism| hey!]]''</small></sup> 07:44, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

There isn't many sources online there may be some in archive newspapers from the early 1990's  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.29.139.12|92.29.139.12]] ([[User talk:92.29.139.12|talk]]) 22:30, 9 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
