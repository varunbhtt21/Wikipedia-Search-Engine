According to witnesses, one train was hit from the rear by another incoming train while leaving Sangwangsimni station in the east of Seoul.<ref name=reuters/> Another witness said many passengers forced the doors open and escaped onto the tracks after ignoring the onboard announcement which told them to stay inside the cars.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|title=South Korea subway crash injures dozens in Seoul |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27250961 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=May 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505210252/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27250961 |archivedate=May 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> The decision by many passengers to ignore instructions was likely due to distrust in authorities after the [[Sinking of MV Sewol]] and [[Daegu subway fire]], where instructions to remain onboard resulted in several fatalities.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Song|first1=Jung-a|title=Dozens injured in Seoul subway crash|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4f1a0bdc-d1e3-11e3-8ff4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3sFFIn8tu|accessdate=22 November 2015|work=Financial Times|date=2 May 2014}}</ref>

[[YTN]] television reported one subway car was derailed, so passengers had to walk a short distance along the tracks to the station. A government emergency official said that many passengers were injured as they jumped from the subway cars onto the tracks.<ref name=reuters/> [[Yonhap]] said the train stopped due to mechanical problems after the second train ran into the back of it.<ref name=bbc/> It also said that 'a failure in the moving train's automatic distance control system' may have been the cause, while officials were still investigating the accident.<ref name=ap>{{cite web|title=Seoul subway trains crash, causing minor injuries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/south-korean-media-subway-accident-injures-dozens/2014/05/02/3c051eb0-d1cf-11e3-a714-be7e7f142085_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 2, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Causes and investigations==
The CEO of Seoul Metro later revealed that a faulty [[Automatic Train Stop]] signaling system was responsible for the incident.<ref name="dw" /> The signaling fault was discovered 14 hours before but remained unfixed at the time of collision.<ref name="yonghap" /> Seoul Metro official Jeong Su-young said that the driver of the moving train applied the emergency brake after noticing a stop signal, but the train could not stop in time.<ref name=abc/> 
Local news reports revealed 'providing instructions to passengers about what to do' were largely delayed.<ref name=abc/>
