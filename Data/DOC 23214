==Wiki project==
I have seen baseball wiki projects and want to add on to them but i cant. Do you have to be a member of the project, or be invited in to it, Cause i know a lot of stuff that should be on it. So is there a way i can conributte to any sports wiki projects.[[User:Tylkrby767|Tylkrby767]] ([[User talk:Tylkrby767|talk]]) 01:35, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:Definitely. Check out [[Portal:Baseball/Projects and Things|Baseball Portal - Projects and Things]] and review the section titled "Things you can do". Or at [[WP:MLB|WikiProject Baseball]] read the green box to the left and look for "Everybody is welcome to add their name to the list of participants", which contains a link to the list of participants. I don't see a project page for the Kansas City Royals, but there's one for the [[WP:REDS|Cinncinati Reds]].

:At the same time, make sure you have read all the articles recommended to you on your [[User talk:Tylkrby767|talk page]]. Some very experienced, friendly editors have cautioned you about various issues and have offered great advice. If you follow their recommendations, you can become an important member of one or more of the [[Portal:Baseball|baseball WikiProjects]].

==I want to upload a photo to a page==
This ought to be simple but seems so difficult! I have a photo of my own original poster from the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music which has it's own page...I thought it would be a good update to the page. I have an account but have only made one update to any page in 8 years..why the rule to make 10 updates before I can upload a photo? Or have I got the wrong end of the stick. I went into EDIT mode on the page but couldn't see how to upload a photo so here I am!

:Hello Cullen, I am a very new contributor and also want to add a photo (of Bishop George Mackarness) to a page that currently has no image.

::Hello, {{U|Sydwall}}. No, it doesn't work to link to a picture outside Wikipedia. You first have to upload the picture to either Wikimedia Commons (where all Wikimedia projects can use it) or to Wikipedia. However, issues of copyright make this difficult. It's not enough that you are the administrator of a site where the picture is hosted: you need to get the owner of the copyright (often the photographer, but not necessarily) to explicitly release the photo with a suitable licence (which allows anybody to use it for any purpose, provided it is attributed). Please see the [[WP:donating copyrighted materials|donating copyrighted materials]] page for how to go about this. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 09:20, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:Thanks for your responses folks. My photo is merely of a poster from an event in 1970. I own the poster. There is a photo of a different poster there already and the display of that one has a good explanation that a low-res picture for illustrative purposes does not violate US copyright law. My poster is very different from that on display already and is perhaps more in keeping with 70s style graphic art, though I appreciate that the editors might not want a second poster there

==First try at editing removed, what is next step?==
Hi, Helper, I recently added information about an academic study of The New York Times to the Wikipedia NYT article under the coverage subsection. I gave a citation, but my edit was removed with the comment that it showed POV and Undue and I should get consensus. It's a solid study, cited in an academic journal and written by highly qualified academic experts, so I am convinced it should be included, especially since a similar study is already in the subsection. I am new to this and ready to revise and try again to do it right this time. Tell me, how do I get consensus? Can you walk me through the next steps? 
Many thanks!

::Hello Zeke1314.  To attain a consensus, go to the talk page of the NY Times article, and describe the study you were talking about.

==How do I get the notability tag removed?==
Hi, I confess up front - I'm a Wikipedia newbie. 

I have written my first article: [[Chris Bradford (rock musician)]], and added lots of references throughout it.
But a notability tag has turned up, making the article look very suspicious. 

I checked the notability article - 
[[Wikipedia:Notability (music)]]

''A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, DJ, musical theatre group, instrumentalist, etc.) may be notable if it meets at least one of the following criteria...'' (my article meets the following THREE criteria)

<br />
2.Has had a single or album on any country's national music chart.[note 4]
<br />
5.Has released two or more albums on a major record label or on one of the more important indie labels (i.e., an independent label with a history of more than a few years, and with a roster of performers, many of whom are notable).
<br />
6.Is an ensemble which contains two or more independently notable musicians, or is a musician who has been a reasonably-prominent member of two or more independently notable ensembles.[note 6] This should be adapted appropriately for musical genre; for example, having performed two lead roles at major opera houses.

I think my article meets the criteria.
How do I get the notability tag removed?

Hope someone can help me here.

THANKS!!

:[[User:Billy900]], I'd recommend leaving a message at [[User talk:Animalparty]], copying what you just wrote here, and asking if s/he has any objections to you removing the notability tag. Or maybe someone here will just have a closer look and remove the tag themselves.  Worst case, if you and Animalparty can't agree, you can always leave a message at [[WP:3O]] to get a third opinion from another user.

==How do I deal with a page redirect that I disagree with?==
I created a page that I think is important and significantly different from the topic that it was redirected to. I am new to editing Wikipedia and this is the first page that I created and invested a lot of time and effort into making it good enough to be approved as a page. It is really frustrating to see it redirected the next day in response to my request for assistance to improve it from Class-C to Class-B quality. 
The topic was redirected as POV, even though it had citations for almost everything. The topic was about a major startup ecosystem located in a village-like environment. As far as I know, that is uncommon and most are located in urban environments. The topic was redirected to the largest city in the area (population of 22,000). The name of the topic was [[Startup Village, Yokneam]]. The redirect was to [[Yokneam]].

How should I deal with this? How can I get the redirect removed from [[Startup Village, Yokneam]].

:Your first step is to discuss the matter with {{U|Huon}} who redirected.

I'm just guessing here, because you have not clearly identified which page you had a problem editing, but was it [[Wikipedia:WikiProject St. Louis Cardinals|this page]]? If so, the issue has nothing to do with whether or not you are a member of the Wikiproject. (In fact, being a member of a wikiproject is simply an identification of an interest, a way to declare you might be willing to collaborate and so on, and gives you no "permissions" to edit something that you otherwise could not.) If it was that page, then the issue is that the text you see on that page is from other [[WP:TRANSCLUSION|transcluded pages]], and unfortunately, it's really quite difficult without a lot of experience to even figure out what those pages are from the code on the page when you click edit. Here it would be [[Wikipedia:WikiProject St. Louis Cardinals/right side]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Baseball/left side]]. But there are a few sections on that project page that have links in the body to allow you to edit, including the section on adding your name to the Wikiproject.

==Stub class = red title and not found when searching Wikipedia?==

==Corecting a stub==
A couple of problems with a cheese stub:

* [[Caş]] should redirect to [[Caș]]. Instead the pages are the other way around. The corect sign is [[ș]] with a comma. The cedilla variant is wrong and only used because systems older than Windows XP have it wrong.

* What's the point to reference a word dictionary? The reference is also in Romanian. Should I ask for a translation with 'Source need translation' or plain remove the link?

* Should cow milk and sheep milk be links in this context?

* Does the third reference, also in Romanian, have a point? Should I ask for a translation in such a case?

* What can be done about the template?

** Bryndza is the generic word for cheese if written as Brânză

** [[Bryndza]] spelled like that is a Polish cheese, nothing to do with Romania

** [[Caș]], [[Cașcaval]], [[Telemea]], [[Urdă]] are a generic types of cheese like [[Cottage cheese]]. Cașcaval is used as the equivalent of Yellow cheese.

** [[Năsal]] is a comercial trade mark and not a traditional cheese. It has only one maker and no published recipie or description like [[Cheddar cheese]]

How do I corect citation issues? Somebody introduced a reference to an unreliable Romanian tabloid. Something like The Sun in United Kingdom. And many food related articles give lists of fictive foods as having [[protected designation of origin]]. I corected the [[telemea]] article. But

* should I ask for a translation?

* should I ask for a better source?

* should I remove the wrong part?

[[Năsal cheese]] should be considered unreferenced? There are two references, one about food odor and one in Hungarian.

* there are no references to the fame of this chese

:Hi, Ableci and welcome to The Teahouse. I will try to answer as many questions as I can, but I can't give an answer to them all.

:If you have a source for the incorrect redirect we could do a [[WP:MOVE|move]], which may require administrator help since someone would have to move to an existing page.

:Sources in other languages are fine, but if one can be found in English it is preferable. I'm not sure what the policy is on using a dictionary as a reference.

:Yes, my opinion is that types of milk should be linked.

:I'm not sure what you mean by template.

:As for the types of cheese, I would have to assume you know what you are talking about but a source would help.

:If you know a source to be unreliable, you can put the following after <nowiki>"</ref>": {{unreliable source}}. Or you can remove it and replace it with {{cn}}.</nowiki>. 

:Do what you can if you don't feel confident. Each article has a [[WP:TP|talk page]]. For the page you mentioned first, that would be [[Talk:Caș]]. After clicking on that link click on "New section" at the top of the page. Or at least that's how it works for me.— [[User:Vchimpanzee|<font color="Green">Vchimpanzee</font>]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[User talk:Vchimpanzee|<span style="color: orange"> talk</span>]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Vchimpanzee|<span style="color: maroon">contributions</span>]]&nbsp;'''·''' 20:29, 25 April 2014 (UTC) 
::I see there is a red link, so instead of clicking on "New section", you would just start typing once you clicked. You would add a section heading at the top:

:: Thank you Vchimpanzee for your answer.

: Do you think breaking up the long list into individual questions would help?

: For the move I am going to do what is written into the move reference.

: About the linked types of milk, I find it silly in this particular case. I have checked so far [[feta]], [[emmental cheese]] and [[raclette]] and these respectable cheeses do not have that particular link. In the case of [[caș]] it is a stub. Second it is about a generic category like saying yellow cheese. Third last time I went to the market caș was made of any milk available. The examples above are all respected and protected types that are made of a specific milk. They might have variations, but mainly there is only one way to do it.

: By template I meant that frame at the end of the article that contains a listing of a certain category (I think). Please do read the page, it is only a stub and quite obvious.

: You are right about needing a source before making changes to that end-of-page-table. It is a bit ironic, as the original poster did not have one. For the [[bryndza]] just check up the linked page.

: Very useful the example for unreliable sources. In my particular case, please do check [[telemea]]. I have the proof at the source of [[PDO]] that the quoted source is a lie.

: Finally, about the talk pages, what is the way to reach a conclusion? Is there a time to lave the issue open than move on with the changes? How are the issues solved? How do I prevent somebody reading the fake/wrong source from making the same mistake a year later? [[User:Ableci|Ableci]] ([[User talk:Ableci|talk]]) 19:47, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::Sorry to take so long to respond. There was nothing on my talk page and I didn't know you needed further help because I didn't happen toi come back here. I was very busy.

::If there is a lot to talk about, individual questions might be better.

::Regarding the types of milk, I thought if those were the specific types of milk, it would be useful to have links to them. On the other hand, if caș can be any milk, maybe it is not necessary. If someone else wrote a better article and did not link them, maybe it is not necessary. It's all about what people might want to research further. 

::I still don't know what you want to do about the template. I didn't know which one you were talking about, and I don't see anything wrong now.

::I really don't know what the correct procedure is for reaching conclusions on talk pages. There is a link to [[WP:TP|talk page]] above that should point you to some information. — [[User:Vchimpanzee|<font color="Green">Vchimpanzee</font>]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[User talk:Vchimpanzee|<span style="color: orange"> talk</span>]]&nbsp;'''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Vchimpanzee|<span style="color: maroon">contributions</span>]]&nbsp;'''·''' 15:29, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

::And after checking, I actually don't see anything. That's surprising. I should refer you to [[WP:BRD]] which might help you know how to discuss possible changes. Someone has to to discuss these issues with you, though, and I'm not sure how to do that other than to look at the history ("view history" at the top of each article) and click on the talk page of each editor who made a major contribution. These are the people most likely to have an interest.

::To keep someone from going back to the wrong source, clearly identify the wrong source as unreliable in your edit summary, and maybe comment on the article talk page.

==Leaders of Native American renegade bands==
Hi all,

After a user challenged the notability of a Wikipedia article I created (my first), I thought it raised an interesting question for the larger community (and perhaps one that has already been answered in the past): 

do the leaders of small, renegade Native American bands merit inclusion in Wikipedia?

The subject in question led a small village of "disaffected" Native Americans from a few different tribes, numbering about 100 in all; dealt land to settlers to which he claimed he held rights; complained to colonial authorities on multiple occasions about settlers' dealings with him; and according to one historian, appeared to have plotted some kind of aggressive act to bring other tribes "down" on farmers and settlers in the area where he lived. He was thought to have fled his original tribal unit; and fled a second time after killing a Native American whose name appears to be lost to history.

There is very little historical information about him out there -- I have been able to find only three or four references to citations in colonial records and scholar articles, and so the Wikipedia article itself is by necessity brief, only about five paragraphs long.

I would be interested to know whether marginal Native American leaders who led renegade bands have been chronicled on Wikipedia. It struck me as worthy of the historical record, but it is a borderline case and I could see how other's could view him as not having sufficient historical weight to merit his own article.

Casoulman[[User:Casoulman|Casoulman]] ([[User talk:Casoulman|talk]]) 11:54, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Hello, {{U|Casoulman}}The criterion for accepting a subject for an article in Wikipedia is quite clear and simple, but not what people unused to Wikipedia might expect. It is not importance, fame, or worthiness: it is simply what Wikipedia calls "notability"; in other words, has the subject ''already'' been written about in multiple reliable places, independent of the subject, such as major newspapers or books from reputable publishers? The sources do not have to be online, or even in English (though it's easier if they are) but they have to exist, and treat the subject at some length. So, if there have been books, or newspaper or journal articles about these leaders, then they "merit inclusion", and any article must cite these sources to demonstrate this fact. If there haven't been, then no matter how important they were historically, they may not have Wikipedia articles; for the simple reason that it will be impossible to write a satisfactory Wikipedia article about them. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 14:36, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Okay, thanks ColinFine -- by that standard, my entry on Chickens Warrups would appear to not merit a separate article in Wikipedia, then. I have found multiple historical resources that mention him (colonial records, historical book and mentions in articles published in academic journals), but all reference him in relation to the history of Connecticut, and not profiling him alone as an independent figure of historical significance. I may delete the article I wrote (assuming one can do so), but will wait a few days for any additional comment here.

Thanks again ...[[User:Casoulman|Casoulman]] ([[User talk:Casoulman|talk]]) 14:56, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::You can't delete the article yourself, since this requires an administrator. And since others have contributed to [[Chickens Warrups]] it would have to be nominated for deletion.

==Trying to create a biographical page for a professor==
Hi there, I'm new to Wiki page and article creation and need a little help, so I'm not plagiarizing or crossing lines during the process.  I would like to use a lot of the content from this professor's University of Washington webpage that would contain his academic background and publications, etc., but I don't know how I would go about doing that.

:Hi Friesianfighter and welcome to the Teahouse. You can definitely use the professor's webpage as a reference and include a link to it at the end of the article. See the [[Sandra Waxman]] page as an example. However, you cannot copy - everything must be in your own words. And most importantly, the professor must be "notable" which means having been noticed and written about, before you write the article. You need to find references independent of him to show that he has gotten awards, made an impact in his field, or been otherwise well known. See [[Wikipedia:Notability (academics)]]. What he has written doesn't matter as much as what has been written ABOUT him. Happy editing. [[User:StarryGrandma|StarryGrandma]] ([[User talk:StarryGrandma|talk]]) 22:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Hi Zince34. This is something commonly seen at [[WP:AFD|Articles for deletion]] - if, after a seven day period, the reviewing admin is unable to establish a consensus (if not enough people have contributed to the discussion, or the arguments made don't show a clear preference for one particular course of action) that admin will often relist the discussion to gain more input. This basically just moves it back into the current (and hence most heavily viewed) AFD queue. A discussion can be relisted two or even three times if necessary, before it gets closed as "no consensus". Does that help explain it?

::{{replyto|zince34}} Generally, yes.  Occasionally a [[Wikipedia:Non-admin closure|non-admin relisting]] can be appropriate, e.g. if the nomination has not received any comments during the initial listing period -- so it's obvious even to a non-admin that relisting is the correct course of action.

:::There's no technical reason that non-admins can't relist discussions, but unless it's a very obvious relist (e.g. no-one's commented apart from the nominator) then it's probably better to leave it for an admin to take a look. Whilst a relisted discussion can still be closed without running for another week, if you relist the discussion, it's moved out of the list of discussions for closure. Since that's where most administrators will tend to look for discussions to close, you're basically forcing a discussion to continue when it might in fact be closeable. Still, there's certainly no prohibition against non-admin relists.

Which one are you working on? I will give you some more suggestions on your talk page. [[User:StarryGrandma|StarryGrandma]] ([[User talk:StarryGrandma|talk]]) 23:19, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Thank you for all your help! Can you respond give me suggestions to this current article on the Teahouse discussion? 

[[User:DS132|DS132]] ([[User talk:DS132|talk]]) 15:31, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::Sure. I've put the review comments back on [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/IPC Systems]]. You have enough independent sources. Sources from industry publications are fine as long as they are reporting or announcing awards, not just reprinting press releases. The article reads like a sales brochure, but it should be easy to rewrite it into encyclopedia form. Start out with a sentence like:
:::IPC Systems is an American company headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey that provides trading communication systems for the financial services industry. They are known for the creation of the trading turret.
::Next put the company history. Company press releases are OK as a source for facts. Here is where to explain what a trading turret is. And the introduction of the VoIP version. Thanks for including an explanation of what the company's product does. Many editors don't include that in company articles. An encyclopedia article shows how the company developed over time.
::Leave out marketing language like: The company’s written aim is to deliver "unified solutions that support collaborative voice trading, real-time electronic trading and market data connectivity." 
::Let me know if you have any more questions. [[User:StarryGrandma|StarryGrandma]] ([[User talk:StarryGrandma|talk]]) 16:23, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

==photo copyright-cannot find the source==
I'm kind of a newbie to editing.
There is a bio page of a favorite actress which has no image of her. I would like to upload a photo but I cannot tell if its under any sort of copyright. I tied to look up the source and that provides nothing. Its a formal portrait like you would find in a press package. Can I upload it under Creative Commons or what??
thanks much!!
[[User:Utnijlj|Utnijlj]] ([[User talk:Utnijlj|talk]]) 16:39, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:No, if you cannot find a source you should not use it. As that could bring Wikipedia into legal troubles. Which is a very big no. I suggest you find another image that is allowed. Or try to find the source for a little while longer. [[User:NathanWubs|NathanWubs]] ([[User talk:NathanWubs|talk]]) 17:18, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::Is the actress still alive?

::Incidentally but separately, even if the actress is still alive, if you were able to find a justification similar to [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Monroes_Cast_1966.jpg the one here] then the image could be used. That's a publicity photo that was taken a long-ish time ago and never released as "free" as we understand it - of course it requires knowing the source or at least physically possessing the original promotional material. In this case the latter, and also I quote in this case "It is unclear as to whether the press-materials were distributed by Qualis Productions (the company that produced the series), 20th Century Fox Television (the company that co-produced the series), or ABC Television (the network that aired the series)", but still permissible for the other reasons given there. --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 17:53, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

==To revert or not to revert...==
Still a novice editor, I would appreciate suggestions from the more experienced people here.

Going through some of the articles in [[:Category:Pages_with_missing_references_list]], I came across [[U.S._Congress_and_citizens]]. The most recent edit was by an IP, who deleted the entire Reference section with the comment "(Tag: section blanking)".

The old references were different from what I am used to, with lots of long quotations from the US constitution etc. I'm not sure whether that approach is good or bad, but just deleting everyhing, including the Reflist, seems a bit heavy-handed. I should mention that the Talk page does not appear to be used; there is only one comment there, from 2010.

I would be grateful if somebody would take a look at the current (id=605983553) and previous (id=598362631) versions, and advise whether that edit should be reverted.  Or is there some better way to deal with this? [[User:Gronk Oz|Gronk Oz]] ([[User talk:Gronk Oz|talk]]) 09:50, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:Rule of thumb that I always keep is this. If someone just blanks a whole section that mostly means vandalism. But of course you should check to make if this is the case. In this case it seemed blatant vandalism to me so I undid what was done. [[User:NathanWubs|NathanWubs]] ([[User talk:NathanWubs|talk]]) 11:34, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

: I think you will find that the comment "(Tag: section blanking)" was not an edit summary added by the IP editor but a warning to watching editors added by the edit filter software, see [[Wikipedia:Tags]]. As NathanWubs implied, such tags are often a useful pointer to vandalism. --[[User:David Biddulph|David Biddulph]] ([[User talk:David Biddulph|talk]]) 14:48, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::Great - thanks again for the help, Nathan and David.  --[[User:Gronk Oz|Gronk Oz]] ([[User talk:Gronk Oz|talk]]) 16:08, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:No problem, also one more tip. If you see something that looks like vandalism. Then check the user contributions after you are done with reverting. As a lot of vandals like to spread their vandalism around. Sometimes on pages that are almost never checked. Which can result in an act of vanadalism being in an article for a long time. So be vigilant [[User:NathanWubs|NathanWubs]] ([[User talk:NathanWubs|talk]]) 16:12, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::Good point, thanks. I have not had to deal with vandalism before, so it helps to have this perspective. I just checked this case, and there are no other "Contributions" for that IP. Of course, IP addresses change, but it's worth checking. --[[User:Gronk Oz|Gronk Oz]] ([[User talk:Gronk Oz|talk]]) 16:24, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:::I'd just like to re-emphase NathanWub's important point "But of course you should check to make if this is the case". The most common cause of section blanking (or entire article blanking) '''not''' being vandalism is outlined in the early part of [[Wikipedia:Don't overlook legal threats]], and the issues mentioned there - [[WP:BLP]] - are a lot more important than just some ordinary vandalism happening to an article. It's well worth reading. --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 18:12, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::: One extra tip.  I notice that you had earlier included in your question the markup <nowiki>[[Category:Pages_with_missing_references_list]]</nowiki>, and subsequently realised that this didn't display, but it put this help page into the category referred to.  In a revision to your question you removed the wiki markup, but the easy way of avoiding this problem is to precede the category name by a colon, thus <nowiki>[[:Category:Pages with missing references list]]</nowiki>, which is rendered as the link [[:Category:Pages with missing references list]] <small>(so I've taken the liberty of making that edit to your question to include the link)</small>. The same technique of a preceding colon is used for inter-wiki language links. --[[User:David Biddulph|David Biddulph]] ([[User talk:David Biddulph|talk]]) 18:19, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

==Album cover and single cover==
How can I put some album cover or single cover for the pages I created about songs? Thank you [[User:DridsOBrien|DridsOBrien]] ([[User talk:DridsOBrien|talk]]) 19:24, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::Hello DridsObrien.  Album covers are for the most part copyrighted, and therefore not [[free use]].  Wikipedia as a rule shies away from using non-free use pictures and logos.  For future reference, there is a tab on the side of the page called "Upload file".  Follow the instructions after hitting it to upload images, but as I said before, it's best to avoid non-free use pictures.  [[User:Vjmlhds|Vjmlhds]] [[user talk:Vjmlhds|(talk)]] 20:29, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Hello {{U|DridsOBrien}}. Low resolution images of album covers are permitted under our guideline on non-free content. Please see [[WP:NFCI]] #1, and follow that guideline carefully.

::::But they would probably be allowed on an article about the album, but not on articles about the individual songs. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 23:34, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::The same guideline applies, for example, to classic singles released as 45 rpm records. In that case, a photo of the record label of the single side is permitted. But it wouldn't apply to articles about individual album tracks, even those that became notable hits, in my opinion.

==How to create another page for a person who is in different field==
If a page with the same name exist already how can we create another page as the field of person is different and i don't want to edit the existing page of a person as both are popular in their respective fields[[User:Novoiceplus|Novoiceplus]] ([[User talk:Novoiceplus|talk]]) 02:01, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:<small><small><small>@[[:User:Novoiceplus|Novoiceplus]]:</small></small></small> Hi Novoiceplus. Please tell us the name of the name of the existing page and the topic of the intended article. In very general terms, this is a [[WP:DAB|disambiguation]] question but what to do depends on various factors. For example, if the existing page is the primary topic then it should remain at the main title and the new title should have a disambiguated name, possibly through natural disambiguation by including a middle initial or name, or possibly through a parenthetically disambiguated title, coupled with a [[WP:HATNOTE|hatnote]] on the primary topic's article. If there is no primary topic, then the main title should be occupied by a disambiguation page and both pages should take disambiguated names.  See [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation]] and [[Wikipedia:Article titles]] generally, and especially their subsections at [[WP:PRECISION]], [[WP:PTOPIC]] and [[WP:TWODABS]] among others. I have presented this as a black and white, two option scenario but this does not cover all possibilities that arise. Again, if you supply the specifics, advice can be tailored.

==soc pupet==
I have seen poor people on wiki being investigated for sock puppet. Could you just tell me what the hell is a sock puppet. [[User:Redsfan21|Redsfan21]] ([[User talk:Redsfan21|talk]]) 12:42, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::Hi Redsfan21 and welcome to the Teahouse. A sock puppet is a user who uses multiple account for  improper multiple purpose they often try  attempt to deceive or mislead other editors, disrupt discussions, distort consensus, avoid sanctions, or otherwise violate community standards and policies.

==Removing statements from articles==
According to [[Wikipedia:Perennial proposals#Only allow the truth in articles|Wikipedia:Perennial proposals]], people may not remove well sourced information they believe isn't true. I'm wondering if the reason is because in almost all cases, the editor was wrong and didn't believe the truth and would be removing true information without realizing it. I'm wondering if the same rule applies in cases where it's very clear that if somebody believe's something, it's true and all doubt about it would come from thinking the editor is lying rather than from not believing the truth. For example, if I saw the [[Scarborough RT]] article saying, 'No RT train has ever derailed' then later I saw one derail, could I remove the sentence 'No RT train has ever derailed' and write in the edit summary 'I saw one derail.' I think the rule about [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability]] applies to articles but doesn't apply to edit summaries. [[User:Blackbombchu|Blackbombchu]] ([[User talk:Blackbombchu|talk]]) 17:07, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:No; if the statement that no train has ever derailed is supported by reliable sources, then you should not remove it based on your personal observations, as that would constitute [[WP:OR|original research]], which is prohibited at Wikipedia. Though it may seem silly, what you should do is wait until the train derailment has been reported in reliable sources, then cite those sources when you remove the statement. Otherwise, how can we be sure that you're telling the truth about what you saw?

::It didn't actually happen. I only posed a hypothetical situation because I figured future editors might be in a similar situation and thought it would be useful for them to know whether they are allowed to remove a sentence.

::::In this hypothetical situation, would it be appropriate for the editor to record his personal observations on the Talk page, to make other editors aware that the statement is questionable?  They may spot coverage in media which our hypothetical editor misses. If the evidence becomes stronger, should they perhaps add a "disputed" tag to direct people to the Talk page?  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Gronk Oz|Gronk Oz]] ([[User talk:Gronk Oz|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gronk Oz|contribs]]) 22:55, 30 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:::::I think it's perfectly reasonable to say on a talk page "The article says X, and has good references; but I think it should be Y because ...; does anybody know of any sources which argue against X?"

::::::I will give a very specific example, and it relates to an edit I made to a specific article, [[Black Bear Diner]], only a few minutes ago. There was a statement in that article until my edit that the restaurant chain does not serve alcohol, referenced to a review of their Redmond, Washington location. Last night, we ate at their Vallejo, California location. My wife and son both had a Corona beer, and I had a glass of Chardonnay. So, I just edited the article to say that some locations serve alcoholic beverages while others don't. I think this is a small but legitimate example of "ignore all rules", which is one of the [[WP:5P|Five Pillars of Wikipedia]], and I think that the article (and the encyclopedia) is better for it. I am interested in the thoughts of other editors.

::::::::It depends on what it is. I frequently edit crime articles and I'm constantly arguing over the language to describe someone to be convicted of a crime. I favor language like "this person was convicted of murder" vs. "this person is a murderer" because one can be proven and the other can be debated. Even if the proof is really, really good, there's still that chance that they could be innocent. Like Cullen's example, if your experiences have demonstrated that one source is inaccurate and another source is accurate, I think you can go ahead and use the one you know to be accurate. If there is really no way to verify which is accurate, figure out if you really need it. If you need it for whatever reason, cite both and say the literal truth is unknown. However, if only ''you'' know something to be true and every reliable source says something else, it's probably not right for wikipedia.
