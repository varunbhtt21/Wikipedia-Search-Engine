::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] I was unhappy with the "said to be similar" wording in the proposed hook—see [[WP:WEASEL]] for why this shouldn't be employed on Wikipedia—and even less so when I discovered it stemmed from a sarcastic opinion column, and also that it was solely due to the "land of the brave" wording and nothing else ("land of the free, and home of the brave" in the US anthem). The article's phrasing, "it has been viewed", was another example of weasel words. After editing, the article is down to below 1500 prose characters, and the hook really isn't tenable any more.

:::*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  '''Alt1''' <s>... that "'''[[Namibia, Land of the Brave]]'''" ''(Namibian flag pictured)'' was compared with "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]"?</s> <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<span style="color:red;">The C of E  </span><span style="color:blue;"> God Save the Queen!</span>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<span style="color:darkblue;">talk</span>]])</span> 07:31, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

::::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] ALT1 is not interesting. (Did you really think it was?) The phrase "was compared with" says almost nothing. If there isn't anything sufficiently interesting about the anthem to make a good hook, then perhaps this shouldn't be a DYK. Finding some new interesting facts about it and adding them to the article might point the way to a good hook, and also help with the article's length and breadth, both of which need improvement.

:::::*'''ALT2'''<s> ... that insulting "'''[[Namibia, Land of the Brave]]'''" ''(Namibian flag pictured)'' is liable for five years imprisonment?</s> <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<span style="color:red;">The C of E  </span><span style="color:blue;"> God Save the Queen!</span>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<span style="color:darkblue;">talk</span>]])</span> 06:14, 5 May 2014 (UTC) 

::::::*ALT2 isn't quite accurate, though it has potential. I've modified the article's final section to better reflect the punishments in the act (from FN6). Here's a revised version; let me know what you think:

:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] 5x expansion verified. New enough, long enough, adequately referenced, no close paraphrasing seen. ALT3 hook ref verified and cited inline. QPQ done. ALT3 good to go. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 21:35, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
