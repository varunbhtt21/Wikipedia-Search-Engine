==Career==
Wherley began his military career in 1969 when he received his commission as a [[second lieutenant]] through the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) program at [[Fordham University]]. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from Fordham, and in 1977 gained a [[Master of Business Administration]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].<ref name=NG1/>

After he was released from active duty Wherley served in a number of staff assignments with the National Guard in Maryland, and for a short time deployed as the deputy operations group commander for fighters at [[Prince Sultan Air Base]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]. As a pilot and instructor, he clocked up more than 5,000 hours of flying time over a multitude of missions.<ref name=NG1/>

Wherley gained his first command in 1985 with the [[121st Fighter Squadron]], and went on to command [[201st Airlift Squadron|Detachment 1]] (later to be re-designated 201st Airlift Squadron).<ref name=NG1/>

At the time of the [[9/11 attacks]] in 2001, Wherley was commander of [[113th Wing]], the Guard unit responsible for protecting Washington D.C.. That morning, Wherley ordered his pilots, who did not launch until after the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] attack, to operate [[weapons free]], meaning that they were permitted to shoot at will.<ref name="National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States 2004 364">{{cite book|author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|title=The 9/11 Commission Report|year=2004|publisher=W.W.
