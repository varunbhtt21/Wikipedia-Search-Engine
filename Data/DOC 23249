This article is about a retired judge who served on the Review Panel of the Virginia Tech Massacre, and is listed as being a member of that panel in the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] article. This is textbook WP:BLP1E. "If reliable sources cover the person only in the context of a single event, and if that person otherwise remains, and is likely to remain, a low-profile individual, we should generally avoid having an article on them." There was no news coverage of her participation on the panel, and there are no articles about her with regard to anything else that I can find. &mdash;[[User:D'Ranged 1|D'Ranged&nbsp;1]]&nbsp;[[User talk:D'Ranged 1|<sup>'''talk'''</sup>]] 10:16, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:: I did find one additional article, apparently her daughter and her daughter's boyfriend were shot in the head and the car they were in was set on fire.[http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/02/26/morgan-state-grad-student-found-shot-in-head-in-burning-car/]<!-- {{cite web|title=Morgan State Grad Student & Boyfriend Found Shot In Head In Burning Car|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/02/26/morgan-state-grad-student-found-shot-in-head-in-burning-car/|work=CBS Baltimore|accessdate=May 9, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302065749/http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/02/26/morgan-state-grad-student-found-shot-in-head-in-burning-car|archivedate=March 2, 2013|date=February 26, 2013|deadurl=no}}--> I'm still not in favor of retaining the article; this just makes it ''two'' events instead of one. While she may be notable in her community as a retired judge, she still doesn't seem notable enough for inclusion here, although it is sadly ironic that her own daughter was a victim of gun violence after her mother served on the review panel, but Wikipedia is  not about irony, either. To make matters more fun, the editor who created this article has been blocked from editing since September 11, 2007, for being a sock puppet. The article is currently three sentences long; perhaps I should have just used [[WP:PROD]]. &mdash;[[User:D'Ranged 1|D'Ranged&nbsp;1]]&nbsp;[[User talk:D'Ranged 1|<sup>'''talk'''</sup>]] 08:23, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I agree with nominator. Not really much general notability, short passing mentions aren't enough. Also I would note that all sources in article are dead links--[[User:Staberinde|Staberinde]] ([[User talk:Staberinde|talk]]) 15:22, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
