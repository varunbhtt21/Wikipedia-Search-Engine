Title : Sharenting
Text : '''Sharenting''' (or '''oversharenting''') is the overuse of [[social media]] by parents to share content based on their children, such as baby pictures or details of their children's activities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/18/pros-cons-of-sharenting|title=The pros and cons of 'sharenting'|last=Meakin|first=Nione|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2013-05-17|accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref>  It is related to the concept of "[[wikt:too much information|too much information]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://lancasteronline.com/lifestyle/the-odious-art-of-oversharenting/article_8620e8ec-ec8a-5626-807e-e88f5c200c7a.html|title=The odious art of 'oversharenting'|last=Cassidy|first=Suzanne|work=[[Lancaster Online]]|date=2012-10-14|accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> There is an ongoing debate as to how parents can balance their right to share with their child's interest in privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2711442&download=yes|title=Sharenting: Children's Privacy in the Age of Social Media|last=Steinberg|first=Stacey|date=|website=papers.ssrn.com|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref> Pediatricians are starting to consider how sharenting affects childhood well-being and family life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2613405|title=Parental Sharing on the Internet Child Privacy in the Age of Social Media and the Pediatrician’s Role|last=Keith, B and Steinberg, S|first=|date=|website=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2613405|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331041321/http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2613405|archive-date=2017-03-31|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}</ref>

== History ==
It has been stated that ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' created the term,<ref name=asia>{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Science%2Band%2BTech/Story/A1Story20130311-407754.html|title=Share with care|last=Yap|first=Eve|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=2013-03-12|accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref> where they called it "oversharenting", a combination of "over-sharing" and "parenting".  The practice stems from the connected nature of social media early-adopters, who are comfortable sharing their lives online.  When they had children, they began to share large numbers of pictures online.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577392041180138910?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304451104577392041180138910.html|title=The Facebook-Free Baby|last=Leckart|first=Steven|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2012-05-12|accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref>  It has since been the focus of a number of articles on the subject and was one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s words of the day in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/02/06/words-of-the-week-new-jersey-jughandles-oversharenting-and-more/|title=Words of the Week: New Jersey ‘Jughandles,’ Oversharenting and More|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2013-02-06|accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>

== Popularity ==
The popularity of sharing baby pictures has resulted in a backlash that includes anti-sharenting sites and apps that block the pictures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/are-you-guilty-of-oversharenting-20130701-2p74h.html|title=Are you guilty of oversharenting?|last=Smith|first=Sandy|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2013-07-03|accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref>  The blog STFU Parents was founded in 2009 to lampoon parents' over-sharing on social media.  The site itself became controversial for what parents said was taking posts out of context.  Parents also stated that the communities dedicated to sharenting found the content useful, even if it was ridiculed as pointless by other communities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2012/10/stfu-parents-blogger-defends-her-lampooning-of-oversharing/|title=STFU Parents Blogger Defends Her Lampooning of Oversharing|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[ABC News]]|date=2012-10-05|accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref>  [[Fisher-Price]] conducted a survey in Australia that found that 90% of Australian parents admitted to over-sharing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/could-you-be-over-sharenting/story-fnet08ui-1226664884805|title=Could you be over sharenting?|last=Baker|first=Fiona|work=[[News.com.au]]|date=2013-06-15|accessdate=2014-05-07}}</ref>  [[Eircom]] conducted a survey in Ireland that found that while the practice was widespread, only 5% of Irish parents claimed to be sharenters.  About three-quarters (74%) of parents who use social media say they have seen another parent "oversharent", according to a 2015 [[University of Michigan]] [[C.S. Mott Children's Hospital]] National Poll on Children's Health.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Parents on social media: Likes and dislikes of sharenting|journal=C.S.

== Risks ==
In extreme forms, parental sharing of their children's information has led to a phenomenon labeled "digital kidnapping", whereby children's photos and details have been appropriated by others who promote such kids as being their own children.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/mom-my-son-was-digitally-kidnapped-what-112545291567.html|title=The Disturbing Facebook Trend of Stolen Kids Photos|last=O'Neill|first=Jennifer|work=Yahoo Parenting|date=2015-03-03|accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref> Research has shown that millions of innocent photographs, end up on paedophilic and [[Hebephilia|hebephilic]] websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/paedophile-websites-steal-half-their-photos-from-social-media-sites-like-facebook-a6673191.html|title=Paedophile websites steal half their photos from social media sites like Facebook|author=Victoria Richards|date=30 September 2015|work=The Independent}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
The ''Wall Street Journal'' quoted psychiatry professor Elias Aboujaoude, who said that sharenting can turn parenthood into a competition for attention.<ref name=wsj/>  The practice has also been linked to online predators, who could use the information for [[child grooming]].<ref name=asia/>  Children's self-esteem can be affected by negative online reactions,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/01/are-you-guilty-of-oversharenting-why-we-owe-our-kids-online-privacy/|title=Are You Guilty of ‘Oversharenting’?
