:({{Find sources|New Life Christian Center}})
A few months ago I proposed deletion (PROD), giving as the reason "Still unsourced after being tagged for over 5 years, and searches fail to produce any significant independent coverage." An editor removed the PROD, and added references to the New Life Christian Center's own web site, YouTube, and a copy of the New Life Christian Center's calendar. However, the article still has no references to independent sources, and it still remains true that there is no sign of significant independent coverage anywhere, as far as my searches can find. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 10:44, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' for now. I've just spent a rather unconstructive few minutes Googling "New Life Christian Center", only to discover what a common name for a church it is. I've also watched one of the church's videos, which left me feeling quite queasy. However, what I haven't been able to find is any independent media coverage of this organisation. It is, clearly, a thriving and highly profitable business, but in the absence of any references other than their own websites and publicity I think it has to go. If better sources of information subsequently become available, it will be easy to re-create this article at that time.

*'''Keep''' -- This is a bad article, but if correctly classified (in the infobox) as a megachurch it ought to be notable.  [[User:Peterkingiron|Peterkingiron]] ([[User talk:Peterkingiron|talk]]) 17:06, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
