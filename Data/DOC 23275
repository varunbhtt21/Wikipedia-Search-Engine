:({{Find sources|Prakhar Bindal}})
Restored as a contested PROD so bringing this to AfD with the same rationale after over two weeks without significant improvement.  No evidence of passing the notability criteria for biographies. Apart from brief mentions/quotes in 4 articles, the remaining sources are self-published profiles. The company of which he is CEO and apparently sole owner is a 2 year old start-up with no significant coverage either, despite rather extravagant claims in some of his profiles. He may eventually become a notable business figure, but is not now. The current article is considerably shorter than the original. The material was removed as copyvio from the subject's LinkedIn profile. Analysis of refs (note that I have been unable to find any better ones):
#"Out fo the Box". [[The Telegraph (Calcutta)]] quoting 4 business ideas (one of which was by Bindal) pitched at a young entrepreneur meet-up. 
#"Prakhar Bindal". [[Entrepreneur (magazine)]].  Self-published profile on the social networking sub-site of the magazine, '''not an article about him'''
#"Risks & dividends". [[The Statesman]] (India).  Brief article under Campus news about a conference for students at the [[Indian Institute of Management]]  (IIM) Calcutta where Bindal is a student. Sole mention: "Prakhar Bindal enlightened the students with the do’s and don’ts of entrepreneurship. Urging them to pursue ideas he also asked them to refrain from selling a service that they might not approve of."
#"About Prakhar Bindal". Silicon India. Self-published profile.
#"Leveraging social media for stock market info". [[Business Line]] (India). The writers are 4 students from the class of 2014, IIM Calcutta. One of them is Bindal who is quoted in a 3 sentence segment on the subject.
#"IIM Calcutta to host its 7th annual International Entrepreneurship Summit". [[Daily Bhaskar]]. Press release-based announcement of same conference in 3. Sole mention: "Prakhar Bindal (Director & Talk Architect of IES), Deep Patel (President of IIMC E-Cell) and Sameer Sawale (Events Head of IIMC E-Cell), the second year students of "IIM Calcutta, have left no stone unturned to make IES 7 the biggest ever..."
#"About Prakhar Bindal". [[BITS Pilani]]. Self-published profile
