*'''Comment''' - If someone has the patience, I'm about 99% sure we can get a larger version of this painting from the Rijkmuseum's website.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 00:36, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*:This version was already downloaded from the website of the Rijksmuseum. Do you mean you have requested a better version? – Editør ([[User talk:Editør|talk]]) 17:54, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*::The version they offer for download is smaller than the largest version which they have (maximum zoom). Check out our version of [[:File:Raden Saleh.jpg]]; last I checked, it's considerably higher resolution than what the Rijkmuseum offers for direct download. It just takes a heck of a long time (have to download the individual tiles, then stitch them in GIMP).&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 01:30, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*:::Thanks, now I understand what you mean. But until the stitched image is available, I don't see a reason not to vote on this version. – Editør ([[User talk:Editør|talk]]) 07:47, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Is the original so dark on left side? [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 15:03, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*:Yes, as you can see on these snapshots: [http://nippaku.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc04982.jpg] [http://www.mennomail.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2.png]. – Editør ([[User talk:Editør|talk]]) 17:56, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
