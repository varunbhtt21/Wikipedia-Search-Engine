*'''Delete''' unless/until properly sourced.  Each time I Google for her connection to something, the main result is this article, and the others are self-published, or otherwise useless.  --[[User:Thivierr|Rob]] ([[User talk:Thivierr|talk]]) 20:20, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment:''' I've just noticed that Gibbons used to be a member of [[Un-Cut]], which had a top forty hit. Therefore, this article should really be redirected.--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 19:51, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
