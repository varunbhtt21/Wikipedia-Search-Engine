Title : Lucrezia Borgia (play)
Text : {{italic title}}
'''''Lucrezia Borgia''''' ({{lang-fr|Lucrèce Borgia}}) is an 1833 play by the French writer [[Victor Hugo]]. It is a [[History (theatrical genre)|historical work]] portraying the [[Renaissance]]-era Italian aristocrat [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. The play (along with ''[[Angelo, Tyrant of Padua]]'') is believed to have been a major influence on [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Padua]]'' (1891).<ref>Kohl p.46</ref> 

==Adaptations==
The opera ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' composed by [[Gaetano Donizetti]] had a [[libretto]] by [[Felice Romani]] which was based on Hugo's play. Several films about Borgia and her family have drawn partly on the plot of the play.
