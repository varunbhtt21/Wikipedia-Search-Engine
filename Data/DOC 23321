==History==
A {{RailGauge|1000mm}} wide [[metre gauge]] line from Marwar Junction to Pali was built by the Rajputana Railway in 1882. It was extended to Luni in 1884 and Jodhpur in 1885. It formed the first Jodhpur Railway. It later became part of Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.wiki.fibis.org/index.php?title=Jodhpur-Bikaner_Railway|title = Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway| publisher= fibis| accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=irfcaii>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history2.html |title = IR History: Part II (1870-1899)| publisher=IRFCA | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref>
 
A metre gauge line from Luni to Shadipalli, in Sind, was built across the [[Thar desert]] in 1902 by Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway and the line from Shadipalli to Hyderabad (now in Pakistan) was regauged.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history3.html|title = IR History: Part III (1900-1947)| publisher=IRFCA | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref>

The Luni-Barmer-Munabao section was converted to {{RailGauge|1676mm|allk=on}} wide [[broad gauge]] in 2004.<ref name=geography>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-inter.html  |title = Geography:International| publisher=IRFCA | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref> The Jodhpur-Luni-Marwar Junction section was converted to broad gauge in early 2000s.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nwr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/1308229227325-OVERVIEW.pdf |title = Overview of Jodhpur Division: Historical Perspective| publisher= North Western Railway| accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref>

==Border crossing==
According to a 1929 issue of the Railway Gazette, the Sind Mail used to run on this route between Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, Sind. The route was in use with through services between Jodhpur and Karachi till around 1965. On the Pakistan side, [[Khokhrapar]] was the terminus of a branch line from Hyderabad, Sind via Mirpur Khas, 135&nbsp;km from the border.<ref name=geography/>

The rail link across Munabao-Khokhrapar border was restored in 2006. It reduced considerably the travel distance and time for people travelling to and from southern parts of Pakistan, particularly [[Muhajir people|Mohajirs]] in Sind, and central and southern India. They otherwise would have had to use the longer route via Wagah-Attari.  As per the agreement between Indian and Pakistan railways, the [[Thar Express]] travels once a week from Karachi during a six-month block, crosses the international border, and the passengers change over to an Indian train at Munabao for their onward journey to Jodhpur.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article931198.ece |title = Thar Express survives ‘terror attack’| first= Mohammed|last= Iqbal| publisher=The Hindu, 5 December 2010 | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref> Service on the Munabao-Khokhrapar link of the India-Pakistan border was suspended on 24 August 2006 following incessant rain and water-logging on the Indian side and restored on 17 February 2007. Pakistan Railways have set up a new railway station at [[Zero Point railway station|Zero Point]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history7.html |title = IR History: Part VII (2000-present)| publisher=IRFCA | accessdate = 30 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =  http://208.112.102.150/PrintEdition.aspx?ID=4700&Cat=13&dt=12/11/2006| archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20140313154151/http://208.112.102.150/PrintEdition.aspx?ID=4700&Cat=13&dt=12/11/2006| dead-url =  yes| archive-date =  13 March 2014| title =  Khokhrapar station to be operational soon| publisher =  The News, 12 December 2006| accessdate =  30 April 2014}}</ref>
