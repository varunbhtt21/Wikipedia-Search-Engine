Lees-Jones was an expert on the stamps of Canada and plated the early issues, particularly the 12½c of 1859. In 1936 he gave to the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]] a collection of Canada 1897-1936 in mint blocks of four with plate numbers. In 1951 he won that society's [[Tilleard Medal]] for his display of Papermakers' Watermarks. That collection was auctioned by HR Harmer Ltd in 1952. His Canadian stamps were shown, ''hors concours'', at the [[London International Stamp Exhibition 1960]]. He was President of the Canadian Philatelic Society.<ref name=abps/>
