==History==
The [[Lords Blantyre]] came into ownership of the Erskine Estate and Erskine House during the early 18th century. In 1828 Major General Robert W. Stuart, the 11th Lord Blantyre commissioned the present house. The latest Erskine House was constructed between 1828–45 at a cost of £50,000.<ref name="rememberingscotlandatwar1"/> It was designed by [[Sir Robert Smirke]], the architect of the [[British Museum]]. [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] designed the fountain & garden lay-out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/43262/details/erskine+house/|title=Site Record for Erskine Hospital & War Memorial|publisher=Canmore.rcahms.gov.uk |date=1951-02-27 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref> A nearby quarry (now disused) provided the stone required for construction. The oak interior was imported from [[Quebec]], Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst11967.html |title=Overview of Mar Hall |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> The building lay empty as the peerage of the Lords Blantyre ended in 1900. It was then renovated and opened as the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers in 1916. This was to treat soldiers returning from the [[First World War]].<ref name="rememberingscotlandatwar1"/><ref name="clydewaterfront1"/> A nearby monument commemorates the original owner of Erskine House. It is called [[Blantyre Monument]].

==Hotel==
A £15m re-fit converted the building into a 5-star hotel which opened in 2004. The official name of the hotel is Earl of Mar; however, locally it is known as Mar Hall. The name recalls the Erskine Estate’s former ownership by the [[Earl of Mar]]. The hotel has a swimming pool, gym and 18-hole golf course which hosts [[Pro-Am]] tournaments throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europro.bluegolf.com/bluegolf/europro12/event/europro1232/index.htm |title=MarHall.com Scottish Classic Pro-Am Tournament Information Page |publisher=Europro.bluegolf.com |date=7 August 2012 |accessdate=20 June 2014}}</ref>
