The '''South African National Defence Union''' ('''SANDU''') is a [[South Africa]]n [[trade union]] for [[South African National Defence Force|SANDF]] members. It is not affiliated to any trade union federation as state by COSATU. Military trade Unions in South Africa are by law not allowed to affiliate. SANDU is apolitical.

In April 2016, after the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] found that [[Jacob Zuma|President Zuma]] had failed to uphold the country's constitution, and Zuma responded with only an apology, the union backed mass action to remove the president.<ref name="iol_mass">{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/defence-union-backs-mass-action-for-zumas-removal-2004368 | title=Defence union backs mass action for Zumaâ€™s removal | publisher=Independent Online | accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>
