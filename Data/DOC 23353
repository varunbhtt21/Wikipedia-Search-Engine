Title : Marie Tudor
Text : {{italic title}}
'''''Marie Tudor''''' is an 1833 play by the French writer [[Victor Hugo]]. It is a [[History (theatrical genre)|historical work]] portraying the rise, fall and execution of Fabiano Fabiani, a fictional [[royal favourite|favourite]] of [[Mary I of England]] (1516-1558). Mary has Fabiani thrown in the [[Tower of London]] and despite later wishing to spare his life, is unable to do so. This was an influence on [[Oscar Wilde]]'s later ''[[The Duchess of Padua]]''.<ref>Kohl p.46</ref>

==Adaptations==
The play was adapted into an opera at least twice. J. V. Bridgeman adapted it in English for [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]]'s ''[[The Armourer of Nantes]]'' (1863). [[Emilio Praga]] adapted it in Italian for ''[[Maria Tudor]]'' (1879) composed by [[Ant√¥nio Carlos Gomes]].<ref>Jones, Barrie (ed.) (2014).

The play has also been made into films. In 1912 [[Albert Capellani]] directed ''[[Marie Tudor (1912 film)|Marie Tudor]]'', a silent film version of the play. A 1966 French television film ''[[Marie Tudor (1966 film)|Marie Tudor]]'' was also made, directed by [[Abel Gance]].<ref>Parill & Robison p.143-44</ref> A 1911 Italian film, ''[[Mary Tudor (1911 film)|Mary Tudor]]'', might also have been based on the play.
