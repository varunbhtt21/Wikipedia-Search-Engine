'''Arkwright House''' is in Stoneygate, [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancashire]], England.  The house was built in 1728, and was later expanded and restored.  It is notable as the place in which [[Richard Arkwright]] and colleagues worked in 1768 to develop the [[water frame]], a machine for spinning yarn.  The house is an example of [[Georgian architecture]], and is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].

==History==

The house was built in 1728.<ref name=nhl>{{NHLE |num= 1279775|desc= Arkwright House |access-date=1 May 2014|mode=cs2}}</ref> It was the home of Revd Ellis Henry, who was the headmaster of the Free Grammar School in Stoneygate, and in 1768 Richard Arkwright was a lodger in the house.  Arkwright was obsessed with the idea of creating a machine to spin yarn mechanically.  During the time he was living in the house he worked with [[Thomas Highs]] and [[John Kay (spinning frame)|John Kay]] to develop a machine to do this.  Their work was carried out in secrecy, the landlord thinking that they were working on a machine to measure the [[longitude]].  However it resulted in a machine known as the water frame, and this was patented in 1769.{{sfnp|Hunt|1992|pp=141–143|ps=}}  The historian David Hunt argues that this makes Arkwright House one of the birthplaces of the [[Industrial Revolution]].{{sfnp|Hunt|1992|p=142|ps=}}  The house was extended in the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name=nhl/> A photograph taken in 1946 shows it with an inscription reading "ARKWRIGHT ARMS HOSTEL".{{sfnp|Hunt|1992|p=142|ps=}}  The house was altered and renovated in about 1979.<ref name=nhl/>The current owners are Age Concern Central Lancashire who support and deliver services to older people in and around Lancashire.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Architecture==

Arkwright House is built in brick, and has a partly [[stucco]]ed façade and a [[slate]] roof.  It is in early Georgian style, and has an L-shaped plan consisting of a front range, a rear wing, and the 19th-century extension to the right.  The house is in three storeys with an attic and cellar, and has a symmetrical five-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] front, plus a two-bay extension.  The doorway has a wooden [[architrave]] with a [[pediment]] and a [[fanlight]].  The extension contains a shop window in the ground floor; the other windows are [[sash window|sashes]].<ref name=nhl/>

==Appraisal==

Arkwright House was designated as a Grade II* listed historic building on 12 June 1950.<ref name=nhl/> Grade&nbsp;II* is the middle of the three grades of listing and is applied to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/| title = Listed Buildings| accessdate =22 March 2015| publisher = Historic England}}</ref> Hartwell and [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] in the ''[[Buildings of England]]'' series comment that the house has been "over-restored".{{sfnp|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|p=530|ps=}}
