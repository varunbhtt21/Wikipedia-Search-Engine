The 2013–14 season was also the first season for San Jose State in the Mountain West Conference.

Among the penalties: a post-season ban (including from the MWC Tournament) for the 2014–15 season, replacing four hours of weekly practice with four hours of academic activities, and five days instead of six of basketball activities.<ref name="APR sanctions">{{cite web|title=Men's Basketball Will Incur Anticipated NCAA APR Sanctions For 2014-15|url=http://www.sjsuspartans.com/genrel/040114aaa.html|publisher=San Jose State Athletics|accessdate=March 14, 2015|date=April 1, 2014}}</ref> Responding to the sanctions, Wojcik stated: "The team recorded its highest grade-point average ever in the 2013 Fall semester.

Three players suffered season-ending injuries early in the season.<ref name="kicked off team"/> Wojcik announced on December 13, 2014 that five players were suspended indefinitely due to violating team rules; as a result, two members of the San Jose State football team joined the roster temporarily.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Durkin|first1=Jimmy|title=Football players become basketball players for San Jose State|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_27135485/football-players-become-basketball-players-san-jose-state|website=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=March 14, 2015|date=December 14, 2014}}</ref> Five days later, associate head coach Chris Brazelton was placed on paid administrative leave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Durkin|first1=Jimmy|title=San Jose State places assistant basketball coach on administrative leave|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_27165370/san-jose-state-places-assistant-basketball-coach-administrative|website=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=March 14, 2015|date=December 18, 2014}}</ref> Ultimately, two of the suspended players, Rashad Muhammad and Jaleel Williams, were reinstated on January 3, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Durkin|first1=Jimmy|title=San Jose State men fall to Wyoming|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_27254568/san-jose-state-men-fall-wyoming|website=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=March 14, 2015|date=January 3, 2015}}</ref> Two other suspended players were dismissed from the team, and another transferred.<ref name="kicked off team">{{cite web|last1=Durkin|first1=Jimmy|title=Two San Jose State basketball players kicked off team|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_27300829/two-san-jose-state-basketball-players-kicked-off|website=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=March 14, 2015|date=January 12, 2015}}</ref>

In 2015–16, San Jose State improved to a 9–22 (4–14 MW) record that included home wins over eventual conference tournament champion [[2015–16 Fresno State Bulldogs men's basketball team|Fresno State]] and defending conference regular season champion [[2015–16 Boise State Broncos men's basketball team|Boise State]].

In [[2016–17 San Jose State Spartans men's basketball team|2016-17]], Wojcik led the Spartans to the first round in the [[2017 Mountain West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]] where they lost to [[2016–17 Utah State Aggies men's basketball team|Utah State]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]]. The Spartans finished the season 14–16; and 7–11 in conference play for 8th place in the regular season. Wojcik lead the Spartans to victories such as, but not limited to: [[2016–17 San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team|San Diego State]], at [[2016–17 Washington State Cougars men's basketball team|Washington State]], and a sweep against [[2016–17 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]].
