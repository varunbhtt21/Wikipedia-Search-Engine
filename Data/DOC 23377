Procedural AfD, since the article was PRODed and contested. I am somewhat neutral on notability. He could maybe satisfy [[WP:PROF]] C6, if the Institute for Basic Science is deemed a "major academic institution". Due to the inconsistent way citation databases treat Korean names, finding a citation track record is very hard. What worries me is that some of the claims to fame previously listed in the article appear to have been blatantly false.[[User:TimothyRias|T]][[User talk:TimothyRias|R]] 12:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC) [[User:TimothyRias|T]][[User talk:TimothyRias|R]] 12:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Difficult, as one doesn't know what name he published under and cites can be assessed. Until then '''Delete'''. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 03:31, 3 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Delete'''. Searching finds no evidence of passing [[WP:PROF]]. Negligible citations and nothing else notable. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.89.99|101.117.89.99]] ([[User talk:101.117.89.99|talk]]) 06:48, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak delete'''. He has some quite highly cited papers (e.g. 854 Google scholar cites for "Observation of reactor electron antineutrinos disappearance in the RENO experiment", 203 for "Limits on WIMP-nucleon interactions with CsI(Tl) crystal detectors", and 186 for "The MSU Miniball 4π fragment detection array") but these are articles with many researchers (34, 28, and 14 respectively) and his name appears in a non-distinguished place in them, so it is difficult to tell how much if any impact we can credit him with. The only high-impact citation with him as first author that I found was 147 cites for "Intermediate mass fragment emission in Ar 36+ 197 Au collisions at E/A= 35 MeV". I don't think that's enough to make a clear case for [[WP:PROF#C1]] and I don't see another notability criterion for him to pass in its place. But there are a lot of papers by "Y.D. Kim" only some of which are his so I could easily have missed some in my search. In any case we need enough sources about the subject but not by him to form the basis of an encyclopedia article, and I don't see those either. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 23:12, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak delete'''. Seems to be failing [[WP:PROF]], no-one is able to argue otherwise so far.--<sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]]&#124;[[User talk:Piotrus|<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> reply here</font>]]</sub> 04:14, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
