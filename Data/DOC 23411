*[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] Article was created on April 10, but not nominated until May 2. DYK nominations are supposed to be made within five days of creation or 5x expansion, but this is twenty-two days after, and doesn't come remotely close to qualifying. Closing this as far too late for DYK consideration. Note to nominator: if the article ever becomes a [[WP:Good Article|Good Article]], it can be nominated for DYK within five days of its listing as a GA.
