The '''Silver Lake Farm''' is a historic farmstead on Seaver Road in northwestern [[Harrisville, New Hampshire]].  It consists of a traditional New England farm complex, with a clapboarded farmhouse that was built c. 1820, a poultry shed, two early 20th-century barns, and a modern tractor shed.  It is sited on a meadow (former farmland now out of production) above [[Silver Lake (Harrisville, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]], from which there are views of the lake and of [[Mount Monadnock]].  The farm was originally established by Paul Whitcomb Breed, whose family gave the lake its early name (Breed Pond).  It was later owned by the Farwells and Seavers.  Despite its active use until the 1970s, the farmhouse remained relatively unaltered, lacking even modern heating.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=86003252}}|title=NRHP nomination for Silver Lake Farm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>

The farmstead was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name="nris"/>
