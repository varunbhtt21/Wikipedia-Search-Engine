|Source = http://foerdefluesterer.de/mediashare/ls/q1rv3uvno96yudo9gh0ak1275ix3oe-pre.jpg
|Date = 2010
|Author = Nolwenn Leroy
|Article = Bretonne (album)
|Purpose = to serve as the primary means of visual identification at the top of the article dedicated to the work in question.
|Replaceability = n.a.
|Minimality = The entire cover: because the image is cover art, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image. 
The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original cover. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable as artwork on pirate versions or other uses that would compete with the commercial purpose of the original artwork.
|Commercial = n.a.
