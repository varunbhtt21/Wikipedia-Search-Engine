Title : Ernst Haffner
Text : {{Orphan|date=June 2014}}

'''Ernst Haffner''' was a German social worker, journalist, and novelist whose only known novel, ''Blood Brothers'', originally titled “Jugend auf der Landstrasse Berlin” (“Youth on the Road to Berlin”), was published in 1932 to critical acclaim by [[Bruno Cassirer]] and banned by the Nazis one year later. Sometime over the course of World War II, all traces of Haffner were lost, including any professional and personal records that may have helped to indicate what led to his disappearance. There is just a single entry for him in the Berlin registry, where Haffner lived between 1925 and 1933. At the end of the 1930s, it is documented that he was summoned to appear at the Nazi ''Reichsschrifttumskammer'' (a writer’s union affiliated with the Third Reich), after which the details of his life remain unknown.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Gritty Weimar Portrait of Youth Gangs, Restored to Renewed Acclaim |newspaper=The New York Times |first=William |last=Grimes |date=13 February 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/books/a-gritty-weimar-portrait-of-youth-gangs-restored-to-renewed-acclaim.html|access-date=2015-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=German publishing sensation haunted by riddle of vanished author  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/german-publishing-blutsbruder-riddle-vanished-author |date=3 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2015-02-14|first=Philip|last=Oltermann}}</ref>
