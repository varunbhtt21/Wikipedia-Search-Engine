The '''Nibbia Chapel''' ({{lang-mt|Il-Kappella ta' Nibbia}}) was a [[Roman Catholic]] chapel in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], which was dedicated to [[Virgin of Mercy|Our Lady of Mercy]]. It was originally built in 1619 by Fra Giorgio Nibbia, a knight of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], and it was located near a cemetery where deceased patients from the nearby [[Sacra Infermeria]] were buried.

The chapel was rebuilt in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style in 1731. In 1852 its crypt was decorated with skeletal human remains taken from the adjacent cemetery, giving rise to the name '''Chapel of Bones''' ({{lang-mt|Il-Kappella tal-Għadam}}). The chapel was heavily damaged by aerial bombardment in 1941, and its ruins were subsequently demolished, leaving only some foundations on the site. However, the crypt might still survive intact.

==History==
The Nibbia Chapel was built in 1619 with funds of the knight Fra Giorgio Nibbia, who was buried there upon his death.<ref name="oneworld"/> The chapel was dedicated to [[Virgin of Mercy|Our Lady of Mercy]] (or the [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Madonna della Pietà]]),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ciantar|first1=Giovannantonio|title=Malta Illustrata|date=1780|location=[[Malta]]|page=343|url=https://books.google.com/?id=onxb8mja88kC&pg=PA343&lpg=PA343&q=nibbia#v=snippet&q=nibbia&f=false|language=Italian}}</ref> and it stood next to a cemetery where patients who had died at the [[Sacra Infermeria]] were buried.<ref name="times2012-08-10"/> It was used mainly to celebrate mass for the souls of these patients.<ref name="fionavella">{{cite news|last1=Vella|first1=Fiona|title=Arti bl-għadam uman|url=http://fionavella.com/features/2010/06/arti-bl-ghadam-uman/|work=It-Torċa|date=27 June 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6k0WPbRx9|archivedate=24 August 2016}}</ref> The chapel was commonly referred to as ''ta' Nibbia'' after the knight who built it, but it was also called ''taz-zuntier'', a Maltese word which formerly meant "cemetery".<ref name="times2012-08-10"/>

In 1852, chaplain of the hospital Rev. Sacco decided to decorate the crypt with human remains from the cemetery. It therefore became known as the ''Chapel of Bones'', and by the early 20th century it had become an attraction for both the Maltese and tourists, being featured on a number of postcards.<ref name="fionavella"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bonello|first=Giovanni|date=2010|title=Nostalgias of Malta: images by Modiano from the 1900s|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonu Malti|isbn=9789993273165|oclc=696296725|page=54}}</ref> Over the years, local tradition held that the bones in the crypt did not belong to Sacra Infermeria patients, but to soldiers who had died during the [[Great Siege of Malta]] in 1565.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cassar Pullicino|first1=Joseph|title=The Order of St. John in Maltese folk-memory|journal=Scientia|date=October–December 1949|volume=15|issue=4|page=154|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2015(1949)4(Oct.-Dec.)/01.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417173522/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2015(1949)4(Oct.-Dec.)/01.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2016}}</ref>

Saint [[George Preca]] held conferences about [[Christian eschatology]] within this chapel. Several pilgrimages were held at the chapel, especially during the month of November.<ref name="fionavella"/>

The chapel was damaged by aerial bombardment on 14 February 1941, during [[World War II]]. Some human remains were apparently collected and buried at the [[Addolorata Cemetery]],<ref name="fionavella"/> although the crypt might still survive intact. The chapel's ruins were demolished in the late 1970s, leaving only a few remains on the site.<ref name="times2012-08-10"/>

The remains of the chapel, which include Nibbia's sarcophagus, are now found in a cordoned area in the car park of Evans Building.<ref name="oneworld"/><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Malta Medical Journal|last=Bonello|first=Giovanni|date=October 2006|title=Petitions by Medical Practitioners: 1632-1732|url=http://www.um.edu.mt/umms/mmj/PDF/150.pdf|publisher=University of Malta|volume=18|issue=3|page=40|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230101118/http://www.um.edu.mt/umms/mmj/PDF/150.pdf|archive-date=30 December 2017}}</ref> The ruins were given a facelift by the Archaeological Services Cooperative and the Grupp Arkeologiku Malti (Maltese Archeology Group) in 2002,<ref>{{cite news|title=Chapel remains being restored|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20020916/local/chapel-remains-being-restored.167133|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=16 September 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322165941/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20020916/local/chapel-remains-being-restored.167133|archivedate=22 March 2016}}</ref> but they have since fallen into a state of disrepair.<ref name="times2012-08-10">{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=State of Nibbia chapel ruins|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120810/letters/State-of-Nibbia-chapel-ruins.432250|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=10 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235654/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120810/letters/State-of-Nibbia-chapel-ruins.432250|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref> These remains were scheduled as a Class B national monument by the [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] in 2008.<ref name="oneworld">{{cite news|title=One World – Protecting the most significant buildings, monuments and features of Valletta (109)|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090421/opinion/one-world-protecting-the-most-significant-buildings-monuments-and.253697|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=21 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824174454/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090421/opinion/one-world-protecting-the-most-significant-buildings-monuments-and.253697|archivedate=24 August 2016}}</ref>

==Architecture==
The Nibbia Chapel was an octagonal building with a dome. The façade had a large portal with the main doorway, which was flanked by two sets of [[Doric order|Doric]] pilasters on either side. The door had an [[architrave]] with a marble plaque, which was topped by a broken rounded [[pediment]]. The upper section had a central arched window between small clusters of pilasters and running scrolls, and it was separated from the lower half of the structure by a thin [[cornice]]. Another triangular pediment topped the building.<ref name="oneworld"/>

===Crypt===
[[File:Six and one abroad (1914) (14597842289).jpg|thumb|The Chapel of Bones]]

The chapel had a vaulted underground [[crypt]] which served as an [[ossuary]]. Skeletal remains of patients who had died at the [[Sacra Infermeria]] were arranged in decorative patterns on the walls, and the crypt therefore became popularly known as the ''Chapel of Bones''. The crypt had one altar, which had a Latin inscription lamenting the [[ephemerality]] of life and requesting prayers for the deceased.<ref name="oneworld"/>

The exact location of the crypt has been lost, and it could have been either under the chapel itself or in the immediate vicinity. Although the chapel was destroyed during the World War II bombings, the crypt might still exist.<ref name="oneworld"/>
