===Maine Green Line===
On December 9, 2014, Anbaric and [[National Grid plc|National Grid]] announced the formation of [http://www.greenlineinfrastructurealliance.com Green Line Infrastructure Alliance].<ref>National Grid Press Release  http://www.nationalgridus.com/aboutus/a3-1_news2.asp?document=9003 | Retrieved December 9, 2014</ref> The Alliance aims to provide benefits to New England's energy consumers by providing consumers with access to large-scale, cost-effective sources of renewable and zero-emission energy; diversifying the region’s energy portfolio, thereby easing the constraints on the natural gas pipeline system and providing access to affordable clean energy; enabling the New England states to meet all current clean energy targets by 2020 at affordable prices and enhancing the reliability and resilience of the region’s power grid.

The Alliance's first project will be Maine Green Line, a hybrid land-and-sea HVDC project that will initially deliver 1,000MW of wind from northern Maine, firmed up by imports of hydropower from eastern Canada, via a submarine cable to Massachusetts.  Maine-based constructor Cianbro Development Corporation will be a part of this project. Connecticut-based PowerBridge has been part of the Maine Green Line Development team.
