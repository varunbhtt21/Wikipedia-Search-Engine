Houston is a diverse and international city, in part because of its many academic institutions and strong biomedical, energy, manufacturing and aerospace industries. According to the U.S. Census 2000, the racial makeup of the city was 49.3% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]] (including Hispanic or Latino), 25.3% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.4% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 5.3% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.1&% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 16.5% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.2% from [[Multiracial|two or more races]]. 37% of the population was [[Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.

By 2010 Houston had significant numbers of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], [[Chinese Americans]], and [[Indian Americans]], as well as the second-largest [[Vietnamese-American]] population of any U.S. city. Houston became a "majority-minority" city (one where the non-Hispanic White population is smaller than the minority groups combined) in the 1990s, and by 2000 [[Greater Houston]] became majority-minority.<ref>Strait, John B ; Gong, Gang.

Strait and Gang Gong, authors of the article "Ethnic Diversity in Houston, Texas: The Evolution of Residential Segregation in the Bayou City, 1990–2000," wrote that in the 1990s, the minority groups of Houston became more integrated with one another but more segregated from whites. Hispanics integrated with other groups more because the overall number of Hispanics in Greater Houston increased. Many Asians moved into neighborhoods with other Asians, and blacks and Hispanics moved into neighborhoods which Whites were leaving.<ref>Strait, John B ; Gong, Gang. "Ethnic Diversity in Houston, Texas: The Evolution of Residential Segregation in the Bayou City, 1990–2000." ''[[Population Review]]'', 2010, Vol.49(1). cited: p. 64. "First, during the 1990s all non-white populations in Houston became increasingly segregated from and less residentially exposed to whites, while becoming more integrated with one another.[...]"</ref>

The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' stated, in regards to the 2000 census data, that the racial and ethnic diversity in Houston and Greater Houston increases further from the center of the city.<ref>Gardner, David.

The Hispanic population in Houston is increasing as more immigrants from [[Latin America]]n countries come to  work in the area. As of 2006 the city has the third-largest Hispanic population in the United States. As of the same year Karl Eschbach, a [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] demographer, said that the number of [[illegal immigration|illegal aliens]] in the Houston area was estimated at about 400,000, with over 70% being of Mexican descent.<ref>Hegstrom, Edward.

As of 2011, the city is 44% Hispanic. As of 2011, of the city's [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]] that are Hispanic, half are at voting age or older. Many Hispanics in Houston are not U.S. citizens, especially those living in [[Gulfton]] and [[Spring Branch, Houston|Spring Branch]]. As a result, Hispanics have proportionally less representation in the municipal government than other ethnic groups. As of April 2011 two of the [[Houston City Council]] members are Hispanic, making up 18% of the council.<ref>Casey, Rick.

As of 2010, Strait and Gong, authors of "Ethnic Diversity in Houston, Texas: The Evolution of Residential Segregation in the Bayou City, 1990–2000," stated that Hispanics and Latinos had "intermediate levels of segregation" from non-Hispanic whites.<ref name=StraitGongp58>Strait, John B ; Gong, Gang.

In the early 1980s, there were 300,000 native Hispanics, and an estimated 80,000 [[illegal immigrants]] from Mexico in Houston.<ref name=RodriguezJournalp4>Rodriguez, Nestor, "Undocumented Central Americans in Houston: Diverse Populations," p. 4.</ref>

In 1985, Harris County had about 500,000 Hispanics. Eschbach said that, historically, Hispanics resided in specific neighborhoods of Houston, such as [[Denver Harbor]], the [[Houston Heights]], [[Magnolia Park, Houston|Magnolia Park]], and the [[Northside, Houston|Northside]]. Between 1985 and 2005, the county's Hispanic population tripled, with Hispanics making up about 40%<!--two in five--> of the county's residents. In most communities inside and outside [[Beltway 8]], Hispanics became the predominant ethnic group. Some communities in Greater Houston which do not have Hispanics as the predominant ethnic group include expensive, predominantly non-Hispanic white communities such as [[Memorial, Houston|Memorial]], [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]], and [[West University Place, Texas|West University Place]]; and historically African-American neighborhoods located south and northeast of [[Downtown Houston]]. Eschbach said, "But even these core black and white neighborhoods are experiencing Hispanic inroads. Today, Hispanics live everywhere."<ref name="chron.com">Rodriguez, Lori.

The exceptions are the historically black neighborhoods northeast and south of downtown and high-dollar white communities from West University Place through Uptown and Memorial."</ref>

Historically Houston had a significant African-American population,<ref name="Trevino29"/> as this area of the state developed cotton plantation agriculture that was dependent on enslaved laborers. Thousands of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] [[African-American]]s lived near the city before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many of them worked on sugar and cotton plantations. Slaves held in the city primarily worked in domestic household and artisan jobs. In 1860 forty-nine percent of the city's population was made up of enslaved people of color. In 1860 nearby [[Fort Bend County]] had a population with twice as many black slaves as white residents; it was one of six majority-black counties statewide.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} 

From the 1870s to the 1890s, black people made up almost 40% of Houston's population.<ref name="Trevino29"/> Before being effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] by the state legislature imposing payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] in 1902, they were politically active and strongly supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates.<ref name="Trevino29"/> After disfranchisement, the state legislature established legal segregation and [[Jim Crow]]. Between 1910 and 1970, the black population of Houston ranged from 21% to 32.7%.<ref name="Trevino29"/> They were virtually without political representation until after 1965 and passage of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]], which enforced their constitutional rights of suffrage. Many blacks left Houston for the West Coast during and after World War II in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as jobs increased rapidly in the defense industry on that coast and social conditions were better. 

In 1970, 90% of the black people in Houston lived in predominantly [[African-American neighborhood]]s, reflecting decades of legal, residential segregation. By 1980 there was some increase in diversity in the city, and 82% of blacks lived in majority-black areas.<ref name="Worstfirst249">Finkel, Adam N.

[[White Americans]] of [[European American|northern and western European origin]], particularly those of [[German American|German]] and [[British American|British]] origins, founded the City of Houston. Historically in the mid-nineteenth century, Southern [[Anglo-Saxon|Anglo]] settlers primarily from the [[Southeastern United States]] crossed the [[Mississippi River]], migrating to Texas.<ref name="Higham, Nicholas J. 2013">Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J. Ryan. ''The Anglo-Saxon World''. Yale University Press, 2013.</ref>  Roberto R.

In 1910, prior to new waves of immigration from eastern and southern Europe, descendants of ethnic Whites who had founded Houston numerically outnumbered other ethnic groups who had later settled in Houston.<ref name="Trevino29"/> After European immigrants and their descendants assimilated into United States culture, they tended to develop with the city of Houston. Demographics at mid-century reflected a white majority, with Latino (mostly Mexican-American) and African-American minorities. The state legislature had [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks at the turn of the century and in practice, erected barriers to Latino voting as well. 

After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained some successes, such as congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to enforce minority constitutional rights, in the 1970s, [[white flight]] occurred in Houston as wealthier people moved to newer housing in suburbs, also choosing to avoid economic and racial integration of public schools in the city.<ref name="integration"/> The city government used [[annexation]] as a strategy to mitigate White flight by annexing areas where White Americans moved.<ref>"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=l20fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZtUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2703,1880402&dq=houston+white-flight&hl=en City bucks the trend Others dying, Houston thrives]," ''[[Associated Press]],'' ''[[Southeast Missourian]],'' 18 January 1975.

Demographers Max Beauregard and Karl Eschbach, both of [[University of Houston Center for Public Policy]], concluded from their analysis of the [[2000 U.S. Census]] that white flight from the city continued to occur in the 1990s. In the decade prior to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], White residents left communities within Houston such as [[Alief, Houston|Alief]], [[Aldine, Texas|Aldine]], [[Fondren Southwest]], [[Gulfton]], and [[Sharpstown]]. Other communities in Houston that lost large numbers of Whites by the 2000 census include [[Inwood Forest, Houston|Inwood Forest]], Northline, [[Northside, Houston|Northside]], and [[Spring Branch, Houston|Spring Branch]].

Lori Rodriguez said, regarding the movement of white people in Greater Houston leading up to the year 2000, "Picture a stone dropped on the urban core and ripples of people spreading from within the Loop to the second-ring suburbs between the [[610 Loop|Loop]] and [[Beltway 8]]; and then beyond, to the outer-ring settlements and even [[unincorporated area|unincorporated perimeter]]; [[Kingwood, Houston, Texas|Kingwood]], [[The Woodlands, Texas|The Woodlands]], [[FM 1960]]."<ref name="Rodriguezwhiteflight">Rodriguez, Lori.

The first recorded ethnic Greeks in Houston, listed in the ''Houston City Directory of 1889-1890,'' were George and Peter Poleminacos. They worked as manual laborers, as they did not speak English. Kalliope Vlahos was the first Greek woman to arrive, in 1903; after her, more women and families with children began settling Houston.<ref>Cassis, Irene and Dr. Constantina Michalos.

====Italians====
Brina D'Amico, a member of the D'Amico restaurateur family, said in 2014 that most Italian-American families in Houston were of Sicilian origins, and their immigrant ancestors had entered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries at the [[Port of Galveston]].<ref>Steinberg, Kaitlin.

====Norwegians====
In the late 1800s, more Norwegians arrived at the port of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] than any other United States port other than Ellis Island in New York City. Many of the Norwegians who were processed through Galveston migrated to join compatriots in farming areas of [[Minnesota]] and other areas in the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name="MorenoOsloBayou"/>

===Late 20th century to present===
Since the late 20th century, new immigrants have arrived from Norway, Russia, and the Mideast. In addition, there are nationals from the UK and other countries who work here for a period of time. Lasse Sigurd Seim, the consul general of the [[Norwegian Consulate General, Houston]], described the estimated 5,000&ndash;6,000 Norwegians in the Houston area around 2008 as the largest concentration of ethnic Norwegians outside of [[Scandinavia]]. Jenalia Moreno of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said during that year that the influx of Norwegians into Greater Houston was "relatively new" and related to Norway's also having a major oil industry.<ref name="MorenoOsloBayou">Moreno, Jenalia.

As of 1994, over 50,000 ethnic Iranians live in Houston. As of that year, 12 [[city blocks]] along [[Hillcroft Avenue]], from [[Westheimer Road]] to a point just south of Westpark, contain a Persian business district including shops and restaurants. Allison Cook of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' referred to the area as "Little Persia".<ref name=CookLittlePersia1>Cook, Allison. "Touring Little Persia," ''[[Houston Press]]''. September 15, 1994. p.

As of 2000, Iranians were one of the two main [[Zoroastrian]] groups in Houston. As of that year the total number of Iranians in Houston of all religions is larger than the total [[Parsi]] (generally immigrants from India) population by a 10 to 1 ratio.<ref name=Rustomjip249/>

Rustomji wrote that as of 2000, because of the historic tensions between the Parsi and Iranian groups, the Iranians in Houston did not become full members of the Zoroastrian Association of Houston (ZAH), which was majority Parsi. Rustomji stated that Iranian Zoroastrians "attend religious functions sporadically and remain tentative about their ability to fully integrate, culturally and religiously, with Parsis."<ref name=Rustomjip249/> In 1996 the Iranian population had its largest attendance at a ZAH event when it attended ''Jashne-e-Sade'', an event the community created for ZAH. By 2000 some Muslim Iranians who were opposed to fundamentalism in the mosques, began attending Zoroastrian events. Rustomji wrote in 2000 that from 2000 to  2005, Iranians were expected to make up a greater proportion of ZAH.<ref name=Rustomjip249/>

===Jews===

{{Main article|History of the Jews in Houston}}
Jews were part of the great waves of immigration from eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coming especially from the [[Russian Empire]], that than included [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]. Most entered through the Port of Galveston. Jewish aid societies encouraged immigrants to settle in the South, as the northeastern cities were absorbing so many from Europe.

By around 1987<!--The first book with the essay by Bell was published in 1987--> about 42,000 Jews lived in [[Greater Houston]].<ref name=Bellp217>Bell, p.

Rothman, author of ''The Barber in Modern Jewish Culture: A Genre of People, Places, and Things, with Illustrations,'' wrote that Houston "has a scattered Jewish populace and not a large enough population of Jews to dominate any single neighborhood."

Christian Egyptians and some North Africans have historically belonged to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]. A sufficient number of immigrants from these areas have settled in Houston since the late 20th century to establish churches and the [[Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States]]. As of 2004, there were three [[Coptic Orthodox]] churches in Houston: St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church<!--It isn't named by the source, but the Coptic Church in Bellaire *is* St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church--> in [[Bellaire, Texas|Bellaire]], the St. Mary and Archangel Michael Church in northwest [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], and the Archangel Raphael Coptic Orthodox Church in [[Clear Lake City]]. The St. Mary and Archangel Michael church began church services on July 25, 2004, had 200 families in August of that year, and was built at a cost of $2.5 million.<ref name=Varanewhome>Vara, Richard.

In the late 1960s there were far fewer Coptic families. They were served by a priest from [[Los Angeles]], who would fly monthly to Houston and hold mass in a borrowed Orthodox church or in a private house.<ref name=Varanewhome/> From 1968 to 2006, more than 600 Coptic families moved to Houston. Due to [[Persecution of Copts|sectarian strife against Copts]] in Egypt, by 2006 the number of immigrants had increased and membership of Copt churches in Houston was growing.<ref name=KatzGregory/>

In 2006 Gregory Katz of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said that, partly because many Copt church leaders are accustomed to anti-Copt attitudes in Egypt, those who come to Houston are not accustomed to speaking freely about their religious beliefs. They "do not mingle easily with the rest of the large Christian community in the Houston area".<ref name=KatzGregory/>

After the [[2011 Alexandria bombing]] in Egypt, Houston Coptic churches cancelled their [[Coptic Christmas#Date of Christmas|Coptic Christmas]] services.<ref>Shellnutt, Kate.

===Parsis===
The [[Parsi]] in 2000 made up one of the two chief ethnic groups practicing the [[Zoroastrian]] religion. As of that year the total number of Iranians of all religions in Houston was larger than the total Parsi population by a ratio of 10 to 1.<!-- So? This seems like an odd way to discuss an ethnic group, especially when contrasted with all Iranians in total. --><ref name=Rustomjip249/> As of 2000 the members of the Zoroastrian Association of Houston (ZAH) are majority Parsi. Rustomji wrote that because of that and the historic tensions between the Parsi and Iranian groups, many Iranians in Houston did not become full members of the ZAH.
