The band do not appear to be famous in Singapore, and the article does not state their notability in neutral terms.  They do not meet the criteria under [[Wikipedia:Too soon]] and [[Wikipedia: Entertainer]] - no 'significant roles in multiple notable films, television shows, stage performances, or other productions', lacks a 'large fan base or a significant "cult" following', and have not 'made unique, prolific or innovative contributions to a field of entertainment'. I am also concerned about the connection between the original author of this page and the band-research seems to suggest the original author is the band's website designer. --[[User:Paul 1953|Paul 1953]] ([[User talk:Paul 1953|talk]]) 14:02, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*Other issues of concern are the substantial lack of citations and references outside of the band's website and iTunes profile. Text added after the speedy deletion notice did not improve the article's quality, in my opinion. The rather large gap between my edit and the last one is also telling of their fledgling status. I am considering speedy deletion. --[[User:Paul 1953|Paul 1953]] ([[User talk:Paul 1953|talk]]) 16:31, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
**In the light of the revised Terms of Use regarding paid editing, I believe there is a stronger case for deletion. This is assuming that my hypothesis (see above) is right. [[User:Paul 1953|Paul 1953]] ([[User talk:Paul 1953|talk]]) 10:44, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
***'''Strong oppose''': The Sam Willows is one of the most established singers from Singapore, and they are popular, not what you think. "Glasshouse" charted in the [[987FM]] Top 100 Countdown of 2013, despite the fact that it did not enter the local chart.

*'''Keep''' - I don't think the 987Film chart mentioned above is an official for Singaporean music, so it can't be used as a claim to notability. With that said, a search revealed quite a number of interviews from reliable sources, such as one from TODAYonline and The Republican Post, so [[WP:N]] is met.

*'''Keep'''. Quick google finds an article in TODAYonline, plus [http://www.noise11.com/news/steve-lillywhite-produces-singapores-the-sam-willows-20131108 this] in Noise11 about them collaborating with [[Steve Lillywhite]]. It also says they've performed at [[SXSW]] (supported by [http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_MS20553 this]) and [[Canadian Music Week]]. Some other news coverage on them includes in the [http://stcommunities.straitstimes.com/music/2012/11/24/indie-band-same-willows Strait's Times], [https://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/reflections-sam-willows-39-benjamin-kheng-starting-band-123000650.html Yahoo Entertainment], [http://www.stuff.tv/sg/our-gadget-life-sam-willows/feature Stuff Magazine], [http://www.republicanpost.sg/up-close-with-the-sam-willows/ Republican Post],  and they appear in a [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] tv show [https://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/reflections-sam-willows-39-benjamin-kheng-starting-band-123000650.html as seen here]. Their EP is presently No 62 on iTunes Singapore, a year after it was released. [http://itopchart.com/sg/en/music-album-charts/pop/ see here]. I also found [http://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/travel/rihanna-justin-bieber-to-perform-at-formula-one-grand-prix-season-singapore-92075.html this] from India Times which mentions in passing they performed at the 2013 Singapore Gran Prix and they were supporting act for [[Pete Murray]]'s Singapore concert per [http://www.petemurray.com/news/pete-announces-first-ever-singapore-show this].

*'''Keep'''.  From my brief search and looking at what [[User:JTdale|JTdale]] found above, there is certainly significant coverage of this band in multiple verifiable reliable sources independent of the subject itself, and therefore passes the very basic of [[WP:N|notability guidelines]].  This article merely needs cleanup for [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]] and [[WP:MOS|manual of style]], which I will try and help with going forward.  Cheers.

::As another note, this band is also signed for distribution with [[Warner Brothers Music]] as evidenced by their [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mn0003138435 AllMusic profile], which passes [[WP:Music|music notability guidelines]] as well.

:::I've cleaned up the article as best I could with the short time I had available to do so today.  This is probably the most ridiculous deletion nom I have ever seen.  Had the nominator done just a few minutes of research without prejudgement, maintenance tags could have been added, and a lot of our time as reviewers would have been saved. On the other hand, the article did get somewhat improved in response to this nom, so that may be the only plus to this nom. I have added it to my watchlist and will be very happy to further help with improvements in the future.  [[User:Cricket02|♫ Cricket02 ]] ([[User talk:Cricket02|talk]]) 18:03, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
