The '''Smith–Mason Farm''' is a historic farmstead at Meadow and Old Roxbury Roads in [[Harrisville, New Hampshire]].  The main house is a 1-1/2 story Greek Revival structure built c. 1791, and it is attached to a shed and barn, making a traditional rambling New England house-to-barn complex.  A second detached barn stands across Old Roxbury Road, and a modest cottage is located near the main complex.  The property exemplifies the transitions of use in rural Harrisville, starting as a working farm.  It was converted into a summer residence in 1904, and to full-time occupancy later in the 20th century.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=86003255}}|title=NRHP nomination for Smith–Mason Farm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>

The farmstead was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name="nris"/>
