'''Adam and Noah Brown''' were American shipbuilders, based in [[New York City]], founded a company with its name based in New York, which was active between 1804 and 1833. They built several notable vessels, including [[Robert Fulton]]'s {{Ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}}, the first steam-powered warship, and numerous naval vessels on [[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Champlain]], during the [[War of 1812]].

==Company history==
Adam and Noah Brown were brothers from upper New York State. Noah Brown was apprenticed as a carpenter from 1785 to 1792, and worked in New York until 1804, when he and his brother Adam built the schooner ''Work'' at [[Newark, Upper Canada]], (now Niagara-on-the-Lake, Southern Ontario) for the [[North West Company]]. In early 1805, the brothers built a whaler at [[Sag Harbor, New York|Sag Harbor]] on [[Long Island]].<ref name="1812privateers">{{Cite web |title=Noah Brown 1770-? |url=http://www.1812privateers.org/United%20States/PRINCE/brown.html |work=1812privateers.org |accessdate=2 May 2014 }}</ref>

The Browns acquired a plot of land in at the eastern end of [[Montgomery Street (Manhattan)|Montgomery Street]] in New York, on what was then called "Manhattan Island"<ref name="Morr40">Morrison (1909), p. 40</ref> in November 1807. This was an area of solid ground, covering several acres, by the shore of the [[East River]], and bounded on three sides by salt marshes. Over the next few years the marshland was gradually reclaimed, and "Manhattan Island" eventually became part of the city.<ref>Morrison (1909), p. 39</ref> The Browns shipyard was located on [[Cherry Street (Manhattan)|Cherry]] and Clinton Streets, in what is now the [[Lower East Side]],<ref>Morrison (1909), p. 22</ref> and over the next few years they built numerous sailing vessels for the merchant service.<ref name="Morr40"/>

During the [[War of 1812]] they constructed the privateers ''[[General Armstrong]]'', ''Paul Jones'', ''[[Prince de Neufchatel]]'', ''[[American privateer Warrior|Warrior]]'', ''Yorktown'', and ''Zebra'' at New York<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.houstonmaritimemuseum.org/development-of-modern-western-sailing-warships/ | title=Development of Modern Western Sailing Warships | publisher=Houston Maritime Museum | date=2011 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502185417/http://www.houstonmaritimemuseum.org/development-of-modern-western-sailing-warships/ | archive-date=2 May 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Noah Brown shipbuilder War of 1812|url=http://www.1812privateers.org/Privateers/brown.html|accessdate=20 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724203822/http://www.1812privateers.org/Privateers/brown.html|archive-date=2011-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> and were then contracted to construct military vessels for the U.S. Navy. Under the general supervision of [[Henry Eckford (shipbuilder)|Henry Eckford]], Noah Brown was placed in charge of construction on [[Lake Erie]],<ref name="Morr40"/> and from February 1813 he completed three gunboats, a despatch schooner, and the brigs {{USS|Lawrence|1813|2}} and {{USS|Niagara|1813|2}}. Between July and September 1813 the Browns built the sloop {{USS|Peacock|1813|2}} in New York. From March 1814, they were based at [[Lake Champlain]], where they built corvette {{USS|Saratoga|1814|2}}, nine gunboats, and converted the steamer ''Vicennes'' into the schooner {{USS|Ticonderoga|1814|2}}. From June to August 1814, at [[Vergennes, Vermont]], they constructed the 18-gun brig {{USS|Eagle|1814|2}}. They then returned to New York to build [[Robert Fulton]]'s steam battery {{Ship|United States floating battery|Demologos||2}} and the torpedo-boat ''Mute'', before working with Eckford on the construction of the [[Ship of the line|ships]] {{USS|New Orleans|1815|2}} and {{USS|Chippewa|1814|2}} at [[Sackets Harbor, New York|Sacketts Harbor]] in early 1815.<ref name="1812privateers"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usskidd.com/ships-no-usn.html |title=Louisiana's Military Heritage: Vessels named USS New Orleans |work=usskidd.com |accessdate=2 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222093925/http://www.usskidd.com/ships-no-usn.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}</ref> Following the end of the war Noah Brown served as assistant alderman in New York's Tenth Ward representing the Republican party.<ref name="1812privateers"/> 

This wartime activity proved very profitable, as in 1815 Adam and Noah Brown were assessed for personal taxes of $15,000 each. Noah Brown was also active in the development of real estate on the east side of the city.<ref>Morrison (1909), pp. 48–49</ref>
 
Early on 14 March 1824, a fire broke out in the Browns' sawmill and spread rapidly to the adjoining yard of [[Jacob Bell (shipbuilder)|Brown & Bell]], destroying two steamboats, two brigs, and a large quantity of timber. The fire also extended to the yard of [[Isaac Webb (shipbuilder)|Isaac Webb & Co.]], where a frame building and a considerable quantity of timber was burned. Fire Engine No. 33, "Black Joke", was also destroyed in the blaze and the firemen had to jump into the river to escape.<ref>Morrison (1909), pp. 54–55</ref>

The last vessel constructed by Noah Brown was the ferryboat ''Sussex'', built for the New York and Jersey City Ferry Company in 1833.<ref>Morrison (1909), p. 59</ref>
