Auditions for the first series occurred only in three metropolises: the capitol Islamabad, the Heart Lahore and the industrial hub Karachi. People showed enthusiasm for the auditions. In Lahore auditions days were extended due to their great reception, and in Karachi, auditions were extended for two more days.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Audition structure===
The auditions for season 1 of ''MasterChef Pakistan''  followed almost the same format as of the ''[[MasterChef]]'' series, similar to Australia and India. There were three rounds, the first being the open call audition advertised. Auditioners registered themselves via forms at the series' website, and then called for auditions at the venue, to which they bring their cold dishes. Those who gain two yeses from the judges then gain the red apron for the next round.

In the second round, the selected auditioners face a live cooking challenge, where in one hour they have to present their dishes to the judges. Half of those who attended are eliminated at this stage, and the rest  are "white apron" auditioners selected to proceed further.

In the third round, half of those selected have to face a boot camp challenge where their cutting skills and speed are judged. Here a further selection occurs, with only 16 or 17 participants moving on.<ref>{{cite web|title=Registration process for MasterCher Paksiatn|url=http://www.brandsynario.com/articles/masterchef-pakistan-how-to-register|work=Ghazala Suleman|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref>

In the first season, unlike India and Australia, ''MasterChef'' did not air audition episodes, but directly aired with the selected initial contestants. The first season follows the live cooking challenge round and the boot camp challenge.

==Judges==
The first season of the series was hosted and judged by the following panel of acclaimed Pakistani chefs:<ref>{{cite web|title=Master Chef Pakistan Judges Panel Announced !|url=http://reviewit.pk/master-chef-pakistan-judges-panel-announced/|work=Reviewit.pk|publisher=Rabia Basharat|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>
* Chef [[Zakir Qureshi]] 
* Chef [[Mehboob Khan (chef)|Mehboob Khan]]
* Chef Khurram Awan

==Challenges prior to finals==
===Live cooking challenge===
After the regional auditions in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, the judges selected 100 contestants who came from all over Pakistan to venues. All 100 contestants faced a live cooking challenge, where they were given one hour to present their dishes to the judges. From among these contestants, the pool of contestants was narrowed down to 50 by giving a white apron to each, for the next round.

===Boot camp challenge===
The second phase was the boot camp challenge, where the selected 50 contestants' cutting and techniques of cooking were judged by giving them different kitchen chores. Here a further selection occurred, and the top 50 were narrowed down to the final top 16. Boot camp included two or three phases in order to select the last final contestants who would fight for the series' title.

==Contestants==
===Opening week===
The opening week of ''MasterChef Pakistan'' saw 100 contestants competing for the 16 positions in the main competition. After facing the live cooking challenge, the top 50 were revealed in the second episode. They then faced the boot camp challenge. The top 30 were shown in episode 3. Finally after facing the last boot camp challenge, the top 16 were revealed, who would appear in the main competition.

===Top 16===
The full top 16 were revealed on Sunday, 11 May.
