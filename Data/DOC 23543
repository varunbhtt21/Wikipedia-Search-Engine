The '''Dharawal National Park''' is a [[state park|protected]] [[national park]] that is located in the [[Illawarra]] region of [[New South Wales]], in eastern [[Australia]]. The {{convert|6508|ha|adj=on}} national park is situated between the Illawarra Range and the [[Georges River]] and is approximately {{convert|45|km}} south west of [[Sydney]]. There are three entry points to the park: from the east through {{NSWcity|Darkes Forest}}; from the north through {{NSWcity|Wedderburn}}; and from the south through {{NSWcity|Appin}}.<ref name=pom>{{cite web|work=[[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service]]|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/dharawalMgmtplan.pdf|type=PDF|date=26 July 2006|title=Dharawal Nature Reserve and Dharawal State Conservation Area: Plan of management|accessdate=26 April 2014|isbn=1-74122-057-2}}</ref>

The national park covers almost both the O’Hares and Stokes Creek catchments. It contains significant biodiversity and ecosystems and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] culturally significant sites. It has high conservation significance within the region, especially due to the low disturbance within the park and limited public access. The landscape varies from gorges and waterfalls to upland swamps to sandstone woodland, rainforests, and eastern gully forests. The residents of the park include [[koalas]], [[wallaby|wallabies]], [[wallaroos]], [[platypuses]], [[potoroos]], [[pygmy possums]] and many more animal species.

The conservation objectives of the park are to maintain the natural and cultural heritage, provide education and research opportunities as well as providing some recreation activities.<ref name=pom/>

== Etymology and indigenous heritage ==
The name ''Dharawal'' refers to the [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] [[Dharawal people|Dharawal community]], which has lived in the area for more than 15,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Campbelltown City Council|title=Dharawal National Park, Macarthur|accessdate=27 April 2014|url=http://macarthur.com.au/dharawal-national-park}}</ref> The Dharawal once occupied the area from the southern shores of [[Botany Bay]], south to the [[Shoalhaven River]], and northwest to {{NSWcity|Camden}}.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Carol, L.|year=1988|title=The Dharawal and Gandangara in Colonial Campbelltown, New South Wales, 1788-1830|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=12|pages=49–62}}</ref>  The park is within the Tharawal and the Illawarra [[Aboriginal Land Council]]s areas.

== History ==
In 1927 the O’Hares Creek Catchment was declared a Special Area to be used for water supply, and so management of the region was designated to the [[Sydney Water|Sydney Water Corporation]]. In 1978, the Sydney Metropolitan Water Sewage and Drainage Board decided that the catchment would not be used for water supply, and so the [[Government of New South Wales]] proposed creating a state recreation area over the catchment. Due to conflicting government interest, it took until 1996 before the catchment area was declared a nature reserve and state recreation area.<ref name=pom/> As a result of the ''National Parks and Wildlife Act, 2001'' passed by New South Wales, all state recreation areas became state conservation areas.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|npwaa|National Parks and Wildlife Amendment Act, 2001 No 130}}</ref>

The distinction between Dharawal Nature Reserve and Dharawal State Conservation Area was due to coal mining being allowed in the state conservation area. Dharawal Nature Reserve was categorised by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] as a category Ia Strict Nature Reserve and the Dharawal State Conservation Area was categorised as a category VI Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]|title=IUCN Protected Areas Categories System|accessdate=26 April 2014|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=when were these categorizations made?|date=January 2016}}

On 26 March 2012 most of the Dharawal State Conservation Area was declared a national park with a residual of three areas of state conservation area remaining on the western side and center of the national park to allow ongoing mining operations<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=2012|title=Government Gazette of New South Wales, Number 32|accessdate=1 August 2014|url=http://www.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/No_32_of_2012.pdf|type=PDF}}</ref> The government waited for its last mining exploration licence with [[BHP Billiton]] to expire before making the announcement.<ref name=smhpatty>{{cite news|author=Patty, A.|date=26 March 2012|title=Mining to remain on border of Dharawal|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=5|url=}}</ref> The national park status has meant that there are now much greater restrictions on activities such as coal mining within the protected area although in 2012 BHP Billiton was reported as continuing mining exploration in Darkes Forest, just outside the park’s border.<ref name=smhpatty/> The area is said to be protected to the centre of the earth which in theory means that no more mining activities can take place.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Boyd, A.|date=2012|title=The Dharawal: To be or not to be|journal=EarthSong Journal: Perspectives in Ecology, Spirituality and Education|volume=2|number=3|page=8}}</ref>

== Region description ==
The Dharawal National Park is located on the southern rim of the [[Sydney Basin]]. The Woronora plateau gently slopes northwest towards the [[Cumberland Plain]]. The majority of the Dharawal region is located within the Nepean Ramp sub-region of the plateau, with a small portion in the west being part of the Macdonald region. The Dharawal National Park forms part of a larger protected area, which includes [[Royal National Park]] located in the north, the [[Budderoo National Park|Budderoo]] and [[Morton National Park|Morton]] national parks in the south and the extensive [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]{{endash}}listed [[Greater Blue Mountains Area]] in the west and northwest. Combined, these protected areas are one of the largest within the state of New South Wales.<ref name=pom/>

The Dharawal sites consist of the catchment of the O’Hares and Stokes Creeks, which are the headwaters of the Georges River on the Woronora Plateau. The annual average discharge of the catchment streams is estimated at {{convert|40000|ML|e9impgal+e9USgal}}. There are many waterways within the park, totalling over {{convert|200|km}} and including 26 swamps, draining towards the [[Nepean River|Nepean]] and [[Georges River|Georges]] rivers.<ref name=pom/>

The plateau predominantly consists of [[Triassic]] [[Hawkesbury Sandstone]], which is largely [[quartzose sandstone]] with some [[shale]] and [[ironstone]]. The soil in the park is generally shallow, sandy and of low fertility. The park is prone to high and extreme erosion threats.<ref name=pom/> There are 13 vegetation communities in the park, among which sandstone woodland and eastern gully forest dominate. Orchards and hobby farms surround park on the east and west.<ref name=pom/>

The region's climate is classified as temperate with temperatures ranging in the winter months from {{convert|6|to|27|C|F}} in the summer months.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}{{clarify|reason=only one temperature range is given, for two seasons. The information is not in the source|date=January 2016}} The average annual rainfall varies from {{convert|850|to|1550|mm}}.<ref name=keith1993>{{cite journal|author1=Keith, D.

== Biology and ecology ==
The park is a region of high species diversity, especially the upland [[swamp]]s, which are considered to be the most species-rich in the world for shrub/sedge vegetation. They contain over 140 plant species.<ref name=keith1993/> These upland swamps have experienced no significant changes in the last 17,000 years and thus, are of great scientific importance as well as being listed as an endangered ecological community.<ref>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|title=Coastal upland swamp in the Sydney Basin Bioregion – endangered ecological community listing|accessdate=28 April 2014|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/coastaluplandswampfd.htm|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref> Additionally, Stokes and O’Hares Creeks are classified as protected waters and the waters connected to O’Hares Weir are classified as Specially Protected Waters.<ref name=pom/> This signifies that either no or very little discharges can occur within these waters. The park is of regional significance, having preserved local and diverse ecosystems and habitats that in other surrounding areas have been either damaged or destroyed.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Flora ===
The two dominant vegetation communities, sandstone woodland and eastern gully forest, have species compositions very different from that of the same communities in other areas.<ref name=pom/> The species richness of dry [[sclerophyll]] forests, dry sclerophyll [[woodland]]s and [[heathland]]s are greater than in similar coastal communities within NSW.<ref name=keith1993/> There are also vegetation communities which are not well represented in other existing Sydney [[sandstone]] conservation areas.<ref name=pom/> The O’Hares Creek Shale Forest community, which has a low population density, and the [[Callitris endlicheri|black cypress pine]] of the Woronora Plateau, which is disconnected from other populations, are both classified as endangered.<ref name=vol4>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/07473tpagssvol4pt1.pdf|type=PDF|work=Terrestrial Vertebrate Fauna of the Greater Southern Sydney Region|title=The Fauna of the Metropolitan, O’Hares Creek and Woronora Special Areas: Summary of findings and recommendations|volume=4|publisher=Department of Environment and Climate Change, [[Government of New South Wales]]|date=September 2007|isbn=978-1-74122-602-7|accessdate= }}</ref>

=== Fauna ===
128 birds, 39 reptiles, 32 mammals, 23 frog, 5 fish, 2 crayfish, 1 shrimp, 1 freshwater mussel and 273 invertebrate species have been recorded in the park.<ref name=pom/><ref name=fauna2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/surveys/dharawalscavertebratefauna.pdf|type=PDF|title=The vertebrate fauna of Dharawal State Conservation Area, Dharawal Nature Reserve and adjacent lands|work=Department of Environment and Climate Change|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=December 2007|accessdate=|isbn=978-1-74122-686-7}}</ref> Of these fauna, 23 vertebrate species are listed as threatened.<ref name=fauna2007/> Other species considered rare either generally or within the region are [[platypus]] (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus''), [[dusky antechinus]] (''Antechinus swainsonii''), [[greater glider]] (''Petaurus breviceps''), [[wombat]] (''Vombatus ursinus''), [[eastern grey kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus''), [[wallaroo]] (''Macropus robustus''), [[red-necked pademelon]] (''Thylogale thetis''), [[red-necked wallaby]] (''Macropus rufogriseus'') and [[peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus'').<ref name=pom/> The largest population of koalas (''Phascolarctos cinereus'') in southern Sydney are found in Wedderburn, which is located in and around the park.<ref name=vol4/><ref>{{cite book|publisher=[[Australian Koala Foundation]]|date=1996|title=Wedderburn Fauna Planning Study|work=Campbelltown City Council }}</ref> Their breeding habitat runs along the creek lines of the O’Hares Creek and Georges River starting from the Stokes creek junction to north of Kentlyn.

The following species are of high priority as most of their habitats are in the Woronora Plateau:<ref name=fauna2007/> [[broad-headed snake]] (''Hoplocephalus bungaroides''), [[Littlejohn’s tree frog]] (''Litoria littlejohni''), [[spotted-tailed quoll]] (''Dasyurus maculatus''), [[large-footed myotis]] (''Myotis macropus''), [[east-coast free-tailed bat]] (''Mormopterus norfolkensis''), [[Australian green tree frog|green tree frog]] (''Litoria caerulea''), [[grey-headed flying fox]] (''Pteropus poliocephalus'') and the [[southern emu-wren]] (''Stipiturus malachurus''). These species suffer from a variety of threats, chiefly habitat loss.<ref name=fauna2007/> The park is considered to be critical to the regional conservation of the [[beautiful firetail]] (''Stagonopleura bella''), [[tawny-crowned honeyeater]] (''Gliciphila melanops''), [[Rosenberg's monitor|Rosenberg’s goanna]] (''Varanus rosenbergi''), and the [[eastern three-lined skink]] (''Bassiana duperreyi'').<ref name=fauna2007/>

Diverse freshwater fish species are found within creeks in the park, including the [[Macquarie perch]] (''Macquaria ambigua''), which is a threatened species.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|work=[[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of the Environment]]|title=''Macquaria australasica'' – Macquarie Perch|accessdate=27 April 2014|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=66632 }}</ref> The freshwater species [[Cox’s gudgeon]] (''Gobiomorphus coxii''), [[Speckled longfin eel|long-finned eel]] (''Anguilla reinhardtii''), [[climbing galaxias]] (''Galaxias brevipinni'') and the [[Sydney crayfish|Sydney]] (''Euastacus australasiensis'') and [[Euastacus|spiny crayfish]] (''Euastacus'' spp.) are also found in the park.<ref name=pom/>

== Environmental threats ==

=== Pests ===
Fifty plant species found in the park are considered [[introduced species]].<ref name=pom/> Most weed populations are found where there has been human activity, such as along roads, abandoned quarries, or on park boundaries.<ref name=pom/> Significant weeds found in parts of the park are crofton weed (''[[Ageratina adenophora]]''), pine trees, and pampas grass (''[[Cortaderia selloana]]''), which is an easy proliferator.  Many weeds are present outside the boundaries of the park, which present the threat of invasion.<ref name=pom/> Some of these are gorse ([[Ulex europaeus]]), fireweed (''[[Cotoneaster]] glycophylla''), broad and narrow-leaf privet (''[[Ligustrum]]'' spp.), Scotch thistle (''[[Cirsium vulgare]]'') and cassia (''[[Senna (plant)|Senna]] pendula'').

In total, there are seven species of introduced mammals and four introduced bird species within the park.<ref name=fauna2007/> Foxes and feral dogs are a threat to koalas, and Feral cats and foxes are a real danger to many threatened species within the Upland Swamp region.<ref name=vol4/> Bats are especially vulnerable to feral cat predators.<ref name=pom/> Feral cats, foxes and mosquito fish (''Gambusia affinis'') have been listed as creating key threatening processes (predation, competition and vegetation alteration) under the ''Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995'' (NSW).<ref name=bioatlas/> Chytrid fungus infecting frogs and feral deer causing environmental degradation (such as trampling and accelerating erosion), are also considered to cause threatening processes.<ref>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|title=Herbiovry and environmental degradation caused by feral deer – key threatening process listed|accessdate=1 May 2014|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/FeralDeerKtp.htm }}</ref>

=== Catchment ===
The water extraction licenses issued in the park's catchment have the potential to reduce flow further down the catchment. Five weirs have been constructed within creeks in the park. These weirs exclude certain native fish from being able to reach creeks within the reserves, therefore preventing these fish from being able to complete their lifecycle.<ref>{{cite thesis|author=Searle, B.|date=1997|title=The impact of mining related subsidence on surface hydrology in Dharawal state conservation area|type=Unpublished B. Env. Sc. (Hons.) Thesis|publisher=[[University of Wollongong]]}}</ref>

=== Mining ===
Coal mining exploration has occurred in the park, which has caused cracking in creek beds as well as some damage to slopes and rocks.<ref name=pom/> Stream flows have been altered due to cracking, which can lead to alterations in aquatic habitats and impacting on linked species.<ref name=bioatlas>{{cite web|work=Department of Environment and Conservation|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|title=Bio Net Atlas Search of NSW Wildlife|accessdate=27 April 2014|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/atlaspublicapp/UI_Modules/ATLAS_/atlasreport.aspx#}}</ref> Cracking caused to the streams can be to such an extent as producing water loss.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Holla, L.|author2=Barclay, E.|date=2000|title=Mine Subsidence in the Southern Coalfield, NSW, Australia|work=New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources }}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2016|reason=what does "cracking" mean in this context?}} Management trails have previously been created using coal wash waste, which can be easily transported into the streams during rain events.<ref name=pom/> This can cause alkaline conditions and can have a negative effect on flora and fauna.

=== Fires ===
Wildfires are a threat to flora and fauna within the park, and require fire protection and management, especially for areas such as core koala-breeding habitat.<ref name=vol4/> Threats of arson have also been made, both outside and within the park. Arson and accidental fires from bushwalkers have been the main reason for bushfires within the park.<ref name=pom/>

== Management ==
The park management is trying to protect and conserve the park’s natural and cultural heritage in the most natural state possible.<ref name=pom/> It places emphasis on maintaining a healthy and high yielding rainfall catchment. Upland swamps are also important due to the rare species they contain, and so have been classified as a Priority Fauna Habitat.<ref name=fauna2007/> The park management also helps conserve area outside the park perimeter. The management is also rehabilitating areas disturbed by invasive species with a focus on [[sedge]]land – Health Complex{{Clarify|date=January 2015|reason=What is 'Health Complex'?}}, [[heath]] woodland, ironstone woodland and ironstone heath.<ref name=pom/> Maintenance of rare, threatened and endangered flora and fauna is a priority along with maintaining diversity and regenerating areas, which have been disturbed.<ref name=fauna2007/>

Weeds that are a threat to the native vegetation communities are controlled within the park as well as controlling weeds on neighbouring lands. These include [[Andropogon virginicus|whisky grass]] (''Andropogon virginicus''), [[Eragrostis curvula|African love grass]] (''Eragrostis curvula'') and [[Chloris gayana|Rhodes grass]] (''Chloris gayana'').<ref name=fauna2007/> The populations of foxes, [[feral]] dogs and cats, and deer, which are all introduced fauna, are annually controlled.<ref name=pom/> Using coal wash waste has been banned within the park. Fire management includes reducing fuel within the park, ensuring that fences are well maintained so as to prevent [[arson]], as well as [[prescribed burn]]ing. [[Soil erosion]] and [[sediment]] movement is being repaired, especially in the upland swamp region and the Hawkesbury and Maddens Plains Soil Landscape Units. Water quality in the catchment is being monitored and there is some action towards limiting water pumping from streams, when there is little or no flow available.<ref name=pom/>
