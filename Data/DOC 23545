|Description = [[Abortive initiation]], in which [[RNA polymerase]] pulls DNA into itself through the active site so that it can transcribe short segments of RNA without leaving the promoter sequence.

|Article = Abortive initiation
|Purpose = I want to show the mechanism of DNA scrunching, which is important to understanding abortive initiation.
|Replaceability = No free media exists because this is not a widely known concept.
|Replaceability_text = The terminology used to describe DNA scrunching is already mostly abstract concepts to the average Wikipedia reader, so description of this complex mechanism by text alone is insufficient to provide understanding.
|Minimality = This is a small portion of the original image and will only be used in this single article.
|Commercial = n.a.
