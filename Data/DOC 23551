The result was  '''No consensus.'''  Considering that the nomination was grounded in concerns about the article's sourcing, and a number of new sources have been added during the debate, the discussion does tend towards "keep", but it would be overreaching to say there was a real "keep" consensus here.—[[User:S Marshall|<font face="Verdana" color="Maroon">'''S Marshall'''</font>]] <small>[[User talk:S Marshall|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/S Marshall|C]]</small> 19:05, 15 May 2014 (UTC)'''

Not enough sources to prove notability. Also, the article is nothing other than plot summaries of the films he appears in. [[User:Kailash29792|Kailash29792]] ([[User talk:Kailash29792|talk]]) 14:13, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::[[User:Kailash29792|Kailash29792]], please see below. [[WP:NRVE|Multiple sources exist that were simply not used]], article content and style would appear to be addressable [[WP:HANDLE|through regular editing]], and we rarely delete what can be fixed.

*'''Redirect''' to [[Dabangg]] - there are only two films in which the charcter appears,not notable enough for an independant article, & as noted the article is nothing but plot summaries. It is also effectily unsourced.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 14:56, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

I was prepared to opine a delete.... until my searches revealed how often this character is spoken of and analyzed directly and in detail in multiple reliable sources. If he were a real person, [[WP:GNG|notability would not be in doubt]]. The topic needs expansion and [[WP:NRVE|use of available sources]]... IE: editorial attention, not deletion.

*'''delete''' there is nothing salvagable in the current version, but if MichaelQSchmidt or some other editor wants to userfy , that is an option as well.<small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:TheRedPenOfDoom|TheRedPenOfDoom]] ([[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheRedPenOfDoom|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

*'''Keep and improve''' - Upon a source review of those provided by [[User:MichaelQSchmidt]] above, the topic passes [[WP:GNG]]. That said, the article would benefit from copy editing to be more succinct and the addition of sources to the Biography and Game character sections.
