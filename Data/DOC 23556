The Woods was a nineteenth century house which had a lake and woods in its grounds. In the 1930s the house was demolished, and in 1947 [[Municipal Borough of Surbiton|Surbiton Council]] compulsorily purchased the site and turned it into a park. In 1980 the upper part of the park was fenced off to form the bird sanctuary, which has been managed by the London Wildlife Trust since 1987.<ref name=LGO/>

The site is wooded, and has typical woodland birds such as [[great spotted woodpecker]]s and [[tawny owl]]s. Invertebrates include [[stag beetle]]s.<ref name=LNR/>

There is access from Oak Hill Grove.
