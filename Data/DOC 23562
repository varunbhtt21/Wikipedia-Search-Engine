The gate served as the West Gate of the arsenal and faced the [[Subic, Zambales#Spanish period|Spanish-era]] settlement of Olongapo. A high wall of locally quarried stone connected it to the south gate that faced the waterfront.<ref name="empeno" />

In addition to being used as the main entrance and exit to the naval station, the gate was also used as a jail during both the Spanish and the American occupation.<ref name="anderson">{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Gerald R.|title=Subic Bay from Magellan to Pinatubo: The History of the US Naval Station, Subic Bay|date=January 12, 2009|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1441444523|page=65}}</ref>

On November 26, 2013, the Spanish Gate was declared a historical landmark by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] (NHCP). The NHCP affixed on the wall of the gate a marker which reads "Himpilang Pandagat ng Look ng Subic"<ref name="empeno" /> ("Naval Station of Subic Bay").
