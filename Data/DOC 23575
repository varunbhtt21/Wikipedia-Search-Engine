Started in the fall of 1994, the '''Hoboken Spring & Fall Arts and Music Festival''' has presented annual artist and musical performances in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. The event takes place on Washington St. from Observer Highway to 7th St.. In the first years, the event was only 2 to 3 blocks long with about 80 to 100 vendors. It quickly expanded to its current size, now 10 blocks long, hosts over 400 vendor spaces, has 3 stages of live performance and a special section with activities for children. The event attracts between 30,000 and 50,000 visitors every year.<ref>http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/05/arts_and_music_festival_20_yea.html</ref>
