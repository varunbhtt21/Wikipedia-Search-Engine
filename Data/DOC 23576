:* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] Length, date verified.  Hook's offline ref accepted AGF by seasoned editor. All non-lede paragraphs have refs. Both sources used are reputable, but offline. No apparent close paraphrasing issues. Image is from Commons. Interesting hook; hook's length is fine. QPQ done. GTG, and I recommend it as the lead hook to include the img. --[[User:Rosiestep|Rosiestep]] ([[User talk:Rosiestep|talk]]) 13:56, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
