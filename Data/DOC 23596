Title : General purpose analog computer
Text : The '''General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC)''' is a mathematical model of [[analog computer]]s first introduced in 1941 by [[Claude Shannon]].<ref name="Shannon">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/sapm1941201337|title = Mathematical Theory of the Differential Analyzer| journal=Journal of Mathematics and Physics| volume=20| issue=1–4| pages=337–354|year = 1941|last1 = Shannon|first1 = Claude E.}}</ref> This model consists of circuits where several basic units are interconnected in order to [[Computation|compute]] some [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. The GPAC can be implemented in practice through the use of [[Differential analyser|mechanical devices]] or [[Analogue electronics|analog electronics]]. Although analog computers have fallen almost into oblivion due to emergence of the [[computer|digital computer]], the GPAC has recently been studied as a way to provide evidence for the [[Church–Turing thesis#Variations|physical Church–Turing thesis]].<ref>O.

== Definition and history ==

The General Purpose Analog Computer was originally introduced by [[Claude Shannon]].<ref name="Shannon"/> This model came as a result of his work on [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyzer]], an early [[analog computer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Claude_E._Shannon |title=Claude E. Shannon, an oral history |author=Robert Price |work=IEEE Global History Network |year=1982 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}</ref> Shannon defined the GPAC as an analog circuit consisting of five types of units: adders (which add their inputs), multipliers (which multiply their inputs), [[integrator]]s, constant units (which always output the value 1), and constant multipliers (which always multiply their input by a fixed constant ''k''). More recently, and for simplicity, the GPAC has instead been defined using the equivalent four types of units: adders, multipliers, integrators and real constant units (which always output the value ''k'', for some fixed [[real number]] ''k'').

In his original paper, Shannon presented a result which stated that functions computable by the GPAC are those functions which are [[Differential algebraic equation|differentially algebraic]].
