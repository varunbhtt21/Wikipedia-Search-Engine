==Background==

He subsequently procured a [[Master of Divinity]] and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary]], where while in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], he was thereafter for fourteen years the [[J.

Before he came to Louisiana College in 2011,<ref name=smithalumnispeech/> Smith was the pastor of the First Baptist Church of [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], Mississippi. He came to LC as Dean of Chapel and Associate Dean of Pastoral Ministry for the Caskey School of Divinity,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wildcats.ehclients.com/index.php/newspaper/article/lc_hires_new_dean_of_chapel#/images/sized/images/uploads/DSC_8920_1-400x536.jpg|title=Al Quartemont, "LC hires new Dean of Chapel", 2010|publisher=wildcats.ehclients.com|accessdate=April 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503165949/http://wildcats.ehclients.com/index.php/newspaper/article/lc_hires_new_dean_of_chapel#/images/sized/images/uploads/DSC_8920_1-400x536.jpg|archive-date=May 3, 2014|dead-url=yes}}</ref> an entity endowed by the [[Coushatta, Louisiana|Coushatta]] [[business]]man [[Edgar Cason]], who has since withdrawn funding for the school and entered into an arrangement with New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, Smith's former institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140417/NEWS01/304170025/Former-LC-benefactors-appear-helping-New-Orleans-seminary |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140418025819/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140417/NEWS01/304170025/Former-LC-benefactors-appear-helping-New-Orleans-seminary |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 18, 2014 |title=Leigh Guidry, "Former Louisiana College benefactors appear to be helping N.O. seminary" |publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk'' |accessdate=April 17, 2014 }}</ref>

Smith and his wife, the former Connie Kathleen Saucier, also a native of Poplarville, married in 1975, both at the age of twenty. They have three grown sons, Joshua, David, and Dustin Smith.<ref name=argsmith/>

==Tapped as interim LC president==

At the time he was chosen as interim president, Smith wore four titles at LC: the executive vice president, the associate dean for Christian ministry at the Caskey School, the vice president for the integration of faith and learning, and professor of preaching and pastoral ministry.<ref name=aguillarddeparts>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20140418/NEWS01/304180026/Smith-says-he-ll-work-Aguillard-La-College-moves-forward |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140423214850/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20140418/NEWS01/304180026/Smith-says-he-ll-work-Aguillard-La-College-moves-forward |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 23, 2014 |title=Leigh Guidry, Smith says he'll work with Aguillard as La. College moves forward, April 18, 2014 |publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk'' |accessdate=April 23, 2014 }}</ref>

Smith succeeded [[Joe W. Aguillard]], whose latter tenure was shaken by a series of controversies, including a claim that [[Calvinism]] was being promoted on the Baptist campus, questions about forged documents submitted to the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], the failure to finish the [[Paul Pressler (Texas)|Paul Pressler]] Law School under construction in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], and the diversion of $60,000 from the Caskey School of Divinity to an LC missions project in [[Tanzania]]. The events led to the call of a [[student strike]] against Aguillard. Though the strike at first appeared unsuccessful, on March 27, 2014, it was reported that the LC trustees had asked Aguillard to resign.<ref name=aguillardaskedtoresign>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140327/NEWS01/303270016/Sources-Louisiana-College-President-Aguillard-asked-resign-support-dwindles |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140327141946/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140327/NEWS01/303270016/Sources-Louisiana-College-President-Aguillard-asked-resign-support-dwindles |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 27, 2014 |title=Leigh Guidry, Sources: Louisiana College President Aguillard asked to resign as support dwindles |publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk'' |accessdate=March 27, 2014 }}</ref>

On April 15, 2014, the trustees named Aguillard [[Emeritus|president emeritus]] beginning August 1, with Smith tapped at that same time as the interim president, pending a job search for a permanent holder of the position. Aguillard will remain as president until May 31, at which time Smith will for two months assume the temporary title of "president pro tempore".<ref name=aguillarddeparts/> Aguillard will assist Smith in the transition of administration and may after a year of paid leave beginning in 2015 resume his former tenured professorship in the LC Graduate Teacher Education program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140415/BREAKING_NEWS/140415014/Louisiana-College-will-seek-new-president-after-moving-Aguillard-emeritus-role? |title=Louisiana College will seek new president after moving Aguillard to emeritus role, April 15, 2014 |publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk'' |accessdate=April 15, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Smith told a meeting in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] of LC alumni that the college must rebuild trust within Baptist ranks. "I don’t have a vision for a long-term future. I have a mandate to make sure we get ready for the arrival of the new president,” he said. Two in the audience questioned whether the search committee would act independently of the trustee.<ref name=smithalumnispeech>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140503/NEWS01/305030017/Smith-Louisiana-College-must-build-trust-alumni |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140503133242/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140503/NEWS01/305030017/Smith-Louisiana-College-must-build-trust-alumni |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2014 |title=Smith: Louisiana College must build trust with alumni, May 2, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|The Alexandria Town Talk]] |accessdate=May 3, 2014 }}</ref>

On June 19, 2014, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools at its annual meeting in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], placed Louisiana College on probation because of issues related to trustee board governance, institutional integrity, personnel policies, and audit findings regarding both student financial aid and other financial control matters.<ref name=probation/>

Smith said that the decision by SACS is "disappointing" but "represents an opportunity for Louisiana College to address the issues in preparation for the arrival of a new president. Fortunately, the issues don't bring into question in any way the excellent classroom work being done by our professors and students. The issues have to do with administrative areas."<ref name=probation>John Willie, "Louisiana College Placed on Probation by SACS-Commission on Colleges; Maintains Full Accreditation", Louisiana College press release, June 19, 2014</ref>

In November 2014, President Smith disclosed that Louisiana College has a $1 million shortfall for the 2014-2015 academic year. The 2014 enrollment of 1,265 is 141 fewer than in the fall of 2013. A decrease of 141 students, according to Smith, represents a loss of $2.1 million in revenues from tuition and fees paid by students, double the overall budgetary shortfall. Smith said that the institution will attempt to control expenditures but not cut jobs or contracts. Major projects under former President Joe Aguillard will be suspended, including a school in Tanzania, a law school in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] to have been named in honor of former Texas Judge [[Paul Pressler (Texas)|Paul Pressler]] of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], and a medical school and film school in Central Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2014/11/15/la-college-faces-million-budget-shortfall/19112533/|title=La.

Smith was succeeded as president by [[Rick Brewer (academic)|Rick Brewer]], a former administrator at [[Charleston Southern University]] in [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], who was the unanimous choice of the LC trustees.
