* ... that the '''[[Shriners Hospital for Children (Portland)|Shriners Hospital for Children]]''' ''(pictured)'' in [[Portland, Oregon]] underwent a $70 million expansion that reduced the number of beds at the hospital?
:* ''Reviewed'': [[:Template:Did you know nominations/Frank M. Warren, Sr.|Frank M. Warren, Sr.]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ADid_you_know_nominations%2FFrank_M._Warren%2C_Sr.&diff=604108627&oldid=604102438]
<small>5x expanded by [[User:Aboutmovies|Aboutmovies]] ([[User talk:Aboutmovies|talk]]). Self nominated at 14:44, 2 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] I feel like the hook is misrepresenting facts - saying that it underwent expansion ''to'' reduce the number of beds suggests that the purpose of the expansion was to cut down on beds, whereas the article seems to suggest the reduction in beds was a secondary by-product of the expansion rather than the primary intention. (Put simply, the hospital wanted to expand/improve other areas and ended up cutting beds.) [[User:97198|97198]] ([[User talk:97198|talk]]) 04:29, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::*While I disagree it misrepresents, and is inline with how we do hooks, I've altered it to "that reduced". [[User:Aboutmovies|Aboutmovies]] ([[User talk:Aboutmovies|talk]]) 05:49, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] I think this is a better hook, and still interesting. Date and length are fine and article is within policy. Difficult to check for copyvio since majority of sources are offline. Hook is referenced (and $70m is a reasonable approximation), image is PD and QPQ is done. Good to go!
