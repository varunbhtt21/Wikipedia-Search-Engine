:({{Find sources|WWW Trilogy}})
Non-notable book trilogy. Note that the referenced '''Slate''' article is about sentinence and the trilogy is used as a foil for developing the theme of AI sentinence; it's not "a review or non-trivial coverage". [[User:Mikeblas|Mikeblas]] ([[User talk:Mikeblas|talk]]) 14:50, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

I am also nominating the following related pages because they are similarly non-notable:

:{{la|Wonder (novel)}}
:{{la|Wake (Robert J. Sawyer novel)}}
:{{la|Watch (novel)}}
-- [[User:Mikeblas|Mikeblas]] ([[User talk:Mikeblas|talk]]) 14:54, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

: All of the information in the trilogy stub and the two sequel stubs is in the lead paragraph of [[Wake (Robert J. Sawyer novel)]], our article about the first book. --all but the link to that ''Slate'' article.
: It's simply "Robert J. Sawyer's “WWW” trilogy" in ''Slate'' but the series is catalogued as "WWW Trilogy" at ISFDB ({{isfdb series|26059|WWW Trilogy}}). So that's a reasonable pagename to use for coverage of the whole. Nevertheless I suggest redirect the three stubs to the ''Wake'' article. At least for now [[Wake (Robert J. Sawyer novel)#Reception|that]] seems to be a good place under a heading such as Sequels, Series, or Trilogy. 
: FYI the trilogy stub is 3 years old, the two sequel stubs 1 year. --[[User:P64|P64]] ([[User talk:P64|talk]]) 19:19, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''': I'm still working on it, but so far this looks to be a keep for all of them from my end. I'm finding quite a few reviews and articles on the series via a GS and I haven't even hit the Highbeam, BingNews, and JSTOR type sources yet. It looks like the first book also got an Aurora Award as well.

*'''Keep all'''. I've fleshed out all of the articles here and each book has multiple reviews, which allows them to pass [[WP:NBOOK]] fairly easily. I've also found quite a bit about the series as a whole, so I've kept that information on the main page for the series since it's a bit more easy to post it there than to repeat the same information on each individual page. We could probably include some of the information on Wake's entry to the main page, as it has info about the themes and so on, but I'll leave that to someone more familiar with the series. In any case, notability has now been established.

*'''Aside?''' [[WP:NCBK#Standard disambiguation]] is clear to me that we avoid [[Wake (Robert J. Sawyer novel)]] in favor of [[Wake (Sawyer novel)]], or [[Wake (WWW trilogy)]] or even [[Wake (WWW)]] if "WWW" is (very) well known. Certainly not "WWW" in this case; I guess "Sawyer novel".
: If we do retain four pages for the Sawyer series, then [[Wonder (novel)]] should be moved. As I understand it, rename both that and [[Wonder (R.J. Palacio novel)]] to use "Sawyer novel" and "Palacio novel". --[[User:P64|P64]] ([[User talk:P64|talk]]) 20:21, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:: P.S. I visited and confirmed or corrected the three disambiguation pages and all "What links here" from Article space--to the trilogy article and two sequel articles only. ''Wake'' and Sawyer are the only articles that link to those last three pages. --[[User:P64|P64]] ([[User talk:P64|talk]]) 21:19, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep all''', following improvements by [[User:Tokyogirl79]]. However, even before the improvements, I would probably have been looking to keep either the ''Wake'' or the series article. I personally think Sawyer rather second-rate, but he consistently gets enough favourable critical attention to make any of his novels likely, though not certain, to be notable enough for a stand-alone article. Further, while the [[Hugo Award]] nomination probably does not automatically make ''Wake'' notable, Hugo-nominated novels are subject to a lot of critical attention within the science fiction field - enough, in fact, that I would be surprised if any Hugo-nominated novel could not be shown to be notable. In the case of ''Wake'' (and indeed the other novels here), [[User:Tokyogirl79]] has now in fact demonstrated notability. (By the way, I have corrected one bit of [[User:Tokyogirl79]]'s work - the award won by ''Wake'' was in fact the [[Prix Aurora Award]], which is commonly informally referred to in English just as the Aurora Award.)

*'''Merge''' individual book articles into trilogy article, unless sufficient work can be done to make the books' articles worthwhile alone. [[User:Radagast|Radagast]] ([[User talk:Radagast|talk]]) 18:52, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
