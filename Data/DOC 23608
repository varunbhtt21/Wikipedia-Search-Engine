Title : Royal Prayer Book
Text : The '''Royal Prayer Book''' (London, British Library Royal MS 2.A.XX) is a collection of prayers believed to have been copied in the late eighth century or the early ninth century.<ref>Joseph Crowley, ‘Anglicized
Word Order in Old English Continuous Interlinear Glosses in British Library, Royal 2. A. XX’, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 29 (2000), 123–51, at 123 n. 2; N. R. Ker, ''Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1957), pp. 317–18 [no. 248]</ref> It was written in West [[Mercia]], likely either in or around Worcester.<ref>Patrick Sims-Williams, ''Religion and Literature in Western England 600–800'', Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 279–80; cf.

It is one of four early Anglo-Saxon prayerbooks, all of which have some textual interrelationships: the [[Book of Cerne]], the [[Harleian prayerbook]], and the [[Book of Nunnaminster]]. The prayers are mainly in [[Latin]] but have some Old English and Greek elements.<ref>A. N. Doane (ed.), ''Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile: Volume 1'', Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 136 (Binghamton NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1994), pp. 52–9 [no. 283].</ref> Its general theme ‘would appear to be Christ as the healer of mankind’, and its concern with physical healing is sufficient to suggest that it ‘might have functioned as a devotional, and practical, tool for a physician’.<ref>Michelle P. Brown, ‘Female Book-Ownership and Production in Anglo-Saxon England: The Evidence of the Ninth-Century Prayerbooks’, in ''Lexis and Texts in Early English: Studies Presented to Jane Roberts'', ed. Christian Kay and Louise M. Sylvester, Costerus New Series, 133 (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001), pp. 45–67 (at pp. 56, 57); cf. Patrick Sims-Williams, ''Religion and Literature in Western England 600–800'', Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), pp. 275–327</ref>

Folio 45v contains what seems to be the first manuscript attestation in any Germanic language of the common noun ''[[elf]]''.<ref>Alaric Hall, ''Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity'', Anglo-Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007), pp. 71-72.</ref>

The manuscript also contains detailed Old English glosses from the tenth century in the Mercian dialect of Old English.<ref>A. N. Doane (ed.), ''Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts in Microfiche Facsimile: Volume 1'', Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 136 (Binghamton NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1994), p. 52 [no. 283].</ref>
