==History==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
For much of its history Houston was overwhelmingly Christian. The amounts of other religious groups did not grow because for the most part immigration was predominately from majority Christian Europe, favored by the quotas in federal immigration law at the time. The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] removed the quotas, allowing for the growth of other religions.<ref name=Barden-Smithdiversity/>

In 2016 the Kinder Houston Area Survey of the [[Kinder Institute]], [[Rice University]] polled Houston area residents on whether they attend religious services other than weddings and funerals within the past month. 45% of respondents stated that they did, a decline from previous eras, when a majority of those polled stated they did.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holeywell|first= Ryan|url=http://urbanedge.blogs.rice.edu/2016/04/25/in-houston-the-land-of-megachurches-fewer-people-attending-religious-services/|title=In Houston, the Land of Megachurches, Religious Service Attendance Declines|publisher=The Kinder Institute @ [[Rice University]]|date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>
