== Features ==
WebWatcher utilizes a [[client-server]] architecture which monitors and records user activity on the client machine. After data is recorded, it is then [[encrypted]] and transmitted through a secure [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] connection to a remote server. The user can then login to a website portal to view this recorded data.<ref>{{cite web|title=webwatcher.com|url=http://www.webwatcher.com/|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> This process allows a customer to view the recorded data remotely. WebWatcher also offers a Risk Free Trial for Android, iOS, Windows, Mac & [[Chromebook]] platforms.

== Reception and Criticism ==
WebWatcher received the [[PC Magazine]] editors' choice award in a 2011 review of Parental Control & Monitoring software. In the article, WebWatcher was referred to as "Heavy-handed" saying: "if you find it necessary to track a child who's engaging in risky activities, WebWatcher will record every detail and even send you instant notification when it encounters certain words."<ref name="pcmag" /> Also, [[About.com]] readers named WebWatcher as the "Best [[Internet safety|Internet Safety]] Tool" as part of its 2011 Readers' Choice Awards.<ref>{{cite web

Critics have noted that since the software runs stealth on a device, there is an opportunity for the software to be installed illegally. To mitigate this issue, WebWatcher requires administrator credentials to be installed on a device.<ref>{{cite web
