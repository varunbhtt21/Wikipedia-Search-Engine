The site is abandoned allotments next to [[Tolworth Brook]]. The stream is of low wildlife value as it is in culvert with no vegetation. There is a dense thicket of elms, and a trip next to the brook which has mature oak, ash and sycamore trees. Most of the site is grassland dominated by [[Arrhenatherum|oat grass]] and [[cock's foot]].<ref name=LEU/>

The entrance in the road called Edith Gardens, off Raeburn Avenue, is kept locked and there is no public access.
