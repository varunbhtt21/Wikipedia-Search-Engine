== Mythology ==
[[Parashurama]] teaches [[Karna]] the use of  all his celestial weapons that he[[Parashurama]] obtained from [[Shiva]] himself including Bhargavastra, (Karna has to make a promise to his teacher that he will never use those weapon against any warrior)Rudra Astra,[[Pashupatastra]],Maheshwarastra and [[Vajra]]. He ([[Parashurama]]) advised [[Karna]] that to obtain [[Nandaka]] sword, [[Vaishnavastra]] and [[Narayanastra]] he must have to take penance(austerity) to Lord [[Vishnu]. After 10 years of penance he made Lord Vishnu happy and obtained those celestial weapons from him but he had to  promise Vishnu that he will only use the weapon on that warrior who targets him with that weapon first and he must never tell anyone that he has those celestial weapons too.
However, in the aftermath of discovering he([[Karna]]) was not a Brahmin,[[Parashurama]] cursed him that he will forget all his knowledge when he will need it the most at the time when he fights with someone whom he always wanted to defeat ”.

===Karna and Parashurama===

[[Parashurama]] took [[Karna]] as his student after enquiring about his lineage as explained in the [[Mahabharatha]].Parashurama gave his student his celestial weapons and his bow Vijaya to shoot celestial weapons because normal bow breaks when summoning celestial weapons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kotru |first1=Umesh |last2=Zutshi |first2=Ashutosh |title=Karna The Unsung Hero of the Mahabharata |date=2015 |publisher=Leadstart Publishing PvtLtd |isbn=9789352013043 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tBMfCAAAQBAJ&q=Parashurama&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=5#v=onepage&q=Vijaya&f=false |language=en}}</ref>

===Kurukshetra war===

In the [[Kurukshetra war]], where [[Krishna]] always parises Karna when he fires simple arrows on [[Arjuna]] and [[Krishna]] chariot and the chariot goes back 3 steps on 15th night.
Karna used the Vijaya bow on 17th day.
Coming out after meeting Yudishtir ,knowing Karna's might, Krishna on the 17th day warned Arjuna,praised Karna's might and prowess and explained his merits.


 "Karna is possessed of might. He is proud and accomplished in weapons. He is a maharatha. He is accomplished (in the ways of battle) and conversant with all modes of warfare. He is also well-acquainted with all that suits place and time. What need is there of saying much? Hear in brief, O son of Pandu! I regard the mighty car-warrior Karna as thy equal, or perhaps, thy superior! With the greatest care and resolution shouldst thou slay him in great battle. In energy he is equal to Sankara(Shiva) himself. As regards speed, he is equal to the impetuosity of the wind. In wrath, he resembles the Destroyer(Shiva) himself again. Endued with might, he resembles a lion in the formation of his body. He is eight ratnis in stature. His arms are large. His chest is broad. He is invincible. He is sensitive. He is a hero. He is, again, the foremost of heroes. He is exceedingly handsome. Possessed of every accomplishment of a warrior, he is a dispeller of the fears of friends. Engaged in the good of Dhritarashtra's son, he always hates the sons of Pandu. No one, not even the gods with Vasava weilding his thunder at their head, can slay the son of Radha. Slay, therefore, the Suta's son today. No one possessed of flesh and blood, not even the gods fighting with great care, not all the warriors of the three worlds fighting together can vanquish that car-warrior."|}}
