==Reception==
Catriona Wightman of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' described the show as not particularly enjoyable and having little depth, writing that "it all feels like a home movie" which "doesn't necessarily make for compelling television".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wightman|first1=Catriona|title=Tom Daley Goes Global review: Did his backpacking make a splash?|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/review/a563848/tom-daley-goes-global-review-did-his-backpacking-make-a-splash/|accessdate=22 July 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=10 April 2014}}</ref> Rhik Samadder of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "duller than the back of a scuffed spoon", arguing that the "sight of vague celebrities going on holiday does not make great television".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Samadder|first1=Rhik|title=Tom Daley going backpacking is a poor excuse for a TV show|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/apr/11/tom-daley-goes-global-weekend-escapes-warwick-davis|accessdate=22 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 April 2014}}</ref>
