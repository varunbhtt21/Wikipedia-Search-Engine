| ShortSummary    = Ragnar tells Björn that he never wanted to be king, but only to explore and farm. Ragnar wants to return to Wessex to claim the land promised by King Ecbert. Floki feels that his new family with Helga is too happy, while Rollo wishes to be away from Siggy. Þórunn desires to be a shieldmaiden like Lagertha, much to Björn's displeasure; he believes her to be carrying his child. When Lagertha announces she intends to raid with Ragnar, Kalf, her right-hand man, offers to remain and take care of Hedeby. When they arrive in Wessex, King Ecbert informs Ragnar that to receive their land, the Vikings must fight for Princess Kwenthrith to appease King Ecbert's nobles. Lagertha is unsure about joining, so King Ecbert offers her the job of leading the Viking settlers in Wessex. The settlers go to the land to farm, while the warriors defeat Kwenthrith's uncle's army.
