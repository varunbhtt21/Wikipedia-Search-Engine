'''COSMIC-2''' also known as '''FORMOSAT-7''', is the  [[Satellite constellation|constellation of satellites]] for [[meteorology]], [[ionosphere]], [[climatology]], and [[space weather]] research.  FORMOSAT-7 is a joint US-[[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] project including [[National Space Organization]] (NSPO) on the Taiwanese side and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) on the US side. FORMOSAT-7 is the successor of [[Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate|FORMOSAT-3]]<ref name = NSPO3/> The six satellites of the constellation were launched 25 June 2019 on a [[Falcon Heavy]] rocket.

==Pre-launch==
On April 15th 2019 the satellites were placed aboard a [[China Airlines]] cargo plane at [[Taoyuan International Airport]]. The six satellites were packed in three climate controlled transport crates. The satellites were shipped as [[diplomatic pouch]] to speed their journey through US customs, the first time a satellite had been shipped as such.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Everington |first1=Keoni |title=Taiwan's FormoSat-7 group shipped to Florida for launch |url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3680497 |website=taiwannews.com |publisher=Taiwan News |accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref>
