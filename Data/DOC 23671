Text : {{italic title}}

'''''Valentine Road''''' is a documentary film by director Marta Cunningham. In 2008 Cunningham read a [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] article about the murder of an openly gay non-conforming 15-year-old, Lawrence King. He was [[Murder of Larry King|shot and killed]] in his middle school classroom by classmate 14-year-old Brandon McInerney.

Investigating the case Cunningham felt compelled to challenge what she perceived as a homophobic portrayal of King in the mainstream media. She began attending McInerney’s pre-trial motions and hearings. “The more she looked into the case, the more she uncovered a web of complications and nuance that just wasn’t being given a fair hearing by the media, let alone the courts.”<ref>. http://www.indiewire.com/article/heroines-of-cinema-marta-cunningham-explains-the-valentines-tragedy-that-turned-her-into-a-filmmaker?page=1#articleHeaderPanel</ref>

Embedding herself in the rural blue collar town of Oxnard, Cunningham spent five years developing trust with the community and accumulating over 350 hours of footage. The result was an 89-minute documentary in which: “Cunningham masterfully weaves a kind of cinematic memorial quilt to King, who, just prior to his death, was living in a group home/treatment center away from his adoptive parents. Emotional input from the boy's deeply supportive friends and teachers, including several who witnessed the classroom shooting, provides much of the backbone… The case's prosecuting attorney and McInerney's devoted defense lawyers, along with police detectives, hate-crime experts and several unapologetically pro-McInerney jurors, also weigh in. Archival news footage, school surveillance video and courtroom renderings round out this powerful, heartbreaking reminder of the bold, cross-dressing boy with a misplaced crush who was too often deemed the cause of his own murder.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-valentine-road-review-20131004-story.html|title=Review: Murder of gay teen memorialized in 'Valentine Road'|date=3 October 2013|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>
