== Supporters ==

The official supporters group of Saint Louis FC is the St. Louligans. The St. Louligans were founded in 2010 when several local soccer fan groups joined forces at [[AC St. Louis]] home games. These small groups eventually decided to create a new group to unite them all, and the St. Louligans were born. They have provided strong support for a number of St. Louis area soccer teams, including: AC St. Louis, [[Saint Louis Athletica]], [[St. Louis Lions]], and [[Illinois Piasa]] <ref>{{cite web|title=St. Louligans|url=http://saintlouisfc.com/landing/supportersgroup|publisher=Saint Louis FC|accessdate=October 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006172346/http://www.saintlouisfc.com/landing/supportersgroup|archivedate=October 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Saint Louis FC is working very closely with the St. Louligans to encourage their support, and on July 9, 2014, the club awarded the Louligans with the first Saint Louis FC season ticket. The group has promised that for each home game, they will give a new fan the ticket as a way to encourage new fans to join the St. Louligans and support Saint Louis FC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Saint Louis FC Awards First Season Ticket|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4830096|publisher=Our Sports Central|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=July 10, 2014}}</ref>

== Colors and logo ==

The club conducted a fan vote to decide the team's crest.<ref name="auto"/> The logo chosen includes a fleur-de-lis, which acts as the focal point of the logo and pays tribute to Saint Louis' French heritage. Also included in the logo is a reference to the year the city was founded, 1764, and five lines to represent the club's five core values: unity, humility, passion, respect, and tradition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pro Soccer in St. Louis|url=http://saintlouisfc.com/history|publisher=Saint Louis FC|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}</ref>
