==Early life==
Dalelkhan Sugirbayev was born in 1906 to a nomadic [[Kazakhs in China|Kazakh]] family in the [[Bayan-Ölgii Province|Bayan-Ölgii Region]] of what was then [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] [[China]] and now the westernmost ''[[aimag]]'' of [[Mongolia]].<ref name=DGC>(Chinese) [http://www.81.cn/yljnt/2014-01/20/content_5741785.htm 杜根成, "达列力汗·苏古尔巴也夫" 中华英烈网] 2014-01-20</ref> His grandfather and father were both chieftains of the Qieruqi branch of the Abaq [[Qaraei|Kerey tribe]].<ref name=DGC/>  Other sources say they were part of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] tribe.<ref>[[#Forbes|Forbes 1986]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&dq=warlords+and+muslims&q=dalil+khan#v=snippet&q=dalil%20khan&f=false 332 n.40]</ref> The family moved about the pastures in the [[Altai Mountains]], separating Mongolia and Xinjiang.<ref name=DGC/>

When his father died in 1918, his older brother, Duerbuti Khan, became chief.<ref name=DGC/> In 1921, remnants of [[White movement|White Russian]] troops under Andrei Stephanovich Bakich entered the [[Tacheng| Tacheng region]] with the [[Soviet Red Army]] in pursuit.<ref name=DGC/> After several thousand White Russians crossed the [[Irtysh River]], Duerbuti agreed to help the Red Army gather intelligence on the intruders.<ref name=DGC/> When Bakich learned that the local chieftain had refused to give livestock to his army and was helping the Soviets, he went to arrest Duerbuti.<ref name=DGC/> The White Russians came during Dalelkhan's wedding. They seized his brother and the family's wealth.<ref name=DGC/> A month later, Duerbuti was executed and Dalelkhan fled to the Red Army, who defeated the White Russians.<ref name=DGC/>

In the spring of 1930, Dalelkhan sent his mother and brother from Bayan-Ölgii, which had become part of independent Mongolia, to the Ashan ([[Altay Prefecture|Altay]]) region of Xinjiang.<ref name=DGC/>  Later, he followed them with a thousand tribesman.<ref name=DGC/>

==Leadership in Xinjiang==
Xinjiang at the time was ruled by warlord governor [[Sheng Shicai]].<ref name=DGC/> Dalelkhan was made the deputy chairman of the Society for the Advancement of Kazakh Culture.<ref name=DGC/> In 1937, he became a core member of the Anti-Imperialist Society of the Altay region.<ref name=DGC/> In September 1939, after the outbreak of [[World War II]], Sheng Shicai began to move away from Soviet-backing.<ref name=DGC/> Dalelkhan opposed Sheng Shicai and moved to the Soviet Union to study.<ref name=DGC/> He received military training in [[Almaty]] and in October 1943, proposed organizing a national liberation army in Altay, Xinjiang.<ref name=DGC/> By then Sheng Shicai had severed ties with [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] and the Soviet authorities supported Dalelkhan's plans.<ref name=DGC/>  They sent a team of 12 military advisors to accompany him back to Ashan (Altay), via Mongolia, and they set up a militia base in [[Qinggil County]], where they taught Kazakh nomads about the ideas of revolution and trained them into a partisan force.<ref name=DGC/>

Dalelkhan then joined forces with [[Osman Batur]], an ethnic Kazakh guerrilla leader who had a larger following and backing from the Mongolian government.<ref name=GZX>(Chinese) [http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_60f25ed70102ee3e.html 菅志翔, "结构、现实需要与文化传承 ——以乌斯满的行为逻辑和社会互动为例"] 2013-10-25</ref> Osman Batur's mother was from the Qieruqi tribe, and Dalelkhan's mother asked her to have Osman take care of Dalelkhan.<ref name=GZX/> On account of the blood relations, Osman trusted Dalelkhan and gave him an important leadership position.<ref name=GZX/>

===Rebellion in 1944===
In February 1944, Osman and Dalelkhan's Kazakh guerrilla force rebelled against Sheng Shicai's government and captured the Qinggil County seat.<ref name=DGC/> By April, the rebels had 1,000 fighters and spread the rebellion to [[Jeminay County|Jeminay]], [[Fuhai County|Fuhai]], [[Habahe County|Habahe]] and Chenghua ([[Altay City|Altay]]).<ref name=DGC/> In October, the rebel forces established a revolutionary government in the Altay region.<ref name=DGC/> After the outbreak of the [[Ili Rebellion]] in the [[Ili valley]], the Kazakhs began to cooperate with the [[Ili National Army]], under the Russian commander A. Leskin.<ref name=DGC/>

In February 1945, the rebels captured Jeminay.<ref name=DGC/> In early August 1945, Osman and Dalelkhan attacked Chenghua, with the help of the Mongolian army, but could not capture the city.<ref name=INA>(Chinese) [http://military.china.com/history4/62/20140303/18370969_2.html "历史上的新疆民族军：新疆“三区革命”的主力军(3)"  新疆哲学社会科学网] 2014-03-03</ref> In September, they surrounded the city.<ref name=INA/>  Nationalist Chinese defenders fled for the Mongolian border but were refused entry, and surrendered.<ref name=DGC/><ref name=INA/>  On September 20, the guerrilla forces around Altay was organized into the Altay Kazakh Cavalry Battalion with Dalelkhan as commander.<ref name=INA/>

===Coalition government===
Then, the political situation changed as the Nationalist leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] pressed the Soviet Union to cease support for the rebellion.<ref name=DGC/> A ceasefire in October halted the fighting.<ref name=DGC/> On November 17, 1945, Dalelkhan issued orders protecting the legal and property rights of ethnic [[Han Chinese]] in the Altay region.<ref name=DGC/>

In the summer of 1946, the leaders of the Ili Uprising agreed to set aside their declaration of an independent [[Second East Turkestan Republic|East Turkestan Republic]] and joined in a coalition government with the Nationalists in [[Dihua]].<ref name=DGC/>  Dalelkhan became the minister of the health bureau in the provincial government.<ref name=DGC/><ref>[[#Benson|Benson 1990]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=suuXIhetjZcC&pg=PA197&dq=Delilhan&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eMFjU8OkI-LfsASW7oGwBw&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Delilhan&f=false 71]</ref>

Tensions remained high between the rebels in the three districts of northern Xinjiang and the Nationalist authorities which controlled the rest of the province.<ref name=DGC/> After the outbreak of full-scale [[Chinese Civil War|civil war between the Nationalists and Communists]] in [[China proper]], the Nationalists persuaded Osman Batur to change sides.<ref name=DGC/> Osman resented the Soviet influence in the revolutionary government and joined the Nationalists.<ref name=GZX/> Dalelkhan supported the Soviets and broke with Osman.<ref name=Forbes203/><ref name=GZX/>

In November 1946, Osman Batur attacked Fuhai.<ref name=DGC/> From January to March 1947, he launched five raids on Chenghua.<ref name=DGC/>  The Three Districts government expelled Osman Batur and designated Dalelkhan as the executive of the Altay District.<ref name=DGC/> In August 1947, Osman Batur and the Nationalists attacked the Altay District.<ref name=DGC/> After two months of heavy fighting, the Ili National Army under the command of Dalelkhan and Leskin repelled the invasion.

===Cooperation with the Chinese Communists===
In September 1948, he became the chair of the Altay chapter of the "Union to Protect Peace and Democracy in Xinjiang."  The Union was formed by the progressive faction within the Ili government, in opposition to the pan-Turkic and pan-Islamists in the government.<ref name=DGC/> In November 1948, as the Chinese Communists turned the tide in the civil war, Dalelikhan spoke enthusiastically of having the INA joining forces with the [[People's Liberation Army]].<ref name=DGC/>

In August 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] invited the Ili leadership to attend a [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|political consultative conference]] in Beiping (now [[Beijing]]) to plan the establishment of a new national government.<ref name=DGC/> On August 19, Dalelkhan received the invitation in [[Burqin County|Burqin]] and sought to fly to Yining to join the main leadership delegation, but the airplane carrying him had engine problems near [[Hoboksar Mongol Autonomous County|Hoboksar]] and was forced to turn back.<ref name=DGC/> He then drove to Yining and met the Chinese Communist representative [[Deng Liqun]].<ref name=DGC/> He departed for Beiping via the Soviet Union with [[Ehmetjan Qasim]], [[Abdulkerim Abbas]], [[Ishaq Beg Munonov]] and [[Luo Zhi]].  All died when their airplane crashed in the [[Transbaikal]] region on or about August 27, 1949.<ref name=DGC/><ref name=NewChina1>(Chinese) [http://military.china.com/zh_cn/history4/62/20051003/12712023.html 新中国和平解放新疆内幕 (1)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324022017/http://military.china.com/zh_cn/history4/62/20051003/12712023.html |date=2014-03-24 }} 2005-10-03</ref>
