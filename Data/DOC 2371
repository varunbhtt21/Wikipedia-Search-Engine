'''Bro-country''' is a subgenre of mainstream [[country music]] originating in the second decade of the 21st century that is influenced by 21st-century [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[hard rock]] and [[electronica]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/music/features/despite-detractors-bro-country-may-be-a-bellwether-of-nashvilles-future-1201364802/ |title=Despite Detractors, Bro-Country May Be a Bellwether of Nashville’s Future |author=Andrew Barker |date=November 26, 2014 |work=Variety }}</ref> Bro-country songs are often  about attractive young women, the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], partying, and [[pickup truck]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/11/02/critics-have-truck-with-bro-country-song-themes/oFLguHPNX7FCHTWb0DNOhJ/story.html|title=For songwriters, a country divide|last=Rodman|first=Sarah|date=2 November 2013|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2014/mar/09/luke-bryan-is-the-poster-boy-for-the-new/|title=Luke Bryan is poster boy for Nashville's new 'bro-country'|last=Bream|first=Jon|date=9 March 2014|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|accessdate=24 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602052353/http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2014/mar/09/luke-bryan-is-the-poster-boy-for-the-new |archivedate=June 2, 2014 }}</ref>

The first use of the term was by [[Jody Rosen]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in an article published on August 11, 2013, in which Rosen described songs by [[Florida Georgia Line]], particularly their debut single "[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]". Rosen also named [[Luke Bryan]], [[Jason Aldean]], and [[Jake Owen]] among singers of the genre.<ref name="vulture">{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/rise-of-bro-country-florida-georgia-line.html|title=Jody Rosen on the Rise of Bro-Country|last=Rosen|first=Jody|date=11 August 2013|work=Vulture.com|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' cited "[[Boys 'Round Here]]" by [[Blake Shelton]] and "[[Ready Set Roll]]" by [[Chase Rice]]  as other examples of bro-country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/10/18/bro-country-beer-trucks-lyrics/|title=Country brodown: Every truck, beer, jeans, moonlight, and 'girl' reference on the current chart|last=Smith|first=Grady|date=18 October 2013|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

The genre drew criticism from other country singers; artists who have spoken against the bro-country subgenre include [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], [[Jean Shepard]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[George Strait]], [[Gary Allan]], [[Naomi Judd]], [[Brad Paisley]], classic rock icon [[Tom Petty]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], and [[Zac Brown]].<ref name="smith">{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/10/01/country-music-identity-crisis/|title=How country music went crazy: A comprehensive timeline of the genre's identity crisis|last=Smith|first=Grady|date=1 October 2013|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The popularity of the genre opened up a divide between the older generation of country singers and the bro-country singers which was described as "civil war" by musicians, critics and journalists.<ref name=time/>

==Popularity==

Although elements of bro-country had been noted prior, such as in the [[Trace Adkins]] hit "[[Honky Tonk Badonkadonk]]", the genre began to gather steam in the early 2010s, but the song that brought the movement to the attention of music journalists was the 2012 [[Florida Georgia Line]] song "[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]".<ref name="vulture"/> In 2014, "Cruise" became the best-selling digital country song of all time,<ref name="best-selling">{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5862305/florida-georgia-line-cruise-sets-all-time-country-sales-record |title=Florida Georgia Line's 'Cruise' Sets All-Time Country Sales Record |author= Wade Jessen |date =January 6, 2014 |work=Billboard}}</ref> with over 7 million copies sold in the US while also holding a then-record 24 weeks as the No. 1 Hot Country Song.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rob|first1=Tannenbaum|title=Rap Whiskey Worship Repeat|journal=Billboard|date=14 October 2014|volume=126|issue=34|pages=44–49}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-meghan-trainor-giant-slayer-204426293.html |title=Chart Watch: Meghan Trainor, Giant Slayer|author=Paul Grein |date= September 10, 2014 |work=Yahoo Music!

A number of highly popular albums and songs by singers such as Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton considered to be bro-country appeared in the first half of the 2010s. In 2013, Luke Bryan's ''[[Crash My Party]]'' was the third best-selling of all albums in the US, with Florida Georgia Line's ''[[Here's to the Good Times]]'' at sixth and Blake Shelton's ''[[Based on a True Story...|Based on a True Story]]'' at ninth.<ref name="fox">{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/06/12/country-music-is-not-dead-give-bro-chance-country.html |title=Country music is not dead: Give bro’ country a chance|author= Sasha Bogursky |date= June 12, 2014 |work=Fox News }}</ref> It has also been estimated in research in mid-2010s that about 45 percent of country’s best-selling songs could be considered bro-country, with the top two artists being Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1750831/bro-country-mashup-guy-confronts-radio-programmers/ |title=Bro Country Mashup Guy Confronts Radio Programmers: What Does the Future of Country Radio Hold?|author =Chris Parton |date=February 26, 2015 |work=CMT}}</ref>

While bro-country was popular with country music fans, programmers and those within the industry grew weary of the genre. According to radio programmer R.J. Curtis: "The real fatigue on it has been with [radio] programmers and the people who have to listen to it a lot and evaluate it — the air personalities and the program directors. The people who aren't really sick of it are the listeners."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/why-country-radio-still-matters-20150224 |title=Why Country Radio Still Matters|author= Adam Gold |date=February 24, 2015 |work= RollingStone }}</ref> Some thought that the genre had waned by 2015;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/07/bro-country-dying-genre |title=Rejoice! Bro-country is dying out as new ideas push genre into bolder territory |author=Grady Smith |work=Guardian |date=July 7, 2015 }}</ref> others, however, felt that the genre remained popular and argued that it had expanded in a positive way.  According to radio [[program director]] Phathead: "The hip-hop, rock and R&B influence you hear in [[Sam Hunt (musician)|Sam Hunt]], [[Thomas Rhett]], [[Brett Eldredge]], [[Cole Swindell]] and all the others is about to take us to new places, and it's awesome."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/radio/6670370/is-bro-country-over-and-what-is-its-lasting-legacy |title=Is Bro Country Over...

==Criticism==
The bro-country movement has been criticized by listeners and music reviewers for its subject matter, namely repeated lyrical themes of partying associated with Friday nights, alcoholic beverages, and trucks, as well as its exclusion of female country artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundposts/2014/03/04/women-edged-out-by-bro-country-party-song-trend/|title=Women edged out by ‘bro-country’ party song trend?|date=4 March 2014|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> Traditional country fans and artists have expressed the sentiment that bro-country music is a poor representation of country music. One critic who spoke favorably about bro-country was David Horsey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who wrote: "But this music has an appeal not unlike the teen surfing songs of [[the Beach Boys]] or the screaming guitar, take-everything-too-far anthems of [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Sammy Hagar]]...For a young man, the allure of reckless freedom is forever strong. And it’s not just young men. I know I’ve got a 25-year-old bottled up inside my decidedly not young self who still longs for the fantasy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/12/entertainment/la-et-ct-horsey-on-hollywood-bro-country-20140312|title=Are bro-mantic songs taking over country music?|last=Horsey|first=David|date=12 March 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

The genre was also criticized for being formulaic. Throughout 2014, radio station [[KTCK (AM)]] had a regular segment called "Fun With Country Music" hosted by [[Corby Davidson]], criticizing the new form of country music, and produced a checklist of specific items that would be found in these songs: boots, alcohol, jeans, trucks, guns, farm equipment, the word "girl", and rural settings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCarthy|first1=Amy|title=The Hardline's "Fun With Country Music" is a Brilliant Skewer of Bro-Country Lyrics|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/the-hardlines-fun-with-country-music-is-a-brilliant-skewer-of-bro-country-lyrics-7048986|accessdate=26 August 2016|work=Dallas Observer|date=4 September 2014}}</ref>  A video by Greg Todd, an aspiring songwriter, which highlighted the similarities between bro-country songs went viral after being featured by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8SwIvxj8o|title=Mind-Blowing SIX Song Country Mashup!|work=YouTube: Sir Mashalot|date=4 November 2014|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref><ref name="sixsongssametune">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/01/14/country-music-mash-up-luke-bryan-blake-shelton-florida-georgia-line/21751561/ |title=Six songs, same tune?

Todd noted the formula as "a tight, mid-tempo backbeat; a quick, two-verse set-up, often laced with clever wordplay and bouncy, lyrical melody; and — bam — the power chorus to bring it all home and keep them coming back."<ref name="sixsongssametune" />

In addition, some also criticized the music's portrayal of women.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Amy|title=Bro Country's Sexism Is Ruining Country Music|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2014/06/bro_country_sexism_ruining_country_music.php|website=blogs.dallasobserver.com|publisher=Dallas Observer|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>  In November 2014, country artist [[Kenny Chesney]], interviewed by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', opined about bro-country: "over the last several years, it seems like anytime anybody sings about a woman, she’s in cutoff jeans, drinking and on a tailgate... they objectify the hell out of them."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/kenny-chesney-billboard-bro-country/ |title=Kenny Chesney Covers Billboard, Speaks Out on Country Songs That ‘Objectify’ Women|author= Sterling Whitaker |work=Taste of Country}}</ref>

In December 2014, [[Brad Paisley]] spoke out against bro-country and the lack of females on country radio: "one of my frustrations with radio now is lyrics: [...] there's a lot of stuff on the radio about, you know, put your tan legs on the dashboard and we'll roll around in the truck and go party. It's like, 'Guys, come on!' – and specifically, yes, guys, 'cause there are no girls! We can say something, too. There are phrases that are totally cliché that we as songwriters owe it to ourselves to not use again."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/article/brad-paisley-country-music-legacy |title=Brad Paisley on Lazy Lyrics, Nashville's Guy Problem – and Why He Doesn't Think He'll Leave a Legacy |author=Eileen Finan |date=December 2, 2014|work=People }}</ref>

In 2017, [[Steve Earle]] noted that the genre was, in some ways, a watered-down form of hip hop, stating that "The guys just wanna sing about getting (censored) up. They’re just doing hip-hop for people who are afraid of black people. I like the new [[Kendrick Lamar]] record, so I’ll just listen to that.”<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/steve-earle-country-music-nashville-chris-stapleton-kendrick-lamar-oasis-a7791486.html|title=Steve Earle: 'My wife left me for a younger, skinnier, less talented singer' |author=Simon Hattenstone |date=June 14, 2017|work=The Guardian }}</ref>

===Response===
In response to the criticisms, Blake Shelton said in January 2013 that he did not care about the "old farts" who complained about their songs: "Well that's because you don't buy records anymore, jackass. The kids do, and they don't want to buy the music you were buying."<ref name="smith"/> In turn, that sparked a response from [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] via his [[Facebook]] page: "It's a shame that I have spend {{sic}} 63 years in this business trying to introduce music to a larger audience and to make it easier for the younger artists who are coming behind me. ... You should be so lucky as us old-timers. Check back in 63 years (the year 2075) and let us know how your music will be remembered." Shelton later apologized to Ray Price.<ref name="smith"/>

Zac Brown described Luke Bryan’s "[[That's My Kind of Night]]" as the worst song he had ever heard, to which Jason Aldean replied, "nobody gives a shit what u think."<ref name=time /> Aldean also called the term bro-country ridiculous and was bothered to be labeled as such because he did not "feel like it's a compliment," that "it's sort of a [[Backhanded compliment|backhanded]] thing that comes from a very narrow-minded listener".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/05/jason_aldean_talks_about_the_r.html |title=Jason Aldean talks about the 'ridiculous' bro-country label, the Tidal 'misconception' and Hersheypark |author=Jewel Wicker |date= May 28, 2015 |work=Penn Live }}</ref>  On his song about drinking and trucks, he said: "Yeah, we've had some songs that talk about that stuff. But that's also what we really grew up doing. A lot of us grew up in these little towns where there wasn't a whole lot to do, and we were entertaining ourselves. I can't sing you a song about being a stockbroker on Wall Street, because I don't even know where the hell Wall Street's at."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/6258750/jason-aldean-billboard-cover-story |title=Billboard Cover: Jason Aldean on the Curse of Nashville, 'Baby-Making Music' and Dealing With Tabloid Scandals|author= Chris Willman |date= September 19, 2014 |work=Billboard }}</ref>

Rosen himself was unhappy the way the term bro-country had been used by some as an insult and felt that some criticisms of the genre came from class and regional prejudices and snobbery. He thought that artists such as [[Jake Owen]] and [[Thomas Rhett]] made music that pushed the genre into "exciting new territory" and said: "All the ways country is flirting with R&B and hip hop, production-wise and otherwise, I think it’s really cool." To Rosen, bro-country has changed country in a positive way, producing an increasing diversity of sound and subject matter on country radio.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/17/burdens-of-bro-country-critics-term-gone-wild |title=The burdens of 'bro-country', a music critic's term gone wild |author=Grady Smith |work=Guardian |date=August 17, 2015 }}</ref>

==Reactions in music==
A number of country singers expressed their criticism of the genre in their songs.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/bro-down-10-signs-countrys-maligned-trend-may-be-on-the-decline-20140721 |title= Bro Down! 10 Signs Country's Maligned Trend May Be on the Decline |work= RollingStone |date=July 21, 2014 |author=Jewly Hight }}</ref> In July 2014, female duo [[Maddie & Tae]] released their debut single, "[[Girl in a Country Song]]", which criticized and referenced many bro-country songs, particularly the roles of females within such songs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martins|first1=Chris|title=MADDIE & TAE WILL LEAD THE BRO-COUNTRY BACKLASH|journal=Billboard|date=17 January 2015|volume=127|issue=1|page=41}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dalfonzo|first1=Gina|title=The Bro-Country Backlash Is Here|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/07/girl-in-a-country-song-maddie-marlow-and-tae-dye-the-bro-country-backlash-starts-now/373982/|accessdate=7 October 2014|work=The Atlantic|date=7 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Conaway|first1=Alanna|title=Has The Bro-Country "Backlash" Begun?

In the song she praises bro-country songs, saying she actually wants to be the girl in their songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/maggie-rose-puts-the-girl-in-bro-country-song-premiere-20140715 |title=Maggie Rose Puts the 'Girl' in Bro Country — Song Premiere|author= Beville Dunkerley |date=July 15, 2014|work= RollingStone }}</ref>

In August 2014, country artist [[Brad Paisley]] recorded a song called "4WP" for his album ''[[Moonshine in the Trunk]]''. In the song, Paisley pokes fun at bro-country by joining the trend and heavily relying on some of its recurrent elements. A sample of Paisley's hit single "[[Mud on the Tires (song)|Mud on the Tires]]" is also featured in the song. About the song, Paisley said: "In the middle of this bro-country movement, with all this criticism about [the genre's reliance on] the jean shorts and the mud and the outdoors, we do a song that's just like that... but we include a sample of myself from 2003! Which is kind of like saying, 'I have a little license. I kinda did this already'. But it's written so tongue-in-cheek, and it doesn't take itself too seriously."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/brad-paisley-talks-pot-rock-riffs-and-flying-with-obama-20140825 |title=Brad Paisley Talks Pot, Rock Riffs and Flying With Obama|author= Andrew Leahey |date=August 25, 2014 |work= RollingStone }}</ref>

On October 15, 2014, Canadian country music artist [[Paul Brandt]] released the song "Get a Bed" as a comedic response to the bro-country phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Calgary's Paul Brandt getting bad rap for cheeky new country tune?|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/calgary/2014/10/23/is-calgarys-paul-brandt-getting-bad-rap-for-cheeky-new-country-tune.html|website=www.metronews.ca|accessdate=September 4, 2015|date=October 23, 2014}}</ref>

In April 2015, songwriter [[Brent Cobb]], who has written cuts by [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Little Big Town]], [[Frankie Ballard]] and [[Luke Bryan]], released a song called "Yo Bro" which mocks and pokes fun at all of bro-country's clichés stating that it was "inspired by frustration".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hear-brent-cobbs-satirical-anti-bro-song-20150410|title=Hear Brent Cobb's Satirical, 'Anti-Bro' Song|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>
