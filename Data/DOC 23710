'''Dennis Johnson''' (born 6 May 1939) is a former [[Jamaica]]n sprinter who equalled the world record, 9.3 seconds, for the [[100-yard dash]] in 1961. Johnson later became a coach and advisor, and the architect of the Jamaican athletics programme.

== Track career ==
Born in Jamaica in 1939, Johnson travelled to the United States for his college education. He studied at [[San Jose State College]], where he was coached by the legendary sprints coach [[Bud Winter]] and was a member of the [[San Jose State Spartans]] track team.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1072579/index.htm|title=A New Sprinter For The Speed Master|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=22 May 1961}}</ref>

In 1959, he won a bronze medal at the [[Athletics at the 1959 Pan American Games|1959 Pan American Games]] in the 4 × 100 m relay as a member of a combined [[West Indies Federation]] team.

In 1961, within a six-week period, he equalled the then world record for the 100 yards three times at 9.3 s:<ref name="recordb">''Progression of IAAF World Records 2011 Edition'', Editor Imre Matrahazi, IAAF Athletics, pp. 15–16.</ref>
*11 March at San Jose in the San Jose State Relays meet;
*15 April at San Jose in the Armed Forces Meeting;
*5 May at Sunnyvale in the San Jose State All-comers meet.

(He also equalled the same time on 1 April at Stanford in a university meet but the lack of a wind gauge meant the time could not be ratified as a world record.<ref name="recordb"/>)

His season was shortened by injury, and he could not compete for the United States collegiate and national championship titles.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19610610&id=4HghAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s4kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3329,1858196|title=Leg Injury Halts Johnson|work=[[Schenectady Gazette]]|date=10 June 1961}}</ref>

In 1962, he was one of the favourites for the 100 and 220 yards titles at the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] but he ended up [[Athletics at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games – Men's 220 yards|finishing fifth in the 110 yards and withdrew from the 220 yards event because of a groin injury]].

In 1964, at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]] he finished 4th in the 4 × 100 m relay as a member of the Jamaican team.<ref name="sportsref"/>

== Coaching career ==
After leaving college, Johnson went into a career in sports development and was to become renowned as the architect of Jamaica's subsequent track and field success.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/04/151956595/a-need-for-speed-inside-jamaicas-sprint-factory|title=A Need For Speed: Inside Jamaica's Sprint Factory|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=4 May 2012}}</ref>

Johnson's dream on leaving San Jose State University was to take what he'd learnt there and develop, for the first time, a US-style college athletic program in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2008/0628/p01s01-woam.html|title=How tiny Jamaica develops so many champion sprinters|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=28 June 2008}}</ref> Johnson's inspiration was the legendary San Jose sprints coach, [[Bud Winter]] - "'Bud' Winter was a master coach. I decided to come back home and bring his methodology to training sprinters in Jamaica", Johnson has stated.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/commonwealth-games/26986280|title=Glasgow 2014: The Jamaican university that changed athletics|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=11 April 2014|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref>

In 1971, Johnson started a sports program at was then a two-year vocational college, the [[College of Arts, Science and Technology]] (CAST), that later, in 1995, became [[University of Technology, Jamaica|University of Technology, Jamaica (UTech)]], a four-year college. Amongst Johnson's first training group was a then 20-year-old Anthony Davis, who was later to follow Johnson as sports director at UTech.<ref name="bbc"/>

Johnson has also stated how he was also inspired to emulate the great Jamaican sprinter, [[Herb McKenley]], who had coached Johnson in high school and passed on what he had learned from his time in the United States - "I just wanted to be like him." 
To help foster the coaching of adult athletes, Johnson and UTech entered a partnership with Stephen Francis and the [[MVP Track & Field Club|MVP Track and Field club]] in Kingston.<ref name="bbc"/>

Johnson has served at Utech in many capacities: as Chairman of the Sport Advisory Council; as Adjunct Associate Professor of Sport Science; the first Director of Sports; and has headed Special Projects for Intercollegiate Sports. In addition, he was the founder of the Jamaican Inter-Collegiate sports competition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cnissports.com/?p=7542|title=Olympian Dennis Johnson to be honoured in New York|publisher=[[CNIS]]|date=15 April 2014|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref>
