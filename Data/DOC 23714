Title : Ahmad ibn Farighun
Text : '''Ahmad ibn Farighun''' (died 10th-century) was the first [[Farighunid]] ruler of [[Guzgan]] (9th-century&ndash;10th-century). He was the son of a certain Farighun.

He is the first Farighunid ruler fully attested in sources. During the campaigns of the [[Saffarid]] ruler [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], Ahmad, along with another local Iranian ruler the [[Banijurids|Banijurid]] [[Abu Dawud Muhammad ibn Ahmad]], was forced to the latter's authority. However, in 900, Amr was defeated and captured by the [[Samanid]] ruler [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]], which made Ahmad and Abu Dawud recognize Samanid authority. Ahmad was later succeeded by his son [[Abu'l Haret Muhammad]] at an unknown date.
