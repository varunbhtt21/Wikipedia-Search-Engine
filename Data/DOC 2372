Title : Sea Bird (ship)
Text : {{italic title}}
The SV '''''Sea Bird''''' or ''Seabird'' (later renamed ''Beach Bird'') was a merchant brig under the command of John Huxham (or Husham or Durham). In 1750 or 1760 the ship grounded herself at Easton's Beach, [[Rhode Island]]. Her longboat was missing, and she had been returning from a voyage to [[Honduras]] and was expected in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] that day. The ship was apparently abandoned in sight of land (coffee was boiling on the galley stove) and drifted off course. The only living things found on the ship were a dog and a cat.<ref name="auto">Myres, Rau & Macklin ''The Little Giant Book of True Ghost Stories'' (2001) {{ISBN|0-439-33995-2}}</ref><ref name=Hand>{{cite book|author=Dix, John Ross|title=A Hand-Book of Newport, and Rhode Island|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2mhZAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22Sea+Bird%22+Huxham&source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=1852|publisher=C.

There are so many variations of this story that have often been retold that all facts have become obscured. Many consider this story to be nothing more than a myth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://esoterx.com/2014/12/06/the-ghost-ship-sea-bird-an-unnatural-fear-of-historical-plot-holes/|title=The Ghost Ship Sea Bird: An Unnatural Fear of Historical Plot Holes|last=EsoterX|date=2014-12-06|website=EsoterX|access-date=2017-08-26}}</ref>
