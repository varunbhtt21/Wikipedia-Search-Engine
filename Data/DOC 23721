'''Parasite Inc.''' is a [[melodic death metal]] band from [[Aalen]], [[Germany]]. Formed in 2007, the band currently consists of Kai Bigler ([[singing|vocals]], [[guitar]]), Dominik Sorg (guitar), Stefan Krämer ([[Bass guitar|bass]]) and Benjamin Stelzer ([[Drum kit|drums]]).<ref name="Parasite Inc."/>

== History ==
The band formed in 2007 after [[guitar|guitar player]] Kai Bigler and [[Drum kit|drummer]] Benjamin Stelzer decided to start a [[Band (music)|band]]. The line-up was completed by Benedikt Grubauer (guitar) and Patrick Hauf ([[Bass guitar|bass]]). During the first two years the band wrote songs for an [[album]] and played several [[concert]]s. In early 2010 they released a self-titled [[Demo (music)|demo]] album, which has been recorded in late 2009 in the band's own [[recording studio]]. The [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] was done by Hendrik Kröger, while the [[Audio mastering|mastering]] was done by the band itself. About that time Patrick Hauf left the band and was replaced by Sebastian Schmid. The demo received critical acclaim, high review scores and sold out soon. In the same year Parasite Inc. was chosen out of over 2.000 applicants to play at the [[Summer Breeze Open Air]] as part of the New Blood Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=Line-Up Summer Breeze Open Air 2010|publisher=Summer Breeze|url=http://www.summer-breeze.de/de/rueckblick/rueckblick-2010.html|accessdate=2014-05-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626133229/http://www.summer-breeze.de/de/rueckblick/rueckblick-2010.html|archivedate=2014-06-26|df=}}</ref>

In the following years the band played many more concerts among others with [[Heaven Shall Burn]], [[Hatesphere]], [[The Sorrow]] and [[Hackneyed]]. In summer 2011 Benedikt Grubauer left the band and was replaced by Kevin Sierra (ex-[[Hackneyed]]). In 2012 Parasite Inc. signed a [[record deal]] with Good Damn Records (later renamed to Rebel Tune Records). For their first official release ''Time Tears Down'' they re-recorded all songs of the demo album alongside 5 new songs. The album was mixed by the band itself and mastered by [[Jens Bogren]] (Fascination Street Studios). During the recordings Sebastian Schmid left the band. Stefan Krämer (Skelton Pit, ex-Torment Tool) took his place.

''Time Tears Down'' has been released on August 2, 2013 via Good Damn Records.<ref name="Rebel Tune">{{cite web|title=Time Tears Down|publisher=Rebel Tune Records |url=http://www.rebeltunerecords.de/?product_cat=paraasite-inc-melodic-death-metal|accessdate=2018-06-30|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002455/http://www.rebeltunerecords.de/?product_cat=paraasite-inc-melodic-death-metal|archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}</ref> The album received very good reviews and high ratings by leading German metal magazines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review Metal Hammer Germany|publisher=Metal Hammer |url=http://www.metal-hammer.de/reviews/alben/article468583/parasite-inc-time-tears-down.html|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Review Legacy Magazine |publisher=Legacy Magazine |url=http://www.legacy.de/re-views/a-z/item/26505-parasite-inc-time-tears-down |accessdate=2014-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021062231/http://www.legacy.de/re-views/a-z/item/26505-parasite-inc-time-tears-down |archivedate=2013-10-21 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Review Metal.de|publisher=Metal.de |url=http://www.metal.de/death-metal/review/parasite-inc/55121-time-tears-down/|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref> It also reached number 26 in the official German rock-metal charts and stayed in the top 30 for several weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official German Rock-Metal charts cw11 2014|publisher=Official German rock-metal charts |url=http://www.wdjc.de/mrc/index.php?PHPSESSID=obhhalk0qvcvk8hndpjbm37915&LG=de&ID=1&CID=5&yyyy=2014&kw=11|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref> The [[music video]] for the song ''The Pulse Of The Dead'' was especially successful on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulse Of The Dead music video|publisher=Parasite Inc. |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St6ZzLMMVe4|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>  In 2014 Kevin Sierra left the band and Dominik Sorg became a new full-time member.
