The '''Biertan fortified church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica fortificată din Biertan}}; {{lang-de|Kirchenburg von Birthälm}}) is a [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheran]] [[fortified church]] in [[Biertan]] (''Birthälm''), [[Sibiu County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]]. It was built by the [[Germans|ethnic German]] [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community at a time when the area belonged to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Briefly [[Roman Catholic]], it became Lutheran following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Together with the surrounding village, the church forms part of the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

==Description==

===Background and church===

[[File:Biertan church inside.jpg|thumb|Altar with polyptych]]
Biertan was founded by Transylvanian Saxons in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. It was allowed to organize a market, placing it in competition with [[Mediaș]] and [[Moșna, Sibiu|Moșna]]; it was also the [[Episcopal see|see]] of the [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Saxon Lutheran Church]] from 1572 to 1867. This accounts for the elaborate church and its defenses.<ref name="org">[http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/biertan-birthalm/ Biertan/Birthälm] at biserici-fortificate.org {{ro icon}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502215018/http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/biertan-birthalm/ |date=2014-05-02 }}</ref>

A [[hall church]] with three [[nave]]s that retains a design close to the original,<ref name="org"/><ref name="com"/> it was the last such church built in Transylvania, and was constructed between 1486 and 1524<ref name="com"/> on the site of an earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church.<ref name="org"/><ref name="com"/> Dedicated to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and built in [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] style with [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] touches,<ref name="com"/><ref name="muresan"/><ref name="djc"/> the structure was constrained by the hilly landscape. The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is 18 m in length, with a [[Rib vault|rib-vaulted]] ceiling, while the three naves of equal height also have rib vaulting. A defensive level above the choir has parapets and a [[battlement]].<ref name="com"/> A second, wooden, level was demolished in 1803.<ref name="org"/> The [[polyptych]] [[altarpiece]] has 28 panels executed between 1482 and 1513 by a painter likely trained at [[Vienna]] and [[Nuremberg]]. In the center, there is a sculpted group: a [[crucifix]] with [[Jesus Christ]] hanging, Mary standing and [[Mary Magdalene]] embracing the cross. The upper side panels show visions of [[Ezekiel]] and [[Augustus]].<ref name="com"/> The stone [[pulpit]], which shows scenes carved in [[relief]], dates to 1523. The richly decorated [[intarsia]] door of the [[sacristy]] has a complex lock, displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris World's Fair]]. Its central system blocks the door in thirteen points, ensuring the safety of the valuables kept in the sacristy.<ref name="org"/>

===Fortifications and recognition===

The King granted the town the right to bear arms when the Ottoman army was frightening the surroundings. The Transylvanian Saxons chose to build instead of [[fortress]]es around the towns, to fortify the churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/596|title=Villages with Fortified Churches in Transylvania|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> The church has three rows of exterior fortifications linked by [[gate tower]]s,<ref name="com"/> nine in total.<ref name="org"/> The first, with four towers, dates to the 14th century; the second was built together with the church, and has a series of reinforcing arches; the third, also with towers, is from the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[clock tower]] to the north of the church also serves as a gate within the inner fortifications. Four stories high, it has a wooden battlement and parapets. The clock is above the pyramid-shaped roof. The wooden [[bell tower]] is located north of the church, while the mausoleum tower contains the headstones of the priest who built the church as well as the bishops buried at Biertan.<ref name="com">[http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/biertan___birthaelm/4/ Biertan/Birthaelm] at biserici-fortificate.com {{ro icon}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503004700/http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/biertan___birthaelm/4/ |date=2014-05-03 }}</ref> The Catholic tower was used by the few Saxons who did not adhere to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] but kept their [[Roman Catholic]] faith. Its chapel (''ca.'' 1520&ndash;1530) features a rare example of 16th-century Transylvanian mural painting, forming an exception to the austere aesthetic that predominated.<ref>[[Vasile Drăguț]], ''Dicționar enciclopedic de artă medievală românească'', p.233. Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică, Bucharest, 1976</ref> The grounds contain a "matrimonial prison" where couples wishing to divorce were confined so they could be sure they wished to end their marriage.<ref name="org"/> The lockup lasted for two weeks, although the pair could leave early if they reconciled. They had to share a single bed, plate and spoon. During the three centuries that bishops resided at Biertan, just one couple ended up divorcing.<ref>Ramona Găină, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/sibiu/sibiu-1_52299242c7b855ff5650d56a/index.html "Secretele bisericilor fortificate săsești din Sibiu"], ''Adevărul'', September 9, 2013 {{ro icon}}</ref>

The church was occupied and robbed in 1704, during [[Rákóczi's War of Independence]].<ref name="djc">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208200453/http://www.sibiu.djc.ro/ObiectiveDetalii.aspx?ID=25 Cetatea Biertan] at the Sibiu County Cultural Affairs Office site {{ro icon}}{{Dead link|date=January 2018}}</ref> It suffered damage during the [[1977 Vrancea earthquake]] and subsequently underwent restoration work<ref name="muresan">Alexandra Mureșan, "The Fortified Church of Biertan (Transylvania)", in [[Myra Shackley]] (ed.), ''Visitor Management: Case Studies from World Heritage Sites'', p.27.

Since 1990, Saxons come annually to Biertan to celebrate their heritage.<ref name="djc"/> In 1993, Biertan and its fortified church were declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]; it was joined by six other places in 1999 to form the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] site.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/596 Villages with Fortified Churches in Transylvania] at the UNESCO site</ref><ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165 "World Heritage Committee Inscribes 48 New Sites on Heritage List"] at the UNESCO site</ref> Additionally, the church is listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by Romania's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], with each of the three fortifications considered a separate monument.<ref>[http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_SB.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Sibiu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217084918/http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_SB.pdf |date=2019-02-17 }} {{ro icon}}</ref> Biertan was the subject of two 2011 postage stamps, a [[joint issue]] between Germany and Romania.<ref>[http://adevarul.ro/locale/sibiu/timbru-postal-despre-biserica-localitatea-sibiana-biertan-lansat-brasov-1_50aceff27c42d5a6638c308b/index.html "Timbru poștal despre biserica din localitatea sibiană Biertan, lansat la Brașov"], ''Adevărul'', September 11, 2011 {{ro icon}}</ref>
