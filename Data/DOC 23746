::*<s>'''Keep''' and do not salt. As the creator of this article initially, I can confirm that the created article (before Cwobeel edits that resulted in the current article) met both the basic and additional [[Wikipedia:BIO|notability]] cum [[WP:BIO]] criteria. It is important that I mentioned that the current semi-protected article is by Cwobeel, and Cwobeel is requesting for the deletion. I guess Cwobeel request for deletion of Akinwunmi ambode's article may be connected with the fact that Akinwunmi Ambode which is already very popular in Lagos (A state with more than 5 million people in Nigeria) is fast becoming an household name beyond the shores of Lagos, and maybe Cwobeel is not happy with the development.

*'''Comment''' 
#Cwobeel nominated the article, and later also voted "delete". That's not good form, looking like voting twice. Besides, the actual vote was "Delete and salt", without a rationale. Could you explain what "salt" means, in relation to AfD?
#Re [[User talk:JzG|Guy]] - Sources 1, 2, 4 and 5 are very much about the subject, re-telling his history in government service. Source 3 is his company's official website.
#The edit-warring about the Afd tag is probably due to the article creator's inexperience, and is irrelevant to determine the '''notability of the subject'''. The notability of the subject of the article should be determined by the merits of the subject not the merits of the article's author, or the shape of the article.
#In this case, to determine notability, we have to consider [[WP:POLITICIAN]], and failing that [[WP:GNG]]. Question 1: Is "Accountant General of Lagos State" a statewide political office under WP:POLITICIAN § 1. ? Or, is "Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance of Lagos State" such an office? Question 2: Is Ambode a "major local political figure who has received significant press coverage" under WP:POLITICIAN § 2. ? Question 3: Are the stories in 4 different newspapers (perhaps more) "significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject" under WP:GNG ? 
#I ask all the voters without a rationale to asnswer these questions, stating a rationale, and not just saying yes or no. I remind the admins among the voters that at your RfA you must have stated once to know something about AfD criteria. [[User:Kraxler|Kraxler]] ([[User talk:Kraxler|talk]]) 13:54, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:*{{ping|Kraxler}} "Salt" refers to [[WP:SALT]], i.e. protection of the article title name to prevent a recreation of the article, and is a term that is well known among most, if not all, editors who regularly take part in AfD-discussions, and thus isn't always linked. "Salting" is usually requested in AfD-cases where there has been a lot of disruption on the article (for example repeated deletion of the AfD-banner, as in this case), and where a number of newly created single-purpose accounts suddenly pop-up, !voting in the AfD as their first contribution to WP. No comment on the rest of your post. [[User:Thomas.W|'''Thomas.W''']] [[User talk:Thomas.W|'''''<sup><small> talk</small></sup>''''']] 14:08, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Thanks for the info and link. [[User:Kraxler|Kraxler]] ([[User talk:Kraxler|talk]]) 14:17, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:*{{ping|Kraxler}} From what I understand, nominators can also provide a comment for Keep, merge, delete, etc. Also, this is not a vote. [[User:Cwobeel|Cwobeel]] ([[User talk:Cwobeel|talk]]) 22:39, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:**At AfD, nominators are supposed to make their point, including a rationale, in the nomination statement. They may later comment, or reverse, or withdraw, their nomination. To nominate for deletion, and then to vote again delete, is not good form. To vote again without giving a rationale is utterly useless, since not the vote tally but the weight of the arguments decides at AfD. [[User:Kraxler|Kraxler]] ([[User talk:Kraxler|talk]]) 23:58, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*:Allegedly being part of the government (and not its head) of a subnational entity probably does not qualify for WP:POLITICIAN. All that is known is that the subject is being bandied about online as he is tapped in a nepotistic manner to be the successor of [[Babatunde Fashola]] as a cursory google search shows. If he is the new governor, then he's notable. Until then, there does not seem to be much proof but there is a lot of promotional puffery.—[[User:Ryulong|<font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font>]] ([[User talk:Ryulong|<font color="Gold">琉竜</font>]]) 14:11, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Re Ryulong -  "''Allegedly''"? I thought there was consensus that Ambode held these offices. Questioning the established facts shows bias. Besides we have articles on, for example, [[Nicholas Van Vranken Franchot]] who was New York State Superintendent of Public Works, a statewide appointive office, and who was never Governor of New York. Please read carefully WP:POLITICIAN and then show me where there's written that somebody must be '''head''' of the government of a sub-national entity to be notable.

:::::[[WP:WAX]], plus two NYT articles.  Apples and oranges, as far as GNG is concerned.  [[User:Dennis Brown|<b>Dennis&nbsp;Brown</b>]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[User talk:Dennis Brown|2¢]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[WP:WikiProject Editor Retention|<small>WER</small>]] 15:56, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::I know about WP:WAX. It says "The fact that we have an article on X is not an argument to have an article on Y". And that's quite right. In this case, Ryulong invented an amendment to the WP:POLITICIAN guideline, and I used an example to illustrate what the guideline really says, not to support the article up for deletion here. I hope you can see the difference. [[User:Kraxler|Kraxler]] ([[User talk:Kraxler|talk]]) 17:02, 3 May 2014 (UTC)  
:::::{{ping|Kraxler}} Judging by the article the post of "accountant-general of Lagos State" is '''not''' a political office, but a job filled by civil servants. The article says that Ambode was a civil servant for 27 years, up to 2012, working as permanent secretary of the Ministry of Finance from January 2005, and then given the additional responsibility of being accountant-general of Lagos State in 2006. So [[WP:POLITICIAN]] does '''not''' apply. In fact the article makes no claims what-so-ever of him ever having held a political office...

::*<s>'''Keep''' and do not salt.
#I will like to add that some of the honors and career highlights of Akinwunmi Ambode include: 1) He had the second best result in entire West Africa in the Higher School Certificate Examinations of 1981. 2) He won the Federal Government Scholarship awards for Post-Graduate Studies. 3) He is Hubert Humphrey Fellow and a Fulbright Scholar (USA). 4) He has been recognized for  positive contribution to Education by Lagos State University Alumni Association. 5) He won the “Most Outstanding Achievement Award” by the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees, Lagos State. 6) He had recognition for Outstanding Excellence by Joint Tax Board (JTB)/FIRS on successful organization of the 1st National Tax Retreat in Nigeria. 7) He organized, in his capacity as Permanent Secretary in the [[Ministry of Finance]], the first ever National Tax Retreat in Nigeria in conjunction with Joint Tax Board/Federal Inland Revenue Services in 2005. 8) He was the Chairman of the Technical Committee that produced the Lagos State Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (SEEDS) document.9) It is on record that he is the youngest person ever appointed as Auditor General in Lagos State, Nigeria at the age of 37. 10) It is on record that he is the first ever Permanent Secretary to retire voluntarily. 
#Besides,  I observed that some parts of my earlier contribution ("Keep and do not salt") was with a line on it that makes it look as if I have cancelled it. I just removed the line before this post. I hope those doing such dirty action will stop the tricks and stop altering the comments of others like me, and allow the closing admin to have all the views without any deletion. Thank you all.

::*<s>'''Keep'''. I have been a substantial contributor to this article as I recognized Ambode as an important factor in the public life of [[Lagos State]] with 9 Mio inhabitants. [[User:Kraxler|Kraxler] has raised an important aspect in referring to the [[WP:POLITICIAN]] which includes "members or former members of a national, state or provincial legislature". Ambode has been part of local governments in many different positions, last being that of Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance. Further more, I believe he "received significant press coverage" as demanded by the [[WP:POLITICIAN]]. You can check that yourselves by searching for him on google.
