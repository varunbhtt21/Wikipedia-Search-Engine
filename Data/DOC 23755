:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] New enough and long enough. 2 QPQs have been offered but this nomination only appears to be promoting one page. Is this correct? I notice fn2 mentions "the area was used for livestock grazing and minor limestone quarrying" but the article says "after former limestone grazing and minor limestone quarries" - should the article be changed to "livestock grazing"?  Per [[WP:CITE]] I would like to see a few more inline citations in the second paragraph. Article has no close paraphrasing issues, sources are sufficient, hook is cited but a bit wordy. Perhaps an alternative could be suggested. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 06:40, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
::*Thanks for the notes. Meanwhile I expanded it and added some sources. Could you have a look at it once more, please? As for the number of pages: yes, I propose just one page to be introduced in the DYK. [[User:Jan.Kamenicek|Jan.Kamenicek]] ([[User talk:Jan.Kamenicek|talk]]) 14:12, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] You don't need to "spend" two reviews for one nomination, feel free to remove one. Problem mentioned above has been satisfactorily addressed, referencing of the article is good with no close paraphrasing concerns. ALT1 hook is better. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 17:08, 11 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
