'''Diarrhea Planet''' was an American six-piece [[Garage punk (fusion genre)|garage punk]] band from [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], United States, formed in 2009.<ref name="blogspot1">{{cite web|title=Diarrhea Planet Bio|url=http://diarrheaplanet.blogspot.com/p/bio.html|website=Diarrheaplanet.blogpsot.com|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> The band is composed of singer-guitarist Jordan Smith, guitarist-singer Emmett Miller, guitarist Evan Bird, guitarist-singer Brent Toler, bassist Mike Boyle, and drummer Ian Bush. Diarrhea Planet has described its sound as "pop played through the filter of heavy metal" and have cited influences such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[AC/DC]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[Dokken]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Selinger|first=Julia|title=Diarrhea Planet Dig the Not-Sucky Parts of Steely Dan, Ride Hard for Classic Rock|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/08/diarrhea-planet-dig-the-not-sucky-parts-of-steely-dan-ride-hard-for-classic-rock/|publisher=Spin Magazine|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> Diarrhea Planet has drawn wide acclaim for their rowdy live shows, which occasionally feature covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Third Eye Blind]].  The band has previously toured with [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]], [[JEFF the Brotherhood]], [[Screaming Females]], [[The So So Glos]], and [[Those Darlins]]. 

==History==
The band self-released their first EP, ''Aloha!,'' in 2009, receiving over 10,000 free downloads.<ref name="blogspot1"/> The band would soon sign to independent label [[Infinity Cat Recordings]], and released their first full-length, ''Loose Jewels,'' with the label in 2011. Their 2013 release, ''I'm Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams,'' was produced and mixed by Kevin S. McMahon at Marcata Recording over the course of just eight days, consisting almost entirely of live takes.  It would bring the band its most attention yet, and led to appearances at festivals including [[SXSW]], [[Bonnaroo]], and [[Governors Ball Music Festival]]. To promote the album, the band released music videos for tracks "Separations", "Ugliest Son", and "Babyhead".

The track "Separations" was used in the soundtrack of the [[HBO]] show ''[[Animals.]]'', appearing in the end credits of "[[Animals.#Episodes|Rats]]" (the Pilot episode for the series) as well as making occasional appearances throughout the show, (along with other modern punk songs by both Diarrhea Planet and other bands, adding to the urban aesthetic of the show).

On March 8, 2016, Diarrhea Planet announced their third album, ''Turn To Gold'', through a lengthy Buzzfeed feature that also debuted their new single "Life Pass." <ref>{{cite web|title=A Hitchhiker's Guide To Diarrhea Planet|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewismaelruiz/in-the-studio-with-diarrhea-planet#.yerezQRNVd|website=Buzzfeed.com|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref> The band has stated that this album is more mature and grander than their previous works, referring to it as their ''Back In Black''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Q&A: Diarrhea Planet On The Nashville Scene, Their Memorable Moniker, And Their Awesome New Album Turn To Gold|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1866711/qa-diarrhea-planet-on-the-nashville-scene-their-memorable-moniker-and-their-awesome-new-album-turn-to-gold/franchises/interview/|website=Stereogum.com|accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref> Soon after, the band returned to SXSW as an official artist and embarked on a west coast tour with labelmates Music Band. On April 11, Diarrhea Planet released their follow-up single "Let It Out" along with a preorder of the upcoming album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stream DP's new single & preorder their new LP|url=https://infinity-cat-recordings.myshopify.com/blogs/infinity-cat/115831685-stream-dps-new-single-preorder-their-new-lp|website=Infinity-cat-recordings.myshopify.com|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref>

On July 23, 2018, the band announced their breakup, stating that the band "has run its course." <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2006936/diarrhea-planet-break-up-announce-final-shows/news/|title=Diarrhea Planet Are Breaking Up|date=2018-07-23|work=Stereogum|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref> On September 7th and 8th, they played two farewell shows in Nashville.
