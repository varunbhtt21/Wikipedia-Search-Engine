== Killing and staged death ==
Sharma lived with his wife Savita and had an unhappy married life{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} <sup>[Check Grammar]</sup>. In 2014, he decided to fake his own death so that he could start a new life with his 25-year-old girlfriend Preeti Nagar, who lived in the same neighbourhood.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Chandra-Mohans-girlfriend-held-for-suppressing-facts/articleshow/41314844.cms |title=Chandra Mohan's girlfriend held for suppressing facts |date=31 August 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India }}</ref> He convinced his brother-in-law Videsh to help him by suggesting that Savita would get money from insurance policies after his staged death. His employer Honda was obliged to pay his family {{INR}} 3,600,000 in case of his death; he had another [[life insurance policy]] worth {{INR}} 300,000.<ref name="HT_admits">{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rti-activist-thought-to-be-dead-arrested/article1-1257665.aspx |title=RTI activist and AAP member back from dead, admits he killed homeless man |date=29 August 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times }}</ref>

In April 2014, Sharma filed an RTI case against the alleged illegal encroachments on a temple land in Kasna village in Greater Noida. He claimed that he received threats to his life due to this, and filed a [[First Information Report]] (FIR) on 29 April, naming several persons for the threats.<ref name=daily/><ref name=ndtv/> He became friendly with a mentally unstable [[homeless]] who used to roam around in the area of his residence. On 1 May 2014, Sharma [[manual strangulation|strangled]] the homeless man using a belt, with Videsh's help. The two put the dead body on the driver's seat of Sharma's [[Chevrolet Aveo]], poured three litres of petrol on it, and set the car on fire on a desolate stretch near Eldeco Crossing in Greater Noida. By the time the [[firefighter]]s arrived, the car had been badly burnt and the dead body had been charred beyond recognition.<ref name="HT_admits"/><ref name=toi>{{cite web | title = Chandra Mohan Sharma: His RTIs 'did not please everyone' | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Delhi/Chandra-Mohan-Sharma-His-RTIs-did-not-please-everyone/articleshow/34554861.cms |date=3 May 2014| accessdate = 3 May 2014 | publisher = The Times of India }}</ref> The car windows and doors were locked, and had to be broken open.<ref name=daily/>

Meanwhile, Sharma's family tried to call him, but his mobile phone was unreachable. In the morning, Sharma's relatives identified the body as his, through the car's license plate. The police initially suspected that Sharma's car had caught fire, and he couldn't open the door due to a malfunction of the vehicle's [[central locking]].<ref name="HT_took">{{cite web | title = RTI activist who took on Noida land mafia dies|newspaper=Hindustan Times| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/noida/rti-activist-who-took-on-noida-land-mafia-dies-family-calls-it-murder/article1-1215024.aspx |date=3 May 2014| accessdate = 3 May 2014 }}</ref> However, Sharma's relatives alleged that he was murdered for fighting against the land mafia, and accused the police of not acting on the FIR he had filed before his death.<ref name=ndtv>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/cities/rti-activist-chandra-mohan-sharma-found-dead-in-his-car-in-noida-517434?curl=1399045662 |title=RTI Activist Chandra Mohan Sharma Found Dead in His Car in Noida |publisher=NDTV |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/rti-activist-chandra-mohan-sharma-found-dead-in-noida/article5969997.ece |title=RTI activist Chandra Mohan Sharma found dead in Noida |publisher=The Hindu |date=2 May 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> On complaint of a family member, the police lodged a murder case against five people at the Kasna police station.<ref name="HT_took"/>

== Investigation and arrest ==

Immediately after staging his own death, Sharma travelled to [[Bangalore]] by train. Subsequently, he assumed a new identity as "Nitin Sharma" and shaved his head. He managed to get a job at the Honda plant in Narsapur ([[Kolar district]], Karnataka), with help of forged [[marksheet]]s and past work experience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rti-activist-who-faked-his-death-arrested-for-murder/article6362725.ece?homepage=true |title=RTI activist, who faked his death, arrested for murder |author=Damini Nath |newspaper=The Hindu |date=29 August 2014 }}</ref> Meanwhile, Honda paid {{INR}} 2,000,000 to Sharma's family.<ref name="HT_admits"/>

On 6 June, around a month after the incident, Sharma's girlfriend Preeti came to Kolar to live with him. Her family filed a [[missing person]] report. The police didn't know about the relationship between the two at this time, but while investigating the case, they found that the [[Subscriber identity module|SIM]] card of her mobile was registered in Sharma's name. By August 2014, Sharma had started finding his new life with Preeti financially taxing. He, therefore, made anonymous calls to her family, telling them about her location and asking them to take her back. The police traced the three calls made between 9 and 13 August to a [[Public call office|PCO]] in Bangalore, which is located at a distance of 50&nbsp;km from the Honda plant in Narsapur. The investigators were told that a man in Honda uniform had made the calls. Using the [[CCTV]] footage and the Honda plant's employee records, they identified the caller as Chandra Mohan Sharma. When confronted, Sharma claimed that his name was Nitin and he was a native of [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], Haryana. However, his real identity was confirmed by a tattoo on his hand with the names of his wife and children.<ref name="HT_admits"/><ref name="ToI_charged"/>

Sharma was arrested on 27 August, in Bangalore.<ref>[http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/dead-aap-activist-chandra-mohan-sharma-caught-alive-in-bangalore_1460856.html 'Dead' AAP activist Chandra Mohan Sharma caught alive in Bangalore]</ref> The police also found Preeti, and the two were brought to Noida.<ref name="ToI_charged">{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Noida/Murdered-RTI-activist-and-AAP-member-charged-with-murder/articleshow/41132551.cms |title='Murdered' RTI activist and AAP member charged with murder |author=Vandana Keelor |date=29 August 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India }}</ref> He admitted that he had murdered a homeless man to stage his own death.<ref name="HT_admits"/>
