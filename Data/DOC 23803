==Critical reception==
Reviewers generally agree that farmers and ranchers in this documentary come across as sincere and committed to their lifestyle.  The movie is viewed as presenting an interesting portrayal of what it is like to farm and ranch for family farmers and ranchers across the United States.  It has been criticized for giving an incomplete view of modern industrial agriculture.  For example, the production of [[animal products]] such as [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and poultry is done mainly by [[corporate farming]] and not small [[family farm]]s.  Controversial issues such as the use of genetically modified crops, the use of [[pesticide]]s, the use of antibiotics in animal feeds, and the treatment of animals on farms are largely dismissed in the film according to reviewers.  Finally, reviewers question the aims of the movie because it was funded by U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance.<ref name=NPR/><ref name=Simon/><ref name=Means/><ref name=LAT/><ref name=Barsanti/><ref name=CSM/><ref name="Deseret News">{{cite news|last=Terry|first=Josh|title='Farmland' takes viewers on a trip to rural America|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865602214/Farmland-takes-viewers-on-a-trip-to-rural-America.html?pg=all|accessdate=May 2, 2014|newspaper=Deseret News|date=May 2, 2014}}</ref>
