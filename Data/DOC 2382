'''''Demolition''''' is the first full-length [[Demo (music)|demo]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] by the [[thrash metal]] band [[Vektor (band)|Vektor]]. Although a self-released demo, it is occasionally regarded as the band's first full-length [[Album (music)|album]], due to its 48-minute length. "Moonbase" is the only non-instrumental or interlude track without a revised version appearing on either of the band's first or second albums, ''[[Black Future]]'' and ''[[Outer Isolation]]''.<ref name="discogs">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Vektor-Demolition/release/3577230|title=Vektor - Demolition (CD, Album) at Discogs|publisher=discogs.com|accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref><ref name="metal-archives">{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Vektor/Demolition/146989|title=Vektor - Demolition - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|publisher=metal-archives.com|accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>
