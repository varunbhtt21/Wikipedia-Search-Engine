==History of Kangra==
This region, commonly named as Dev Bhumi is believed to be the abode of gods.   There is a mention of Trigarta (Kangra) kingdom in Mahabharata.  Sir Lepel Griffin refers to the Rajput dynasties of the hills of whom the Katochs’ are the oldest. In Mahabharata there is a mention of King Susharama Chandra, who sided with the Kaurvas. He is said to be the founder of this dynasty.  At that time, Kangra was probably named as Bhim Kot. The reference to prosperous Kingdom of Trigarta (Kangra) is also found in the Panani literature.  The mention of Kangra (Nagarkot) was found in the works of Ferishta. 
  At some later period, perhaps that of the Muhammadan invasion, the Katoch princes were driven into the hills, where Kangra already existed as one of their chief fortress. In spite of constant invasions, the little Hindu kingdoms, secure within their Himalayan glens, long held out against the aggressive Muhammadan power. In 1009, the riches of the Nagarkot temple attracted the attention of Mahmud of Ghazni, who defeated the Hindu princes at Peshawar, seized the fort of Kangra and plundered the shrine of an immense booty in gold, silver and jewels. From this time, Kangra does not reappear in general history till 1360, when the emperor Firoz Tughlak again led a force against it.  The Raja gave in his submission, and was permitted to retain his dominions; but the Muhammadans once more plundered the temple.
In 1556, Akbar launched an expedition into the hills, and occupied the fort of Kangra. 
Kangra passed to the British at the end of the first Sikh War in 1846 and there were several revolts against the British. Ram Singh, a Pathania Rajput, invaded the British garrison at Shahpur.  The British immediately rushed their forces, which surrounded Shahpur fort. Ram Singh finding himself at a disadvantageous position sneaked into the nearby forest to rearm himself. After the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857, some disturbances took place in the Kulu subdivision; but the vigorous measures of precaution adopted by the local authorities, and the summary execution of the six ring leaders and imprisonment of others on the occasion of the first over act of rebellion, effectually subdued any tendency to lawlessness.  The disarming of the native troops in the forts of Kangra and Nurpur was effected quietly and without opposition.
  The national movement in Kangra district was spearheaded by Comrade Ram Chandra, Thakur   Panchan Chandra and Baba Kanshi Ram.  Baba Kanshi Ram did a great deal for liberation movement in Kangra district.  He was responsible for the liberation wave in hills.  He was given the title of “Hill Gandhi” by Jawahar Lal Nehru for his work and “Bulbule Hills” for his melodious throat by Sarojini Naidu. With the freedom of British India, Kangra district automatically threw away the foreign yoke and entered into the era of democracy.

== Redirect request: [[ Conium maculatum ]] ==
{{afc-c|d}}

Target of redirect: [[ Conium ]]

Reason: 
Hemlock - plant Conium maculatum has its own article in many languages with notable exception - English. As the article about Conium contains also detailed discussion of Conium maculatum, I think that this existing article should be part of the multilingual tree. However, I do not know if the redirection is sufficient to achieve this goal, as I am not wikipedia guru.

== Redirect request: [[Ronald O'Sullivan]] ==

Target of redirect: [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]]

Reason: Seeing as it is the person's actual first name, "Ronnie" being but his popular nickname, you'd expect to get the article on him when searching. If I were more "wikipedia-savvy" I'd probably suggest ../Ronald_O%27Sullivan to be used as the permalink.

Source (if applicable): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_Wikipedia_is_not_so_great#Technical.2Fusability_issues

<blockquote>Word form and case has to be ''exactly right'' to link to articles. Wikipedia is highly [[case sensitive]]. Case of some article titles (e.g., [[Light Characters in the Wheel of Time series]]) can be difficult to figure out even for experienced users. Most internet search engines are case-insensitive, and that is what users have come to expect.  While the articles themselves should use only correct English case, automatic obvious redirecting or even correcting in the anchor article is not a bad idea.  Creating manual redirects for all possible alternate capitalizations of [[Light Characters in the Wheel of Time series]] would require 127<!--first letter is case insensitive--> redirects, and this only considers the first letter of each word. (That article has since been redirected to [[List of Wheel of Time characters]], reducing the possibilities but retaining the issue).  Why not fix this? Surely [[WP:Bot requests|there is a programmer who can try]]?</blockquote>

== Redirect request: [[Lynher River]] ==
{{afc-c|a}}
Target of redirect: [[St Germans River]]

Reason:
Article on Antony Passage incorrectly names the Lynher River as "St Germans River". WHile there may be people who call it that, no resident of Antony Passage would, at any time in decades, or even hundreds of years. Nor does such a name appear on a map! It is ALWAYS the Lynher River, so this is the name I edited into the Antony Passage article. Rather than interfere with another article, I ask that the Lynher River entry I placed in the Antony Passage article redirects to the "St Germans River" page where the disticntion, though improperly applied, is at least there so people can figure it out for themselves! :)

Ideally I recommend that the main article be renamed Lynher River, and the redirect page be named "St Germans River". I don't expect that suggestion to be taken up, but it would be correct! It's just a question of how much change a registered editor is willing to make, but you'll easily find evidence to support it.

Reason: The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably therefore this will avoid confusion. Cup drink is also not currently in use by any other articles and free for a redirect.

== Redirect request: [[M997]] ==
{{afc-c|a}}
Target of redirect: [[Humvee]]

Reason: The M997 currently redirects to the page for the M977 HEMTT, when the M997 designation itself is for the ambulance variant of the HMMWV. It's a little thing, but the redirect being wrong could be confusing.

Source (if applicable): M997 shows up exactly 0 times on the HEMTT page, giving no reason why it should be a redirect there, while it shows up on the Humvee page a couple times because that's actually a variant there.

== Redirect request: [[Hybrid module]] ==
{{AfC-c|a}}

Target of redirect: [[Hybrid integrated circuit]]

Reason: "Hybrid module" is a synonym for "Hybrid integrated circuit", and should redirect. I (and every individual that I know and that I've communicated with in the field of vintage electronic repair) have always used the term "Hybrid module" more frequently than "Hybrid integrated circuit" (I used it ''exclusively''), as the term "integrated circuit" is commonly associated with the silicon integrated circuit (microchip). I have also seen its repeated use on numerous websites, primarily those dealing in vintage technology, microwave band technology, power technology, and automotive components. Even Google themselves places the Wikipedia page for "Hybrid integrated circuit" as the first result when searching for "Hybrid module". Google is, in fact, the means by which I actually ''found'' the Wikipedia page for "Hybrid integrated circuit", as the naming was entirely non-intuitive for me, again related to the fact that many people strongly associate integrated circuit with silicon chips, even if the literal definition of an integrated circuit can cover any unified device containing multiple circuit elements.

== Redirect request: [[ picon]] ==
{{afc-c|d}}
Target of redirect: [[Avatar_(computing)]]

Reason: Avatar images are sometimes referred to as picons(personal icons). Some articles talk about picons (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap#Application_support), but they don't link to an article for further reading on the subject. I edited the page for Avatar(computing) to include some information on picons, and included citations.

(and why the hell does one have to go through this tedious shit just for being a mere ip?) <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/89.204.139.161|89.204.139.161]] ([[User talk:89.204.139.161|talk]]) 18:47, 28 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->

:I do apologize for the tediousness of this process. The Wikimedia Foundation has prevented anonymous users from creating new article pages after the [[Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident]], and unfortunately, redirects are caught in this prevention. This is the best workaround we have come up with to allow anonymous editors to continue to contribute new redirects and articles. (As you can tell, it still needs work!) If you are interested in becoming a regular contributor to Wikipedia, I recommend [[WP:Why create an account?|creating an account]]. Doing so will let you create redirects right away, without having to submit a request. It also comes with other benefits, such as hiding your IP address, which can be used to trace your location. In the future, please conduct yourself more civilly on Wikipedia. Uncivil comments, such as yours above, is contrary to our community principles and [[WP:CIVIL|civility policy]]. In any case, [[Image:Symbol confirmed.svg|20px]] '''Redirect created.''' Thank you for your contribution to Wikipedia!
