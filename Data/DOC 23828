==Career==

===2010–2012: Early career and work with Pro Era===
Warmsley, then known as Lee Bannon, first began to receive attention after self-releasing a number of homemade beat tapes from 2010 to 2012, eventually leading to collaborations with California rappers [[Souls of Mischief]], [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]] and fellow producer [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?2018 |last=Ryce |first=Andrew |title=Lee Bannon: Search/Destroy |date=January 15, 2014 |work=[[Resident Advisor]] |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Soon after, Warmsley was introduced to [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]] and the rest of [[Pro Era]] through a mutual friend. The relationship proved to be fruitful, with Bannon signing on as Pro Era's touring DJ in 2012 and doing production for Joey Badas$$' third mixtape ''[[Summer Knights]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18276-joey-bada-summer-knights/ |last=Goble |first=Corban |title=Joey Bada$$ - Summer Knights Review |date=July 12, 2013 |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> He appeared alongside Joey Bada$$ and [[The Roots]] when they performed "Waves" live on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on November 2, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1191871/watch-joey-bada-perform-with-the-roots-on-fallon/video/ |last=Breihan |first=Tom |title=Watch Joey Bada$$ Perform With The Roots On Fallon |date=November 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Stereogum]] |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/pageburner/blogs/post?oid=12523249 |last1=Gillespie |first1=Blake |title=Review: Sacramento by way of Brooklyn, Lee Bannon goes all throwback '90s on your ears |date=January 15, 2014 |work=[[Sacramento News & Review]] |accessdate=22 June 2014}}</ref>

===2013–2015: ''Alternate/Endings'', ''Pattern of Excel'' and name change===
After his time with Pro Era, Warmsley began to explore a more experimental sound as a solo artist. In June 2013, he self-released "NW/WB", which showcased strong jungle and [[drum and bass]] influences and garnered a significant amount of press, including ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', who included Bannon on their list of the 5 Best New Artists for July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynaldo |first=Shawn |url=http://www.spin.com/2013/07/5-best-new-artists-june-2013-priests-potty-mouth-migos-lee-bannon-sinjin-hawke/130701-bannon_0/ |title=5 Best New Artists for July '13 |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> The attention drew the interest of British label [[Ninja Tune]], which signed Bannon in October 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/10/08/lee-bannon-signs-with-ninja-tune-announces-new-album/ |title=Lee Bannon signs with Ninja Tune, announces new album |date=October 8, 2013 |work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> His debut [[long play]], entitled ''Alternate/Endings'', was released on January 9, 2014 to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=14146 |title=Lee Bannon – Alternate/Endings Review |last=Ryce |first=Andrew |work=[[Resident Advisor]] |accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/10/lee-bannon-drum-n-bass-america |title=Is Lee Bannon the man to sell jungle to America? |date=January 10, 2014 |last=Martin |first=Clive |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xlr8r.com/podcast/2014/03/lee-bannon |title=Podcast 335: Lee Bannon |date=March 2014 |last=Reynaldo |first=Shawn |work=[[XLR8R]] |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed ''Alternate/Endings'' at number 15 of its 20 Best Electronic and Dance Albums of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-best-edm-electronic-and-dance-albums-of-2014-20141216/lee-gamble-koch-20141216 |title=20 Best EDM, Electronic and Dance Albums of 2014 |date=December 16, 2014 |last=Edwards |first=Gavin |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>
