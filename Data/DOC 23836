'''Alfred William Bethea''', known as '''Red Bethea''' (June 20, 1916 – September 13, 1999), was a farmer from [[Dillon County, South Carolina|Dillon County]] in eastern [[South Carolina]] who served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] from 1961 to 1966. In 1970, he left his party to run unsuccessfully as the [[Candidate|nominee]] of the [[American Independent Party]] for [[governor of South Carolina]].

==Background==

A son of Fitzhugh Lee Bethea (1889–1971)<ref name=cemetery/> and the former Bonnie Keen, Bethea graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1938 from [[Clemson University]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]] in northwestern South Carolina. In 1945, after service as a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in the [[North African Theater of Operations|North African]] and the [[European Theater of Operations]] during [[World War II]], he earned a Master of Science degree from [[Colorado State University]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], then known as Colorado A&M. Bethea was an active member the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. From 1959 to 1960, he was a member of the United States [[Chamber of Commerce]]. He served as well on the Dillon County [[American Farm Bureau Federation|Farm Bureau]]. 

Bethea and his wife, the former JoAnne Dellinger (born September 25, 1928), daughter of Lester E. and Saidee Blanchard Dellinger, had six children, Kitty, Buddy, Shannon, Lesa, Cammie, and Fitzhugh Bethea.<ref name=cemetery>{{cite web|url=http://sciway3.net/proctor/dillon/cemeteries/Dothan_cem.html|title=Dothan Methodist Church Cemetery|publisher=sciway3.net|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

==Gubernatorial race==

In [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]], Bethea supported former [[governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]] for U.S. President in the three-way campaign against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] and Democrat [[Hubert Humphrey]], the outgoing vice president, who sought to succeed U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Whereas Wallace returned to the Democratic Party to run against [[Albert Brewer]] for governor in 1970, Bethea became the standard-bearer of Wallace's former [[American Independent Party]] in his own run for governor against the Democrat [[John C. West]], the departing [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]], and the Republican choice, outgoing [[U.S. Representative]] [[Albert Watson (South Carolina)|Albert Watson]] of [[South Carolina's 2nd congressional district]].
Bethea claimed that Wallace was sympathetic his campaign, but with his own race in Alabama Wallace took no part in the South Carolina campaign.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "The Changing Politics of Race: Congressman Albert William Watson and the South Carolina Republican Party, 1965–1970", ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'' Vol. 89 (October 1988), p. 233</ref>

Frank B. Best, Sr., of [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]], the 1968 Wallace campaign manager in South Carolina, endorsed Watson, on the basis of his [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] congressional record, rather than West, who had backed Humphrey in the previous presidential race. West had called Humphrey "a real friend of the South though he has had no credit for it."<ref>''[[Florence Morning News]]'' and ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', October 12, 1970; ''[[The State (newspaper)|Columbia State]]'', April 1, 1968, October 10, 1970; ''Columbia Record'', October 13, 1970</ref> Other Wallace leaders backed the Democrat West, who led in ten of the twelve counties that Wallace had carried in 1968.<ref>South Carolina Election Commission, 1968 and 1970 election returns; ''Columbia State'', November 11, 1970</ref> Bethea finished the race with 9,758 (2 percent), a margin too small to have denied victory to Watson. West prevailed with 251,151 (52.1 percent); Watson trailed with 221,236 (45.9 percent).<ref>South Carolina Election Commission, 1970 general election returns</ref>

Bethea died at the age of eighty-three. He is interred with other family members at the Dothan Methodist Church Cemetery in Dillon County.<ref name=cemetery/>
