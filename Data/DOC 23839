Betty has been feeling ill and has retired from the party to sleep. Various complications ensue as Tony attempts to conceal or explain his near-naked presence in Betty's bedroom.

==History==
[[File:The Girl in the Limousine 1921 advert.PNG|thumb|Advertisement for the play in ''[[The Jacksonville Daily Journal]]'', February 2, 1921]]
Wilson Collison wrote the initial version of the play and offered it to producer Al Woods, who had previously produced ''[[Up in Mabel's Room (play)|Up in Mabel's Room]]'', a play Collison co-wrote with [[Otto Hauerbach]]. Woods gave it to Avery Hopwood for revisions. The play was initially titled ''Betty's Bed'', but was changed for production to ''The Girl in the Limousine'', despite the fact that no female character is in a limousine at any time during the story.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Emergence of the Modern American Theater, 1914-1929 |first=Ronald Harold |last=Wainscott |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |year=1997 |isbn=0-300-06776-3 |oclc=35128122 |pages=56â€“57}}</ref>
