'''Skyline''' {{airline codes|OX||}} was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] charter airline which operated from 1971 to 1978. It had a fleet of [[Vickers Viscount]] aircraft, operating between one and three at any given time and a total of five aircraft. Based in [[Malmö]], it initially flew out of [[Bulltofta Airport|Malmö Bulltofta Airport]]. The airport closed in 1972 and Skyline moved to [[Malmö Airport|Malmö Sturup Airport]].

From 1975 to 1977 the company experienced a major increase to traffic flying three aircraft for [[Linjeflyg]] for its scheduled, domestic network. Flying out of [[Stockholm Bromma Airport]], it served seven towns in southern Sweden. On 15 January 1977 one its aircraft flying [[Linjeflyg Flight 618]] crashed at [[Kälvesta]] during approach to Bromma, killing all 22 people on board. The Linjeflyg contract expired that year and the company ceased operations in 1978.

Because of delays of the delivery of their new [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] aircraft, Linjefly started in 1975 to [[wet lease]] flights from Skyline. Initially these consisted of the routes [[Stockholm]]–[[Kalmar]]–[[Ronneby]], Stockholm–Visby, Stockholm–Visby–Kalmar–Ronneby–Malmö, Stockholm–[[Hultsfred]]–[[Växjö]]–[[Kristianstad]]–Malmö.To deal with the traffic, Skyline leased two additional Viscounts, the larger 814D model with capacity for 75 passengers. These had originally been delivered to [[Lufthansa]]. Skyline operated with their own crew and aircraft, but with Linjeflyg's [[flight code]]s and chartered for an hourly fee. During the late 1970s Linjeflyg accounted for the vast majority of Skyline's revenue, although it continued to supplement with conventional charter flights.<ref name="sanz"/>

The airline replaced its first aircraft with a similar, larger Vickers 838 Viscount. That year Skyline started two additional routes for Linjeflyg: Stockholm–[[Jönköping]] and Stockholm–[[Karlstad]]. However, the aircraft would be written off in Flight 618 on 15 January 1977 and was therefore replaced with a leased Viscont 814D. This arrangement lasted for some months, before Skyline's contract with Linjeflyg was terminated due to the delivery of the F28s.<ref name=sanz /> Skyline ceased operations in 1978.<ref name=asn />

==Accidents and incidents==
{{main|Linjeflyg Flight 618}}

Skyline's only accident<ref name=asn /> was Linjeflyg Flight 618, which took place during approach to [[Stockholm Bromma Airport]] at 09:05 on 15 January 1977. The flight was operated from Malmö to Stockholm via Kristianstand, Växjö and Jönköping. During approach to Stockholm Bromma Airport the horizontal stabilizer experienced [[atmospheric icing]]. Low power on two of the engines had caused reduced function of the [[ice protection system]], causing a buildup of ice. During approach the pilots suddenly lost pitch control and the aircraft crashed in the neighborhood of [[Kälvesta]], Stockholm. There were nineteen passengers and a crew of three on board; all were killed in the accident.<ref name=sanz />
