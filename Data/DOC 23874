==Shakespeare Program==
One of the hallmarks of Donahue Academy has been the Shakespeare program founded in 2015 by Peter Atkinson, a graduate of [[Ave Maria University]].

His teaching model was based on that of [[Shakespeare & Company (Massachusetts)|Shakespeare & Company]]. In 2017, Atkinson left his teaching position to pursue further education at Columbia University. Robert Gotschall, another former member of the ''Shakespeare in Performance'' program, who had previously taught at Mason Classical Academy in Naples, took charge of the program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/local/communities/collier-citizen/2017/06/14/whats-up-ave-maria-dan-guernsey-returns-lead-donahue-academy-forward/397493001/|title=What's Up in Ave Maria: Dan Guernsey returns to lead Donahue Academy forward|work=Naples Daily News|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}</ref>
