Welcome to the fourth edition of WikiProject Transport's newsletter, designed to get this sleepy project back to work and bring updates to the participants of the latest happenings on transport related articles. If you notice the fairly empty lists to the right - 1 new featured articles, only 6 new Good articles and no new members. I encourage you all to come back and help the project by voting in [[WP:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Transportation|transport AfDs]], having a look at [[WP:WikiProject Transport/to do|our to-do list]], tagging and rating the talk pages of articles, inviting editors to [[WP:WikiProject Transport#Who are we?|sign up]] to us or one of [[WP:WikiProject Transport#Child projects|our sister projects]]. Get involved! Get the project active again!
