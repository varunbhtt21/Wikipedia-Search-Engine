'''Ponderosa Twins Plus One''' was an American [[soul music|soul]] [[vocal group]] formed in 1970 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. The group featured two sets of identical twins, Alfred and Alvin Pelham, and Keith and Kirk Gardner, along with Ricky Spicer. The group released one studio album, ''[[2 + 2 + 1 = Ponderosa Twins Plus One]]'', in 1971, before disbanding in 1975.

The group came into prominence after their track, "Bound" was sampled by rapper [[Kanye West]] in his 2013 song, "[[Bound 2]]". This was followed by a [[Legal issues surrounding music sampling|copyright lawsuit]] by Ricky Spicer.

==History==
The group was founded in 1970 while the all original members attended the Patrick Henry Jr. High School on the east side of Cleveland. The group was managed by Tony Wilson, who brought them to the attention of Bobby Massey of [[The O'Jays]]. Through Massey, the group eventually signed to [[Chuck Brown]]'s Astroscope record label.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-ponderosa-twins-plus-one-mn0001450774/biography | title=The Ponderosa Twins Plus One | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=May 2, 2014 | author=Hamilton, Andrew}}</ref>

Accompanied by Massey, the group recorded three singles in a studio. [[Sylvia Robinson]], the owner of [[All Platinum Records]], agreed to distribute singles. The group's first single, "You Send Me" became their best-selling single,<ref name="allmusic-bio"/><ref>{{cite journal | title=Gold for All Platinium policy | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=April 1972  | volume=84 | issue=17 | pages=54 | issn=0006-2510 | author = Bottstein, Dan }}</ref> peaking at number 23 at ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Best Selling Soul Singles]].<ref name="soul-singles1">{{cite journal | title=Soul Singles chart | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 1971  | volume=83 | issue=46 | pages=50 | issn=0006-2510 }}</ref> Following the success of the single, the group toured with artists such as [[Ray, Goodman & Brown|the Moments]], [[the Whatnauts]], [[Linda Jones]] and [[Lonnie Youngblood]].<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>
