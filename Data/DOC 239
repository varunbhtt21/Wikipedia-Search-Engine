'''Propose merging''' [[Template:Jennifer Nettles]] with [[Template:Sugarland]].<br />
Nettles has too few solo works at the moment to warrant her own template. The only three solo works with their own pages are "That Girl", its title track, and "Who Says You Can't Go Home". The rest of the links are all duplicates of the Sugarland template, thus creating massive overlap. The Sugarland template should be sufficient at the moment. <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 03:48, 5 March 2014 (UTC)

'''Propose merging''' [[Template:Rellink]] with [[Template:Hatnote]].<br />
These two templates are essentially the same with the exception of another syntax qualifier that can be added to {{Tl|Hatnote}} from {{Tl|Rellink}} without having to manually update any values in the 800,000 combined transclusions of these templates. Also, for further notes about this, please see a related discussion at [[Template talk:Hatnote#Conversion to Lua]].

*'''Comment''' can this be done quickly, or the template note be taken off every single page that this appears on?

*'''Merge. Keep name {{tl|hatnote}}, and keep using class name <code>class=rellink</code>'''. Because <code>class=dablink</code> still uses old disambiguation background, which is too limited by now. {{tl|Hatnote}} allows any text, not just dab-related. This applies to more hatnote templates, for example, {{tl|main}} has nothing to do with WP:DAB. -[[User:DePiep|DePiep]] ([[User talk:DePiep|talk]]) 13:09, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*:{{Ping|DePiep}} I believe that a more accurate option world be to replace both the "dablink" and "rellink" classes with a "hatnote" class, considering that not all hatnotes have to do with disambiguation (or whatever "rellink" is short for), but all hatnotes are ... hatnotes.

:::{{ping|Steel1943}} yes, <code>class="hatnote"</code> is even better. Don't know if class renaming is doable, and whether a TfD can cover that. A "phase one out" choice is within reach. -[[User:DePiep|DePiep]] ([[User talk:DePiep|talk]]) 20:36, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::::{{Ping|DePiep}} I would I believe that the class renaming option is completely doable, given that it looks like the only two templates that directly use the "dablink" or "rellink" classes in their syntax are {{Tl|Hatnote}} and {{Tl|Rellink}}. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.) But, just in case, it may be safer to just phase out one, and leave the other, as you stated, since yeah, we shouldn't unknowingly be breaking Wikipedia.

this navbox wrapper is no longer used in article space after a massive cleanup effort by {{U|NSH002}}. per the discussion there, this is really only needed in one article, [[The Beatles]], and more targeted navboxes should and are used in the-Beatles-related articles.  I, personally, would like to see the pre-August 2011 history of this template merged into [[Template:The Beatles main]], and either (a) redirect it to {{tld|The Beatles main}} or (b) move {{tld|The Beatles main}} to this title.  I have nominated it here for further discussion. [[User:Frietjes|Frietjes]] ([[User talk:Frietjes|talk]]) 15:56, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
* There are three options here (see the discussion on the talk page):
*# simply delete this template (advantage: prevents people adding it to any article only remotely connected with the Beatles)
*# redirect to {{tld|The Beatles main}} - the easiest option (a history merge would not be necessary)
*# merge the pre-August 2011 edit history of this template with that of {{tld|The Beatles main}}, which would then become {{tld|The Beatles}}

: For the reasons stated on the talk page, I prefer #3 - overall, the neatest result in the end.

This seems to be intended as a module for {{tl|Infobox web browser}}, transcluded in two articles (including once inside a table), and called somewhat awkwardly by the main template. From the code, it does nothing more than mapping <code>label1</code> to parameter <code>1</code>, <code>data1</code> to parameter <code>2</code>, etc. If a software's version numbers are genuinely so unusual to require such a byzantine solution, it might be better to omit them from the infobox, and explain them in the main body of the article. [[User:Underlying lk|eh bien mon prince]] ([[User talk:Underlying lk|talk]]) 02:07, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' (''!vote by author''): I made this template to replace [[template:latest stable software release/Opera Mini|templates like this]] with a single unified display, as {{tl|LSR}} subtemplates tend to break. The simplistic approach, noted by nominator, is currently employed simply because the template is in its infancy – it was created on April 18, and still requires [[template talk:LSR#Edit link|edit to protected template]] in order to be usable. (The latter is the reason it is not really used anywhere.) Both {{tl|LSR}} and this template mainly exist to maintain version information across multiple articles, and this purpose will be defeated with proposed solution to explain versioning in plain text in the body of the article. I would also note, that the problem this template is supposed to address isn't uncommon, so it has some potential. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D. Czarkoff]] ([[user talk:czarkoff|talk]]•[[Special:Contributions/czarkoff|track]]) 09:03, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Yes this template is still at infancy and that's why I didn't replicate the change from {{tl|Infobox web browser}} to {{tl|Infobox software}}. But let's not commit infanticide. The first thing we need to do is to add a section header to {{tlp|Infobox web browser}} and fix the overflow problem in doc page. The rest, we will figure out. Meanwhile, detaching version numbering from the infobox does not have consensus; in fact, there is a backlash against it.
