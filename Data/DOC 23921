===Florida State University===
[[File:Kassey Kallman (cropped).jpg|left|Kallman at Florida State|thumb]]
Kallman burst onto the ACC women's soccer scene, leading the [[Florida State Seminoles women's soccer|Seminoles]] her freshman year in minutes played and was the only true freshman to start every game while being named Second-Team All-ACC, to the All-ACC Freshman Team and was a Soccer America First-Team Freshman All-American.<ref name=uswnt_bio/><ref name=fsu_bio>{{cite web|url= http://www.seminoles.com/sports/w-soccer/mtt/kassey_kallman_700938.html |title= Kassey Kallman Biography |publisher=Florida State University |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>  That year, Kallman scored her first collegiate goal against in-state rival the [[Florida Gators women's soccer|Florida Gators]] in the 89th minute to send that game into overtime.  She followed that up as a sophomore by playing every minute of all 26 games for Florida State while helping the Seminoles to their first ACC Championship and fifth NCAA College Cup appearance.  She was then named captain for her junior year, leading The Seminole defense that blanked their first eight ACC opponents en route to claiming the ACC regular season title for the second time in school history, and continued her senior when she was a Hermann Trophy Semifinalist and Honda Award finalist.<ref name=fsu_bio/>  She was the first player from Florida State to be named ACC Defensive Player of the Year and even from the backline, Kallman had two important game winning goals in a senior campaign that came just short of a national championship, losing to UCLA in the final.<ref name=uswnt_bio/>  That year she led a Seminole defense ranked in the top 25 nationally in goals against average (7th) and shutout percentage (17th), while their 15 shutouts are the second most in school history – two off the school record of 17 set her junior year.<ref name=fsu_bio/>

Kallman tallied 94 career starts in four seasons at Florida State with 27 points on 10 goals and seven assists, tying her for the seventh most starts in school history.<ref name=fsu_bio/>   She was a fixture in the Seminole backline her entire four years in college and led Florida State to three straight College Cup appearances (2011, 2012 & 2013), two ACC titles (2011 & 2013) and a conference regular season championship in 2012.<ref name=fsu_bio/> In 2013, Kallman was named the ACC Defensive Player of the Year, garnered Most Valuable Player honors at the ACC Tournament, and earned a spot on the All-ACC first team and All-Tournament team. She was also a finalist for the Senior CLASS Award. For the second year in a row, Kallman was named a second team Academic All-American by Capital One becoming the program’s first two-time Academic All-American.<ref name=uswnt_bio/><ref name=fsu_bio/><ref name=soccerwire_bio>{{cite web|url= http://www.soccerwire.com/players/kassey-kallman/ |title= Kassey Kallman Biography |publisher=Soccer Wire |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

==Club career==
===FC Kansas City===
In the second [[2014 NWSL College Draft|collegiate draft]] for the [[National Women's Soccer League]], [[FC Kansas City]] selected Kallman with their first pick, the fifth pick overall,<ref name=FCKC_bio>{{cite web|title=Kassey Kallman | url=http://www.fckansascity.com/2014/01/17/kassey-kallman/ | publisher=FC Kansas City | accessdate=April 30, 2014 | date=April 30, 2014}}</ref> following four of her teammates from the [[2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup|2012 U-20 World Cup]] team: [[Crystal Dunn]], [[Kealia Ohai]], [[Julie Johnston]], and [[Vanessa DiBernardo]].

As most of Kallman’s collegiate and U-20 international experience was spent in the central defense, she was largely expected to step into the hole in that position left by [[Lauren Sesselmann]]’s departure for the [[Houston Dash]] through the [[2014 NWSL Expansion Draft]].  However, through the first few games of the 2014 NWSL season, she featured as the left [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]], providing width in the attack for FC Kansas City’s possession-oriented style.  Kallman adjusted to the role well, particularly against the high-powered attacks of the [[Portland Thorns FC|Portland Thorns]] and [[Seattle Reign FC|Seattle Reign]] during the playoffs, helping the Blues win the 2014 NWSL Championship.

===Boston Breakers===
On October 27, 2014 Kallman was traded to the [[Boston Breakers]] for [[Heather O'Reilly]], along with [[Morgan Marlborough]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Breakers trade O’Reilly to FC Kansas City for Kallman, Marlborough|url=http://womens.soccerly.com/2014/10/27/heather-oreilly-traded-fc-kansas-city-boston-breakers/|publisher=Soccerly|accessdate=October 27, 2014|date=October 27, 2014}}</ref>

===Washington Spirit===
In November 2016, Kallman was traded to the [[Washington Spirit]] along with [[Kristie Mewis]] for [[Megan Oyster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonspirit.com/pro/washington-spirit-acquires-kristie-mewis-kassey-kallman-and-no-1-spot-in-the-distribution-ranking-order-from-boston-breakers/|title=Washington Spirit Acquires Kristie Mewis, Kassey Kallman, and No. 1 Spot in the Distribution Ranking Order from Boston Breakers|work=[[Washington Spirit]]|date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

==International career==
Kallman’s first-ever national team call-up came in January 2011 after her freshman season at FSU when she was invited in with the U.S. U-20s.<ref name=uswnt_bio/>

Kallman became an important member of the [[United States women's national under-20 soccer team|U-20 US national team]] that won the [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup|FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in Japan in 2012. She started and played all 450 minutes of the qualifying games, leading the squad in minutes and served as team captain in the final pool play match against Panama.<ref name=FCKC_bio/>

In February 2014, Kallman was among six players recently drafted into the NWSL and five members of the U.S. team that won the [[2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]] that were called up by [[Steven Swanson]] to represent the USA in La Manga, Spain, for the 2014 Six Nations Tournament. The USA won the tournament, defeating the U-23 sides of Japan (1–0), Sweden (2–1), and Norway (2–1) as Kallman went the full 90 against Japan and Norway.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/13/46/140301-usa-1-jpn-0 | title= U.S. U-23 WNT Opens Year with 1–0 Victory against Japan in La Manga, Spain}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/52/140305-usa-2-nor-1 | title= U.S. U-23 WNT Wins Six Nations Tournament in La Manga, Spain with 2–1 Victory Against Norway}}</ref>
