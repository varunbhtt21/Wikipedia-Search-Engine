'''''Colchicum ritchii''''', or the '''Egyptian autumn crocus''', is a plant species native to the southeastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] east to the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

==Description==
''Colchicum ritchii'' grows from a [[corm]] which is oval measuring 2-3.5&nbsp;cm across, and covered with a  loose brown skin. The leaves, which emerge and develop at the same time as the flowers, are largely hairless and elongate after flowering to form a cone which protects the developing fruits. The flowers which appear in December, January and February are white or pink, with plants with either colour frequently growing alongside each other.  Each plant produces 2-10 flowers, which each have 6 [[tepal]]s, 6 [[anther]]s and 3 [[style (botany)|style]]s. The inner tepals are ridged with just one, or at most very few teeth at the base, near the base of the anther. The anthers are black, but get covered by yellow pollen. The fruit is a green, irregularly shaped capsule, up to 35&nbsp;mm long and 15&nbsp;mm across which contains round, globular seeds.<ref name = FOI>{{cite web | url = http://flora.org.il/en/plants/colrit/ | title = Colchicum ritchii R.Br. | accessdate = 2016-11-26 | publisher = Prof. Avinoam Danin|work = Flora of Israel Online}}</ref>
