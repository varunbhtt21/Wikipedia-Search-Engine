Title : Gothic name
Text : [[Onomastics]] of the [[Gothic language]] is an important source not only for the history of the [[Goths]] themselves, but for [[Germanic name|Germanic onomastics]] in general and the linguistic and cultural history of the [[Germanic Heroic Age]] of c. the 3rd to 6th centuries.

The [[names of the Goths]] themselves have been traced to their 3rd century [[Oium|settlement]] in [[Scythia]]. 
The names [[Tervingi]] and [[Greuthungi]] have been interpreted as meaning "forest-dwellers" and "steppe-dwellers", respectively, and the
later [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothi]] and [[Visigoths|Visigothi]] as "oriental Goths" and "occidental Goths", respectively, although all four etymologies are not without detractors.<ref> Arne Søby Christensen, Heidi Flegal (trans.), ''Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth'' [https://books.google.ch/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC&pg=PA205 205f.]</ref>

Gothic [[given name]]s are recorded from the 4th century, but often in corrupted Latinized forms, so that in many cases their etymology is open to speculation. 
[[Jordanes]] gives partly mythological genealogies leading up to historical 4th to 5th century rulers:
*[[Amali dynasty]]:  [[Gapt]], Hulmu,  Augis, Amal,  Athal, Achiulf, Oduulf, Ansila, Ediulf, Vultuulf, [[Ermanaric]]
*Vultuulf, Valaravans, Vinithariust Vandalarius, [[Theodemir]], [[Valamir]],  Vidimer.

An important source of early Gothic names is the hagiography surrounding the [[Gothic persecution of Christians|persecution of Gothic Christians]] (by the pagan Terving Gothic authorities) in the second half of the 4th century. Many of the Gothic saints mentioned in these sources bear  Syrian, Cappadocian and Phrygian names, however, perhaps reflecting a practice of assuming a baptismal name.

Numerous Gothic names are recorded for the 5th to 7th centuries. After the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim in invasion of Hispania]] and the fall of the [[Visigothic kingdom]] in the early 8th century, Gothic tradition was largely interrupted, although Gothic or pseudo-Gothic<ref>H Reichert, "Sprache und Namen der Wandalen in Afrika" in: Albrecht Greule, Matthias Springer  (eds.), ''Namen des Frühmittelalters als sprachliche Zeugnisse und als Geschichtsquellen'', [https://books.google.ch/books?id=y8jyenL7RSwC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false 50f.]
</ref> names continued to be given in the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], the remnant of the Visigothic state and nucleus of the  [[Reconquista|Christian reconquest]] of Andalusia.
Thus, [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] (recorded as ''Adefonsus''), born one generation after the Muslim invasion, was given the Gothic name ''*Adafuns'' or ''Adalfuns'', which as ''[[Alfonso]]'' would become a frequently used royal name in the medieval  Iberian kingdoms.
In the [[Septimania|Gothic March]] north of the Pyrenees, the remnant of the Visigothic state conquered by the [[Francia|Franks]] in the 9th century, Gothic names continued to be common until the 10th centuries, with an example of a record of a mother and her eight children all bearing Gothic names dated to 964.<ref>Wolfram (1990:[https://books.google.ch/books?id=E268TW_Z1qMC&pg=PA233 p. 233])</ref>
