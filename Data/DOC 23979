Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''keep'''. Thanks {{u|Kevin Gorman}}. I'm generally wary of AfDs with only one editor against another, and unless the nomination clearly proposes a non-deletion action, I'd wait for more opinions. A couple keep endorsements is enough for me in this case. ([[Wikipedia:non-admin closure|non-admin closure]]) [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 12:04, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

most sources are the organization themself. once source is a nonnotable online mag published by a commercial food company. only one other source mentions them, in passing, where the main subject is the food coop.

*I'm holding officehours with students currently; I'll have more thorough comment up as I can.  This is an article coming out of a course that I'm involved in.  I *believe* I have enough sources on file to exceed the GNG for it pretty easily; once I'm done here I will check and get back.  From memory, I think I had ~10 RS's that dedicated significant coverage to it.  If I'm wrong, I'll find an appropriate place to merge the content in to if one exists and take care of it myself, if not, I'll be back here with sources shortly.  The article definitely would benefit from using more secondary sources, but if notability is established independently, that'd be a process for repair (which I'll also work on once instruction ends,) rather than deletion.

:*Actually, although I'm not done here yet, taking a quick look at the org's own [http://www.mandelamarketplace.org/#!in-the-news/cs40 press file,] I think it demonstrates that the org exceeds the level of coverage necessary for the GNG.  Not all of the linked articles are RS'es, but a number that include significant coverage are. I'll be back with more indepth analysis of sources later.

*I managed to get sick at about the worst time of the year possible for this project.  That said, I think that these sources: [http://organicconnectmag.com/mandela-marketplace-beacon-healthy-hope-disadvantaged-west-oakland/#.U0SMJ61dUnd Organic Connect Magazine,] [http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Oakland-Start-Ups-May-Tap-Into-Kiva-Micro-Lending-208419791.html This piece from NBC,] [http://civileats.com/2012/10/16/all-together-now-world-food-day-2012/ this piece from CivilEats,] [https://oaklandnorth.net/2012/09/13/white-house-celebrates-oakland-food-champion/ this piece from OaklandNorth which talks about Mandela receiving a national award], [http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2012/09/10/west-oakland-activist-honored-by-the-white-house/ this piece from KQED (one of the top five NPR affiliates in the country], as well as a bunch of other coverage they've received demonstrates that the they certainly pass the GNG.  (If I looked back through our local outlets archives, I could probably find at least a few dozen outlets talking about Mandela - they've attracteda lot of attention.)

*Hi {{ping|Mz7}} - I'm not sure a relist is really needed.  I linked a major NPR affiliate's article solely about Mandela, as well as an NBC article about it, several pieces of local coverage, and a link to their press file which contains dozens of reliable sources talking about Mandela. That's way more than enough to pass the gng.  I think this is a pretty clear case of "keep, but the sourcing needs to be improved."  Poor sourcing (where better sourcing is available) is not a reason for deletion.  Once the semester has fully finished I'll add in the extra sourcing myself if my students' haven't, but there's really no way this fails the GNG.
