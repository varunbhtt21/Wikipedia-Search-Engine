==Life and work==
Reas grew up in a [[working class]] family on the [[Buttershaw]] council estate in [[Bradford]].<ref name="jim-greenhalf-telegraph-argus">{{cite news | url = http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/10838742.Photographer_Paul_Reas_puts_the_world_on_his_old_doorstep/ | date = 28 November 2013 | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | first = Jim | last = Greenhalf | publisher = [[Telegraph & Argus]] | title = Bradfordian returns with his own exhibition}}</ref> He was born and lived with four siblings in a house on Brafferton Arbor (since demolished) and was mostly raised by his mother, who also worked at [[John Logie Baird|Baird Television Ltd.]] assembling televisions,<ref name="jim-greenhalf-telegraph-argus" /> or as a cleaner.<ref name="whoslooking38">[[Val Williams]], Carol Brown and Brigitte Lardinois, eds, ''Who's Looking at the Family?''

He left Bradford to study documentary photography at the [[University of Wales, Newport]] from 1982 to 1984.<ref name="karin-andreasson-guardian">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/12/paul-reas-best-shot-dad-army-wallpaper | date = 12 March 2014 | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | first = Karin | last = Andreasson | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = Paul Reas's best shot: a dad buying army wallpaper for his son}}</ref> [[David Hurn]] was course head and among his tutors were [[Daniel Meadows]], John Benton-Harris and [[Martin Parr]].

He photographed working people, taking inspiration from both August Sander and Lee Friedlander's portrayal of working people, that he considered gave them the grace and dignity he experienced working in industry.<ref group="n">As seen in Sander's ''People of the 20th Century'' series and Friedlander's ''Lee Friedlander at Work'' (2002).

He was aware of the colour photography of [[Paul Graham (photographer)|Paul Graham]] and Martin Parr, Charlie Meecham and Bob Phillips, but it was seeing the work of North American colour photographers [[William Eggleston]], [[Joel Sternfeld]], [[Stephen Shore]] and [[Joel Meyerowitz]] that convinced him to change to colour for his own work and put him into an influential group of British colour documentarists including Graham and [[Anna Fox]].<ref name="elegies" /> He changed to a larger format camera, which allowed smaller details to be easily read and understood, not requiring the bold graphic statements he considered necessary with 35&nbsp;mm;<ref name="reas-impressions-gallery">{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_o6AFAPU0Q | date = 14 February 2014 | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | first = Paul | last = Reas | publisher = Paul Reas | title = Paul Reas Impressions Gallery Talk}}</ref><!-- This source may not be good enough --> and to using a [[Flash (photography)|flashgun]].

In 1985 he and Ron McCormick were the first photographers commissioned by [[Ffotogallery]] in Wales as part of its ''Valleys Project'' to each produce a body of work which "focussed on the changing topographic landscape and the partial introduction of new technology into a latter day industrial wasteland". Other photographers commissioned were [[David Bailey]], Mike Berry, [[John Davies (photographer)|John Davies]], [[Peter Fraser (photographer)|Peter Fraser]], Francesca Odell, [[Roger Tiley]] and William Tsui.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ffotogallery.org/whats-on/the-valleys-archive | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | publisher = [[Ffotogallery]] | title = The Valleys Archive}}</ref><ref group="n">A resource on the Valleys Project is available [http://www.ffotogallery.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Ffotogallery-TheValleysArchive.pdf here] (PDF) within Ffotogallery's website.</ref>

Reas's first book, ''I Can Help,'' shows supermarkets, superstores and the like, photographed from 1985 to 1988. [[Val Williams]] writes that "The people who Reas photographed emerged from its pages .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as lost souls, modern Ancient Mariners adrift in an ocean of endless choices."<ref name="elegies" /> The photographs (1989–1993) in his second book, ''Flogging a Dead Horse'', "explored the rise of the heritage business, taking issue with what he judged to be the cynical re-writing of the past of British working people by the leisure industry"; they are "edgy, viciously satirical comments on our appetite for vicarious experience."<ref name="elegies" />

Reas worked commercially as an editorial photographer for ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'', ''[[The Observer]]''<ref name="jim-greenhalf-telegraph-argus" /> and the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/lizll-fix-it-1613712.html | date = 1 April 1995 | accessdate = 27 April 2014 | first = Amanda | last = Mitchison | publisher = [[The Independent]] | title = Liz'll Fix It}}</ref> For a period he worked as an advertising photographer for clients such as BT and Volkswagen.<ref name="jim-greenhalf-telegraph-argus" />

He taught at the Faculty of Arts, [[University of Brighton]], from 1993 to 1998.<ref name="observer-lewis">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/paddy-considine-actor-i-was-portrayed-angry-i-was-just-ill | date = 7 September 2014 | accessdate = 8 September 2014 | first = Tim | last = Lewis | newspaper = [[The Observer]] | title = Paddy Considine: ‘I was always portrayed as angry, but I was just ill’ | quote = "Considine left for Brighton University to study photography, under the social documentarian Paul Reas"}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/faculty-of-arts-brighton/alumni-and-associates/associates-and-alumni/photography/paul-rees | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | publisher = [[University of Brighton]] | title = Paul Reas | quote = Reas taught at the Faculty of Arts from 1993-1998 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131208211725/http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/faculty-of-arts-brighton/alumni-and-associates/associates-and-alumni/photography/paul-rees | archivedate = 8 December 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> He is course leader of [[documentary photography]] at the University of Wales, Newport.

In 2011/2012 Reas completed ''From a Distance'', a year-long commission on the regeneration of the [[Elephant and Castle]] in South London, part of ''The Elephant Vanishes'' project, directed by Patrick Sutherland, for London College of Communication. He photographed people candidly, showing fraught and tense emotions (with the aid of an assistant with a [[Boom operator (media)|boom mounted]] flashgun); portraits; cans of incense intended to provide help under specific social pressures; and discarded furniture. The photographs were exhibited in 2012 and published by [[Photography and the Archive Research Centre]] (PARC) in ''Fieldstudy 16: From a Distance''.<ref group="n">''Fieldstudy 16'' is available [http://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/6261/1/Fieldstudy_Distance3.pdf here] (PDF) within the UAL Research Online website.</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/oct/19/distance-utilitarianism-moral-architectural-fail | date = 19 October 2012 | accessdate = 26 April 2014 | first = Giles | last = Fraser | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = Because it sees us from a distance, utilitarianism will always fail}}</ref>

Reas has said of his work that "I would say I photograph people but I think the pictures are more about systems people find themselves in, people shopping in supermarkets, but it’s about consumerism and how we are caught up in that. I never set anything up. Everything I photograph is as it happens".<ref name="jim-greenhalf-telegraph-argus" />

As well as consumerism, Reas has also been concerned with politics, Americanisation, the heritage industry, gender politics and how northern working-class people are historically represented. His work is usually biographical.

In 1993, Reas began a series, ''Portrait of an Invisible Man,'' that examined the mystery of his distant and mostly absent father "by photographing the microcosm which a child observes in the macrocosm of home".<ref name="whoslooking38" /> The curators of an exhibition at the Barbican wrote of this series: "Paul Reas's meticulously constructed descriptions of domestic life may perhaps exorcise demons, the ghouls and goblins which inhabit a child's imagination; they are photography as remedy, as exhumation and a personal adventure on a grand scale."<ref name="whoslooking38" />

Williams writes that Reas's work of the early 1990s "assume a documentary stance, but they are essentially polemical."<ref name="elegies" /> Robert Clark writes in ''[[The Guardian]]'':

<blockquote>Reas has an eye for themes that reveal a prevailing air of social disillusionment and cultural vacuity. As traditional industry disappears, we see the emergence of assembly-line technologies. The architectural identity of towns dissolve to make way for out-of-town shopping malls. Heritage-industry theme parks indulge in a politically dubious nostalgia as the London property boom explodes. On the face of it it’s unrelentingly grim. Yet Reas populates such scenes with real characters, replete with poker-faced humour and shrugging defiance."<ref name="robert-clark-guardian">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/dec/13/paul-reas-exhibitions-art-shows | date = 13 December 2013 | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | first1 = Skye | last1 = Sherwin | first2 = Robert | last2 = Clark | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = Paul Paul Reas, Edward Chell, Sislej Xhafa: this week's art shows in pictures}}</ref></blockquote>
