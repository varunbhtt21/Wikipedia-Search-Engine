Text : '''Richard Malone, 1st Baron Sunderlin''' (c.1738 – 14 April 1816) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] politician and peer.<ref>John Lodge and Mervyn Archdall, ''The Peerage of Ireland: Or, A Genealogical History of the Present Nobility of that Kingdom'', Volume 7 (J. Moore, 1789), 292-293.</ref>

Sunderlin was the eldest son and heir of Edmond Malone and Catherine Collier.<ref>John Lodge and Mervyn Archdall, ''The Peerage of Ireland: Or, A Genealogical History of the Present Nobility of that Kingdom'', Volume 7 (J. Moore, 1789), 292-293.</ref> His uncle was the lawyer, [[Anthony Malone]], from whom Sunderlin inherited extensive estates in the counties of Westmeath, Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, and Dublin. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], from where he graduated in 1755, before studying for an MA at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], which he achieved in 1759. He also attended [[Middle Temple]] and became a [[barrister]], practising in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. 

He served as the Member of Parliament for [[Granard (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Granard]] between 1769 and 1776, and then as the MP for [[Banagher (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Banagher]] from 1783 to 1785.<ref>John Lodge and Mervyn Archdall, ''The Peerage of Ireland: Or, A Genealogical History of the Present Nobility of that Kingdom'', Volume 7 (J. Moore, 1789), 292-293.</ref> On 30 June 1785, he was created '''Baron Sunderlin''' of Lake Sunderlin in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], thus entitling him to a seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]]. As Sunderlin had no children, a patent was created in 1797, when he was made '''Baron Sunderlin''' of Baronston, also in the Peerage of Ireland, with special remainder to his brother,<ref>[[Sir James Prior]], ''Life of Edmond Malone, Editor of Shakespeare'' (Smith, Elder & Company, 1860), 240.</ref> the Shakespearean scholar and editor, [[Edmond Malone]]. However, his brother predeceased him, and both titles became extinct upon his death.
