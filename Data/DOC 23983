Initial reports said 350 people were killed<ref name="BBC "/> and 2,500 were missing.<ref name="WSJ "/> After the scope of the disaster became clear, the death toll was increased to an estimated 2,100 the next day by Badakhshan government officials.<ref name="TOI"/> However, Gul Mohammad Bedar, the deputy provincial governor of Badakhshan, later said: "The first figure that we announced was obtained from local people, not from our technical team. We think the dead toll will not rise beyond 500." The UN said that 350 were confirmed dead and it was unlikely to find more bodies due to the "catastrophic nature" of the mudslide.<ref name="aljaz">{{Cite web | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/05/thousands-reported-dead-afghan-landslide-20145372655196915.html| title = Afghan landslide survivor search abandoned | publisher = Al-Jazeera | date = 4 May 2014 | accessdate = 4 May 2014}}</ref>

== Reactions ==
The governor of [[Badakhshan Province]] said that the mudslides were "massive and it's beyond human ability to take all the dead bodies out [...] This is a disaster and a tragedy".<ref name="WSJ "/> He further stated that clearing out the bodies would be impossible so the site should be left as a [[mass grave]].<ref name="G "/> He also appealed for more shovels to dig people out.<ref name="aljaz"/>

Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]] stated that he is "deeply saddened by the loss of lives and financial damage".<ref name="WSJ "/> U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said: "Our thoughts are with the people of Afghanistan who are facing a terrible tragedy [...] We stand ready to help our Afghan partners to face this disaster".<ref name="BBC" /><ref name="EN">{{cite web | url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/05/02/breaking-hundreds-reportedly-missing-after-mudslide-in-afghanistan/ | title=Afghanistan: Hundreds missing-feared-dead after mudslide | work=Euronews | date=2 May 2014 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Harris, Chris}}</ref>
