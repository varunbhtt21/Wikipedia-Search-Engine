== Years at MOCA ==
In 1990, Schimmel was appointed chief curator of [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)]].<ref name="Knight - Safe Harbor">{{cite news|last=Knight|first=Christopher|title=Leaving a Safe Harbor for MOCA : Chief curator Paul Schimmel is the first member of the local art community to get a top Southland museum position|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-15/entertainment/ca-1890_1_newport-harbor-art-museum|accessdate=2014-05-16|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 15, 1990}}</ref> During Schimmel's tenure, MOCA’s collection grew from 987 objects at the time of its founding to 6,735 objects at the time of Schimmel’s departure in 2012. Under his leadership, the museum acquired works by artists such as [[Diane Arbus]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Marlene Dumas]], Robert Gober, Jasper Johns, Mike Kelley, Paul McCarthy, Bruce Nauman, [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]], [[Jason Rhoades]], [[Nancy Rubins]], [[Edward Ruscha]], [[Franz West]]<ref name="MOCA Press Release">{{cite web|last1=Winter|first1=Lyn|title=MOCA Announces the Resignation of Paul Schimmel|url=http://www.moca.org/pdf/press/MOCA_Announces_the_Resignation_of_Paul_Schimmel.pdf|website=www.moca.org|publisher=moca.org|accessdate=6/2/14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626204627/http://www.moca.org/pdf/press/MOCA_Announces_the_Resignation_of_Paul_Schimmel.pdf|archivedate=2015-06-26|df=}}</ref> and [[Gregor Schneider]].<ref name="MOCA PRESENTS HAUNTING WORK BY AWARD-WINNING GERMAN ARTIST GREGOR SCHNEIDER">{{cite web|title=MOCA PRESENTS HAUNTING WORK BY AWARD-WINNING GERMAN ARTIST GREGOR SCHNEIDER|url=http://www.moca.org/museum/exhibitioninfo_viewable.php?useGallery=1&id=338|website=www.moca.org/museum/exhibitioninfo_viewable.php?useGallery=1&id=338}}</ref>
While at MOCA, Schimmel continued to spotlight trends in contemporary California art. His 1992 exhibition ''[[Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s]]'' proved to be a “game-changer,” bringing the work of many young Los Angeles artists to international attention for the first time under the umbrella of themes of alienation, dispossession, and violence.<ref name="Frank - Kelley">{{cite news|last=Frank|first=Priscilla|title='Mike Kelley: 1954-2012' A Tribute Exhibition At The Watermill Center|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/26/mike-kelley_n_1695858.html|accessdate=2014-05-16|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=July 26, 2012}}</ref>  ''Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974–1981'' examined the proliferation of diverse and often overlooked art practices in California through the lens of the Nixon era’s political climate.<ref name="Buckley - UTBBS">{{cite news|last=Buckley|first=Annie|title=Under The Big Black Sun|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/under-the-big-black-sun/|accessdate=2014-05-16|newspaper=Art Review, Art in America|date=December 22, 2011}}</ref>  In addition, he organized solo exhibitions of work by Los Angeles–based artists [[Laura Owens]] and [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]].

In June 2012, amid highly publicized internal turmoil at the museum, Schimmel resigned from MOCA, finishing work on the exhibition ''Destroy the Picture: Painting the Void, 1949–1962'' as an independent curator.<ref name="Finkel - Resigned, not Fired">{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title=MOCA says chief curator Paul Schimmel resigned and wasn't fired|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/30/entertainment/la-et-0630-moca-schimmel-20120630|accessdate=2014-05-16|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 30, 2012}}</ref>  On the occasion of his resignation, the museum’s Board of Trustees named an exhibition space at the Geffen Contemporary branch of the museum in his honor.<ref name="MOCA Press Release" />

== Hauser Wirth & Schimmel ==
In May 2013, [[Hauser & Wirth]] announced that Schimmel had joined the international gallery as a partner along with plans to open a new contemporary art space in Los Angeles, Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, which opened in 2016.<ref name="Finkel - PS Joins Gallery">{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title=Paul Schimmel joins gallery world, creating Hauser Wirth & Schimmel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/23/entertainment/la-et-cm-paul-schimmel-gallery-0130523|accessdate=2014-05-16|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>  Also in 2013, Schimmel organized the exhibition ''Re-View: Onnasch Collection'' for Hauser & Wirth, which opened in their London galleries and later traveled to their New York location.<ref name="Johnson - Onnasch">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=The Impact of Four Decades, Experienced Room by Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/arts/design/re-view-onnasch-collection-is-a-postwar-journey.html|accessdate=2014-05-16|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 20, 2014}}</ref> In February 2017, it was announced by Hauser & Wirth that Schimmel was no longer with the organization.

== Impact and Influence ==
Schimmel is known for his close working relationships with artists. In an interview with Charles Desmarais, he remarked, “Boy, you want to poison the well, you start putting curators in front! If you make them the ones that are leading the pack of dogs, you're going to follow the scent right into a bog! Whereas, if you stick with artists—and that's my total and simple mantra—if you stick with artists, it will keep you moving forward. Not every day in the right direction, but overall in the right direction.”<ref name="Desmarais Interview" />  Schimmel served as a co-director and chair of the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts.

In addition to championing California art and artists, Schimmel is best known for organizing large-scale, speculative exhibitions that examine overlooked tendencies in art or the interstitial periods between established art movements. He has been particularly focused on art of the postwar era, especially [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]], Pop, and early [[performance art]]. In a 2005 interview, described his “interest in connecting different elements, and crossing boundaries through very large-scale thematic exhibitions that define a very specific aspect of who we are culturally.”<ref name="Miles - Curatorial Ecstasy">{{cite news|last=Miles|first=Christopher|title=Curatorial Ecstasy|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2005-10-27/news/curatorial-ecstasy/|accessdate=2014-05-16|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=October 27, 2005}}</ref>

== Awards ==
