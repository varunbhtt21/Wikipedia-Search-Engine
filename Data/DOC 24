The '''Little River Turnpike Bridge''' carries [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|U.S. Route&nbsp;50]] (US&nbsp;50) across the [[Little River (Goose Creek)|Little River]] near [[Aldie, Virginia|Aldie]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia]]. The two-arch masonry bridge was built in 1826 by the [[Little River Turnpike]] Company, which built the roadway that is now US&nbsp;50. The costs of the bridge were apparently shared between that company and the Ashley's Gap Turnpike Company. It is one of a small number of masonry arch bridges still carrying a major through road in the state. It is about {{convert|108|ft|m}} long and {{convert|23|ft|m}} wide.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Loudoun/053-0244_Little_River_Turnpike_Bridge_2007_draft_Nomination.pdf|title=NRHP draft nomination for Little River Turnpike Bridge|publisher=Virginia DHR|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

The bridge has received only modest visible modifications since its construction. Concrete caps have been installed on upper surface elements, and the arch underside has also been protected with shotcrete.  The upstream central pier has had a concrete fender added to protect it from debris and scouring. The downstream parapet wall was damaged by a truck in 1998 and reconstructed, and in 2004 reinforcing metal rods were injected into the rubble of the bridge to help distribute the active load. {{As of|2014}}, the bridge has no weight limit.<ref name=NRHP/>

The bridge was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2014.<ref name="nps"/>
