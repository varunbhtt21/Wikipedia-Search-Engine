'''Blair Athol''' is a former town within [[Clermont, Queensland|Clermont]] in the [[Isaac Region]], [[Queensland]], Australia.<ref name=qpn>{{cite QPN|3138|Blair Athol|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> It was obliterated by the development of the [[Blair Athol coal mine]].

==History==
Early settler James MacLaren took up a pastoral run in the area in 1863 and named it Blair Athol after the village [[Blair Atholl]], the location of [[Blair Castle]] of the [[Duke of Atholl]] in Scotland.<ref name=qpn/> While sinking a well in 1864, he discovered coal on the property.<ref name=qha>{{cite web|last=Kerogen|first=Luke|title=Coal|url=http://www.qhatlas.com.au/content/coal|publisher=Queensland Historical Atlas|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>

By 1873, early shafts were dug, revealing extensive seams of coal. At that time, around 100 people were living in the town and there was a hotel, although no township had been officially surveyed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122561615 |title=PEAK DOWNS. |newspaper=[[Queensland Times, Ipswich Herald & General Advertiser]] |date=11 March 1873 |accessdate=25 April 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The town was surveyed in 1878.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51979969 |title=The Morning Bulletin, ROCKHAMPTON. |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=18 September 1878 |accessdate=25 April 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Blair Athol Provisional School opened on 6 November 1893. It became a State School in 1909.<ref name=qs>{{Cite QldSchool|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite QSA Agency|6528|Blair Athol State School|25 April 2014}}</ref>
 
Blair Athol Post Office opened on 1 July 1927 (a [[receiving office]] had been open from 1910) and closed in 1966.<ref name = "Post Office">{{Cite web  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List  | publisher = Premier Postal Auctions | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=QLD&country= | accessdate = 10 May 2014}}</ref>

On 18 May 1922, the [[Queensland Governor]] [[Matthew Nathan]] officially opened Australia's first open cut mine at Blair Athol.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54025257 |title=THE GOVERNOR'S TOUR. |newspaper=[[The Morning Bulletin]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=25 May 1922 |accessdate=25 April 2014 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

By the 1970s, it became apparent that there were significant coal seams under the town. In order to construct an open cut mine, the town had to be sacrificed.<ref name=qha/>

The school closed on 31 December 1974.<ref name=qs/>

In 1981 a reunion was held at the community hall to mark the final end of the town, following which all of the town was demolished. Only the cemetery remains.<ref name=qha/>
