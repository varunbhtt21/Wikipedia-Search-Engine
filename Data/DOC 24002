Not notable. Unable to locate significant coverage in independent reliable sources. Cited sources are unreliable databases (IMDb, IBDb), simple database listing (AllMusic) showing he exists and a bare mention in the ''NYT''.

*'''Keep''' Just looking at the [http://danmosesschreier.com/press.html Press] page on Schreier's website, he's been written about in the ''New York Times'', ''Variety'', ''Wall Street Journal'', ''Reuters'', and several other independent reliable sources.  And looking at the [http://danmosesschreier.com/bio.html Resume] page of his website, he has three Tony Award nominations, six Drama Desk Award nominations (including three wins), and an Obie Award.  On [https://www.google.com/#q=%22dan+moses+schreier%22+site:nytimes.com Google] it looks like he's gotten a "bare mention", on up to a more detailed discussion of his work on different plays, quite a few times in the ''New York Times'' alone.  I'd say he definitely passes the Wikipedia notability standard. <font face="cursive">— [[User:Mudwater|Mudwater]]<small><sup> ([[User talk:Mudwater|Talk]])</sup></small></font> 00:01, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Mudwater.  On the basis of the renown of the award (and the likely press coverage in reliable sources that winning it would generate), I hold to the general proposition that all winners of Drama Desk awards are presumptively notable.

*'''Keep''': Sufficient evidence can be found of multiple awards in his field to establish basic notability. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 05:58, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': Schreier has just been nominated for a 2014 Tony Award and has received two 2014 Drama Desk nominations for his work on Broadway. I believe artist who have been nominated for Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards are people of note.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Radiodrama|Radiodrama]] ([[User talk:Radiodrama|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Radiodrama|contribs]]) 17:57, 4 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
