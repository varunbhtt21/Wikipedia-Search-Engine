Not notable - Other than the company's own website, the only references are a routine "company profile", a press release by the company and a scientific paper about one of the company's products. [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 18:47, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' as nom. [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 18:49, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*Publicly traded company, but my calculation show it's only worth about $42 million. I'm going with '''weak delete'''. It has been around since the 1940s, one of the factories is now a museum, some of its executives are somewhat prominent and it is an international company, but I can't find substantial coverage.
