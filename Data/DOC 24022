==Biography==

===Early life and priestly life===
Jesús Aguirre was born on June 9, 1934 in  [[Madrid]], Spain. He spent most of his childhood in [[Santander, Spain|Santander]]. He began his priestly career at [[Comillas Pontifical University, Madrid]], graduating with a degree in philosophy. In 1956, he went to [[Munich]] to study theology under [[Gottlieb Söhngen]], at the same time as [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]] was there. It was in Munich that he made contact with the survivors of Critical School, and was a speaker at the first meetings between Marxists and Christians.

In 1958, during his vacation to [[Spain]], he joined the People's Liberation Front, and in 1962 he served as a pastor to the Church of the City University of Madrid. When he left the priesthood in 1969, he wrote "Sermones en España" ["Sermons in Spain"]. It was initially banned in [[Francoist Spain]]. The ban was lifted in 1971, a year and a half later.
