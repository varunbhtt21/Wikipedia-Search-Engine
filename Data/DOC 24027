''[[Girl Meets World]]'' is an American [[comedy]] television series created by [[Michael Jacobs (producer)|Michael Jacobs]] and [[April Kelly]] that aired on [[Disney Channel]] from June 27, 2014 to January 20, 2017. The series is a spinoff of ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' and stars [[Rowan Blanchard]], [[Ben Savage]], [[Sabrina Carpenter]], [[Peyton Meyer]], August Maturo, [[Danielle Fishel]], and Corey Fogelmanis.

The series centers around the life of Riley and her friends and family, particularly their school life, in which her father [[Cory Matthews#Girl Meets World|Cory Matthews]] is their history teacher. Riley shares a strong relationship with her best friend Maya Hart, who assists her in learning to cope with the social and personal issues of adolescence. Several ''Boy Meets World'' cast members reprise their roles in the series.

== Main ==

=== Riley Matthews ===
{{visible anchor|Riley Matthews}} ([[Rowan Blanchard]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2013/02/04/new-show-girl-meets-world-gets-closer-to-becoming-a-reality|title=New Show "Girl Meets World" Gets Closer to Becoming a Reality|last=Merrimac|first=Megan|date=February 4, 2013|website=Tucson Weekly|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> is the daughter of Cory and Topanga Matthews, and has a younger brother named Auggie. 

At the start of the series, Riley is 12 years old and in seventh grade.  She and her best friend, Maya Hart, explore school and life together while making new friends along the way.  She and Maya are in middle school for the first two seasons and then high school for the third season.  Riley is usually very optimistic and cheerful about life, and generally has faith in almost everyone.  She also has a very silly and quirky personality, much like her father and to an extent, her mother.  She is often portrayed as being very ditzy and innocent of the world around her.

In the pilot episode, Riley develops a crush on Lucas Friar, whom she met on the subway on the way to school; he later becomes her classmate in Cory's history class. They go out on a date for the first time in "Girl Meets First Date". During season two, Riley and Maya discover that they both like Lucas and he also likes the two of them, but Riley is Lucas' choice in season three's two-part episode "Girl Meets Ski Lodge". 

She is periodically portrayed by Lindsey Lamer in flashbacks to Riley and Maya's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by [[Mariah Buzolin]].

=== Cory Matthews ===
{{main article|Cory Matthews}}
{{visible anchor|Cory Matthews}} ([[Ben Savage]]) is Riley and Auggie's father and Topanga's husband. He has taken a job as a history teacher at [[John Quincy Adams]] Middle School for the first two seasons and then [[Abigail Adams]] High School in the third season. In both settings, his class consists of his daughter and her friends, and his history lessons relate to their lives, becoming life lessons for them. In addition to being Riley's father, he often acts as a father figure to Maya. He also acts as a mentor to his students, much like [[Mr. Feeny]] was to Cory, Topanga, and Shawn in ''[[Boy Meets World]]''.

=== Maya Hart ===
{{visible anchor|Maya Hart}} ([[Sabrina Carpenter]]) is Riley's best friend.  Maya was raised in a single-parent household by her mother Katy; she is tomboyish, social and street smart, but has a troubled past rooted in the fact that her father Kermit abandoned her and Katy before Maya turned five.  Consequently, Maya is wild and rebellious as evidenced by her actions, such as protesting homework and almost lighting a class assignment on fire, but her friendship with Riley and the Matthews family keeps her grounded most of the time.  

In the second season three-part episode "Girl Meets Texas", Maya is shown to have deeper feelings for Lucas than she normally lets on. Riley notices Maya's feelings and decides to step back from Lucas and let Maya start a relationship with him, which turns out to be awkward.  In season 3, Maya goes through an identity crisis stemming from the fact that she loves Riley so much that Maya was influenced by her, which turned out to be an underlying reason why she liked Lucas.  After Riley helped bring Maya back to her true self, she realized that she does not like Lucas the same way Riley does, and that she became like Riley to protect her and to find out if Lucas was right for her.  After this she put her full support behind Riley and Lucas as a couple.

Beginning in the first season, Maya develops a crush on Cory's younger brother Joshua.  He downplays it as a schoolgirl crush until season 3 when, in the two-parter "Girl Meets Ski Lodge", Maya tells him she genuinely likes him, and he finally admits he has feelings for her as well; he tells her that there is a chance for them and that he is willing to play the long game and see what happens.  In the third season, after her mother Katy marries [[Shawn Hunter]], Shawn presents Maya with adoption papers, and Maya accepts, proclaiming herself as Maya Hunter.<ref name="adoption"/>

Maya is periodically portrayed by Ivy George in flashbacks to Maya and Riley's childhood, and as an adult in one episode by [[Ruby Lewis]].

=== Lucas Friar ===
{{visible anchor|Lucas Friar}} ([[Peyton Meyer]]) is another member of the group and at first was both Riley and Maya's love interest until Maya decided Riley and Lucas were good for one another. 

Originally from [[Austin, Texas]], Lucas has gentlemanly manners and common sense, and has shown to be the protector of the group as he is fearless and unstoppable when defending his friends.  Because of his Texas upbringing, Maya often addresses Lucas stereotypically calling him derisive but good-natured names like "Huckleberry", "Ranger Rick" and "Bucky McBoingboing"; in "Girl Meets 1961" Lucas finds out that he is from a family of cowboys and had a great grandfather who had a brief career as a musician. In "Girl Meets the Secret of Life", it is revealed that Lucas is a year older than his classmates, and his father was transferred to New York giving Lucas a fresh start.  He had been expelled from his former school in Austin. The reason for his expulsion involved sticking up for his friend Zay Babineaux after he got into trouble with some students.

=== Auggie Matthews ===
{{visible anchor|Auggie Matthews}} (August Maturo)<!-- actor has no Wikipedia article at this time - please do not link unless/until there is one --> is Riley's precocious young brother and Cory and Topanga's son. Auggie is very attached to his parents and sister, and wants to be like his father when he grows up. His neighbor, Ava Morgenstern, becomes Auggie's girlfriend,

=== Topanga Matthews ===
{{main article|Topanga Matthews}}
{{visible anchor|Topanga Matthews}} ([[Danielle Fishel]]) is Riley and Auggie's mother and Cory's wife. Topanga is Cory's high school girlfriend and they have been friends since they were babies. Topanga has become a successful lawyer and is a loving and protective mother as shown in "Girl Meets Sneak Attack". She later inherits Svorski's from the late Mrs. Svorski, later changing the bakery's name to Topanga's.

=== Farkle Minkus ===
{{visible anchor|Farkle Minkus}} (Corey Fogelmanis)<!-- actor has no Wikipedia article at this time - please do not link unless/until there is one --> is close friends with Riley and Maya, but is also infatuated with both of them. In "Girl Meets Sneak Attack", it is shown that he cares for the two and will do anything for them to be happy. He is smart, eccentric, and a big flirt. He is shown to be the teacher's pet in many episodes. He is the son of Cory and Topanga's former classmates, [[List of Boy Meets World characters#Stuart Minkus|Stuart Minkus]] and Jennifer Bassett; of the two, Farkle bears great similarities to his father. 

Farkle cares a great deal about his education and always keeps his grades up in class. In the season two episode "Girl Meets I Am Farkle", his IQ score is found to be exceptionally high, so his guidance counselor has him take a series of tests to find out whether or not he has [[Asperger's Syndrome]], which he and his friends are relieved to find that he does not. In this same episode he begins a relationship with his former arch-nemesis, Isadora Smackle, who reveals she was diagnosed with Asperger's at age five.

== Recurring ==

=== Evelyn Rand ===
Evelyn Rand ([[Jackée Harry]]) meets Riley and Maya on the subway in the pilot; they later call her Crazy Hat because of the obscure hats they see her wearing at the subway station. She is revealed to be a successful businesswoman.

=== Ava Morgenstern ===
Ava Morgenstern (Ava Kolker) is Auggie's girlfriend.  Being slightly older, she manipulates Auggie into doing whatever she wants, remaining oblivious to how this affects him.  Ava's personality appears to be a product of her mom's way of raising her.  Early on, Topanga makes it clear that she does not like Ava, but in the season 2 episode "Girl Meets STEM", she takes Ava's side: Ava is furious when she and Auggie get exactly the same trophy after Ava singlehandedly defeats Auggie's soccer team 29-0.  In the season 3 premiere "Girl Meets High School: Part One", Ava comes to Cory, Topanga, and Auggie when her parents are splitting up.

=== Smackle ===
<!-- Credited as "Smackle", so please leave the section heading as that, but adding the first name below should be fine. -->
Isadora Smackle (Cecilia Balagot) is Farkle's arch-rival. In "Girl Meets I Am Farkle", it is revealed that she was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]] when she was five years old. By the start of "Girl Meets High School, Part 1", she has joined the others at Abigail Adams High School, having become Farkle's girlfriend and becoming closer with Riley, Maya, Lucas and Zay.

=== Katy Hart ===
Katy Hart (Cheryl Texiera) is Maya's mom. For Career Day at school, Katy reveals to Maya's class that though she works as a waitress she aspires to be an actress. Katy frequently fails to show up to any event of importance to Maya, believing herself to be a hindrance to her daughter's future. Her relationship with Maya is strained at first,  reminiscent to that of Shawn and Chet Hunter from ''Boy Meets World'', but they become much closer after Shawn reveals to Maya in "Girl Meets Master Plan" that Maya's father deserting her family was not Katy's fault; Katy maintained the story that she drove him away believing that a girl should think well of her father.  As the series progresses, Katy becomes a manager for Topanga's bakery. After meeting Shawn, she develops feelings for him. The two get engaged in "Girl Meets Upstate" and subsequently wed in "Girl Meets I Do".

=== Ms. Kossal ===
Gabriella Kossal (Aisha Kabia) is the art teacher at John Quincy Adams Middle School who is impressed with Maya's art.

=== Dewey/Doy ===
Dewey/Doy{{efn|Credited as Dewey in "Girl Meets the New World", and Doy in subsequent episodes.}} (Cooper Friedman) is a friend of Auggie who pronounces his name "Doy" much to the annoyance of Topanga. He does not like his name and cries each time somebody corrects his pronunciation.

=== Zay Babineaux ===
Zay Babineaux (Amir Mitchell-Townes) is Lucas' old friend from Texas who later moves to New York and enrolls at John Quincy Adams Middle School, who gradually befriends Riley, Maya and Farkle as he gets to know them better.  He fancies himself a smooth talker, but his words and actions more often get him into trouble rather than out of it.  When Zay and Lucas were classmates at their old school in Texas, Lucas was usually the one who bailed him out. Eventually, one of these situations caused Lucas to be expelled from his old school.

=== Charlie Gardner ===
Charlie Gardner (Tanner Buchanan) is a student at John Quincy Adams Middle School who admires Riley. In "Girl Meets Semi-Formal", he asked Riley to the semi-formal, right before Lucas was going to.

=== Sarah ===
Sarah (Sarah Carpenter<!-- please DO NOT wikilink, as doing so would link to someone else; she does not have her own standalone article -->) is a classmate of Riley and Maya at both John Quincy Adams Middle School and Abigail Adams High School. She mostly serves as a background character in many episodes, but achieves prominence in "Girl Meets Hollyworld" as a screenplay writer for a movie her father, the director DW Preminger, is casting. The episode "Girl Meets Commonism" shows her on the honor board panel and reveals her last name to be Carpenter.

[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Eric Matthews|Eric Matthews]] ([[Will Friedle]]) is Cory, Joshua, and Morgan's older brother, and Riley and Auggie's uncle. He first appears in "Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels". Like in the original series, Eric is a goofball and lovable, but is quite dimwitted sometimes. Now a full-grown adult, he appears to have matured a little, but is still considered to be the fun uncle in the Matthews family. As evidenced in the original series, Eric has good people skills. Since leaving Philadelphia, Eric has gone on to become the Mayor of St. Upid Town, New York, a fictional community near the borders of New York State and the Canadian Province of [[Quebec]], after all those who would have supported his mayoral opponent died in a landslide, according to Eric.

To blend in with the locals, he wears a [[hermit]] costume, an homage to his faux alter ego, Plays with Squirrels, from the ''Boy Meets World'' episode "Seven the Hard Way". Running gags include calling Riley his "niche", referring to Auggie as his cousin, and frequently mispronouncing Maya's name. He is eventually elected [[United States Senate|senator]] and is later faced with a decision involving his friend, Jack Hunter. He returned in the series finale.<ref name="S3finale"/>

Moore ([[Julius Carry]]) died in a fishing accident, but also that she has gotten married to a man in the service. Her reason for meeting up with Shawn is to get some advice and counseling about her fears of becoming a mother, because she is worried that she may end up like her own mother. Shawn encourages Angela to start a family with her husband and experience the joy of being a parent. After this, Angela encourages Shawn to pursue a relationship with Katy and leaves to go back home.

=== Chet Hunter ===
[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Chet Hunter|Chet Hunter]] ([[Blake Clark]]) is Shawn and Jack's late father who died of a heart attack in the sixth season of ''Boy Meets World''.

=== T.J. Murphy ===
[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Tommy|Thomas Jonathan Murphy]] (J. B. Gaynor) was an orphan whom Eric met while he was playing Santa Claus at the mall one Christmas. After Eric gave Tommy a toy for Christmas, Tommy became convinced that Eric was really Santa Claus and asked Eric for parents for Christmas. Eric, touched by the boy's request, decided to volunteer as Tommy's big brother. The two spent a great deal of time together, leading Eric to consider adopting him, but he later changed his mind so Tommy could go live with a family who could provide better support for him.

Many years later, he resurfaces in "Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels Goes to Washington" as a political activist and founder of a website called ''Thorn in Your Side'' that reports on political scandals, with the latest one being about Senator Jefferson Davis Graham. He volunteers to help when Eric is nominated to run for senator of New York, though the others are unaware of his identity. Later, at a debate against Eric's opponent, Senator Jefferson Davis Graham, Tommy reveals his identity and speaks of Eric's compassion and how Eric had sacrificed himself for Tommy's future. Eric joyfully reunites with Tommy who expresses his desire to continue working with Eric's campaign.

=== Mr. Turner ===
[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Jonathan Turner|Jonathan Turner]] ([[Anthony Tyler Quinn]]) was an English teacher who taught Cory, Shawn, and Topanga in high school.

After his motorcycle accident, Jonathan fell in love with his nurse and married her.

Mr. Turner returns in "Girl Meets the New Teacher", where he is now a superintendent who personally hired Cory Matthews to teach history at John Quincy Adams Middle School. He is called in to oversee the class of Harper Burgess to see if she is worth keeping around after Principal Yancy threatened to fire her and Cory; like Mr. Turner in ''Boy Meets World'', Harper uses comic books in her lessons and rides a motorcycle to work. Riley sees Mr. Turner as an uncle figure as he has formed an even closer affinity with the Matthews family than before, visiting their home often. Although thankful to him for being a good educator, Topanga holds a grudge against Turner because he gave her an A- in high school. He returned in the series finale.<ref name="S3finale"/>

=== Jack Hunter ===
[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Jack Hunter|Jack Hunter]] ([[Matthew Lawrence]]) is Shawn's paternal half-brother and was Eric's best friend in college. Jack competed with Eric for the affection of Rachel McGuire. He and Rachel joined the [[Peace Corps]] at the end of ''Boy Meets World'', but Jack eventually left while Rachel stayed behind. The two have since lost touch, while Eric and Rachel still talk often.

Reappearing in "Girl Meets Semi-Formal", Jack now works for a corporation that is not environmentally friendly and has been assigned to persuade Senator Eric Matthews to allow his company to build a pipeline somewhere. Eric takes it upon himself to try and show Jack a simpler time to change his ways by taking him to the semi-formal dance where he meets Riley.

=== Jennifer Bassett Minkus ===
