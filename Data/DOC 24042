Title : Media and gender
Text : {{Globalize|article|Western culture|date=April 2018}}
'''Media and gender''' refers to the relationship between [[Media (communication)|media]] and [[gender]], and how gender is represented within [[media platform]]s. These platforms include but are not limited to [[film]], [[radio]], [[television]], [[advertisement]], [[social media]], and [[video game]]s. Initiatives and resources exist to promote [[gender equality]] and reinforce women's [[empowerment]] in the media industry and representations. For example, [[UNESCO]], in cooperation with the [[International Federation of Journalists]], elaborated the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media] contributing to [[gender equality]] and women's [[empowerment]] in all forms of media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/|title=Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media: Framework of indicators to gauge gender sensitivity in media operations and content {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref>

== History ==
[[Feminism|Feminist]] writers, largely gaining prominence in the 1960s during [[Second-way feminism|second wave feminism]], began criticizing the [[Western canon]] for providing and promoting an exclusively white male [[world view]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Have We Got a Theory for You! Feminist Theory, Cultural Imperialism and the Demand for "The Woman's Voice"|last=Lugones|first=Maria C.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> These feminists typically perceive gender as a social construct which is not only reflected in artistic work but perpetuated by it.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Feminism|last=Treichler|first=Paula|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Until fairly recently, feminists have mainly directed their studies to gender representations in literature. Recently, a new wave of academic studies focused on gender representations in modern society and culture (such as in the film, advertisement and cultural industries).<sup>[[Media and gender#cite%20note-%3A7-3|[3]]]</sup>

== Gender disparity in media careers ==
Numbers of women in media professions, such as journalism, is growing; however, the media is and has been statistically dominated by men, who hold the vast majority of power positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.metiers-presse.org/explore.php#stack/alljournalists/journalistNumber/ageSlice/genderDistribution/none/2014/none|title=La répartition du nombre de journalistes par tranches d'âge et par sexe en 2014|work=Espace Data - Observatoire des métiers de la presse}}</ref> Studies show that men are more likely to be quoted than women in the media, and more likely to cover "serious" topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|title=The Problem|publisher=Women's Media Center|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210092107/http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem|archivedate=February 10, 2012}}</ref> A large number of international institutions and NGOs are advocating for gender equality in the media workplace. For instance, in 2018, UNESCO supported 42 media institutions and 16 universities to implement policies and strategies on gender equality. In addition, coherent with the strategy to empower women and girls through policy implementation, 31 institutions, community radio stations and national broadcasters adopted policies on gender equality in media.

The [[Bechdel test]], originally created to evaluate popular fiction's representation of women and subsequently adapted to employment in the media professions, show that a number of women are employed but do not benefit from an equal voice. For example, women's presence on [[radio]] is typically hired to cover topics such as weather and [[culture]].

In the [[video game industry]] about half of the [[gamer]]s are women but their presence is still limited in the production of games. Those who tried to publicly challenge this situation, such as [[Anita Sarkeesian|A. Sarkeesian]], have been subjected to harassment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=A.|year=2015|title="Everyone Can Make Games!": The post-feminist context of women in digital game production|url=https://zenodo.org/record/849069|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15|issue=4|pages=576–592|doi=10.1080/14680777.2014.958867|hdl=2381/29087}}</ref> In cinema there is concern about the low number of female [[Film director|director]]s and the difficulties of older actresses to find roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/100-women-directors-hollywood-should-be-hiring.html|title=100 Women Directors Hollywood Should Be Hiring|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|date=November 2, 2015|work=Vulture}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-women-directors-20150222-story.html|title=Oscars 2015: Female directors scarce at Hollywood's major studios|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|date=February 22, 2015|work=LA Times}}</ref> They also earn 2.5 times less income than men in the same jobs.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Smith L., Stacy|author2=Choueiti, Marc|author3=Pieper, Katherine|year=2014|title=Gender bias without borders: An investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries|url=https://seejane.org/wp-content/uploads/gender-bias-without-borders-full-report.pdf|publisher=Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative.

A survey conducted by [[Stacy Smith]] of the [[University of Southern California]] shows that only 7% of directors, 13% of [[writer]]s and 20% of [[Film producer|producer]]s in film and television are women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theairspace.net/insight/gender-equality-in-the-media-the-new-social-movement/|title=Gender Equality in the Media: The New Social Movement|last1=McSweeney|first1=Melissa|website=The AirSpace|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref> According to The Writers Guild, an estimated 17% of screenplays over the last decade were written by women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Charlotte|date=2000|title=MOVIES; Her Type Is Strong, Not Silent; Susannah Grant is making waves in the male-dominated world of screenwriting with her latest films centering on determined women.: [Home Edition]|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/421663810|journal=Los Angeles Times|volume=|pages=|via=Proquest}}</ref> However, increasing numbers of women work in the media as journalists or directors.

== Representations of women ==

=== Under-representation and misrepresentation ===
In spite of their monumental achievements, women's representation in media remains drastically different to that of their male counterparts. Women are the focus of only 10% of news stories, comprise just 20% of experts or spokespeople interviewed, and a mere 4% of news stories are deemed to challenge gender stereotypes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews|title=Women Make the News 2018|date=2018-02-14|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>

According to the report investigation of female characters in popular films across 11 countries, 1 woman for 2.24 men appeared on the screen between January 1, 2010 and May 1, 2013. In 2009, the [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild (US)]] also found that men continue to make up the majority of roles, especially [[Supporting Roles|supporting roles]], where they contribute around two roles for every female role, whereas females hold a slightly larger proportion of [[lead role]]s compared to their proportion of supporting roles, but still less than lead roles occupied by male counterparts.

The same is true for [[television programs]]. In general, from the 1950s to the 1970s, television programs had 30–35% female roles in American TV shows.<ref name="Gauntlett2">{{cite book|title=Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction|last1=Gauntlett|first1=David|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-39661-5|edition=2nd}}</ref> The female roles increased in the 1980s, but there were still twice as many roles for men in television.<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> However, these disparities change depending on the type of program: in mid-1970s [[sitcom]]s there were "nearly equal proportions", whereas in [[adventure (genre)|action-adventure shows]] "only 15 per cent of the leading characters were women".<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> In the 1980s, female characters represented 43% of roles in comedy shows and only 29% in action-adventure programs, however, they had outnumbered male characters two to one in dramas.<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> Since the 1990s, "gender roles on television seemed to become increasingly equal and non-stereotyped ... although the majority of lead characters were still male."<ref name="Gauntlett2" />

The [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] is an organisation that has been lobbying the industry for years to expand the roles of women in film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21737490-furore-hollywood-will-result-different-stories-making-it-screen|title=The aftermath of the Weinstein scandal|website=The Economist}}</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists such as [[Clare Short]], Gaye Tuchman, and [[Angela McRobbie]] denounced unfair representations of gender in media and especially in magazines.

=== Sexualization ===
Mass media has become a driving force to [[discrimination]] based on gender. Images and expectations of gender roles  are highlighted through a variety of platforms and sources like the structure of language, activities, media, school settings, historical passages or art pieces, and the workplace.<ref name=":03">{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Rebecca L.|date=2011-02-01|title=Content Analysis of Gender Roles in Media: Where Are We Now and Where Should We Go?|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=64|issue=3|pages=290–298|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9929-5|issn=1573-2762}}</ref> Sexualization of women, in particular, is heavily centralized in [[mass media]]. When these platforms hyper sexualize women, portray them in a lack of clothing, or depict women as subordinate to men, a women's self esteem, body image and emotional well being may be negatively affected.<ref name=":04">{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Rebecca L.|date=2011-02-01|title=Content Analysis of Gender Roles in Media: Where Are We Now and Where Should We Go?|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=64|issue=3|pages=290–298|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9929-5|issn=1573-2762}}</ref> One of the earliest studies of role portrayal in advertisement was done in 1971 by Courtney and Lockeretz. These researchers discovered that the central four themes of female [[Stereotype|stereotypes]] were that a woman's place was in the home, the second was women didn't make important decisions, third that women were dependent on their male counterparts and lastly that women perceived as sexual objects.Two other follow up studies done by Wagner and Banos, and Belkaoui and Belkaoui reached similar outcomes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belknap|first=Penny|last2=Leonard II|first2=Wilbert M.|date=1991|title=A Conceptual Replication and Extension of Erving Goffman's Study of Gender Advertisements|journal=Sex Roles|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=103–118|doi=10.1007/BF00289848}}</ref> The final two points highlight the angle that women are viewed in regards to their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and bodies. For centuries, dating back to when women would pose for paintings or sculptures, the concept that a woman's nature lied within the ground of subordination and submission has been reinforced by media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kanopy.com/product/codes-gender|title=The Codes of Gender {{!}} Kanopy|website=www.kanopy.com|access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2019|certain=y|reason=Source is a documentary - these are rarely non-biased sources nowadays}}  

The [[Western world|Western]] ideal of female beauty is that of the fit, young and thin woman, and the media spreads this ideal through movies, TV shows, [[fashion show]]s, advertisements, magazines and newspapers, music videos, and children's [[cartoon]]s. For women to be considered attractive, they have to conform to images in advertisements, television, and music portraying the ideal woman as tall, white, thin, with a 'tubular' body and blonde hair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&detail=4475&content=4795|title=Female Body Image and the Mass Media: Perspectives on How Women Internalize the Ideal Beauty Standard|author=Serdar, K.L.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172944/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=...&detail=4475&content=4795|archivedate=2016-04-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2016-05-03|df=}}</ref>

Studies show that typical female roles fall into cultural stereotypes of women and are often sexualized with minimal clothing and sexualized roles.<ref name="Collins2">{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Rebecca L.|date=2011|title=Content Analysis of Gender Roles in Media: Where Are We Now and Where Should We Go?|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=290–298|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9929-5}}</ref> For example, a content analysis of video games found that "41% of female characters wore revealing clothing and an equal number were partially or totally nude", whereas the male characters were not.<ref name="Downs2">{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|date=2010|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|volume=62|issue=11|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1}}</ref> However, [[sexualization]] is not the only stereotypical way in which women are represented in the media.

In advertisement, celebrity endorsement of products are thought to be especially effective if the celebrity is a physically attractive woman, as the attractiveness is thought to transfer to the brand's image and studies have shown that audiences respond better to female endorsements.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1108/17473611311325564|title = Impact of celebrity endorsement in advertising on brand image among Chinese adolescents|journal = Young Consumers|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 167–179|year = 2013|last1 = Chan|first1 = Kara|last2 = Leung Ng|first2 = Yu|last3 = Luk|first3 = Edwin K.|url = https://repository.hkbu.edu.hk/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&context=coms_ja}}</ref>

The [[objectification]] of women in the media is transmitted verbally and nonverbally, as well as directly and indirectly, and it is not only visual but can also be expressed subtly by commenting on women's appearance in a humorous way, making jokes and gags, and using double meanings.<ref name="Galdi3">{{cite journal|last1=Galdi|first1=Silvia|last2=Maass|first2=Anne|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|date=2014|title=Objectifying Media: Their Effect on Gender Role Norms and Sexual Harassment of Women|url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/38/3/398|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=38|issue=3|pages=398–413|doi=10.1177/0361684313515185}}</ref> Thus, women are often victims of online and offline violence as a result of the [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] of their bodies objectification. In order to advocate against the objectification of women in the media, some programmes are implementing projects on this issue. For instance, some trainings and handbooks are being developed by International organisations and NGOS for media professionals to improve the gender-sensitivity of media representations. <sup>[[Media and gender#cite%20note-Galdi3-20|[22]]]</sup>

Some shows focused entirely on successful professional women and their "quests for sex, pleasure and romantic love", such as ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (1997–2002) and ''[[Sex and the City]]'' (1998–2004).<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> Even if the main character in Ally McBeal was portrayed as desperate to find a husband, the show had other non-stereotypical female characters and "sided with the women".<ref name="Gauntlett2" />  ''Sex and the City'' had assertive female protagonists, especially in matters of sex, and did not punish them for wanting pleasure, knowing how to get it, and being determined to do so, which can be seen especially in the case of [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]], played by [[Kim Cattrall]].<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> Another female icon from the 1990s is the title character on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', a teenage girl who starred and became hugely popular in the "typically male-dominated world of [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] fans".<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> [[Buffy Summers]], played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], was powerful, heroic, confident, and assertive, characteristics that were generally ascribed to male characters.

In her 1973 article "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]", feminist film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] coined the term [[Male gaze|male-gaze]] to describe the way that women in film serve as projections of male fantasies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=1 October 1975|title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|journal=Screen|volume=16|issue=3|pages=6–7|doi=10.1093/screen/16.3.6}}</ref>

=== Domestication ===
On TV, marriage, parenthood, and domesticity have been shown as more important to women than men.<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> From the mid-1940s to the 1960s, women (predominantly white, middle-class women) were portrayed mostly as housewives who had seemingly "perfect" lives: their houses were always impeccably clean, their children were always healthy, and they were always beautiful and organized.<ref name="Zeisler3">{{cite book|title=Feminism and Pop Culture|last1=Zeisler|first1=Andi|date=2008|publisher=Seal Press}}</ref> TV didn't portray the reality that by 1960 "40 per cent of women worked outside the home ... [and that] divorce rates spiked twice after World War II".<ref name="Zeisler3"/> According to a study from 1975 conducted by Jean McNeil,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McNeil|first1=Jean|date=1975|title=Feminism, Femininity and the Television Shows: A Content Analysis|journal=Journal of Broadcasting|volume=19|issue=3|pages=259–269|doi=10.1080/08838157509363786}}</ref> in 74 per cent of the cases studied women's interactions were "concerned with romance or family problems", whereas men's interactions were concerned with these matters in only 18 per cent of the cases.<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> Furthermore, female characters often didn't have jobs, especially if they were wives and mothers, and were not the dominant characters or [[Decision-making|decision-makers]].<ref name="Gauntlett2" /> The boss is usually a man.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.iwmf.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/IWMF-Global-Report-Summary.pdf|title=Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media|author=Byerly, C. M.|publisher=International Women's Media Foundation|location=Washington DC|year=2011}}</ref> Men are portrayed as more assertive or aggressive, adventurous, active, and victorious, whilst women are shown as passive, weak, ineffectual, victimized, supportive, and laughable.<ref name="Gauntlett2" />

As one study about gender role portrayals in advertisements from seven countries' shows, women are more likely to play the role of the [[Housekeeping|housekeeper]] and men are more likely to play the roles of professionals.<ref name="Paek2">{{cite journal|last1=Paek|first1=Hye-Jin|last2=Nelson|first2=Michelle R.|last3=Vilela|first3=Alexandra M.|date=2011|title=Examination of Gender-role Portrayals in Television Advertising across Seven Countries|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=3|pages=192–207|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9850-y}}</ref>

In another study, Souha R. Ezzedeen found that career-driven female characters in film are often portrayed as failing at fulfilling the stereotypical roles of a woman, like sexual attraction, maternal roles, and relationships.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ezzedeen|first=Souha R.|date=2015|title=Portrayals of career women in Hollywood films: implications for the glass ceiling's persistence|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1675843005|journal=Gender in Management|volume=30|issue=3|pages=239–264|via=|doi=10.1108/GM-07-2013-0073}}</ref>

=== Age gap ===

Older characters and actors in general tend to be underrepresented in most media; however, this seems to specifically effect female actors who appear less frequently in film and television than their male colleagues and younger women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/is-2015-the-year-of-the-older-actress-203907/|title=Is 2015 the Year of the Older Actress?|last=Berger|first=Laura|date=April 22, 2015|work=IndieWire}}</ref> While 40+ male roles are on the rise in both theatrical and television productions, female 40+ roles represent only 28% of female roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sag.org/press-releases/october-23-2009/latest-casting-data-follows-historical-trends-and-continues-exclude-p|title=Latest casting data follows historical trends and continues to exclude people with disabilities|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=Screen Actors Guild}}</ref> Actors such as [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] continue to undertake major roles as ageless heroes, whereas the normative structure for older women is that their ageing is part of the plot (for example in ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (2008) and [[Sex and the City (film)|''Sex and the City'']] (2010)).<ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122">{{cite journal|last1=Fairclough|first1=K|year=2012|title=Nothing less than perfect: female celebrity, ageing and hyper-scrutiny in the gossip industry|journal=Celebrity Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=90–103|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644723}}</ref> This is typically seen in relation to female roles relying on sexualization and the superficial (apparent) effects of aging on their body are presented as something to be hidden.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Calasanti, Toni|author2=Kathleen F.

This has led to critiques that these representations are first and foremost framed in terms of how well older actresses are managing their aging bodies.<ref name="Fairclough, K. 20122" /> Midlife women have grown accustomed to seeing their age group portrayed in a seemingly unrealistic way, and this had led to an increase of eating disorders and negative body image among this group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hefner|first=Veronica|date=Summer 2014|title=The Influence of Television and Film Viewing on Midlife Women's Body Image, Disordered Eating, and Food Choice|journal=Media and Psychology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=185–207|doi=10.1080/15213269.2013.838903}}</ref>

In one court case in 2011, English television actress [[Miriam O'Reilly]] successfully sued the [[BBC]] for [[age discrimination]] after being dropped from a show. It was claimed that she had been told to be careful about her wrinkles and to consider [[Botulinum toxin|Botox]] and dyeing her hair.<ref name="doi.org2" />

The commercial potential of older consumers is becoming more significant (an increased 'active [[lifespan]]', the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] generation entering retirement, retirement ages that are raising). A multiplication of images of successful aging are explicitly tied to consumerism by the anti-ageing industry and older female celebrities advertising their products.<ref name="doi.org2" /> Examples abound: [[Sharon Stone]] for [[Christian Dior]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] for [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Julianna Margulies]] for [[L'Oreal]], [[Christy Turlington]] for [[Maybelline]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]] for [[CoverGirl]], etc. These advertisements are paradoxical in that they allow older celebrities to remain visible while encouraging an ageist and [[Sexism|sexist]] culture in which women are valued for their appearance. Baby boomers are an increasingly important audience group for the cinema industry, resulting in more and new kinds of stories with older [[protagonist]]s. [[Romantic comedy|Romantic comedies]] in which women protagonists take on the [[Romance (love)|romantic]] [[hero]]ine role provide one of the few spaces in [[popular culture]] showing appealing representations of older women, such as ''[[I Could Never Be Your Woman]]'' (2007), ''[[Last Chance Harvey]]'' (2008), and ''[[It's Complicated (film)|It's Complicated]]'' (2009). They are part of a phenomenon called the "girling" of older women, where the protagonists and celebrities are portrayed as being just as excited and entitled to be going out on dates as younger women.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jermyn, D.|date=2012|title="Glorious, glamorous and that old standby, amorous": the late blossoming of Diane Keaton's romantic comedy career|journal=Celebrity Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=37–51|doi=10.1080/19392397.2012.644718}}</ref>

=== Abuse ===
Heterosexual romantic relationships in media, particularly in film, often romanticize intimate partner violence wherein the woman is the victim. Films like [[Twilight (2008 film)|''Twilight'']] (2008), ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Gray]]'' (2015), and ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'' (1994) are all examples of films in which abusive behavior, such as manipulation, coercion, threats, control and domination, isolation, excessive jealousy, and physical violence, are all exhibited by the male romantic lead.<ref>Bonomi, Amy E., et al. “The Abuse Litmus Test: A Classroom Tool to Assess Power and Control in On-Screen Relationships.” Family Relations, vol. 66, no. 1, Feb. 2017, pp. 154–165.

=== Female characters as plot devices for male characters ===
====Referred Pain====
In media featuring a male protagonist, women's pain, suffering, or even death are often used as plot devices to further the male protagonist's narrative arc. This is known as the “referred pain” plot device. It involves a situation wherien a woman undergoes a traumatic event, often (but not always) of a sexual nature, but her pain is referred to a male character. This male character's grief and anger due to the trauma experienced by the female character are explored in depth.  The female character's emotional or physical response is only addressed briefly or cursorily. This trope is featured in such films as [[Mission: Impossible 2|''Mission: Impossible 2'' (2000)]], [[Moulin Rouge!|''Moulin Rouge'' (2001)]], as well as in the Shakespeare play ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and books like ''[[Oroonoko]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Åström |first1=Berit |title=Referred pain: privileging male emotions in narrative instances of female physical suffering |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |year=2011 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=125–137 |doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.565193 }}</ref>

====Disposable Woman====
The Disposable Woman trope refers to a trope in which a woman is included in a story for the sole purpose of dying, thus putting the male protagonist through emotional development or inspiring him to embark on a revenge quest. The woman who dies in these situations is referred to as "disposable" because she does not serve a purpose beyond her death. The disposable woman trope in present in many films, including ''[[Braveheart (1995 film)|Braveheart'' (1995)]], [[The Matrix Revolutions|''The Matrix Revolutions'' (2003)]], ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy'' (2004)]], ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight'' (2008)]], ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2|The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' (2014)]], ''[[Deadpool 2|Deadpool 2'' (2018)]], and ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018)]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Disposable Woman |url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman |website=TVtropes |accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>

== Representations of men ==
Men are proportionally represented by media more often compared to women, but the representations that do exist are often criticized for their portrayal of sexist stereotypes. Most critics discuss the ways male characters in film and television are typically more tough, aggressive, domineering, etc. than the average man they are meant to represent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gendered Media: The Influence of Media on Views of Gender|last=Wood|first=Julia T.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Media has the power to shed the light on what is frequently stereotyping images, actions and values that are no more acceptable on all humanitarian levels because they represent all kind of violence and gender discrimination. The importance of mainstream media when it affects the way that people think, understand and talk about violence within our communities; also when it plays a role in shaking the mentalities and promoting positive images for women who are strong leaders and powerful survivors, yet what media should start highlight is positive masculinity. Many examples show that masculinity is usually represented by negative values such as violence, dominance, cruelty, illegal or unhuman actions. Media are way too often diffusing and showcasing this negative representation.  Thus, they are playing a role in the acceptance of the society, by men and women, to these negative values as the norm to depict men and masculinity.{{Quote|text='[[Masculinity|Masculine]]' means the male who fits in with [[Society of the United States|American society]]'s stereotypical 'manly man', or a handsome (according to current [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]) man with definite muscles, and a conservative style of dress and hairdo. The inadequate male lacks many characteristics of the masculine male. He is weak and fearful, lacking both physical stamina and any significant amount of courage. This was demonstrated in the cartoons analyzed not only through actions but also by body type and bone structure, as well as dress and hairstyle. The delicate female was patterned in the cartoons studied as a woman of delicate physical structure, who is thin and dressed in such a manner as would not allow her to complete tasks traditionally meant for males. The modern female is one who is dressed in a more neutral fashion, such as jeans or pants, and does not have a noticeably tiny waistline.|author=Kelly Eick|source="Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons"<ref name="Eick">{{cite web|url=https://www.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/495/paper1.html|title=Gender Stereotypes in Children's Television Cartoons|website=Dr. Rubba's Home Page: English 495 Topics in Applied Language Study|publisher=California Polytechnic State University|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}}}

‘[[Masculinity]]’ is the ideas of how men and boys should behave. In fact, most societies socialize men and boys to assume that they are superior, leader, aggressive and entitled. According to the [[hegemonic masculinity]] model, men who demonstrate power, strength, bravery, fearlessness, virility, competitiveness etc.. can assert their (supposed) superiority over women and consolidate their general position of dominance over them (physically, intellectually, and sexually).<ref name=":0" />

Media representations of sports and athletes contribute to the construction of a dominant model of [[masculinity]] centered on strength and an ambivalent relationship to [[violence]], encouraging boys and men to take risks and to be aggressive.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Messner|first1=Michael A.|last2=Dunbar|first2=Michele|last3=Hunt|first3=Darnell|author-link3=Darnell Hunt|date=November 2000|title=The televised sports manhood formula|journal=[[Journal of Sport & Social Issues]]|volume=24|issue=4|pages=380–394|doi=10.1177/0193723500244006|ref=harv|author-link1=Michael Messner}} [http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/manhood-formula.pdf Pdf.]</ref>

In advertising, men usually promote alcoholic beverages, banking services, credit cards, or cars. Although women also promote cars, advertisements involving women are usually highly dependent on their [[sexuality]], which is not the case for those with men, who are shown in these ads in an elegant and powerful way. Also, when men are acting on a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]], they are usually performing activities such as playing sports, driving around girls, repairing cars, drinking, relaxing, and having fun.<ref>{{cite book|title=International Advertising|author=Bartos, R.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2000|editor=J.

=== Representations of non-binary characters ===
Virginie Julliard and Nelly Quemener remark that even though the dominant conception of sexuality in media is [[heterosexuality]] with [[construction]] of [[tradition]]al models of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]], sexually diverse versions are being used in media which can also be a source of identification by the audience.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/693|title=Le genre dans la communication et les médias : enjeux et perspectives|author1=Virginie Julliard|author2=Nelly Quemener|date=2014-01-15|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue Française des Sciences de l'Information et de la Communication}}</ref>

In the U.S., for example, exposure to TV has been associated with "more stereotypical sexual attitudes [like the idea that men are sex-driven and the notion that women are sexual objects] and evaluation styles". Also popular is the idea that appearance or sexiness is essential for men and women.<ref name="Bogt2" /> Additionally, pop music and music videos have been shown to increase stereotypical gender schemas, and promote the ideas that gender relationships are adversarial and that appearance is fundamental.<ref name="Bogt2" />

The stereotyped portrayals of men and women have been argued to be valued and internalized by younger viewers, especially during puberty and the construction of their sexual identity.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Raja Mujtaba|date=January 18, 2011|title=Mass media and its influence on society|journal=Opinion Maker}}</ref>

Due to the reputation that is upheld in romantic films, males feel that they are unable to enjoy or watch films in this genre, forming this stereotype.

Factors involved in the composition of self-image include the emotional, physical, and reasoning aspects of a person, and these aspects affect one another.<ref name=":42">{{Cite journal|last=Legenbauer|first=Tanja|date=May 2008|title=Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State|url=|journal=Behavior Modification|volume=32|issue=3|pages=352–371|doi=10.1177/0145445507309027|pmid=18391052}}</ref> One of the main contributors to negative body image is the fact that forms of media like commercials and magazines promotes the "thin ideal".<ref name=":42" /> From seeing images of women with extremely thin bodies, some people have an increase of negative emotions, and these individuals tend to take actions like dieting to help relieve the undesirable feelings about their body image.<ref name=":42" /> This act of dieting could lead to dangerous behaviors such as eating disorders if the negative perceptions about one's body image does not improve.<ref name=":42" /> Considering that an average North American will watch about 35,000 commercials a year, it is to be expected that commercials presenting images of skinny and gorgeous women will have a bigger impact on increasing negative body image, than ads in magazines.<ref name=":42" /> The author of "Influence of Appearance-Related TV Commercials on Body Image State", Tanja Legenbauer, conducted a study in order to demonstrate that images presented in commercials can lead to harmful effects in those that watch them. &nbsp;Her study included participants who looked at different silhouettes of differently shaped women, and their response to these images was reviewed. These participants included those with and without eating disorders, and usually those participants with eating disorders reacted more negatively to the images presented to them in the study.<ref name=":42" />

One explanation for why TV shows could negatively affect body image is the idea of the "third" person. The "third" person idea explains that women can start to develop negative body image because they are constantly seeing images of thin and beautiful women on TV.<ref name=":52">{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonhyeung|date=October 2008|title=Third-Person Effects of Idealized Body Image in Magazine Advertisements|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=52|issue=2|pages=147–164|doi=10.1177/0002764208321348}}</ref> From seeing these images, they realize that men are seeing these same women and thinking that those images are the standards for a perfect or ideal woman.<ref name=":52" /> Body image can be defined as the perception of how one sees themselves and whether or not they are happy with what they are seeing. This image of oneself can be positively or negatively affected by the opinions of those that matter to the person.<ref name=":52" /> When a woman thinks about the "third person", the gender and relationship of the "third person" to the woman can change the amount of impact their opinion has on the woman.<ref name=":52" /> So, an example would be if a woman knows that her boyfriend is seeing these images of lean and beautiful women, her boyfriend's opinion can more negatively affect how she sees herself and her body than if she thinks about a female stranger seeing the same images.

Eating disorders are presumed to mainly affect teenage girls, but they are starting to become more common in middle aged women. When women want to work on bettering their health or when they want to get into shape, they often look to fitness or health magazines.<ref name=":62">{{Cite journal|last=Willis|first=Laura E.|date=April 2014|title=Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health and Fitness Magazines|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=29|issue=4|pages=323–331|doi=10.1080/10410236.2012.755602|pmid=23844558}}</ref> One problem with women looking towards health magazines for help is that these magazines are often filled with images of women who are in their 40s and 50s, but are very lean and beautiful.<ref name=":62" /> In order to establish that these health magazines are having a negative impact on body image in the readers of the magazines, Laura E. Willis, the author of "Weighing Women Down: Messages on Weight Loss and Body Shaping in Editorial Content in Popular Women's Health", conducted a study. She looked at issues of five different health and fitness magazines, and realized that these magazines tend to focus more on appearance rather than health, and focused on reducing caloric intake rather than exercise.<ref name=":62" /> The messages presented in these magazines can cause a negative perception of oneself, and instead of motivating people to better themselves, they have the ability to make the reader feel bad about their body.<ref name=":62" />

==== Social Media ====
With the rise in popularity of [[social media]] platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Snapchat]], new standards of beauty have emerged in the relationship between media and gender. This can create a false image of how individuals, particularly young children, should look. Young people are more likely to purchase products endorsed by social media personalities such as Instagram models in hopes of getting that model's body type when in reality the figures are likely attained through plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perloff|first=Richard M.|date=2014-05-29|title=Social Media Effects on Young Women's Body Image Concerns: Theoretical Perspectives and an Agenda for Research|journal=Sex Roles|volume=71|issue=11–12|pages=363–377|doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0384-6|issn=0360-0025}}</ref> This look has also lead to a 115% increase in the number of plastic surgeries since 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-unsettling-relationship-between-selfie-filters-and-plastic-surgery-2018-08-02|title=Do Instagram and Snapchat distort how teenagers see themselves?|last=Paul|first=Kari|website=MarketWatch|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Zoe|last2=Tiggemann|first2=Marika|date=December 2016|title=Attractive celebrity and peer images on Instagram: Effect on women's mood and body image|journal=Body Image|volume=19|pages=37–43|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2016.08.007|pmid=27598763|issn=1740-1445}}</ref>
== Responses and movements for change ==
=== Feminist response ===
[[Germaine Greer]], Australian-born author of [[The Female Eunuch]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Female Eunuch|last1=Greer|first1=Germaine|date=1970|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=978-0061579530}}</ref> (1970), offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women are forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfill male fantasies of what being a woman entails.  Greer wrote that women were perceived as mere consumers benefiting from the purchasing power of their husband. Women become targets for marketing, she said, and their image is used in advertising to sell products.  American socialist writer and feminist, [[Sharon Smith (writer)|Sharon Smith]] wrote on the first issue of ''Women and Film'' that women's roles in film "almost always [revolve] around her physical attraction and the mating games she plays with the male characters" in contrast to men's roles, which according to the author are more varied.<ref name="Smith2">{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Sharon|title=The Image of Women in Film: Some Suggestions for Future Research|journal=Women and Film|issue=1|pages=13–21}}</ref> In 1973 Marjorie Rosen, an important contributor to [[feminist film theory]], argued that "the Cinema Woman is a Popcorn Venus, a delectable but insubstantial hybrid of cultural distortions".<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite book|title=Popcorn Venus|last1=Rosen|first1=Marjorie|date=1973|publisher=Avon Books|location=New York|page=10}}</ref> In 1978 Gaye Tuchman wrote of the concept of [[symbolic annihilation]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media|last1=Tuchman|first1=Gaye|last2=Kaplan Daniels|first2=Arlene|last3=Benét|first3=James|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195023527|ref=Tuchman}}</ref> blaming the media for imposing a negative vision of active women and making an apologia for housewives.

From media representations, feminists paved the way for debates and discussions about gender within the social and political spheres. In 1986, the British MP Clare Short proposed a bill to ban newspapers from printing [[Page 3]] photographs of topless models.<ref name="Biscarrat2">{{cite journal|url=http://rfsic.revues.org/619|title=L'analyse des médias au prisme du genre : formation d'une épistémè|author=Laetitia Biscarrat|date=2013|accessdate=2015-03-04|journal=Revue Française des Sciences de l'Information et de la Communication|volume=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/clare-short-i-didnt-get-rid-of-page-3-can-leveson-6294455.html|title=I didn't get rid of Page 3 – Can Levenson?|author=Clare Short|accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, feminist critics began analyzing film in terms of the Bechdel test. This feminist assessment of cinema was named after [[Alison Bechdel]], feminist cartoonist and creator of the long-running comic strip ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]''. This test determines the level of gender equality present in a film by assessing whether a work of&nbsp;[[fiction]]&nbsp;features at least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bechdeltest.com/|title=Bechdel Test Movie List|website=bechdeltest.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}</ref>

In the 1970s, TV critics, academics, and women started to point out the way TV shows portrayed female characters.<ref name="Zeisler3"/> ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine called out the industry for "refusing to rise above characterizations of women as pretty, skinny, dopey, hapless housewives or housewife wannabes", and a poll conducted by ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine in 1972 showed that "75 per cent of 120,000 women ... agreed that 'the media degrades women by portraying them as mindless dolls'".<ref name="Zeisler3" /> In that sense, ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' was a television breakthrough because it introduced the first female character whose central relationships were not her husband or boyfriend or her family, but her friends and coworkers. The main character was a sort of stand-in for the "new American female" who put her job before romance and preferred to be alone than with the wrong men, but still had to do stereotypically female office work (like typing and getting coffee) and didn't speak up to her boss and other male coworkers.<ref name="Zeisler3" />

=== International Organization and NGO response ===
==== UN Women ====
[[UN Women]] is the [[United Nations|UN]] organization dedicated to [[gender equality]] and the [[empowerment]] of women.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/about-us/about-un-women|title=About UN Women|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref> In order to increase women's leadership, to end violence against women and to engage women in all aspects of peace and security processes, it's important to give women the right place in media landscape, and their representations must be fair and equal. UN Women supports media monitoring studies on how women are depicted in the media. For instance, the organisation "engage media professionals by raising awareness of gender equality and violence against women, including through special workshops and tool-kits, to encourage gender-sensitive reporting."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/end-violence-against-women/2014/media|title=Women and media|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref>

==== UNESCO ====
In line with UNESCO's [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/gender-equality/ Global Priority Gender], "[[UNESCO]] is contributing to achieving full [[gender equality]] in the media by 2030".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/media-pluralism-and-gender-equality|title=Media Diversity and Gender Equality|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25|date=2016-10-12}}</ref> In order to reach this goal, the Organization developed the [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/crosscutting-priorities/gender-and-media/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media/ Gender-sensitive Indicators for Media (GSIM)] to measure gender awareness and portrayal within media organizations (e.g. working conditions), but particularly in editorial content. The Organization has been promoting their application by governments, media organizations, journalists unions and associations, journalism schools and the like. They set the basis for gender equality in media operations and editorial content. In addition, each year, UNESCO organizes a campaign named "[https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews Women Make the News]"; in 2018 the theme was ''Gender Equality and Sports Media'' as "Sports coverage is hugely powerful in shaping norms and [[stereotype]]s about [[gender]]. Media has the ability to challenge these norms, promoting a balanced coverage of men's and women's sports and a fair portrayal of sportspeople irrespective of gender."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews|title=Women Make the News 2018|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25|date=2018-02-14}}</ref>
