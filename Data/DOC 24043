==Background==
{{main|Remittance}}

A remittance is a [[Wire transfer|transfer of money]] by a [[migrant worker|foreign worker]] to an individual in his or her home country. Money sent home by migrants competes with [[international aid]] as some of the largest financial inflows to [[developing country|developing countries]]. In 2012, according to the [[World Bank]] Report, $401 billion went to developing countries (a new record) with overall global remittances at $514 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/29/ri-ranks-third-se-asia-remittance-list.html |title=RI ranks third on SE Asia remittance list |date=April 29, 2013}}</ref>

Remittances are playing an increasingly large role in the economies of many countries, contributing to economic growth and to the livelihoods of less prosperous people (though generally not the poorest of the poor). According to [[World Bank]] estimates, remittances totaled [[US$]]414 billion in 2009, of which [[US$]]316 billion went to developing countries that involved 192 million [[migrant worker]]s.<ref name="go.worldbank.org1">The World Bank: [http://go.worldbank.org/NPD63OTRR0 Remittance Market Outlook]</ref> For some individual recipient countries, remittances can be as high as a third of their GDP.<ref name="go.worldbank.org1" /> As remittance receivers often have a higher propensity to own a bank account, remittances promote access to financial services for the sender and recipient, an essential aspect of leveraging remittances to promote economic development. According to some social scientists remittances have social significance that extends well beyond the mere financial dimensions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1508084/Migrating_-_Remitting_-Building-_Dwelling_House-making_as_proxy_presence_in_postsocialist_Albania |title= Migrating - Remitting -‘Building’- Dwelling: House-making as proxy presence in postsocialist Albania. |year=2013}}</ref>

==Provisions of the bill==
According to a summary written by the House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], "H.R. 4386 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, with respect to complying with monetary instrument transaction reporting requirements, to rely upon examinations conducted by the relevant state supervisory agency if: 1) the category of financial institution is required by state law to comply with federal requirements; or 2) the state supervisory agency is authorized to ensure that the financial institution complies with federal requirements."<ref name=gop4386>{{cite web|title=Legislative Digest - H.R. 4386|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4386-money-remittances-improvement-act-of-2014/|publisher=House Republican Conference|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>

Rep.
