'''Torrylin Cairn''' is the remains of a [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] chambered tomb. It is located near [[Kilmory, Arran|Kilmory]] on the [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]] ({{gbmapping|NR95532108}}).

==Description==
Torrylin Cairn is situated beside Kilmory Water just south of the hamlet of [[Lagg, Arran|Lagg]].<ref name="histscot">[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_024 Torrylin Cairn], Historic Scotland, accessed 2 May 2014</ref>

The cairn has been interfered with by stone robbing and later dumping of field stones and its original shape and size are uncertain.<ref name="rcahms1">{{Canmore |num=39655 |desc=Arran, Torrylin |access-date=2 May 2014}}</ref> The chamber is 6.7 metres long by about 1.2 metres wide with each compartment about 1.4 metres long.<ref name="rcahms1"/> Torrylin Cairn is of a type found across south-west Scotland known as a [[Court cairn|Clyde cairn]], of which a better preserved example can be found at [[Carn Ban, Arran|Carn Ban]], about 3 miles to the northeast.<ref name="histscot"/> The tomb would probably have had a crescent-shaped forecourt, framed by a fa√ßade of slender upright stones.<ref name="histscot"/>

Antiquarian excavations in the 19th century uncovered an elongated burial chamber, divided into four compartments.<ref name="histscot"/> Only the innermost compartment was intact. It contained the remains of six adults, a child and an infant.<ref name="histscot"/> Beside them lay a flint tool and a fragment of pottery.<ref name="histscot"/>
