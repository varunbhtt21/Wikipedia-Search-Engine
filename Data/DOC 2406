===Role of Save Urdu Movement in highlighting Problems of Urdu in India===
This organisation has pointed out that partisan treatment is being meted out to [[Urdu]] language in many states of [[India]]. One such glaring example highlighted is that in spite of the status of official language in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Urdu]] is now totally absent from government offices. There are now too few schools in the state where [[Urdu]] teaching has remained intact because [[Urdu]] teachers have not been inducted since the last 14 years. All this information was furnished in a press statement issued by Irshad Ahmad, the general secretary of the state unit of ‘Urdu Bachao Tahreek’ (Save Urdu Movement) in [[Uttar Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://twocircles.net/2008jun25/urdu_second_official_language_absent_offices.html | title=Urdu, second official language, absent from offices | accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

===Rift with the Sindh Government===
This organisation particularly had a problematic time in Sindh where the Government tried to promote Sindhi over Urdu. One such scheme introduced by the Sindh Government of the ''Sindhi Salees'' scheme to promote Sindhi as a compulsory subject by slashing a 100-marks paper of Urdu taught to the students in Class XI. Save Urdu Movement argued that efforts should be made to teach Urdu and Sindhi to the students at schools in a meaningful way with a spirit to enable the students understand significantly the language and its uses in the daily life, and the government should not try to impose Sindhi or Urdu teaching as a compulsory subject to the students at the intermediate level.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/162751/karachi-teachers-oppose-decision-on-language-subject | title=Home     Newspaper     Karachi  KARACHI: Teachers oppose decision on language subject | publisher=Dawn Newspaper | accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>
