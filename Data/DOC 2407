== Selected Works ==

=== ''Isabel, Queen of Harlem'' ===
''Isabel, Queen of Harlem'' was made in 2017 using coffee and tea stained paper mounted onto a 30 x 22 inch canvas and ink.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/umar-rashid-frohawk-two-feathers-isabel-queen-of-harlem-the-good-mother-we-all-wished-we-had-messier-no-dot-41|title=Umar Rashid (Frohawk Two Feathers) {{!}} Isabel, Queen of Harlem. The good mother we all wished we had. Messier no.41 (2017) {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> Frohawk Two Feathers uses his artistic ability to bring together 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century colonial portraiture and contemporary urban culture. This piece was part of the ''Messier Objects, You Get the Gods You Deserve Part 3 of The Americas 1795'' art exhibit.<ref name=":0" /> The oval frame made of coffee and tea surrounding Isabel makes her the focus of the piece. The thin lines of ink that make up Isabel, from a distance, appear as though they were just light brush strokes, but up close it is as though the individual lines piece her together. The line running down her headdress guides you down her  face and down the shirt she is wearing. The piece is monochromatic and instead uses closer together lines to indicate shadows and farther apart lines to indicate lighter regions. He creates texture much the same way. The coat has curved, spaced apart lines that give the appearance of animal fur. It has a flat surface and the texture of this piece is implied.
