<small>5x expanded by [[User:Hasteur|Hasteur]] ([[User talk:Hasteur|talk]]), [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Hasteur|Hasteur]] ([[User talk:Hasteur|talk]]) at 19:15, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:* Deion Sanders is a big deal, I think. If you don't mind, let's put his name here so this nomination gets noticed. 
::*<s>'''ALT1''' .. that '''[[Prime Prep Academy]]''' which was co-founded by [[Deion Sanders]] and served as a backdrop for ''[[Deion's Family Playbook]]'', later fired Sanders as the school's head coach?</s>  [[User:Maile66|— Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) 20:39, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
::::I think you mean ''Prime Time'' ;-), but the ALT hook works for me. I just want to scrupulusly adhere to the "Must Be Cited" statements [[User:Hasteur|Hasteur]] ([[User talk:Hasteur|talk]]) 20:45, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Not sure what you meant by the Prime Time comment.  Adjust the hook at will.  However, it did occur to me this hook might be passed over for a long time as "what's the big deal about that?" unless you put Deion Sanders in there. [[User:Maile66|— Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) 20:56, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
::::: ''Prime Time'' is Deion Sanders' nickname. [[User:Hasteur|Hasteur]] ([[User talk:Hasteur|talk]]) 19:55, 27 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Complete review needed. [[User:Maile66|— Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) 01:00, 26 May 2014 (UTC)  
*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Article length, newness, and compliance with policy all check out.  ALT1 is interesting and supported byu inline citations that verify the content.  However, I suggest shortening it a bit as I didn't see any reason to mention the reality show:
::'''ALT2:''' that '''[[Prime Prep Academy]]''', which was co-founded by professional football player [[Deion Sanders]], later fired him as the school's head coach? 
:I'll leave the decision as to which version to use up the promoting admin. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 18:00, 27 May 2014 (UTC)
::I, as the advocate for the submission, am fine with ALT2.  I attempted to make the hook interesting by masking which pro-football player it was, but it's for the best.  The school has attracted a significant amount of negative attention which is reflected in the article so I'm trying to rigorously adhere to the overall content guidelines. [[User:Hasteur|Hasteur]] ([[User talk:Hasteur|talk]]) 19:55, 27 May 2014 (UTC)
::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]]  Then if '''ALT2''' is fine with the reviewer and the nominator, I'll approve it and strike ALT1.  And, Hasteur, thanks for enlightening me about the nickname.  Now I know how the school got its name.  I know who Sanders is, but not the details of his career(s).
