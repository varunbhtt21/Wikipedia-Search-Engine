'''Baba Fakhruddin Suharwardy''' was a [[Sufi]] saint who lived in the 12th century.

Before coming to [[Penukonda]], he was a king of [[Sistan]] and Shahpur in [[Iran]].<ref name="babafakhruddin">[http://www.babafakhruddin.com/  Hazrat Baba Fakhruddin (R.A)]</ref> His disciples knew him as a true follower of Islam who renounced the world for the sake of Allah.  His Murshid (spiritual guide) was [[Tabr-e-Aalam Baadshah Nathar Vali]], who himself was a king who also had renounced the world in a place called [[Tiruchirapalli]] (Tamil Nadu). After serving for several years at his Murshid's command, Baba Fakruddin left for Penukonda in order to preach.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

He is commonly known as Babaiah in India and his name has been taken by many men over the centuries due to a widespread popular respect for his legend. Today, his mausoleum is located in [[Penukonda]], Anantapur District, [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]].
