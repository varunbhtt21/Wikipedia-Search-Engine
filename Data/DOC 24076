The result was    '''delete'''. The article is one paragraph long, so there isn't really anything to merge. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<font style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small> 08:41, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

Forced Afd. PROD was contested (albeit with a sockpuppet) and not qualified for an A7. The subject does not appear to meet the [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline.]] The sources listed only describe ''the book'' and the plot. Although she is a main character, I feel that she is not notable enough for her own article, but notable in context for the book. My preferred course of action is '''Delete and redirect/merge article into [[Maya_the_Bee]].''' Thanks. [[User:Tutelary|Tutelary]] ([[User talk:Tutelary|talk]]) 19:16, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Delete and merge''' per the all the above.  [[User:G S Palmer|G S Palmer]] ([[User talk:G S Palmer|talk]]) 00:26, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</s>  '''Delete''': there's nothing in this article worth saving.  [[User:G S Palmer|G S Palmer]] ([[User talk:G S Palmer|talk]]) 12:13, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''.  [[WP:MAD|Merge and delete]] is usually a bad choice; it makes proper attribution impossible. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 02:10, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  There is nothing worth merging, since the text is being added by a non-English speaker, and is generally worse than MT. If anyone can find anything coherent enough to be worth keeping, the facts it represents can be added in English to the main article.

*'''Merge and redirect''' to [[Maya the Bee]]. Maya is a notable and popular character, but there's no need to create duplicate articles for the same topic. Anything substantial could be added to the main article. --[[User:Vejvančický|Vejvančický]] ([[User_talk:Vejvančický|talk]] / [[Special:Contributions/Vejvančický|contribs]]) 06:33, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - there's a [[List of characters in Maya the Bee]] as well (and [[List of episodes of Maya the Bee]] too, though that's not really relevant here) - better to m/rd there or to main page? Better to get rid of the List pages? [[Special:Contributions/206.117.89.4|206.117.89.4]] ([[User talk:206.117.89.4|talk]]) 20:36, 4 May 2014 (UTC) ([[User:Ansh666]])
** I honestly don't know what to do with this page, which is why I have abstained from voting.  I originally boldly redirected it, which got me a threat of being brought to AN/I.  I didn't realize it at the time, but the article qualified for [[WP:G5]] speedy deletion.  Instead, I reduced it to just one or two brief sentences, and, at that point, my extensive edits probably made a G5 speedy delete impossible.  I'd settle for redirection, merge, or deletion.  Really, anything is fine with me, as long as that incomprehensible Russian-to-English translation isn't restored.

*'''Delete'''. There is nothing in this article that isn't already covered perfectly adequately in the main article on the book. [[User:RomanSpa|RomanSpa]] ([[User talk:RomanSpa|talk]]) 06:17, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
