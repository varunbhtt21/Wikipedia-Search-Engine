== Work in architecture==

Fisher started his career as an architect in 1931 with a solo practice in Chicago, which continued until 1943.<ref name="public.aia.org"/>

In 1932, he founded General Houses, Inc. in Chicago to design, sell, and erect low-cost prefabricated housing.<ref name="gh">{{cite web|url=http://oak.conncoll.edu/~steelhouse/ghinc.html |title=General Houses, Inc.

Panels were typically four-feet wide by nine-feet high - except the fireplace panel was taller, and the garage door panel was twice as wide. The panels could be assembled in a wide variety of configurations to suit individual clients' needs and specific sites. For example, one General Houses house that was built on a hillside had three stories with the living room on the top floor to best enjoy the view. The General Houses, Inc. building system was the subject of U.S. patent 1,969,125 issued August 7, 1934.<ref>"Our Homes," advertising brochure published by General Houses, Inc., editors J.

A marketing slogan of the company was "A house that's twice as good at half the price."<ref name="gh" /> General Houses cost about $3,000 to $4,500.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=PREFAB|last=Arieff|first=Allison|last2=Burkhart|first2=Bryan|publisher=Gibbs Smith|year=2002|isbn=|location=Layton, Utah|pages=15}}</ref> 

During the [[Century of Progress]], Fisher had two prefabricated houses on display. The first was part of "The Work of the Young Architects of the Midwest" exhibit, which also featured the work of Fisher's rival, [[Robert W.

General Houses, Inc.'s first house was erected in 1933 in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], but no longer stands.<ref name=gh />

The [[House at 130 Mohegan Avenue]], completed in November 1933 for about $4,500, is a surviving example of a General Houses house.
