==Plot==
A wealthy first-time Broadway producer, Julia Budder, is throwing an opening night party for ''The Golden Egg'' at her luxurious [[Manhattan]] home. The playwright, Peter Austin, is joined by the director, a lead actor, and assorted friends and hangers-on (including a critic) as they nervously wait for the late-night reviews printed in the newspapers. As they wait, they gossip and name-drop celebrities who are in attendance and chat about their respective theater experiences. Virginia Noyes, the star of the show, is taking drugs. James Wicker, an old friend of the playwright, is now a successful TV actor who turned down the lead in the play, and is relieved and secretly thrilled about the bad reviews that arrive. And, although Ira Drew is a theater critic, he is very critical of the theater because he has no talent to actually participate, despite his secretly writing plays. Not discouraged by the bad reviews for ''The Golden Egg'', the assembled parties eagerly make plans for their next play, which they ''know'' will be a hit.<ref name=play>[http://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=1099 " ''It's Only a Play'', The Story"] dramatists.com, accessed June 6, 2014</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], in his review of the 1982 off-off-Broadway production for ''[[New York Magazine]]'' called the play "truly amusing", while noting that the play is missing "the interaction of characters on a plot as well as confrontational level."<ref>Simon, John.

[[Michael Kuchwara]], in his review of the 1986 off-Broadway production for the [[Associated Press]], called the play a "maliciously funny diatribe about the desperate and demented business of producing a play on Broadway."<ref>Kuchwara, Michael.
