Title : Padiham witch
Text : '''Margaret Pearson''', also known as the '''Padiham witch''' because she lived in the town of [[Padiham]] in Lancashire, England, was among those tried with the [[Pendle witches]] in the Lancashire witch trials of 1612. This, her third trial for witchcraft, took place on 19 August at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]]{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=168|ps=none}} in front of Sir [[James Altham]] and Sir Edward Bromley.

One of the Pendle witches, Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had accused Pearson of "riding a mare&nbsp;... to death",{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=171|ps=none}} so she was charged with killing a horse.{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=2|ps=none}} The only other evidence submitted against her came from a fellow resident of Padiham, Jennet Booth, who said that on a visit to Pearson's husband while Margaret was in prison a toad had jumped out of a pile of firewood.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=171|ps=none}} Found guilty of non-capital witchcraft Pearson escaped execution, and was instead sentenced to be [[pillory|pilloried]] in Lancaster, [[Clitheroe]], [[Whalley, Lancashire|Whalley]] and Padiham on four market days, followed by a year in prison.{{sfnp|Sharpe|2002|p=3|ps=none}}{{efn|Pillorying and imprisonment was the usual punishment for those found guilty of witchcraft but who had not killed anyone.{{sfnp|Gibson|2002|p=53|ps=none}}}}__NOTOC__
