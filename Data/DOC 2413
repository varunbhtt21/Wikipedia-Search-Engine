Title : Ignatios the Deacon
Text : '''Ignatios the Deacon''' ({{lang-el|Ἰγνάτιος ὁ Διάκονος}}, 780/790 – after 845) was a Byzantine cleric and writer. Left an orphan as a child, he was educated under the auspices of [[Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople]], and rose in the church hierarchy under Tarasios' successor, [[Nikephoros I of Constantinople|Nikephoros I]], becoming a [[deacon]] and ''[[skeuophylax]]'' of the [[Hagia Sophia]]. After the start of the second period of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] ca. 814, he sided with the iconoclasts, becoming [[metropolitan bishop]] of the prestigious see of [[See of Nicaea|Nicaea]], probably in the 830s. He later reversed his stance, however, and retired as a monk at about the time of the [[Triumph of Orthodoxy|definite end of Iconoclasm]] in 843. Ignatios was the confirmed or probable author of several saints' lives ([[hagiography|hagiographies]]), funeral elegies, letters and poems.
