==History==
In 1969 several families who used a house in the [[Texas Medical Center]] as their place of worship started the ISGH.<ref>"[https://www.isgh.org/about-us/ About Us]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6PHYCBm3b?url=https://www.isgh.org/about-us/ Archive]). Islamic Society of Greater Houston. Retrieved on May 3, 2014.</ref>

In the 1970s a three bedroom house in northern Houston was the only mosque in the city, and it served 30 families. Those families pooled funds and purchased a {{convert|1.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} plot of land in late 1980 so a mosque could be built there; the plot was near two major arteries.<ref name=Badrp193>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA193 193].</ref> At first the mosque was in a {{convert|1500|sqft|sqm|adj=on}}, three bedroom double-wide trailer, purchased for $43,000 (${{inflation|USD|43000|1980|r=2}} when accounting for inflation).<ref name=Badrp193194>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA193 193]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA194 194].</ref> Five families donated money to pay for the down payment, with each family paying $1,500 (${{inflation|USD|1500|1980|r=2}} when accounting for inflation). Public fundraising dinners and anonymous donations provided the funds for the construction of the permanent ''Al-Noor'' mosque.<ref name=Badr194/>

Before the mid-1980s the religious leaders of mosques and the ISGH administration had separate roles: the leaders of mosques administered the teaching of Islam, the leading of prayers, and other religious matters while the board of directors of the ISGH focused on administrative affairs such as the construction of new mosques and financing; this resulted in parallel power structures. As new mosques came in, the ISGH believed that having ''huffaz'' with divergent points of view disrupted the unity in the community, and the organization saw new ''huffaz'' as threats to their own power. A ''[[Hafiz (Quran)|hafiz]]'' could influence his members to vote and affect policies in the entire ISGH system. In the mid-1980s the ISGH leadership created the ''[[Ulama]]'' community to unify the leadership and consolidate its power.<ref name=Badrp199/>

The 1950s marked the first known organized Muslim community in Houston. That community met in the barber shop of Charlie Boyd. In 1978 they established the Houston Masjid of Al-Islam. This historic mosque was made possible by heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]], who donated the funds needed to purchase the Christian Scientist Church to convert as Houston's first mosque. Thirty-three years later, the mosque was rebuilt due to damage from [[Hurricane Ike]]. In 2011 the historic Houston mosque was renamed Masjid Warithudeen Mohammed in honor of one of America's pioneering Muslim leaders. This community has always focused on local activism and interfaith outreach, addressing issues of [[social justice]] and the uplifting of disfranchised people that continues to this day.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1969 a small group of immigrant Muslims, mostly students, some engineers and doctors established regular prayers and salat ul jummah (Friday congregational service) at a small house near the Medical Center. This led to the founding of [[ISGH]]<!--Need to spell out what the name is-->, one of the most unusual Islamic organizations in America. Always growing, ISGH currently operates nineteen community centers, six full-time private schools, four community health clinics, three full-service funeral homes and burial ground, along with weekend Islamic schools, recreational facilities, and a hifz program, with over 150 students who have memorized the Qu'ran.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

ISGH quickly gained success as a platform for all Houston Muslims because of its structure and bylaws. Although most of ISGH's constituents are [[Sunni]]s, its commitment to all the Muslims in Houston dates back to the first elected President, Dr. [[Ebrahim Yazdi]], a [[Shi'a]] Muslim.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

As Houston grows, so does its Muslim community. The first generation of ISGH leadership recognized the size of the greater Houston area and planned accordingly. ISGH operates through five primary "zones" across the area. These zones divide the distances among sections of town as follows: North, Northwest, South, Southeast and Southwest. Each zone, like the organization as a whole, has elected leadership who work to coordinate the activities and needs of the community in their areas.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In total the greater Houston area is home to about 100 Muslim and Islamic organizations, including many independent mosques and community-service focused nonprofits.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Organizations and administration==
As of 2000, ISGH has separate zones for each area of Houston, and mosques are all over Houston so that each Muslim in the city has a mosque nearby. Each zone has one main mosque, and some zones have more than one mosque. For instance the north zone had ''Al-Noor'' as its main mosque and it also had other mosques.<ref name="Badr195"/> As of 2000, lay people volunteering as [[imam]]s serve smaller ISGH mosques, while ''[[Hafiz (Quran)|huffaz]]'' serve larger ISGH mosques.<ref name=Badrp199>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA199 199].</ref> In 2000 Badr wrote that "The role of the clergy in the organizational structure of the ISGH has been an area of contention in the Muslim community."<ref name=Badrp198>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198].</ref> Some members believe the priority of the clergy is to keep the Muslim community together,<ref name=Badrp199/> while others believe that each director of an ISGH zone should focus on the issues at his particular mosque.<ref name=Badrp198199>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA199 199].</ref> Badr wrote that Houston ''huffaz'' often have views in opposition to those in the main leadership, and she added that they originate from various countries "and rarely agree on any issue—big or small—facing the Muslim community."<ref name=Badrp199/>

The ISGH typically tries to build new mosques in community before other organizations do, so individual ethnic groups and factions do not build their own mosques.<ref name=Badr200>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA200 200]</ref>

==Ethnic relations==
As of 2000, according to Badr, about 10% of ISGH consists of Arabs.<ref name=Badr207>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA207 207]</ref> According to Badr, from 1990 to 2000 many Arabs began to create their own mosques and Islamic schools separate from the ISGH due to disagreements over various issues including the language of the Friday sermons, the operations of Sunday schools and full-time schools, and the monetary distribution and collection.<ref name=Badr207/> In 2000 Badr wrote that Muslims "remain fragmented along ethnic lines" and this is mainly due to increased immigration.<ref name=Badr205>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA205 205]</ref>

There are women from [[Asian Americans#Demographics|south Asian]] backgrounds who do not believe in wearing the [[hijab]], and the cultural differences result in different mosque attendance. As of 2000, on Friday evening sessions, 90% of the women attending the Main center are Arab, and 90% of the women attending the Friday night sessions at ''Al-Noor'' are Pakistani. The Northern zonal council has tried to remedy this by obtaining a group of members of various ethnic backgrounds.<ref name=Badr205/>

==Religious doctrine==
When determining when [[Ramadan]] begins, the ISGH uses the time when a crescent moon is first seen in North America as the start date of Ramadan. This originates from the [[Islamic Society of North America]] (ISNA).<ref>Dooley, Tara. "[http://www.chron.com/life/houston-belief/article/Ramadan-starts-today-in-Mideast-but-not-here-1915643.php Ramadan starts today in Mideast, but not here]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''.

==Mosques==

===Al-Noor===
[[File:Al Noor Mosque, Houston, USA.JPG|thumb|Al-Noor Mosque]]
This mosque is also known as the Adel Road Mosque.<ref name=Locations/> The ''Al-Noor'' mosque is a red brick building. Hoda Badr, author of "''Al Noor'' Mosque: Strength Through Unity, wrote that "there is nothing to indicate that it is a mosque" except for the windows that "bear a slight Arabic{{sic}} influence".<ref name=Badr194>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA194 194]</ref> The main prayer hall can house up to 500 people; this area is reserved for men.<ref name=Badr194/> As of 2000, every Friday about 500 people attend the ''[[jumu'ah]]'' (juma) prayer.<ref name=Badr194/> The second floor prayer hall, reserved for women, houses about 200-300 people. A balcony from the second floor extends over the first floor. The main mosque building also houses an auxiliary prayer area that may hold up to 200 people and a ''[[wudu]]'' area. The mosque property includes a community hall, located in a wooden frame house; and a recreation area which includes a pavilion used as a basketball court and an outdoor hall.<ref name=Badr195/> Badr stated that of those who go to Al-Noor, most of them stated that it is the closest mosque to their house, so they attend on a regular basis, although they sometimes go to other mosques because they are closer to their employment centers, or to hear guest speakers, or to attend ''[[Jumu'ah]]''.<ref name=Badr195/>

As of 2000, about 85% of the worshipers at ''Al-Noor'' are Pakistani and Indian. The largest minorities are Bangladeshis, Arabs, and African-Americans.<ref name=Badr202>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA202 202]</ref> As of 2000, according to Badr, about 5% of ''Al-Noor'' consists of Arabs.<ref name=Badr207/> Others include Anglos, Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders, South Americans, and Europeans.<ref name=Badr202/>

As of 2000, the sole Muslim funeral home in the State of Texas is located at ''Al-Noor'', and it serves Muslims from all of Texas and from several nearby states. As of that year, about 90% of the Houston-area funeral prayers are conducted at Al-Noor due to the location of the funeral home.<ref name="Badrp198"/>

The mosque includes a full-time private Islamic school. It also has educational classes for adults and children on Sundays and other days of the week.<ref name=Badr201>Badr, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AT57AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA201 201]</ref> The Al-Noor Mosque offers a [[Sunday school]] that, as of 2000, has an enrollment of 238 children.<ref name=Badr207/> As of that year it is the largest ISGH Sunday school in Houston.<ref name=Badr201/> As of 2000, the enrollment was increasing and the student body was becoming more heavily South Asian and less ethnically diverse.<ref name=Badr207/>

As part of its ''[[zakat]]'' services, the ISGH has special food stamps which can be used to pay bills and rent, bus fare, and items from Muslim grocery stores.<ref name=Badr201/> Badr wrote that the services effectively help new immigrants but some women are hesitant to use the services because there are no women on the ''zakat'' committee and some women do not want to tell a man about their family problems.<ref name="Badr201"/>

In the 1999 ''[[Eid al-Fitr]]'' 2,200 people attended Eid at Al-Noor because the Muslims were unable to reserve a convention center for their ''Eid'' celebration, and therefore they had to celebrate their holiday at their neighborhood mosques.<ref name=Badr194/>

As of 2000, 90% of the women attending the Friday night sessions at ''Al-Noor'' are Pakistani.<ref name=Badr205/>

==Schools==
The Darul Arqam Islamic School District (DAISD), also known as [[Darul Arqam Schools]] is the system of Islamic day schools operated by the ISGH. The [[Islamic Education Institute of Texas]] (IEIT) oversees the operations of the Islamic schools.<ref>"[http://www.north.darularqamschools.org/ Home]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6PITwBeq4?url=http://www.north.darularqamschools.org/ Archive]).
