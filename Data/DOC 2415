While this book satisfies the threshold criteria for [[WP:NBOOK]] there are no reliable sources that it passes any of the other criteria. => [[User:Spudgfsh|<span style="color:green">Spudgfsh</span>]] ([[User Talk:Spudgfsh|<span style="color:red">Text Me!</span>]]) 19:57, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep'''.  It's widely used as a citation in other articles; it is therefore of value to know what kind of publication those articles are citing, what its background was, etc.  That makes the article valuable to include here.

:*Well... being a citable source doesn't always guarantee notability. We've had a lot of subjects that could be used as a RS (books, authors, professors, etc) but that in and of itself doesn't always mean that it would pass notability on that guideline alone. We'd really still need coverage in secondary, reliable sources in some context to help back up claims that this is especially noteworthy and exemplary in the field of series guides. In many cases if that doesn't exist, we'll list the book in a "further reading" section or in a "List of Doctor Who books" type article.

*'''Keep'''. I've found some reviews and mention of it, so this does pass notability guidelines. However the article really, REALLY needs to be cleaned and re-written, as the current version is pretty much unsourced and reads like something you'd find on a fan wikia. This is fine for fan wikias, but you've got to remember that you have to not only be able to source things but you also have to be able to keep the tone neutral and encyclopedic. It just comes across a little fannish and it also doesn't really put things across in layman's terms. While it's more likely that people who will come to the page will be at least passingly familiar, the layout does sort of read like it'd alienate someone who isn't aware of the series. It doesn't need a lot of cleanup, just some tweaks here and there.

*'''Keep''' - The format utilised in the book (Roots/Goofs/Dialogue Triumphs & Disasters/Fashion victims etc) has been adopted by the BBC for their official 'Classic Who' website's episode guide - each entry includes a verbatim (and attributed) 'Bottom Line'... [http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/daleks/detail.shtml Example: The Daleks].

:*Well, I'm not sure whether the BBC having reprinted the book's contents on its ''Doctor Who'' website is an argument for or against Wikipedia having an article on the book. But it does show that the book was sufficiently well-regarded that the keepers of the subject's copyright were willing to give it an official imprimatur by hosting it. —[[User:Josiah Rowe|Josiah Rowe]] <small>([[User talk:Josiah Rowe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe|contribs]])</small> 04:15, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', especially given the cleanup begun by Tokyogirl. Clearly meets criterion N1. —[[User:Josiah Rowe|Josiah Rowe]] <small>([[User talk:Josiah Rowe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe|contribs]])</small> 04:15, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': Fails notability. One of several unofficial guidebooks. The authors are notable, and information on this can be included on their own articles. [[Special:Contributions/41.135.172.4|41.135.172.4]] ([[User talk:41.135.172.4|talk]]) 04:52, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''STRONG Keep''' - according to the WP page linked, it only HAS to meet one of the criteria.  Even the nominator sa\ys it does, so I have no idea why this is even here. [[Special:Contributions/94.195.107.134|94.195.107.134]] ([[User talk:94.195.107.134|talk]]) 11:07, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*:[[WP:NBOOK]] states that passing the threshold criteria is not sufficient for notability.  Whether it passes any of the other criteria is up for debate here.  I am still to be convinced. => [[User:Spudgfsh|<span style="color:green">Spudgfsh</span>]] ([[User Talk:Spudgfsh|<span style="color:red">Text Me!</span>]]) 11:13, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Google Scholar shows this book is cited by at least 5 academic works.[http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22The+Discontinuity+Guide%22+Cornell&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C44&as_sdtp=]  3 of the 5 are "Doctor Who"-specific.  The 4th is DiPaolo's book ''War, politics and superheroes: Ethics and propaganda in comics and film''.  The 5th is Bramwell's work ''Pagan themes in modern children's fiction: green man, shamanism, earth mysteries''.  2 non-Who-specific academic citations aren't much but they are something.

*'''Comment''' If this turns out to be "delete" I would much prefer a redirect with the edit history preserved.  The problem is that I can't think of the best place to redirect it to.  Any target would have to at least mention this book or it wouldn't be a viable target.
