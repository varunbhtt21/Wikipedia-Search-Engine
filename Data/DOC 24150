'''Zar Zari Zar Baksh''', or Shah Muntajab ud din, was one of the earliest [[Sufi]]s of the [[Chishti Order]], the most dominant of all the Sufi orders in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He was sent to the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] by [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] of [[Delhi]] in the beginning of the 8th century [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] (14th century AD). With 700 disciples, Zar Zari Zar Baksh came to [[Aurangabad Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], and is said to have converted a [[Hindu]] princess near a well at [[Khuldabad]]. The place is now called the "''Sohan baoli''" or "pleasing well", and the princess is buried close to the saints grave in Khuldabad.

The tomb of Zar Zari Zar Baksh is between [[Malik Ambar]]'s tomb and the northern gate of the town. It contains a number of ornaments and relics, the most remarkable of which is a circular steel looking glass mounted on a steel pedestal of four feet in height. It is said to have been presented by King [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah|Tana Shah]]. The ''[[dargah]]'' in Khuldabad attracts thousands of pilgrims each year for the [[Urs]] of the saint.
