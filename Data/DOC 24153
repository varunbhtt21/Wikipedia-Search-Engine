Despite the potential political cost to himself, Grady supported the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union]] with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. In 1799, he wrote, "I suffer much in my expectations because, if I pursue my profession, I must remain in this country, and it is idle to say that an individual here, however industrious or intelligent as a barrister, unknown to the British minister in the Imperial Parliament, can expect that situation of which, as a member of the Irish parliament, time, zeal and fitness for judicial situation acquired at least through practice, might induce a reasonable hope...."<ref name=hop1790/>

In the [[1801 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1801]], Grady was elected to the new [[Limerick City (UK Parliament constituency)|Limerick City constituency]] in the UK Parliament.

For his support of the Union, [[Dublin Castle administration|Dublin Castle]] appointed him second counsel to the revenue board, with an annual salary of £1,200.<ref name=hop1790/> Disappointed in not having been better remunerated for his Unionism, Grady supported opposition candidates in the general elections of 1812 and 1818.<ref name=hop1790/> He died 8 September 1847.<ref name=hop1790/>
