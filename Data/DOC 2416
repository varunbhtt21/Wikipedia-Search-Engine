The '''Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of Art''' is part of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Home page|url=http://www.hamilton.edu/index.cfm|publisher=Hamilton College|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]]. The museum was established in October 2012 after the closing of Hamilton’s Emerson Gallery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emerson Gallery - History of Exhibitions|url=https://www.hamilton.edu/gallery-archive/exhibitions/history-of-exhibitions/history-of-exhibitions|publisher=Hamilton College|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>

The 30,537-square-foot building was designed by [[Machado and Silvetti Associates]], and includes the Dietrich Exhibition Gallery that hosts two major exhibitions each academic year, Archive Hall, the Object Study Gallery, two seminar rooms, and the Material Perseveration Laboratory. 

The Wellin is a teaching museum that was designed to allow museum visitor to see all aspects of the museum's functions, including exhibit areas, archives, art storage, conservation workshops, administrative offices, and teaching spaces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Director's Message|url=http://www.hamilton.edu/wellin/index.html#directorsmessage|publisher=Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of Art|accessdate=25 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321031338/http://www.hamilton.edu/wellin/index.html#directorsmessage|archivedate=21 March 2014|df=}}</ref>  There are several classrooms for professors to teach various courses in art and art history. Also in development are classes on [[curator]]ial practices which will be made available to students in the future.

The collection at the Wellin is composed of a wide array of artwork ranging from [[Ancient Roman]] glass to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] baskets. This collection is a mixture of two dimensional and three dimensional work and has grown out of donations and pieces on loan from other institutions.

==Student involvement==
In line with the museum’s commitment to teaching student involvement is an important aspect of the daily functions of the Wellin. Students act as [[Museum docent|docents]], frequently aid in the cataloging of the collection and setting up of exhibitions. During professional artist visits, students also have the opportunity to assist the artist in preparation for their show. Senior-year art students work with the museum staff to set up their [[thesis]] exhibitions. During this time the students consult and work with the staff on everything from the floor plan to the budget.
