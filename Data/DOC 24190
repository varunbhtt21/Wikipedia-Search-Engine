Title : Ibrahim ibn Ahmad
Text : '''Ibrahim ibn Ahmad''' (died 10th-century), was the [[amir]] of the [[Samanids]] briefly in 947. He was the son of [[Ahmad Samani]].

Ibrahim had a brother named [[Nasr II]], who succeeded Ahmad as the ruler of the Samanids in 914. In 943, the Nasr's son [[Nuh I]] succeeded him. During this period Ibrahim resided in the [[Hamdanid]] court in [[Iraq]]. In 945, Nuh I dismissed the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]] from the governorship of [[Khurasan]] after hearing complaints of the latter's harsh rule, and sought to replace him with a [[Turkic people|Turk]], the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali refused to accept his dismissal and rebelled. He then convinced Ibrahim to come from Iraq, which he agreed to do so; Ibrahim first travelled to [[Tikrit]], and then to [[Hamadan]], and then reached the Samanid capital of [[Bukhara]], which he captured with the aid of Abu 'Ali in 947, and crowned himself as the ruler of the Samanids.

The rebellion of Ibrahim and Abu 'Ali quickly spread around the Samanid state, and even spread as far as [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] in [[Jibal]]. Ibrahim's rule was shortly recognized by the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]]. However, he was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers. The fate of Ibrahim is not known.
