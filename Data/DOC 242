* '''[[:Ellie Ga]]''' – endorse, close, userfy.  Everybody seems to agree that the original close was fine, but new sources have come to light since then.  I'm going to move this to [[User:Brainy_J/Ellie Ga]] so he can work on it as he requested.  Once the new sources have been added, it can be moved back to main article space (ask any admin for assistance, if needed) – -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 13:52, 1 May 2014 (UTC) <!--*-->

She seems to have garnered some notability since the deletion in late 2009, and I'll edit the article further once it's restored to incorporate these sources:

*'''Comment:''' I was the closer of the AFD at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ellie Ga]]. Though no longer an admin, I'll respectfully defer to the outcome of this discussion. Cheers, &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:53, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Overturn''' and '''Restore''' Nothing wrong with the close, but the sources clearly pass [[WP:RS]] and [[WP:GNG]]. Also please restore article and talk page for discussion.

*'''Restore''' or re-create article.  I agree, there seems to be new notability since 2009. [[User:Starblind|Andrew Lenahan]] - <b><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">St</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF5500">ar</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF8000">bli</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFC000">nd</FONT></b> 14:47, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
* Temporarily restored for review.  -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 16:31, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Endorse, userfy, allow recreation'''. This really isn't a DRV matter, since the article wasn't salted. Going through [[WP:REFUND]] would have been more efficient. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 23:01, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''[[:UFO sightings in outer space]]''' – Consensus is to '''allow recreation''' of the article based on the new sources. This does not prevent a later AfD discussion if these sources are still considered insufficient. – <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<font style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small> 11:34, 2 May 2014 (UTC) <!--*-->

:{{DRV links|UFO sightings in outer space|xfd_page=Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/UFO sightings in outer space (2nd nomination)|article=}}

Nothing wrong with the close admin did the right thing, but per his request due to the recency of the discussion I am requesting a DRV. New reliable sources have been found and added to the article.

*These sighting were also covered in [[Condon Report]] and by [[James Oberg]]
*Sighting outside of the ISS launches the program "NASA's Unexplained Files" and was covered as part of the Science Channel's "Are We Alone?" series.
*It is also an element in science fiction [[The Astronaut's Wife]] and [[Space (The X-Files)]]

This is a widespread, everlasting, and recurring event in space exploration. The AfD essentially snowball into a delete because it is apparent that no one did any research. Here is the condition of the article during the two AfDs, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Valoem/UFO_sightings_in_outer_space&oldid=604333770 AfD 2], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Valoem/UFO_sightings_in_outer_space&oldid=594526290 AfD 1].

Here is version of the article I intend on restoring [[User:Valoem/UFO sightings in outer space]].

I am requesting an '''Allow recreation''' [[User:Valoem|<font color="DarkSlateGray">'''Valoem'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Valoem|'''<font color="blue">talk</font>''']]</sup> <sup>[[Special:Contributions/Valoem|'''<font color="Green">contrib</font>''']]</sup> 13:42, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

::'''Comment''' I just noticed that I posted this in the wrong date. Should be in 4/24. [[User:Valoem|<font color="DarkSlateGray">'''Valoem'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Valoem|'''<font color="blue">talk</font>''']]</sup> <sup>[[Special:Contributions/Valoem|'''<font color="Green">contrib</font>''']]</sup> 18:39, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Endorse close'''. This can be covered in the main article on UFO sightings, it's just the same crap from a different pilot's chair. The sources don't really establish notability any more than they did last time round - a "Myth: Neil Armstrong saw a UFO; Fact: No he didn't" in long article, for example, is really stretching. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 15:12, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' How can we say this? I have attempted to give as much due weight as possible. Even as a hoax the coverage is considered notable. I noted that officially the Armstrong report is not true, perhaps we can move it to the list section. I added over 8 sources not included in the prior debate. The sources have given significant weight on sightings in outer space. I feel a separate article is necessary. [[User:Valoem|<font color="DarkSlateGray">'''Valoem'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Valoem|'''<font color="blue">talk</font>''']]</sup> <sup>[[Special:Contributions/Valoem|'''<font color="Green">contrib</font>''']]</sup> 15:49, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:There are about a dozen and a half pages of the form [[UFO sightings in place]] (see [[:Category:UFO sightings#U]]).   That they're not see aliens doesn't mean it's not a big social phenomenon that requires a substantial amount of depth. [[User:WilyD|Wily]]<font color="FF8800">[[User talk:WilyD|D]]</font> 08:55, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Relist''' The decision on whether to make a separate article is a value judgement, and the new sources ''might'' affect it. Whether they do should be discussed at AfD, not here. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 19:52, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Restore''' - I dunno about the venue. I "think" the proper procedure would be to request "somewhere" (here is just as good as any). As for the article itself, if the information is worthy to be in an article, it doesn't matter if it is on a standalone page or merged to some other page per [[WP:SS]]. This is an easy split from some other related article as noted by JzG. And the references I looked at appeared to give coverage, including at least one first person account. - <b>[[User:Jc37|jc37]]</b> 19:59, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:: Oh good, another target for loons to try to use to pretend that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 22:49, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Allow restoration''' -  certainly sources have been presented here that invalidate all the deletion arguments made in the XfDs (except, perhaps, the rampant "I don't like it's" that were silly to begin with).  It could be relisted if someone thinks it should be deleted, though that appears to be a pretty silly thing to think; relisting for process's sake is a waste of everyone's time.
