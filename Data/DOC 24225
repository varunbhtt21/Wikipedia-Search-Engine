During the Nationals' [[2017 Washington Nationals season|2017 season]], with the team struggling with its bullpen during the first half, Fedde was temporarily moved to a relief role. While pitching out of the bullpen, he was promoted from Class-AA Harrisburg to the Class-AAA [[Syracuse Chiefs]] on June 13, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.milb.com/milb/news/washington-nationals-promote-erick-fedde-to-triple-a-syracuse/c-236189704/t-185364810|title=Nationals promote Fedde to Triple-A Syracuse|first=Sam|last=Dykstra|date=June 13, 2017|accessdate=July 30, 2017|agency=Minor League Baseball}}</ref> After less than a month, Fedde was switched back to starting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/nationals-journal/wp/2017/07/03/minor-league-monday-erick-fedde-returns-to-pitching-as-a-starter/|work=The Washington Post|title=Minor League Monday: Erick Fedde returns to pitching as a starter|date=July 3, 2017|accessdate=July 30, 2017|first=Chelsea|last=Janes}}</ref> The move proved fortuitous for the Nationals, who lost [[Joe Ross (baseball)|Joe Ross]] from their rotation in July after he tore his [[ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow]] and saw veteran starter [[Stephen Strasburg]] lose time due to a nerve impingement in his throwing arm. Fedde was promoted to the major leagues to start the first game of a double-header against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on July 30, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fanragsports.com/news/nationals-promote-top-pitching-prospect-erick-fedde-triple-syracuse/|agency=FanRag Sports Network|title=Nationals promote top pitching prospect Erick Fedde from Triple-A Syracuse|first=Joseph|last=Nocco|date=July 30, 2017|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>.
