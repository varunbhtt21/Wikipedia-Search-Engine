'''Torr a'Chaisteal''' (or '''Torr a'Chaisteil''') is an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] fort ([[dun]]), located about 1 mile northeast of the village of [[Sliddery]], on the [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]] ({{gbmapping|NR92172326}}).

==Description==
Torr a'Chaisteal is situated on an isolated grassy knoll on the west coast of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]].<ref name="histscot">[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_023 Torr A'chaisteal Fort], Historic Scotland, accessed 2 May 2014</ref>

It was a fortified residence, or [[dun]], of a type common across western Scotland in the later Iron Age.<ref name="histscot"/> A similar structure can be seen at [[Kilpatrick Dun]] 2.5 miles to the north.<ref name="histscot2">[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_019 Kilpatrick Dun (or Cashel)], Historic Scotland, accessed 2 May 2014</ref> The turf-covered walls are 0.5 metres high and have an average width of 4 metres.<ref name="rcahms1">{{Canmore |num=39674 |desc=Arran, Torr A' Chaisteil |access-date=2 May 2014}}</ref> The walls are formed of large sandstone boulders, enclosing an area with a diameter of around 7 metres.<ref name="histscot"/> A short stretch of wall lies beside the dun to the east, while on the landward approach is a substantial earthwork that may have formed an outer defence.<ref name="histscot"/>

Antiquarian excavations in the 19th century uncovered human and animal bones, shells, the top stone of a [[Quern-stone|quern]], and pieces of [[haematite]] iron.<ref name="rcahms1"/>
