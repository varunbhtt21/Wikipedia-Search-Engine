The '''Lebaudy Morning Post''' was a [[France|French]] [[semi-rigid airship]] built for the [[British Army]] in [[Moisson]], France, by  manufacturers [[Lebaudy Frères]]. The airship was commissioned by the newspaper ''[[The Morning Post]]'', who created a fund to purchase the airship and present it to the British Army. The airship's envelope was damaged on the delivery flight and then it was destroyed on a subsequent trial flight after repair.  At the time of construction it was the largest airship that had been built in France.<ref name="Aero_Dec">{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|date=15 December 1910 |pages=563–5  |title=La Dirigeable "Morning Post''|language=French|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65639070/f565.image}}</ref>

==Design and development==
[[File:Lebaudy airship RAE-O393.jpg|thumb|left|The Car of the Morning Post]]
The ''Morning Post'' was designed by [[Henri Julliot]] to the same principles as the earlier ''[[Lebaudy République]]'' and ''[[Lebaudy Patrie]]'' but was larger and faster.<ref name="times1" /> The [[Airship#envelope|envelope]] was made of panels of waterproof canvas with two valves at the bottom to allow the [[hydrogen]] to be released, either automatically or by hand.<ref name="times1" /> An additional manual valve on the top of the envelope could be used to completely deflate the envelope.<ref name="times1" /> Two long quick-release panels were also built into the envelope for emergency deflation.<ref name="times1" /> The gas bag had three [[ballonet]]s, one at the front, one in the centre and one at the rear: the front and rear ballonets could be used to fly the airship up or down.<ref name="times1" /> Two [[centrifugal fan]]s were used to inflate the ballonets.<ref name="times1" /> Small fixed vertical and horizontal stabilisers were mountes at the rear of the envelope.

Suspended below the envelope  a diamond-section keel constructed from steel tubing extended nearly the whole length of the envelope. This contained a horizontal stabilising surface for the front two-thirds of its length: the rear part also had a fixed vertical surface.  It carried two pairs of [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]]s, one pair forward and the other aft, and a single rear-mounted rudder.<ref name="Aero_Dec" />  Below this  the car, also made from steel tubes was suspended.  This had a single landing pivot in the bow.<ref name="times1" /> and was divided into compartments and could carry 20 persons.<ref name="times1" /> Also inside the car were two Panhard four-cylinder water-cooled piston engines rated at 135&nbsp;hp, driving a pair of two-bladed  [[pusher configuration|pusher]] propellers through clutches and a gearbox.<ref name="times1" /> The propellers, which rotated in opposite directions, were 16&nbsp;ft 5in (5&nbsp;m) in diameter and revolved at about one third of the engines' speed.<ref name="Aero_Dec" />

==Operational history==
The airship made its first flight on 14 September 1910<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200771.html|date=24 September 1910|page=769|title=The "Morning Post" National Fund Airship}}</ref> and this was followed by a series of test flights before it was formally accepted by the Army.
 
===Delivery flight===

The ''Morning Post'' left Moisson on delivery to Farnborough at 10:15 in the morning of 26 October 1910, carrying eight people including the pilot [[Louis Capazza]]  and three passengers: the designer [[Henri Julliot]], the newly appointed commander of the Army Balloon School [[Sir Alexander Bannerman, 11th Baronet|Major Sir A. Bannerman]], and a representative of the Morning Post.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|date=15 November 1910  |page=522  |title=La Dirigeable "Morning Post'' Traverse La Manche  |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65639070/f524.image}}</ref>  By two o'clock it had reached [[Brighton]] on the English southern coast, it then travelled north over [[Horsham]] towards [[Aldershot]].<ref name="times1" />  It soon approached North Camp at Farnborough for an attempted landing on the common close to the Army Balloon Works.<ref name="times1" /> Due to the strong winds it took a number of approaches to the common before troops managed to grab the ropes and secure the airship.<ref name="times1" /> The airship was towed to a balloon works shed specially built to house it. It was soon realised it would be a close fit but as it had been measured to fit for the ''Morning Post'' all that was required was that care was taken in moving the airship into the shed.<ref name="times1" /> With all but ten feet inside the shed, a large hiss was heard as the envelope had caught on a girder.<ref name="times1" /> A number of troops were under the airship as it collapsed but nobody was hurt.<ref name="times1" />

On 4 May 1911 the ''Morning Post'' was on its first flight since being damaged in October 1910 when it was delivered.<ref name="times2" /> The airship with a crew of seven was at the end of the one-hour trial flight, it had deployed ropes to allow the soldiers on the ground to bring the ship to the ground, the men could not hold it.<ref name="times2" /> The airship drifted into some trees and the envelope burst, causing the airship to collapse over the trees and a house.<ref name="times2" /> One of the French mechanics was badly burned but all the crew were rescued from the debris.<ref name="times2" />
