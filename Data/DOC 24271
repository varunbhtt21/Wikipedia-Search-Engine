'''Zarina Mayramovna Gizikova ''' ({{lang-ru| Зарина Майрамовна Гизикова}}; born June 20, 1985 in [[Vladikavkaz]], [[North Ossetia]], [[Russian Federation]]) is a [[Russians|Russian]] retired individual [[Rhythmic gymnastics|rhythmic gymnast]], an Honored Master of Sports of Russia and the [[Russian Rhythmic Gymnastics National Championships|2002 Russian National]] All-around champion.

== Career ==
Gizikova originally trained in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] under the [[Deriugins School]] of Rhythmic Gymnastics. Gizikova and her family reclocated, continuing her training at the Olympic Center for Rhythmic Gymnastics in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. [[Irina Viner]] facilitated Gizikova to be under the guidance of Personal trainer [[Vera Shtelbaums]], who then was also the coach of [[Irina Tchachina]]. Gizikova was a very dynamic gymnast having excellent technique work led to success early in her career.

Gizikova became member of Russian national team in 1997. She appeared in junior competition in World Club event in 1998 and 1999 at Aeon Cup in [[Tokyo]]. Gizikova began appearing in senior competitions in 2000, she was a member of the Russian team that won gold at the [[2001 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships|2001 World Championships]] in [[Madrid]] but they were later disqualified due to [[Alina Kabaeva]] and [[Irina Tchachina]] testing positive for a banned [[diuretic]]. With the suspension of Kabaeva and Tchachina in a year for doping, Gizikova and teammate [[Laysan Utiasheva]] saw their emergence as Russia's new leading gymnasts. Gizikova became [[Russian Rhythmic Gymnastics National Championships|Russian National]] champion in 2002<ref>{{cite web|title= 2002 Russian Championships |url=http://lenta.ru/sport/2002/05/31/gymnastics/ |publisher=Lenta |date=31 March 2002}}</ref> and she was a member of the Russian Team that won gold at the 2002 European Championships. Unfortunately, due to her bad performance in her clubs routine, the russian coach [[Irina Viner]] gave her a hard and controversial sermon, which cast doubt her future in the team. She won silver in hoop at the [[Rhythmic Gymnastics World Cup|2002 World Cup Final]] in [[Stuttgart]] and won two gold medals (ball, hoop) at the [[Rhythmic Gymnastics Grand Prix Series|2002 Grand Prix Final]] in [[Innsbruck]].

At the [[Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships|2003 European Championships]] in [[Riesa]], Gizikova won gold in ball and silver in hoop. She continued her success winning bronze in all-around and event finals at the [[Gymnastics at the 2003 Summer Universiade|2003 Summer Universiade]] in [[Daegu]]. Gizikova later began again to struggle with consistency and with the reemergence of [[Alina Kabaeva|Kabaeva]] and Tchachina in Russia's National team saw Gizikova being overshadowed by her teammates and in her later career; in 2004 saw the rise of younger teammates [[Vera Sessina]] and [[Olga Kapranova]], Gizikova finally completed her career in 2005.

In 2007, Gizikova and her sisters began coaching at the [[Palace of Sports]] in Storgino, Moscow and opened up their own gymnastics club.

== Personal life ==
Zarina has two older sisters ( Inessa and Aziruchs Gizikova ) who were also former rhythmic gymnasts. Her father was a former Soviet wrestler from [[North Ossetia]] and her mother, a former soviet skier of [[Koreans|Korean]] descent.
