[[Lieutenant-General]] '''George Ramsay''' (1652 – 5 September 1705) was a Scottish professional soldier who served with the British Brigade in the French army from 1674-1676, then with the Dutch [[Scots Brigade]] from 1676-1691. 

In November 1688, he went to England with [[William III of England|William III]] and fought in the 1689-1692 Jacobite Rising in Scotland. He returned to [[Flanders]] in 1690 during the [[Nine Years War]], was promoted [[Brigadier General]] in March 1691 and Colonel of the [[Scots Guards|Scots Footguards]] in September. After the outbreak of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1702 and died at Edinburgh in September, 1705.

==Life==
[[File:Dalhousie Castle 350.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Ramsay's birthplace, [[Dalhousie Castle]]]]
George Ramsay was born in 1652, third son of George Ramsay, 2nd [[Earl of Dalhousie]] (1618-1674) and his wife, Anne Fleming. Two of his brothers also served in the military; Robert, who died in 1678 and John, a Captain in the Dutch [[Scots Brigade]], killed in 1694.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Scots Peerage, Volume III|authorlink=James Balfour Paul|first=James|last=Balfour Paul|year=1910|pages=100–101|title-link=The Scots Peerage}}</ref>

He married Anna Boxel, the daughter of a Dutch army officer. Her mother, Johanna van Rielen, in 1683 remarried Sir Charles Graham, who later succeeded Ramsay as Colonel of the Third Scottish Regiment of the [[Scots Brigade]].<ref name="Tilburg"> city archive Tilburg, notary Cloosterman, will of Johanna van Rielen, Oct. 17, 1696.</ref> Ramsay and Anna Boxel had one daughter, Johanna, who died shortly after her father.<ref name="Balfour Paul, p.101.

==Career==
=== France and Holland; 1674-1688 ===
The 1638-1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] created strong resistance in Scotland and England to a [[Standing army|professional army]] and those who wanted a military career had to do so abroad.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chandler, David, Beckett Ian (editor)|first1=Childs, John|title=The Restoration Army in Oxford History Of The British Army|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0192803115|page=54|edition=2002}}</ref> Foreign soldiers were widely used in all armies; in 1672, 12 out of 58 French infantry battalions were recruited outside France, as were 9 of its 87 cavalry regiments.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Childs |first1=John |title=The British Brigade in France 1672-1678 |journal=History |date=1984 |volume=69 |issue=227 |page=386 |jstor=24419689 }}</ref> Loyalties were often based on religion or personal relationships, with officers moving between armies; French [[Henri_de_La_Tour_d'Auvergne,_Viscount_of_Turenne|Marshall Turenne]] (1611-1675), perhaps the best general of his time, served with the Dutch from 1625-1630.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turenne 1611-1675 |url=https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/turenne-1611-1675-2/ |website=Musée virtuel du Protestantisme |accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref>

In the 1670 [[Secret Treaty of Dover|Treaty of Dover]], [[Charles II of England]] agreed to support a French attack on the [[Dutch Republic]] and provide 6,000 troops for the French army. [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] paid him £230,000 per year for this, a secret provision not revealed until 1775.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kenyon |first1=JP |title=History Men |date=1983 |publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd |isbn=978-0297780816 |pages=67–68}}</ref> With the outbreak of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, Ramsay joined the Royal English Regiment, raised as part of the [[brigade]].

It proved impossible to replace losses from battle and disease, while service in the French military was extremely unpopular; of 500 men recruited for one regiment in 1678, 213 deserted within two months.<ref> Childs, The British Brigade in France 1672-1678, p. 388 </ref> The Brigade was formally dissolved and Ramsay transferred to the Anglo-Scots Brigade; this had served with the Dutch army since the late 16th century and normally contained three Scottish and three English regiments.

James went into exile on 23 December after his army deserted him and on 4 January 1689, William appointed the Scots Brigade senior officer [[Hugh_Mackay_(general)|Hugh Mackay]], commander in Scotland. Ramsay's regiment went with Mackay and after James landed in Ireland on 12 March, another former Scots Brigade officer, [[John Graham, Viscount Dundee]], launched a Scottish rising in his support. Despite their victory at [[Battle_of_Killiecrankie|Killiecrankie]] in July, Dundee's death and lack of reinforcements prevented the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] exploiting it; after their defeat at the [[Battle of Cromdale]] in May, 1690, the campaign largely focused on minor policing actions, carried out by locally-raised troops.<ref name="Mackay5">{{cite book |last=Mackay |first=Dr James |date=1999 |title=Scottish History |location=Bath |publisher=Parragon |pages=228–229 |isbn=0 75253 038 0|author-link= }}</ref>
