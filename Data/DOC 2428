== Plot ==
The film is set in a school near [[Rome]], and in a small mountain village of [[Abruzzo]]. The boys of the grammar school where teaches Professor Vincenzo Lipari, Italian teacher, are in serious crisis. The crisis, however, is not only that of a typical young adolescent: it is a real collective crisis that pushes young students to not studying, and caring of life, to believe in false ideals, and to get lost in the vortex of ignorance, that will not get them in any future. Vincenzo Lipari tries to help the guys, but also he is a frustrated like them, because they can not even organize a program of Italian lessons of the year. And so the man, trying to understand the new requirements youth, recalls his early school years: past, when teachers did not have to ask pupils to behave well in school, because it was all the opposite.
