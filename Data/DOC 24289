'''Media on demand''' (MOD) is a new generation of [[video on demand]], which not only allows users to watch/listen video and audio content like movies and TV shows, but also provides functions including real-time information, interactive games, attractions guidance, route information, advertising system, shopping & ordering service. Users can select content whenever they want, rather than having to watch it at a specific broadcast time.

In the transportation industry, media on demand technology was first applied by [[FUNTORO]], which offer media on demand as [[In-Vehicle Infotainment|in vehicle infotainment]] to bus & railway passengers through high-definition interactive monitors embedded in seatback or armrest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.computex.biz/computex2011_en/SourcingGuide_Detail.aspx?index=35431|title=COMPUTEX 2011 News Center|website=www.computex.biz|access-date=2018-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ubergizmo.com/2009/03/multimedia-on-demand-system/|title=Multimedia On Demand System|work=Ubergizmo|access-date=2018-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://funtoroglobal.com/mod-solution/|title=FUNTORO MOD Solution|last=|first=|date=2018-03-19|work=FUNTORO MOD|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref>

Some telecommunication companies offer media on demand service by transmitting digital signal to [[set-top box]] that is connected to television screen or another display devices of individual homes and users. Clients are required to pay a monthly fee to get access to a bundle of multimedia content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sogi.com.tw/talks/_%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%9F%E6%97%A5%E5%A0%B1_%E4%B8%AD%E8%8F%AF%E9%9B%BBMOD_%E8%A1%9D%E6%93%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%B7%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%A6%96%E6%A5%AD/4071035|title=【經濟日報】中華電MOD 衝擊有線電視業- SOGI手機王|website=SOGI手機王|access-date=2018-01-07}}</ref>
