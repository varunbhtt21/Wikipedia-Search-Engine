'''Kilpatrick Dun''' is an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[dun]], located about 1 mile south of the village of [[Blackwaterfoot]] on the [[Isle of Arran]] in [[Scotland]] ({{gbmapping|NR90652619}}).

==Description==
Kilpatrick Dun is situated on level ground on a northwesterly hill-slope.<ref name="rcahms1">{{Canmore |num=39637 |desc=Arran, Kilpatrick |access-date=2 May 2014}}</ref> It can be reached via a short walk from a small car park.<ref name="histscot">[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_019 Kilpatrick Dun (or Cashel)], Historic Scotland, accessed 2 May 2014</ref> The site is not well understood. In the past it has been proposed that it was a [[Bronze Age]] burial cairn or the site of an early Christian monastery.<ref name="histscot"/> However, it is now generally thought that the site was a fortified residence, or [[dun]], of a type common across the western Scotland in the later Iron Age.<ref name="histscot"/> A similar structure can be seen at the [[Torr a'Chaisteal]] dun 2.5 miles to the south.<ref name="histscot"/>

The circular dun measures 17 metres in diameter, within a wall more than 8 metres thick in places.<ref name="histscot"/> The entrance, 1.2 metres wide, is from the south.<ref name="histscot"/> There are four chambers visible in the wall thickness.<ref name="histscot"/>

The dun is surrounded by a large enclosure.<ref name="rcahms1"/> The enclosure is similar to the [[wikt:caiseal|cashel]] of an early Christian monastery, but the small rectangular structures built against the enclosure bank, on the far side from the dun, make more sense as a post-medieval [[croft (land)|croft]] or [[bothy]].<ref name="histscot"/>
