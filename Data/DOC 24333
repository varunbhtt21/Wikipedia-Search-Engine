Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''speedy keep''' per [[WP:SK#1]]. The nomination does not provide a valid, guideline- or policy-based rationale for deletion, all three !votes reflect this notion to various degrees, and nobody other than the nominator has recommended deletion.

*'''keep''' No discussion of its 'one sidedness' is evident in the edit history of this article.  The article is extensively documented.  Just because the article content might be disagreeable to someone or another is not a reason to even consider deletion of an article from WP. [[User:Hmains|Hmains]] ([[User talk:Hmains|talk]]) 04:59, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' - No valid rationale for deletion presented by nominator. Clear GNG pass from sources showing in the footnotes. If there is a content issue, deletion is not the answer. [[User:Carrite|Carrite]] ([[User talk:Carrite|talk]]) 06:22, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' Whether an article is biased or not is irrelevant to deletion policy. Bias can be fixed by editors; notability is a separate thing entirely, and this topic is notable. [[User:MezzoMezzo|MezzoMezzo]] ([[User talk:MezzoMezzo|talk]]) 04:26, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
