:* ''Comment'': [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Will_Straw&diff=606094323&oldid=297055952 Expanded from redirect on 27 April 2014]
<small>Created by [[User:Andrew Davidson|Andrew Davidson]] ([[User talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]). Self nominated at 21:32, 2 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The article exceeds 1,500 characters. Spot checking for copyvios reveals no problems. Every paragraph has at least one inline citation. The hook is cited in the article (I added an inline citation to a RS in the lead for this DYK). The article qualifies as new (5 days old or less) per it's creation from a redirect on 27 April 2014, relative to the date of this nomination. A quid pro quo review has been performed by the nominator.

::The only concern here is that the image of the Nutters may be perceived as too unrelated to the subject, because the subject apparently only posed with them once, and the subject does not appear to be in the image. Unless I'm mistaken here, I'd recommend nixing the image. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 09:17, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

:::* The recent news coverage which sparked this article was all about the subject and his defence of the [[Nutters]].  This coverage had plenty of pictures and details of the latter and, in the absence of a good photo of the subject, which we currently lack, a fresh photo of the Nutters seems appropriate.  If this aspect of the subject is not liked then the first hook might be used instead, as it has a different fact and no picture.

::::* Sorry to be a stickler, but the source in the article doesn't state that Straw supports the nutters. Hence, ALT1 isn't supported by a RS. It basically just states that he posed with them. While support is implied, it's not in the given source, and hooks must be supported by reliable sources, per point #3 of [[WP:WIADYK]]. All this said, simply omitting the image would qualify the original hook for DYK. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 01:54, 14 May 2014 (UTC) 
:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Good to go '''using the original hook, sans the image'''. <u>Important note to potential promoters</u>: I have commented out the image atop to avoid any confusion with this moving forward, per discussion herein about using the original hook sans the image.
