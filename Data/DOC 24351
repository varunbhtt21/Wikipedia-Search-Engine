The episode features [[cameo appearance|guest appearances]] by [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Carrie Fisher]]. In contrast to previous guest stars, Jones takes a liking to Sheldon ([[Jim Parsons]]) and the main plot is focused on the two having a night out together. Fisher appears when Jones suggests they [[Knock, Knock, Ginger|knock on her door and run away]]. The episode received high ratings and mainly positive reviews, with many complimenting the cameo appearances.

==Plot==
Leonard ([[Johnny Galecki]]), Sheldon, Raj ([[Kunal Nayyar]]) and Howard ([[Simon Helberg]]) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, waiting for [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] tickets to go on sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are disappointed that they will not be able to attend, especially as they had spent so much time on their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the [[Hulk]] as portrayed by [[Lou Ferrigno]], [[Eric Bana]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Mark Ruffalo]].

Sheldon decides to set up his own Comic-Con, and tries to convince several celebrities to appear, including [[Stan Lee]], [[Bill Nye|Bill Nye the Science Guy]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], and [[List of The Big Bang Theory characters#Wil Wheaton|Wil Wheaton]]. Since he has [[restraining orders]] from Lee, Nimoy, and Nye, he asks Leonard to contact them.<ref>

Unlike many celebrities Sheldon has met, James Earl Jones welcomes his company, and the two spend the night doing various activities; they go to an ice-cream parlor, a carnival, a strip club, and a sauna. Sheldon asks Jones questions about himself and he confirms that he was [[selective mutism|functionally mute]] for eight years, he was a [[pre-medical|pre-med]] in college, and that sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] used scuba equipment to create the sound of Darth Vader's breathing. They also sing at a karaoke club and prank Carrie Fisher by [[Knock, Knock, Ginger|knocking on her door and running away]]. At the end of the night, James Earl Jones learns that Sheldon and his friends failed to get Comic-Con tickets and invites them along as his guests.

Meanwhile, Leonard, Raj, and Howard attempt to solve their Comic-Con problem by illegally buying [[Ticket resale|scalped tickets]]. After arranging for a scalper to come to Leonard's apartment, they begin to get worried, remembering Sheldon's warning that they could get charged for petty theft, then have to disclose the crime in the future. When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.

Penny ([[Kaley Cuoco]]), Amy ([[Mayim Bialik]]) and Bernadette ([[Melissa Rauch]]) go for afternoon tea at a tea parlor in an attempt to feel more like adults. Once they arrive, they see that only mothers and their children are there; they decide to hit the lobby bar instead. They discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an adult is not necessarily a good thing.
