'''Author/Copyright Holder's Name:''' There is no copyright -- I created the image and I give it freely into the public domain for all eternity.

'''Article To Be Used On/Reason For Upload:''' "Banjo"  The reason is, the article is currently illustrated with a photo of a 5-string bluegrass banjo, but the tuning and range given are for a ''4-string, tenor banjo''.  This inconsistency would be confusing to a non-banjoist.  A search of wht Wiki commons did not turn up a by-string illustration of the correct tuning, therefore I created this image and wish to upload it.

Wiki rules for uploading images are very complex and unclear -- I still don't see where to upload the file.
