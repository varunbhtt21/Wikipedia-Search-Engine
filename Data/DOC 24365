[[William Blake Herron]], who will also executive-produce, wrote the pilot, which was directed by [[Peter O'Fallon]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://pressroom.turner.com/us/tnt/tnt-greenlights-agent-x |title=TNT Greenlights High-Octane Drama Agent X, Starring Jeff Hephner, Sharon Stone and Gerald McRaney |work= |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |location=Atlanta, Georgia |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]  |date=October 31, 2014 |accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
On Metacritic, the show holds a rating of 43/100, based on 15 reviews.<ref>{{Metacritic television|agent-x|Agent X - Season 1 Reviews}}</ref> On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 28% approval rating based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The critics' consensus reads: "Unintentionally hilarious, poorly paced, and overall redundant, ''Agent X'' is a secret agent drama that should have remained secret."<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes TV|agent-x/s01|Agent X: Season 1}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' said in a review of the series  "Without the jokey bravado (or high production values) of ''[[Strike Back (TV series)|Strike Back]]'' or the charming wonkiness of ''[[Warehouse 13]]'', the only claim ''Agent X'' has on our attention is [[Sharon Stone|Ms. Stone]]. Even that is tenuous — while her performance loosens up a bit across the first four episodes, her screen time appears to shrink."<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|author=Hale, Mike|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/arts/television/review-agent-x-with-sharon-stone-and-a-spy.html?_r=0|title=Review: 'Agent X,' With Sharon Stone and a Spy|date=November 6, 2015}}</ref>

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote in their review "Possessing some of the flavor of ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]'', ''Agent X'' takes the amusing step of investing the Vice President's office with secret constitutional powers, all for the purpose of concocting a [[Yankee]] version of [[James Bond]]. And wonder of wonders, it mostly works, at least initially, combining a sense of playfulness with bountiful action and, less successfully, a sweeping conspiracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/reviews/agent-x-review-sharon-stone-jeff-hephner-tnt-1201626727/ |title=TV Review: 'Agent X' |last=Lowry, Brain |date=November 5, 2015 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called ''Agent X'' an "improbable but high-action [[thriller (genre)|thriller]]." Also saying "This light and fast-moving version of an America-in-peril [[espionage]] thriller doesn’t really deal in moral ambiguity and shades of gray."<ref>{{cite web|title='Agent X' TV Review: Espionage Gone Wild|author=Smith, Nancy deWolf|date=November 5, 2015|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/agent-x-tv-review-espionage-gone-wild-1446765172}}</ref>
