Head pressing is usually a sign of a neurological disorder, especially of the forebrain (e.g., [[prosencephalon]] disease),<ref>http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/neurological/c_multi_headpressing</ref> or of toxicity due to liver damage, such as [[portosystemic shunt]] and [[hepatic encephalopathy]].<ref name="FaerberDVM1999">{{cite book|author1=Cody W.

===Liver neurotoxicity===
A [[liver shunt]] is a congenital or acquired condition that may lead to toxicity and head pressing. Additional symptoms include drooling and slow maturation early in development. Older animals may suffer from liver cirrhosis.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Viral causes===
Several viruses that cause [[encephalitis]] or [[meningoencephalitis]] can lead to the neurological sign of head pressing, see for example [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] and [[Bovine herpesvirus 5]].<ref name="McVeyKennedy2013">{{cite book|author1=D.
