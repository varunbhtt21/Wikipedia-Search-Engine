[[Lieutenant-General]] '''James Douglas''' (1645–1691) was a Scottish military officer who served successively with the French army and the Dutch [[Scots Brigade]], was appointed Commander in Chief for Scotland by [[James II]] and held senior commands under [[William III of England|William III]] in the 1689–1691 [[Williamite War in Ireland]]. He died of fever at [[Namur]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1691 during the [[Nine Years War]].

==Life==
James Douglas was the second son of James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Queensberry (c.&nbsp;1610{{snd}}1671) and his wife Lady Margaret Stewart. The Earl signed the 1638 [[National Covenant]] and took little part in the 1639–1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]; arrested in 1645 for attempting to join [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose's]] Royalist campaign, he was released after paying a fine.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Le Neve |first1=John |title=Memoirs British and Foreign, of the Lives and Families of the Most Illustrious Persons |date=1712 |publisher=Arkose Press |isbn=978-1345713763 |page=456 |edition=2015 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d31bAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA456&lpg=PA456&dq=treves+1675#v=onepage&q=treves%201675&f=false |accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> The Douglas family largely retained its position and estates throughout the various changes of regime in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sy5JAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA637&dq=Douglas+family+earls+of+queensberry+estates#v=onepage&q=Douglas%20family%20earls%20of%20queensberry%20estates&f=false|title=Scotland and Ireland|volume=2|first=John |last=Debrett|page=637|publisher=F. C. and J. Rivington and others|year=1814}}</ref>

James qualified as an [[advocate]] in 1665, but in 1672 he joined [[William Lockhart of Lee|Sir William Lockhart]]'s Regiment, part of an Anglo-Scots force detached to the French Army between 1672 and 1674. His younger brothers John (1647–1675) and Robert (1650–1676) also became army officers; John was killed at [[Trier]] serving with the [[Royal Scots|Régiment de Douglas]] in 1675, while Robert died in 1676, during the recapture of [[Maastricht]] by the Dutch.<ref name="Le Neve, p.456">Le Neve, p.456.</ref>

As a result of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], many in both Scotland and England viewed standing armies as a threat to individual liberty and society itself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=John|title=The British Army of William III, 1689-1702|date=1987|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0719025525|page=184|edition=1990}}</ref> Those who wanted a military career joined units in foreign service, such as the French [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]] or the Dutch [[Scots Brigade]]. Loyalties were often based on religion or personal relationships, with officers moving between armies; [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne|Marshall Turenne]] (1611–1675), considered the greatest French general of his time, was a Protestant who served in the Dutch army from 1625 to 1630.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turenne 1611-1675 |url=https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/turenne-1611-1675-2/ |website=Musée virtuel du Protestantisme |accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref> 
[[File:1st Viscount Dundee.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham, Viscount Dundee]]; a former colleague who became an opponent]]
In the 1670 [[Secret Treaty of Dover|Treaty of Dover]], England agreed an alliance with France against the [[Dutch Republic]], and the supply of 6,000 troops for the French army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lynn |first1=John |title=The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667-1714 (Modern Wars In Perspective) |date=1996 |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0582056299 |pages=109–110}}</ref> The Treaty contained a number of secret provisions, only revealed in 1771, including payment of £230,000 per year by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] for use of this Brigade.<ref>J. P. Kenyon, ''The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68.</ref>

On the outbreak of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, James Douglas was appointed Captain in [[William Lockhart of Lee|Sir William Lockhart]]'s Regiment, which formed part of the expeditionary force for a proposed landing in the Dutch Republic. When this plan was cancelled in 1673, Lockhart's joined the rest of the Brigade in the [[Rhineland]], under the command of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], Charles' illegitimate son.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Childs |first1=John |title=The British Brigade in France 1672-1678 |journal=History |date=1984 |volume=69 |issue=227 |page=388 |jstor=24419689 }}</ref> However, the alliance with Catholic France was deeply unpopular and England withdrew from the war with the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/europeantreaties02daveuoft |page=238|title=European Treaties bearing on the History of the United States and its Dependencies|year=1917|authorlink=Frances Gardiner Davenport|first=Frances|last=Davenport|accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref>

The [[Franco-Dutch War]] continued and to keep his French subsidies, Charles encouraged members of the Brigade to remain in French service; many did so, among them Monmouth and [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill, future Duke of Marlborough]]. Others enrolled in the Dutch Scots Brigade, including Douglas and a fellow officer in Lockhart's Regiment, [[John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee|John Graham, later Viscount Dundee]].<ref name="Linklater">{{cite journal |last1=Linklater |first1=Magnus |title=Graham, John, first viscount of Dundee [''known as'' Bonnie Dundee] |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/11208 |year=2004 }}</ref>

The Scots Brigade had served in the Dutch army since the 1580s; despite the name, it normally contained several English regiments, which were withdrawn in 1672 but restored in 1674. Over the years, the Scots regiments had lost much of their national identity and a deliberate policy was now adopted to re-establish this by recruiting in Scotland.<ref>{{cite book |author=Miggelbrink Joachim |editor1=McKilliop, Andrew |editor2=Murdoch, Steve |title=Fighting for Identity: Scottish Military Experiences c. 1550-1900 |date=2002 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-9004128231 |pages=91–92 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Tc4stZF9hY8C&pg=PA91&dq=Mackay}}</ref> James joined Colyear's Regiment, as did his brother Robert, killed at Maastricht in 1676; a Lieutenant-Colonel when the war ended in August 1678, he was promoted Colonel in March 1680.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dalton |first1=Charles |title=The Scots Army 1661-1688 |date=1909 |publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode |location=London & Edinburgh |page=78}}</ref>

During the [[Covenanter]] rebellion of June, 1679, Douglas was in Scotland and he took part in the [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]] that ended it. He was awarded the lands of Patrick Murdock of Cumloden, one of those convicted for their participation; the grant was confirmed in April 1685.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ratification in favour of Colonel James Douglas and Robert Barton |url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?a=fcf&fn=jamesvii_trans&id=47208&t=trans |website=Parliamentary Register |accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>

The complex mix of loyalties during this period is shown by his connections to the Catholic [[George Douglas, 1st Earl of Dumbarton|George Douglas, later Earl of Dumbarton]], Colonel of the 'Régiment de Douglas,' later the [[Royal Scots]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Offen|first1=Lee|title=Dumbarton's Regiment|url=http://historyreconsidered.net/Dumbarton_Regiment_1660_1746.html|website=Historyreconsidered.net|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref> From its formation in 1633 to 1679, this was chiefly employed by France and James' younger brother John was serving with it when he died at [[Trier]] in 1675. Without a standing army, units like Dumbartons and the Scots Brigade were an important source of military professionals for the English Crown, which took an interest in the appointment of officers and also controlled recruitment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Glozier |first1=Mathew |title=Scottish Soldiers in France in the Reign of the Sun King: Nursery for Men of Honour |date=2004 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-9004138650 |page=192 }}</ref>

Scottish politics in the 1680s was dominated by his elder brother, the [[William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], who was appointed [[Treasurer of Scotland]] in 1682.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/7936|last1=Ford |first1=JD |title=Douglas, William, first duke of Queensberry (1637–1695) |journal=Oxford DNB |date=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/7936 |accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref> James returned to Scotland permanently in June 1684, after his elder brother persuaded the [[George Livingston, 3rd Earl of Linlithgow|Earl of Linlithgow]] to relinquish his position as Colonel of the [[Scots Guards|Scots Footguards]] in his favour.<ref name="Dalton, p.51">Dalton, p.51.</ref> Queensberry's need for a reliable, Protestant subordinate was driven by several factors, one being his feud with Dundee, a favourite of the future James II and now the chief military power in Scotland.<ref name="Linklater"/>

In addition, many politicians were increasingly concerned by Catholic influence in the military, heightened by events in early 1684, when [[English Tangier]] was abandoned; apart from the expense, Parliament was concerned it was a 'nursery for Popish soldiers.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cannon |first1=Richard |title=Historical Record of the First, or Royal Regiment of Foot: Containing an Account of the Origin of the Regiment in the Reign of King James VI of Subsequent Services to 1846 |date=1846 |publisher=Forgotten Books |page=67 |edition=2012 |url=https://archive.org/stream/historicalreco00cann#page/67/mode/1up}}</ref> Under an administrative loophole, troops classed as 'garrisons' were largely exempt from Parliamentary control; all three Tangier regiments were given this designation on their return to England in early 1684 and remained in being.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Childs |first1=John |title=General Percy Kirke and the Later Stuart Army |date=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1441158826 |pages=62–63}}</ref>

James II succeeded Charles in April 1685 with widespread support in both countries; the 1681 Scottish [[Test Act]] required all public officials and MPs to swear unconditional loyalty to the monarch, 'regardless of religion,' but with the crucial qualifier that they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.'<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Harris|editor-first1=Tim|editor-last2=Taylor|editor-first2=Stephen|title=The Final Crisis of the Stuart Monarchy|date=2015|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-1783270446|page=122}}</ref> The religious conflicts of the 17th century meant most Scots saw both dissident Presbyterians and Catholics as threats and opposed 'tolerance' for either, one reason why [[Argyll's Rising]] collapsed so quickly in June 1685.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Tim|title=Revolution; the Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685-1720|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0141016528|pages=153–157}}</ref>     
[[File:Namur JPG7.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Citadel of Namur]], on the [[Meuse River|Meuse]], where Douglas died in 1691]]
He played an active role in the suppression of Argyll's Rising; the [[Tweedsmuir]] cemetery contains a memorial to John Hunter, ''cruelly murdered at Core Head by Col. James Douglas and his party for his adherence to the Word of God and Scotland’s Covenanted Work of Reformation 1685.''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dumfries and Galloway Council |title=The Killing Times |url=https://www.southernuplandway.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/thekillingtimes.pdf |website=Southern Upland Way |accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref> In October, [[William Drummond, 1st Viscount Strathallan|William Drummond, Viscount Strathallan]] was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, Scotland]], with James as Master-General of the Ordnance.<ref name="Dalton, p.74">Dalton, p.74.</ref>

After Strathallan died in March 1688, Douglas assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief but it is not clear whether he was ever officially appointed as such and operational control was largely exercised by Dundee.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Childs |first1=John |title=The Williamite Wars in Ireland |date=2008 |publisher=Bloomsbury 3PL |isbn=978-1847251640 |pages=232–234}}</ref> In 1685, many supported James from fear of civil war if he were bypassed; by July 1688, anti-Catholic riots made it seem only his removal could prevent one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wormsley|first1=David|title=James II: The Last Catholic King|date=2015|publisher=Allen Lane|isbn=978-0141977065|page=189}}</ref>

The Scottish army was brought south to join the rest of James' forces after [[William III of England|William of Orange]] landed in [[Brixham]] on 5 November, but his troops deserted and he went into exile on 23 December.<ref name="Harris, p.3-5">Harris, pp. 3-5.</ref> [[Hugh Mackay (general)|Hugh Mackay]], another former Scots Brigade colleague, replaced Douglas as Commander in Scotland.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macpherson |first1=James |title=Original Papers: Containing the Secret History of Great Britain |date=1775 |publisher=Hansebooks |isbn=978-3-7434-3572-8 |pages=357–358 |edition=2017}}</ref>

In March, 1689, James II launched the 1689–1691 [[Williamite War in Ireland]] and Douglas joined the Williamite army led by [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Frederick Schomberg]]. He was entrusted with a number of independent commands, although William was generally reluctant to entrust English or Scots officers with senior positions, regarding them as less trustworthy or competent than the Dutch or Germans.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler, David (ed), Beckett, Ian (ed) |first1=Childs, John (author) |title=The Restoration Army 1660-1702 in The Oxford History of the British Army |date=1994 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0192803115 |page=64 |edition=1996}}</ref> He was considered a good soldier, but Schomberg found him hard to work with and he had a reputation as a [[Martinet#In English|martinet]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Childs |first1=John |title=The Williamite Wars in Ireland |date=2008 |publisher=Bloomsbury 3PL |location=London |isbn=978-1847251640 |page=232 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7PPUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=death+of+philip+babington+1690#v=onepage&q=death%20of%20philip%20babington%201690&f=false |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref> He led a Brigade at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and the [[Siege of Athlone (1690)|First Siege of Athlone]], then was posted to [[Spanish Netherlands]] in May 1691, along with [[Percy Kirke]] and Sir John Lanier. This was allegedly a combination of personal animosities, while all three were also accused of indiscriminately looting the goods of those who had already submitted, Catholic and Protestant alike.<ref name="Dalton, p.85">Dalton, p.85.</ref>

All three were dead within a year; Douglas died of disease at [[Namur]] in July 1691, Kirke at [[Brussels]] in October and Lanier was killed at [[Battle of Steenkerque|Steenkerque]] in August 1692.<ref name="Dalton, p.86">Dalton, p.86.</ref> He was succeeded as Colonel of the Foot Guards by [[George Ramsay (English Army officer)|George Ramsay]], another former Scots Brigade colleague.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colonels in the 3rd Regiment of Footguards |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/britishinfantry/scotsguardscolonels.htm |website=British Empire |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref>
