Title : Passive fluency
Text : {{Orphan|date=March 2015}}

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.<ref>{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 | doi= 10.17730/humo.47.4.c23234600v728641 }}</ref> Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).<ref name = "basham">{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.115.5492 }}</ref>

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.<ref name = "basham" />

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}</ref> This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}</ref>
