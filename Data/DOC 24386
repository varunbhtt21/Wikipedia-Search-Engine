:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Date, size, neutral, references, everything seems fine. However, you must review another DYK nomination. [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 23:15, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I thought that didn't apply to the first DYK? I have never nominated one before. [[User:Philafrenzy|Philafrenzy]] ([[User talk:Philafrenzy|talk]]) 23:39, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Yes, that is correct. You should have clarified that, it's unlikely that someone would realize that on his own. [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 03:04, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
