== Mission ==

<blockquote>To prepare BD Army for war and be the architect of its future.<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

== History ==
In the past, the Military Training (MT) Directorate at Army Headquarters (AHQ) was responsible for carrying out different types of research works related to training of the Bangladesh Army. However, due to limited resources and a manpower shortage, they couldn't do any comprehensive research and study in the field of doctrine and development.

To strengthen the research and development capability for strategic, operational, tactical and technological enhancement, and to keep up with continual changes in the complexities of the battlefield scenario, rapid technological advancement Bangladesh Army raised ARTDOC on 25 July 2007 to develop its training and operational standards with special emphasis on research and development in the related fields.<ref name=":0" />
