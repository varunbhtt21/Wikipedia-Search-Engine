'''''Lecciones y Ensayos''''' is a biannual [[law review]] run by university students and published by the [[University of Buenos Aires]] School of Law since 1956.<ref name=index>[http://www.derecho.uba.ar/publicaciones/lye/index.php Revista Lecciones y Ensayos] ''website of the University of Buenos Aires School of Law''.</ref>

== History ==
The journal was established in 1956 by [[Ignacio Winizky]], director of the Publication Department of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] School of Law.<ref name=index2>[http://www.derecho.uba.ar/publicaciones/lye/pub_lye_historia.php Historia de la Revista Lecciones y Ensayos] en ''sitio de la Facultad de Derecho (UBA)''.</ref>

With the constitutional breakdown of 1976, the journal went through a period during which its publishing activity was not in charge of students. In 1983, with the return to democracy, the fundamental principles laid down by Ignacio Winizky were restored, and the journal was again run by the students of the School of Law.
