No coverage in reliable sources other than passing mentions.  No indications of any awards or anything else that would elevate her to [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:FILMMAKER]]. [[User:John from Idegon|John from Idegon]] ([[User talk:John from Idegon|talk]]) 22:07, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''.  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called her a [http://variety.com/gallery/photos-10-tv-scribes-to-watch/ "TV writer to watch"] in their top ten list. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 22:33, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''  Passing mentions such as the one mentioned above are all you can find on her.  That means she is not notable. [[User:John from Idegon|John from Idegon]] ([[User talk:John from Idegon|talk]]) 22:53, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''  800 words [estimated] and a portrait photograph is not by any definition a "passing mention." Her imdb listing, detailing a rather extensive body of work in just 6 years, isn't a passing mention either. [[User:Bustter|Bustter]] ([[User talk:Bustter|talk]]) 17:31, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. She created a series for CW, a minor network, after a term as primary staff on a highly successful major network series [which netted her Writer's Guild Award nominations in each of the past 5 years] -- her career trajectory alone, based on verifiable credentials, makes her notable. You aren't likely to see a lot of press for her from her time on staff of The Good Wife because only the show runners [in this case, Robert and Michelle King] are customarily permitted to discuss the show's creative aspects. Star-Crossed -- which is a pretty bad teen soap -- is likely to be cancelled, but her career is mostly ahead of her.[[User:Bustter|Bustter]] ([[User talk:Bustter|talk]]) 17:22, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' As a part of an article discussing several other folks, yes, the ''Variety'' thing most certainly is a "passing mention".  It is NOT an article primarily devoted to her.  And there is not one thing in the entry above that bestows notability.  Notability comes from substantial coverage in reliable sources, not from being "good" at something, or even less from having the potential to be good at something. In a strange sort of way, notability is a "popularity contest".  Not one where the person's popularity among fans or Wikipedia editors matter, but where there popularity with the media does.  Her career trajectory, whatever that means, does not bestow notability.  Coverage by reliable sources is what notability is all about. Show me some coverage, to paraphrase a movie.

*'''Weak keep'''. The ''Variety'' article is relatively brief but it is substantive and makes an explicit claim for her prominence.   As the creator of a broadcast network series, and the recipient of multiple coverage, I think there's enough here to sustain an article. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 20:02, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per above. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 01:39, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
