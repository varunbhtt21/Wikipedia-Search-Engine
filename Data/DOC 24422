'''Running Strong for American Indian Youth''', or just Running Strong, is a non-profit organization that was co-founded by Olympic Gold Medalist [[Billy Mills]], along with Gene Krizek, founder of Christian Relief Services Charities. Running Strong, also known as American Indian Youth Running Strong, Inc., operates under the [[umbrella]] of Christian Relief Services Charities with the mission “to help American Indian people meet their immediate survival needs – food, [[water]], and shelter – while implementing and supporting programs designed to create opportunities for self-sufficiency and self-esteem.”

== History ==

Running Strong for American Indian Youth was co-founded in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaO3jsaGkeYC&pg=PA433&lpg=PA433&dq=running+strong+for+american+indian+youth&source=bl&ots=ebjnQhei6n&sig=8lUJrCT7LncQQhYkx9cCJNVoTpw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MvA-U-O5DJbMsQSXioH4Bg&ved=0CF4Q6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&q=running%20strong%20for%20american%20indian%20youth&f=false|last= Clauss Ehlers|first=Caroline (ed.)| title= Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology, Volume 1| publisher=Springer|page=433 }}</ref> by Gene Krizek, and Billy Mills (Oglala Lakota), the only American to have won a gold medal in the 10,000 meter race, which he won at the 1964 Tokyo Summer Games. Mills, who is Running Strong’s national spokesperson, started the charity as a “giveaway” to give back to the community that helped him succeed, as per Lakota tradition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shannon|first=Susan| date= 2014-04-21| title=Olympic Gold Turns Into a Lifetime Of Giving Back |url= http://kgou.org/post/olympic-gold-turns-lifetime-giving-back|newspaper=KGOU|accessdate=2014-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCdWdYgublAC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=lakota+giveaway+tradition&source=bl&ots=kiXU_PQ86R&sig=jRZYuD8hkKIMIapTKxzdk28kS24&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wh0_U6zICe7QsQTYtIHIBQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=lakota%20giveaway%20tradition&f=false |last= Pickering|first=Kathleen Ann|title=Lakota Culture, World Economy |publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=57–58}}</ref> Mills was awarded the 2012 [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by [[Barack Obama]], the second-highest civilian award in the United States, in recognition of his service to help American Indian families through Running Strong for American Indian Youth.<ref>{{cite news |author= Office of the Press Secretary |title= President Obama to Honor Recipients of the 2012 Citizens Medal |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/08/president-obama-honor-recipients-2012-citizens-medal |newspaper= The White House |date= 2013-02-08 |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}</ref>

Running Strong is governed by a five-member, Native American-majority Board of Directors.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://indianyouth.org/about-us/staff-and-board| title=Our Staff and Board|publisher=Running Strong for American Indian Youth}}</ref> Its work began primarily in the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]], and the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]], all in South Dakota. Running Strong started its work with programs focused on food and nutrition, women’s health, education, and seasonal needs. Gradually, its services expanded to serve other American Indian communities.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://indianyouth.org/about-us/mission-history|title=Mission & History|publisher=Running Strong for American Indian Youth}}</ref> However, Running Strong has continued to do much of its work on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, as that is where Billy Mills grew up.<ref>{{cite web|author= OLYMADMen|title=Billy Mills|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mi/billy-mills-1.html|publisher=SR/Olympic Sports |accessdate= 2014-05-02 }}</ref>
