She studied music at a local UK college and went on to study business management at the [[University of East London]].<ref name="punchng1"/> In an interview with Lanre Odukoya of ''[[Thisday]]'', Shay said that her mother wasn't a staunch supporter of her musical ambitions. Moreover, her mother wanted her to become a doctor or lawyer.<ref name="The Sun "/> Prior to departing the Earth, her mother told her to focus on her music career and put God first.<ref name="thisdaylive1"/>

Her music career took an upswing when she signed her first ever record deal with No Apology, a record company affiliated with [[George Martin]] (commonly referred to as the "[[Fifth Beatle]]").<ref name="The Sun "/> In 2006, Shay formed a girl band in the UK called Boadicea; they were managed by Ron Tom, the founder and manager of [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]] and [[Sugababes]]. The band separated after two years, and Shay decided to partake in the From Above UK singing audition. After the conclusion of the audition, she emerged as the lead vocalist for the now defunct girl group From Above. The group inked a record deal with Mathew Knowles' management company after performing for him. They were taken to Houston to undergo energetic vocal and dance trainings.
