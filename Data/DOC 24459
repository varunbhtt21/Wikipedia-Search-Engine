The '''U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance''' is an alliance of agriculture related interest groups and organizations that promote [[Intensive farming|industrial agriculture]] in the United States. Their aim is to promote a positive image of [[intensive farming|modern agricultural practices]].  They are supported by [[Commodity checkoff program|checkoff funds]] from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and by cooperate donations. The alliance has been criticized for a bias towards corporate agricultural practices.

==Origin and aims==
The alliance was created in October 2010<ref name=agw /> as a coalition of many of the United States largest agricultural groups (e.g., [[National Corn Growers Association]] and [[National Pork Producers Council]]) to counter publicity that the alliance believed was not in the best interest of agriculture. The alliance has been concerned with the release of videos showing the mistreatment of pigs, chickens put into [[battery cage]]s to lay eggs, [[chicken|chicks]] tossed into [[meat grinder]]s, close confinement of [[livestock]], and the use of [[hormone]]s and [[antibiotic]]s in [[Fodder|feed]]. They are also concerned with negative publicity [[crop]] farmers have received from organizations opposed to [[Genetically modified food|biotech crops]] and the overuse of [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s.<ref name=Crumb>{{cite news|last=Crumb|first=Michael J.|title=Farmers create new alliance to fight bad publicity|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9L36QUO0.htm|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=1 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Moskin|first=Julia|title=In Debate About Food, a Monied New Player|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/dining/in-debate-about-food-a-monied-new-player.html|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 September 2011}}</ref>

Their view is that a [[utopia]]n world without [[genetically modified food]], pesticides, and fertilizers is not feasible if the goal is to feed the world. The alliance's aim is to show the food consumer that a less than perfect world is reasonable.<ref name=Crumb/> They believe that the vast majority of people who do not live in rural areas of America are misinformed about how food is produced.<ref name=NYT/> On their view, non-rural people have been misled into believing that all pesticide, fertilizer, and antibiotic uses in agriculture are harmful; their aim is to show the consumer that this is not true.<ref name=NYT/>

==Management==
In 2011, its annual budget of $11,000,000 came in large part from marketing fees or checkoffs from the United States Department of Agriculture.  These mandatory fees are paid by farmers after they sell their products.<ref name=NYT/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=8_caCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA687|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Food Issues|first=Ken|last=Albala|date=27 March 2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books}}</ref> In June 2018 Erin Fitzgerald was named CEO of the alliance,<ref name=agw>{{cite web|url=https://www.agweb.com/article/erin-fitzgerald-will-lead-us-farmers--ranchers-alliance-as-ceo/|title=Erin Fitzgerald Will Lead U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance as CEO|website=AgWeb - The Home Page of Agriculture}}</ref> taking over from Randy Krotz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/lab-meat-wording-1.4712839|title=Ranchers and vegans in war of words over what to call lab-grown meat |publisher=CBC News}}</ref> Krotz had been hired as the alliance’s first CEO in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agweb.com/article/randy-krotz-no-longer-ceo-of-us-farmers-and-ranchers-alliance/|title=Randy Krotz No Longer CEO of U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance|website=AgWeb - The Home Page of Agriculture}}</ref> The Chairman of the alliance’s Board of Directors is Charles Bowling, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.somdnews.com/independent/spotlight/we-want-every-farmer-to-tell-their-story-newburg-farmer/article_89a33ec5-d37b-5b77-933e-a087faf9a8ca.html|title='We want every farmer to tell their story,' Newburg farmer says|first=Paul Lagasse|last=plagasse@somdnews.com|website=SoMdNews.com}}</ref> former president of the [[National Corn Growers Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lancasterfarming.com/news/southern_edition/maryland-farmer-appointed-chair-of-us-farmers-ranchers-alliance/article_68a68772-7d3a-55b5-a74f-657dffe6ac66.html|title=Maryland Farmer Appointed Chair of US Farmers & Ranchers Alliance|first=Shelby Watson-Hampton, Maryland|last=Correspondent|website=Lancaster Farming}}</ref> Prior to Bowling the Chairman had been Brad Greenway. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agweb.com/article/usfras-brad-greenway-helps-farmers-find-their-voice/|title=USFRA’s Brad Greenway Helps Farmers Find Their Voice|website=AgWeb - The Home Page of Agriculture}}</ref>

==Activities==
Checkoff funds from the United States Department of Agriculture cannot be used to [[Lobbying in the United States|lobby]] government. In 2010, the USDA ruled that the alliance could only use checkoff funds for specific projects and activities.<ref name=Bloomberg/> Their website contains qualitative information on crop cultivation, livestock care, and the general lives of farmers in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=OcSlDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA113|title=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Complete Food and Nutrition Guide, 5th Ed|first=Roberta Larson|last=Duyff|date=18 April 2017|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|via=Google Books}}</ref> 

In 2011, the alliance commissioned a survey of farmers, ranchers, and consumers.<ref name=Aubrey>{{cite news|last=Aubrey|first=Allison|title=Farmers And Ranchers Reach Out To Talk To Consumers|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/09/22/140703300/farmers-and-ranchers-reach-out-to-talk-to-consumers|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=NPR|date=22 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=UC>{{cite news|last=Harper|first=John M.|title=US Farmers & Ranchers Alliance Survey Show Disconect Between American Consumers and Their Food|url=http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=5830|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California|date=22 September 2013}}</ref> A total of 2,417 consumers and 1,002 farmers and ranchers were surveyed. Seventy-two percent of consumers said that they knew little or nothing about farming or ranching and 86% of farmers and ranchers believed that consumers knew little or nothing about farming.<ref name=Aubrey/><ref name=UC/> Forty-two percent of consumers believed that food production was heading in the wrong direction, while 58% of farmers and ranchers believed that consumers have an inaccurate perception of farming and ranching.<ref name=Aubrey/><ref name=UC/>

With the aim of bridging the gap between consumers and farmers, the alliance launched a search in June 2012 for a national spokesperson. Will Gilmer, of [[Lamar County, Alabama]] was selected. He received a $10,000 stipend to defray the cost of spending time away from his farm and he had the opportunity to select an agricultural related charity for a $5,000 donation from the alliance.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=Sulligent farmer is national emissary:  Dairyman to help explain farmers' role to consumers|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20130123/news/130129946|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=Tuscaloosa News|date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

The alliance funded the making of a [[documentary film]], ''[[Farmland (film)|Farmland]]'', that opened in select theaters in the United States on May 1, 2014. The aim of the documentary was to counter the messages about modern agriculture in recent documentaries such as ''[[Food, Inc.]]'' and ''[[King Corn (film)|King Corn]]''. They hired [[James Moll]] as director who agreed to do it only if he had creative control.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ragusea|first=Adam|title=Agribusiness Funds 'Farmland' To Counter Hollywood Message|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/05/02/308066437/agribusiness-funds-farmland-to-counter-hollywood-message|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=NPR|date=2 May 2014}}</ref>

In 2016 the alliance founded the non-profit U.S. Farming and Ranching Foundation, which furthers agricultural education, particularly among the youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.capitalpress.com/nation_world/nation/u-s-farmers-and-ranchers-alliance-launches-new-ag-education/article_7340e3b4-74da-5ab8-9192-320850f29e66.html|title=U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance launches new ag education effort|first=Carol Ryan|last=Dumas|website=capitalpress.com}}</ref> One of the main activities of the alliance are “food dialogues”, of which it ran around thirty between 2010 and 2018.<ref name=agw /> The intention of the dialogues is to promote debate over issues, including some that are considered controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://grist.org/factory-farms/2011-09-26-whos-behind-the-u-s-farmers-ranchers-alliance-and-why-it-m/|title=Who’s behind the U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance and why it matters|date=27 September 2011|publisher=}}</ref> Some of the alliance’s messages promote the use of technology to create food sustainability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2016/12/31/take-a-look-at-how-technology-makes-smart-and-sustainble-farming/|title=Take A Look At How Technology Makes Smart And Sustainable Farming|first=Jennifer|last=Hicks|website=Forbes}}</ref>

==Criticism==
In 2011, Bill Deusing, head of the [[Northeast Organic Farming Association]] has criticized the alliance for not including enough organic farming representatives.<ref name=NYT/>

The alliance has been criticized potential bias towards [[Big Ag]],<ref name=Bloomberg>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Andrew|title=Beyond 'Got Milk': Small Farmers Don't Like Where Their Ad Money Is Going|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-29/beyond-got-milk-small-farmers-dont-like-where-their-ad-money-is-going|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=29 January 2014}}</ref> and that its website tends to support industrial agriculture such as genetically modified crops, while questioning the value of alternative agricultural practices (e.g., [[Pastured poultry|free-range chickens]]).<ref name=Bloomberg/> Randy Krotz, previous [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]) of the alliance, told ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' that the alliance does not favor one form of agriculture over another and that "My personal feeling is, there is a lot of information there on every side of agriculture."<ref name=Bloomberg/>

Robert Lawrence of [[Johns Hopkins University]] wrote in a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' blog that criticized the alliance for its stance on the use of antibiotics in animal foods in agriculture.<ref name=HP>{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=Robert|title=Antibiotic Resistance: How Industrial Agriculture Lies With Statistics|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-lawrence/antibiotic-resistance_b_3996975.html|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>
