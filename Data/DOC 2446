'''''Listen''''' is the fourth studio album by British rock band [[The Kooks]]. It was released on 8 September 2014 through [[Universal Music Group|Universal]].<ref name="NME Listen">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-kooks/76889 |title=The Kooks announce new album 'Listen' |work=[[NME]] |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> It is the band's first album to feature new drummer Alexis Nunez who joined in 2012, replacing Paul Garred. The album was preceded by singles "[[Down (The Kooks song)|Down]]", "Around Town", "Bad Habit" and "Forgive & Forget".

Stylistically, the album differs from the band's previous work as elements of [[jazz]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] were added into the music. This album also marks the first time [[Tony Hoffer]] did not produce the band's work. Instead production was handled by Inflo with the band's lead singer and main songwriter Luke Pritchard as co-producer.

''Listen'' was the band's first album in three years, with ''[[Junk of the Heart]]'' being released in September 2011. The album was recorded in [[Los Angeles]] and [[London]].

Upon its release, ''Listen'' debuted at No. 16 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and failed to meet the commercial expectations set forth by the band's previous work.<ref name="UK"/>

==Recording==
The album started to take shape after frontman Luke Pritchard wrote "Around Town" without being sure if it was meant to be for the band. According to Pritchard, "It was like a catalyst. I didn’t know if it was going to be a Kooks [song] or if it was going to be a side thing, because it seemed so different. It was like electric church music. I’d written that before I’d even met Inflo, and then he heard it and said, ‘Okay, we can cross-pollinate here musically’. Everything stemmed from it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-kooks-interview-theyve-returned-in-their-own-way-9219027.html|title=The Kooks interview: They've returned in their own way|first=Elisa|last=Bray|publisher=The Independent|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>

Pritchard found Inflo, a 25-year-old London-based hip hop producer previously known for his work with [[The Saturdays]] and [[Tulisa]], via Soundcloud.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen">{{cite web|last1=Bedian|first1=Knar|title=Interview: The Kooks Talk "Listen"|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-the-kooks-talk-listen/|website=Sound of Boston|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> "I had written 'Around Town' and I thought maybe for the beat I might want to bring in someone from hip hop," said Pritchard.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/> The two artists were both looking to work with someone new and "looking to get out of the bullshit" of the music industry.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/> "Forgive and Forget" was the first song they wrote together.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/> Pritchard has described Inflo as a "a young Quincy Jones."<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/>

"With this record we didn't do any rehearsing beforehand. I'd write a song with Inflo or on my own, put it up and we'd all play over it. There was a real freedom to the process," said Pritchard regarding the recording process.<ref name="Clash">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/listen-the-kooks-down |title=Listen: The Kooks - Down |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |first=Robin |last=Murray |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="ContactMusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/press/the-kooks-return-with-new-single-down-available-april-20-listen |title=The Kooks Return With New Single 'Down,' Available April 20 [Listen] |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]] |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> 
"To me this album is about pure expression. Even the way we made the album felt fresh. Rather than us just being a band in a room, playing our guitars with the vocal over the top, which is what we'd always done before, we were really listening to what was going on around us, picking up ideas. The whole thing was much more natural."<ref name="Digital Spy">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a566379/the-kooks-confirm-new-album-listen-single-around-town.html |title=The Kooks confirm new album Listen, single 'Around Town' |first=Mayer |last=Nissim |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

The results were considerably different from the band's previous three albums, to the point where they considered changing their name. According to Pritchard, "We could have renamed the band, it felt that different [...] The first three albums were chapter one, this album is the first of chapter two.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gigwise.com/features/92496/|title=The Kooks: 'We were bored of ourselves'|first=Michael|last=Baggs|publisher=Gigwise|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>

==Themes==
Pritchard has explained that "Westside" is a track about his two best friends getting married and "Forgive and Forget" is a story of a couple breaking up in a bar.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/> The track "It Was London" is a song about the London Riots; "A big city like that, London, Paris, you have this illusion that everything's safe, and that sort of thing happens and the walls come crashing down. The police brutality that happened around that time… we wrote a song about that," Pritchard stated.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/> Pritchard has said that "It Was London" is one of his favorite songs on the album.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/>

The song "See Me Now" is a letter to Luke's dad that took on the form of a song.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/> "My dad passed away when I was really young. That's it really, it's a ballad. It's hard to do but I'm glad I did. I got pushed into it by Inflo really. We'd been talking about it all day and I was telling him about my dad and he just said you should write a letter to him. And I didn't really want to because it's a bit cheesy, but from there... the song came of it. I think it's really beautiful. I dunno why at that point I decided to let that happen," Pritchard said in an interview.<ref name="Interview: The Kooks Talk Listen"/>
