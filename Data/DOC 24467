}}The '''Steenkampskraal mine''' is a [[rare-earth element]]s (REEs) mine {{convert|71|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Vanrhynsdorp]] in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. The mine was operated by Anglo American Corporation from 1952 to 1963. In addition to the mining right area of 474 hectares, the company also owns three surrounding farms with a total area of about 7,000 hectares. Steenkampskraal has the highest grade Rare Earth deposit in the world. It has a resource of about 605,000 tons at an average grade of 14.4% Total Rare Earth Oxide (TREO) for a total of 86,900 tons contained TREO. Each ton of ore in the Steenkampskraal mine contains rare earths to the value of approximately US$ 3,000 at present market prices. The total quantity of neodymium in the mine is 15,600 tons at a resource grade of 2.58% Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
