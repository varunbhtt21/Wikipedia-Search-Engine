==Gameplay==
''MEG: RVO'' incorporates elements of [[Action game|action]], [[Strategy game|strategy]], and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] games. The player takes the role of an "RVO", a remote vehicle operator hired by Slate Corporation to explore an alternate dimension opened by a new technology known as the "Probability Aperture". The player uses the iPad to control their vehicle from a [[Top-down perspective|overhead perspective]] through large outdoor maps with varied environments.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140505200102/http://skunkwerkskinetic.com/meg-rvo/ About MEG: RVO] ''Skunkwerks Kinetic''. May 5, 2014.</ref>

The player is assisted by a personal "MEG" unit; a quadrupedal robot<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/Gs9HUOmgfRc?t=31s/ MEG RVO hands-on] ''Youtube''. April 11, 2014.</ref> that acts as the "arms" of the vehicle. Use of the MEG unit allows the player to retrieve artifacts and wreckage found within the game world. MEG is also able to deploy buildings such as a variety of turrets, walls, fences, mines, and beacons. The player can use these buildings to construct bases within the game world that will protect vital locations from enemy AI and other players.

In MEG: RVO, players compete to secure all of the capture points within a particular map. Points are captured for a given team when a member of that team waits upon that point for a certain period of time. The opposing team can then overthrow that point and reclaim it by clearing the surrounding defenses and parking on the point for the same duration of time as the other team. The first team to conquer all of the capture points will be declared the winners of the match. A map stays online as long the map hasn't been conquered by one team.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK1_4DpRyEA/ Strategy Game - MEG RVO Combat Sim iPad App Review ] ''Youtube''.
