'''Moorside Nuclear Power Station''' was proposed for a site near [[Sellafield]], in [[Cumbria]], [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web

</ref> The original plan by [[NuGeneration]], a British subsidiary of [[Toshiba]]-owned [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], had the station coming online from 2024 with 3.4GW of new nuclear capacity, from 3 [[AP1000]] reactors. Work up to 2018 would include acquiring the site licence, the development consent order, and other required permits and permissions to start work. Site preparation was to take two years, up to 2020.<ref>{{cite web

Following the [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] of Westinghouse in March 2017, the project was put under review.<ref name=wnn-20170516>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-National-Grid-puts-Moorside-plans-on-hold-16051701.html |title=National Grid puts Moorside plans on hold |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=16 May 2017 |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> From December 2017 to July 2018 [[Korea Electric Power Corporation|Kepco]] was named as preferred bidder.<ref name=Guardian-171206/><ref name=wnn-20180801/> Kepco were thought to prefer their own [[APR-1400]] reactor design for the site, a design which had not yet gone through generic design assessment with the UK's [[Office for Nuclear Regulation]].

On 8 November 2018, it was announced that Toshiba plans for the new nuclear power station had been scrapped after Toshiba stated that it was to wind up its subsidiary company, NuGen.<ref name=guardian-20181108/> Moorside’s site will be handed over to the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]], with the government issuing a statement reaffirming its commitment to new nuclear.<ref>{{cite web

==History==
The option for a {{convert|190|ha|adj=on}} plot north of Sellafield was acquired in October 2009 for {{GBP|70}}&nbsp;million by a joint venture formed by [[Iberdrola]], [[Engie|GdF-Suez]], and [[Scottish and Southern Energy|Scottish & Southern]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_New_nuclear_for_Sellafield_2810091.html |title=New nuclear for Sellafield |author= |date=28 October 2009 |newspaper=World Nuclear News |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> which named itself NuGeneration (NuGen) in November 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C_Name_for_third_UK_builder_2911101.html |title=Name for third UK builder |author= |date=29 November 2010 |newspaper=World Nuclear News |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> The future plant was named Moorside in December 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/IT-NuGen_names_future_plant_Moorside-0212116.html |title=NuGen names future plant Moorside |author= |date=2 December 2011 |newspaper=World Nuclear News |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> Toshiba, as owner of Westinghouse, took over Iberdrola's stake in NuGen in 2013, allowing the completion of the generic design assessment (GDA) for the AP1000 design by UK regulators. The GDA required a customer and specific site to finalize engineering details.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Toshiba-takes-stake-in-UK-new-build-2312137.html |title=Toshiba stake in UK new-build |author= |date=23 December 2013 |newspaper=World Nuclear News |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2014, the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] agreed commercial terms with developer NuGen to extend a land option agreement to build three reactors at Moorside.<ref>{{cite web

Later that year, [[HM Treasury]] agreed to provide financial security to investors in the project.<ref>{{cite web

In July 2015, NuGen exercised its option and purchased the land near Sellafield needed for the Moorside plant, approximately 200 hectares, for an undisclosed sum.<ref name=wnn-20150714>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-NuGen-acquires-land-for-Moorside-project-1407155.html |title=NuGen acquires land for Moorside project |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=14 July 2015 |accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref>

In October 2016, [[National Grid plc|National Grid]] announced proposals for consultation for a £2.8 billion project to connect the new plant to [[National Grid (Great Britain)|the national electricity grid]]. The proposal involves putting power-lines underground and under [[Morecambe Bay]] to reduce the impact on the [[Lake District National Park]].<ref name=wnn-20161025>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-UK-National-Grid-updates-plans-for-new-nuclear-plants-25101601.html |title=UK's National Grid updates plans for new nuclear plants |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=25 October 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>

Following the bankruptcy of Westinghouse in March 2017, Engie pulled out of NuGen in July, leaving Toshiba as the sole owner of NuGen.

In December 2017, NuGen announced that [[Korea Electric Power Corporation|Kepco]] was named the preferred bidder to acquire NuGen from Toshiba. If the sale to Kepco proceeds, the three AP1000 reactors were likely to be replaced by two [[APR-1400]] units. Tom Samson, CEO of NuGen stated "The Kepco selection presents us with a solution that fully addresses the four questions [on technology, ownership structure, funding solution, and delivery model] that we set ourselves at the start of this process. On technology, the APR1400 tech has been operational now for one year in Korea and it’s a recognised Gen III+ design, and the first Gen III+ design to go into service in the world." The potential design change to APR-1400 would delay the likely in-service date into the late 2020s or early 2030s.<ref name=Guardian-171206>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/korean-energy-firm-kepco-rescue-moorside-nuclear-power-project| title=Korean energy firm rescues UK's Moorside nuclear power project |author=Adam Vaughan |date=6 December 2017 | newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Kepco-named-preferred-bigger-for-UKs-NuGen-07121704.html |title=Kepco named preferred bidder for UK's NuGen |author= |date=7 December 2017 |newspaper=World Nuclear News |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> In July 2018 NuGen announced a consultation to lay off 100 UK staff, while it remained unclear whether the Kepco takeover would go ahead.<ref name=guardian-20180729>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/29/fate-of-new-moorside-nuclear-power-station-in-cumbria-in-doubt |title=Fate of new Moorside nuclear power station in Cumbria in doubt |last=Vaughan |first=Adam |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 July 2018 |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> On 25 July 2018 Toshiba terminated Kepco's status as preferred bidder, but would continue discussions with it and other potential purchasers.<ref name=wnn-20180801>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kepco-loses-preferred-bidder-status-for-NuGen |title=Kepco loses preferred bidder status for NuGen |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=1 August 2018 |accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref>

==Opposition==
The proposal to build the station is opposed by Radiation Free Lakeland, a group of local activists.<ref>{{cite news |last=Clarke |first=Andrew |date=27 September 2014 |title=Protest campaign launched against nuclear power station near Sellafield |url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/protest-campaign-launched-against-nuclear-power-station-near-sellafield-1.1164871 |newspaper=[[News and Star]] |location=[[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] |accessdate=8 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203170001/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/protest-campaign-launched-against-nuclear-power-station-near-sellafield-1.1164871 |archivedate=3 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A report evaluating the AP1000 reactor design was written by the Edinburgh Energy and Environment Consultancy, commissioned by Radiation Free Lakeland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/Moorside-reactors-too-great-a-risk-to-public-health-and-safety-report-claims-fed10206-dff5-40b0-a060-e085ef48204e-ds |title=Moorside reactors 'too great a risk to public health and safety', report claims |author= |date=22 November 2016 |newspaper=News and Star |location=Carlisle, Cumbria |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> The report criticizes the design, saying that "The AP1000 reactor design is not fit for purpose and so should be refused a Design Acceptance Confirmation (DAC) and Statement of Design Acceptability (SDA)″.<ref>{{cite report |url=https://theecologist.org/_download/402328/ap1000-report.pdf |title=The AP1000 Nuclear Reactor Design |author=Roche, Pete |date=November 2016 |publisher=Edinburgh Energy and Environment Consultancy |accessdate=5 January 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130215147/https://theecologist.org/_download/402328/ap1000-report.pdf |archivedate=30 January 2017 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>{{rp|2}}

==Consultation==
Stage 1 consultation took place between May and July 2015 and a report was published on 23 November 2015. Stage 2 consultation took place between May and July 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nugenconsultation.com/stage-two-consultation |title=Stage Two Consultation|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>

==Design==
Both the AP1000 and the APR-1400 are types of [[pressurised water reactor]] (PWR).  PWRs constitute the large majority of the world's nuclear power plants, but there is currently only one civil PWR in the UK ([[Sizewell B]]), with one more under construction ([[Hinkley Point C]]).

===AP1000===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AP600PassiveContainment.jpg|thumb|Diagram of AP1000 passive safety systems.]] -->
{{main article|AP1000}}
Initial plans called for three AP1000 units at Moorside, which is a nuclear power plant designed and sold by [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-UK-AP1000-partnership-confirmed-3006147.html |title=UK partnership for AP1000 confirmed |author= |date=30 June 2014 |newspaper=World Nuclear News |accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> The design has improved use of [[passive nuclear safety]], featuring fewer valves and pumps than previous PWRs and allowing cooling without intervention for up to 72 hours, relying mostly on natural processes such as water flowing downhill and heat rising.  This novel design has raised a number of concerns but the design has been approved for use in both the United States and China.

In December 2011, the [[Office for Nuclear Regulation]] (ONR) and [[Environment Agency]] (EA) had issued interim design acceptance for the AP1000 reactor design.  These indicated that there were 51 outstanding issues and the ONR and EA were satisfied with the plans to resolve these issues.<ref>http://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/ap1000/idac-isoda.htm</ref>  The issues include "Justification of novel form of structure for the steel/concrete composite walls and floors known as CA modules"<ref>http://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/ap1000/gda-issues-res-plan.htm</ref>

In 2015, Westinghouse resumed ONR Generic Design Assessment for the AP1000.  On 28 March 2017 the ONR issued a Design Acceptance Confirmation for the design, stating that the 51 issues identified in 2011 had received an adequate response.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP1000 design completes UK regulatory assessment|publisher=World Nuclear News|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-AP1000-design-completes-UK-regulatory-assessment-30031701.html|date=30 March 2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onr.org.uk/new-reactors/ap1000/reports/ap1000-signed-dac.pdf|title=New nuclear power stations: Generic Design Assessment: Design Acceptance Confirmation for the AP1000® Reactor |publisher= ONR|date=28 March 2017|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> However, the following day the designer, Westinghouse, filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in the U.S. because of $9 billion of losses from its nuclear reactor construction projects, mostly the construction of four AP1000 reactors in the U.S.<ref name=nei-20170329>{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newswestinghouse-files-for-bankruptcy-5773901 |title=Westinghouse files for bankruptcy |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=29 March 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>

{{main article|APR-1400}}
In December 2017, it was thought likely that two APR-1400 units will be intended for Moorside.<ref name=Guardian-171206>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/korean-energy-firm-kepco-rescue-moorside-nuclear-power-project| title=Korean energy firm rescues UK's Moorside nuclear power project |author=Adam Vaughan |date=6 December 2017 | newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> The APR-1400 is designed by the [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (Kepco).
