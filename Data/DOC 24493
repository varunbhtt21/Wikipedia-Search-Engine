'''''Rosemary's Baby''''' is a 2014 two-part, four-hour television [[miniseries]] adaptation of [[Ira Levin]]'s best-selling [[horror novel]] [[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|of the same name]]. [[Zoe Saldana]] stars in the [[NBC]] production that is directed by [[Agnieszka Holland]].<ref name=RBRSHtP/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/zoe-saldana-to-topline-nbc-miniseries-rosemarys-baby/|title=Zoe Saldana To Topline NBC Miniseries 'Rosemary's Baby'|accessdate=May 2, 2014|date=January 8, 2014|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie}}</ref> Unlike earlier versions, it is set in Paris rather than New York. The work was not well received by critics, many of whom said that it was stretched to fill two two-hour timeslots. Although there are several notable changes, this miniseries is considered to be a fairly true updating of the [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|original film adaptation]].

==Cast==
* [[Zoe Saldana]] as Rosemary Woodhouse
* [[Patrick J. Adams]] as Guy Woodhouse
* [[Jason Isaacs]] as Roman Castevet
* [[Carole Bouquet]] as Margaux Castevet
* [[Christina Cole]] as Julie
* [[François Civil]] as Jacques
* [[Frédéric Pierrot]] as Father Tekem
* [[Wojciech Pszoniak]] as Monsieur Wees
* [[Joseph Malerba]] as Paul
* Stefano Cassetti as The Blue-Eyed Man/The Devil

==Plot==
After suffering a miscarriage, Rosemary ([[Zoe Saldana]]) and Guy ([[Patrick J. Adams]]) Woodhouse leave New York City for Paris, hoping to make a fresh start. A series of serendipitous events lead them to befriend affluent couple Margaux ([[Carole Bouquet]]) and Roman Castevet ([[Jason Isaacs]]), who invite them to live in their prestigious apartment building. While Guy appreciates Roman's taking him under his wing, Rosemary is overwhelmed by the Castevets' interest in their lives. She finds evidence of the previous couple that lived in their apartment, and after going to Commissioner Fontaine ([[Olivier Rabourdin]]) with her suspicions, learns that the woman, Nena (Victoire Bélézy), committed suicide. Following a lead, Rosemary finds Nena's priest, who claims that the apartment building has a dark past, and one of its tenants is a Satanist billionaire named Steven Marcato who eats women's hearts. The priest hangs himself soon after, which prompts Fontaine to investigate.

When Guy's career flourishes, he suggests to Rosemary that they try to get pregnant again. On the night they plan to conceive, Rosemary drinks Margaux's herbal brew and passes out. In a dream-like state, Rosemary sees herself having sex with a strange man, while being watched by Guy, Margaux, Roman, and the Castevets' friends. Weeks later, Rosemary learns she is pregnant, but her health deteriorates and she is neglected by Guy, who is reluctant to touch Rosemary and has been spending more time with Roman. Guy is angered when he learns Rosemary went to visit another doctor, as encouraged by her friend Julie ([[Christina Cole]]). Guy visits Julie and secretly takes her crucifix necklace; not long afterward, Julie dies in a kitchen accident. Rosemary's pains suddenly disappear, and the rest of the pregnancy proceeds well.

Late into the pregnancy, Fontaine is still investigating the Marcato case and warns Rosemary to keep her eyes open. Rosemary discovers a secret door in their closet, which leads to a study containing books on the occult. Rosemary takes one of the books, which is about witchcraft and contains a handwritten "It's an anagram!" above a page on Steven Marcato. Rosemary shares her suspicions with Guy that Roman Castevet is Steven Marcato, and that the Castevets are witches with sinister designs on their baby, but Guy insists that she is being paranoid. While searching for their passports, Rosemary discovers Julie's crucifix necklace and suspects that Guy is part of the conspiracy.

Rosemary sneaks out of the apartment to meet Fontaine, but he is run over by a truck while Rosemary watches. Rosemary goes to Dr. Bernard ([[Oisín Stack]]), Julie's friend, but he thinks that she is delusional and calls Guy. Rosemary is taken back to her apartment, where she has a panic attack and is sedated just as she is going into labor. She wakes up three days later in a hospital and is told that the baby died and that its body was cremated. After being discharged, Rosemary leaves Guy and declares that she is going back to New York.

While packing her things in the apartment, Rosemary hears a baby's cries and starts lactating. She goes through the secret door to the Castevets' apartment, where she finds Guy, the Castevets and their friends standing around a crib containing her baby. Rosemary is disturbed by the baby's demonic eyes, and is told that its father is Satan and the baby is their Prince. Roman encourages Rosemary to be the baby's mother, and she lifts her son out of the crib to nurse him. The film ends with Rosemary pushing her son in a pram, and when passersby admire the baby, she says, "He's perfect."

==Reception==
On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show held a 31% approval rating with an average score of 4.8/10, based on 35 reviews. The consensus read: "Although the Parisian setting and special effects are impressive, this ''Rosemary's Baby'' remake resorts to sensationalism and gore." At [[Metacritic]], the show had a score of 51 out of 100, based on 27 reviews, which indicates a "mixed or average" response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/rosemary-s-baby/|title=Rosemary's Baby: Season 1 (2014)|accessdate=May 17, 2014 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/rosemarys-baby|title=Rosemary's Baby : Season 1|accessdate=May 11, 2014 |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>

[[Alessandra Stanley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who called the miniseries a "surprisingly clever remake", felt that the choice of Paris as the setting was not only "one of the best things" about the remake, but it works well with the theme of conflict with neighbors. Furthermore, she noted that it was reasonable that Rosemary ([[Zoe Saldana]]) would be naive and dependent because of her unfamiliarity with Paris as a newcomer.<ref name=WaCitWW>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/arts/television/rosemarys-baby-is-remade-into-a-mini-series.html|title=Wanting a Child in the Worst Way: 'Rosemary's Baby' Is Remade Into a Mini-Series|accessdate=May 11, 2014 |date=May 8, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Stanley |first=Alessandra}}</ref> Stanley wrote that the host couple, French sophisticates Margaux ([[Carole Bouquet]]) and Roman Castevet ([[Jason Isaacs]]), were completely different from the one in [[Roman Polanski]]'s original.<ref name=WaCitWW/> Although she said the adaptation took liberties with the source material, [[James Poniewozik]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said the adaptation "keeps its essential shape and plot" in comparison to the original film, an opinion shared by [[Hank Stuever]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who wrote that the new adaptation was "surprisingly and even satisfyingly true to the old movie".<ref name=RBAdsitaou>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/rosemarys-baby-a-demon-seed-in-the-age-of-ultrasound/2014/05/09/cc042fd6-d48d-11e3-aae8-c2d44bd79778_story.html |title='Rosemary's Baby': A demon seed in the age of ultrasound|accessdate=May 11, 2014 |date=May 9, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|last=Stuever |first=Hank}}</ref><ref name=WaCitWW/><ref name=RRBaPD/> Poniewozik stated that although director Holland had successfully directed complex and lively episodes of ''[[The Wire]]'' and ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', this adaptation was "leaden and slack", which may have been due to an attempt to fill two two-hour time slots.<ref name=RRBaPD/> Stuever also wrote that it was "way too long", and added that the show lacked suspense.<ref name=RBAdsitaou/> Poniewozik characterized Rosemary and Guy ([[Patrick J. Adams]]) as "anesthetically generic" without a "complex relationship"; he likened the miniseries to a "lifestyle show" that becomes a "slasher movie". Despite some "redeeming notes", he ultimately called it "too dull".<ref name=RRBaPD>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/91420/review-penny-dreadful-rosemarys-baby/|title=REVIEW: Rosemary's Baby and Penny Dreadful|accessdate=May 11, 2014 |date=May 8, 2014|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Poniewozik |first=James}}</ref> Stuever noted that the 2014 adaptation was set in "the hyper-aware boutique pregnancy" era, and pointed out one modernization that eased Rosemary's burden: [[Google image]] searches on Satan.<ref name=RBAdsitaou/> [[David Bianculli]] of [[NPR]] felt the shift to Paris was unnecessary and that the adaptation was "neither refreshing nor original"; he summed it up as "just dreadful". He described Saldana's Rosemary as more appealing, but no smarter, than [[Mia Farrow]]'s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/09/311064910/penny-dreadful-is-wonderful-but-rosemarys-baby-is-dreadful|title='Penny Dreadful' Is Wonderful, But 'Rosemary's Baby' Is Dreadful|accessdate=May 11, 2014 |date=May 9, 2014|publisher=[[NPR]]|last=Bianculli |first=David}}</ref>
