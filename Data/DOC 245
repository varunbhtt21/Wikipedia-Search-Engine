'''Armando Fizzarotti''' (1892â€“1966) was an Italian [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]]. Fizzarotti was a native of [[Naples]], and his films are generally set in the city. He was specifically hired to direct ''[[Malaspina (film)|Malaspina]]'' (1947) because of his experience making Neapolitan-style films.<ref>Marlow-Mann p.16</ref> The film helped revive Neapolitan cinema, which had been suppressed during the [[Fascist era]] as production was centralised in [[Rome]].

His son [[Ettore Maria Fizzarotti]] was also a film director.
