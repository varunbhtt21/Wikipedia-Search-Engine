This file is an orphan, and while the uploader [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Torre_Latinoamericana.png&diff=606857228&oldid=606856112 claims it is not fair use], the [http://www.torrelatinoamericana.com.mx/Paginas/esquema.html original source] says "All Rights Reserved ... ©2005". According to the description it was intended as an icon for [[Portal:Mexico City]], but fair use images cannot be used with {{tl|portal}}. Also, the page was previously tagged for [[WP:F5|CSD F5]], but the tag was removed by the uploader (at the same time as making the non-fair-use claim). — '''''[[User:Mr. Stradivarius|<span style="color: #194D00; font-family: Palatino, Times, serif">Mr. Stradivarius</span>]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Mr. Stradivarius|♪ talk ♪]]</sup> 04:49, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

There is no proof that an OTRS email has been sent for this photo and based on the uploader's behavior, he is either working for the subject of the photo in producing an article of him on the English Wikipedia (Mr. Ambode's web presence has been increasing in the past month because of his participation in the upcoming elections in Nigeria) or is the subject himself.
