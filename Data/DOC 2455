Only 1 link goes to him-and its to a page made by the same person. With just 2 credits-not sure if notable enough.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 20:16, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. The nomination seems slightly weak. The fact that an article is effectively an orphan is rarely if ever a good argument for deletion - and as to the number of credits, the Swedish Wikipedia page for the subject gives seven credits and, if I could make head or tail of the Arabic page, I suspect it would prove to contain quite a few more than that. Of course, this does not immediately establish notability, but it does mean that we should be judging the subject by his full filmography and critical reaction to that - including critical reaction in Arabic. Any Arabic-speakers here? [[User:PWilkinson|PWilkinson]] ([[User talk:PWilkinson|talk]]) 15:25, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-Looking on the IMDB for him-couldn't find an exact name but it is very possible he has a different name on there as I found variations of it-unfortunately I'm not sure which could be him. It was a tough call either way. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:45, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Two leading role credits passes NACTOR rules.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 17:29, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep'''. I checked out the Arabic article and searched around on Arabic sites, and he's notable for sure, not least because he's played several leading roles in marquee TV shows on channels like [[Al-Iraqiya]] and [[Al Sharqiya]].—[[User:Neil P.
