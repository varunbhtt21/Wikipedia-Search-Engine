== History ==
Vetter Software began in 2010 when Sagi Solomon's brother, Dr. Tal Solomon launched a mobile veterinary practice. Tal needed a way to access his records while he was visiting patients. After failing to find a system that worked, Tal approached Sagi with the idea of building one. Sagi spent the next several months building the first version of what is now Vetter Software. A second version of the platform was created when Jeff Ulrich joined. This second version was enhanced to become the 3rd version<ref>{{cite press release | title=Vetter Software Launches Cloud-Based Practice Management Suite for Veterinarians|date= 2013-06-24 | url=http://vettersoftware.com/assets/pdf/news_press_release/Vetter_Launch_Press_Release_2013-06-24.pdf | publisher=Vetter Software}}</ref> which is the current platform.
