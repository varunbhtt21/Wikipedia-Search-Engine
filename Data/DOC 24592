Text : '''Wieluń Land''' ({{lang-pl|Ziemia Wieluńska}}) was an [[administrative territorial entity]] of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which for centuries was part of [[Sieradz Voivodeship (1339–1793)|Sieradz Voivodeship]], Province of [[Greater Poland]]. 

==History==

It was based on the medieval [[Castellany]] of [[Ruda, Wielun County|Ruda]], which was first mentioned in the 1136 [[Bull of Gniezno]], and during the period known as Fragmentation of Poland (see [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty]]), it was part of proper [[Greater Poland]]. During few years in the 13th century, it was twice ruled by the [[Dukes of Silesia]]. In 1281, the castellany was moved from Ruda to nearby [[Wieluń]].

In both Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Wieluń Land had its own offices, and the Castellan of Wieluń was one of Senators of Poland. The land had four [[starosta]]s &ndash; at Wieluń itself, [[Ostrzeszów]], [[Bolesławiec, Łódź Voivodeship|Bolesławiec]] and [[Grabów nad Prosną]]. Two deputies to the [[Sejm]] were elected at Wieluń's [[Sejmik]]s. Furthermore, the Voivode of Sieradz was obliged to appoint his deputy from Wieluń{{cn|date=August 2014}}. Wieluń Land had its own [[coat of arms]], established between 1410 and 1434.
