== Life ==
He was the son of a gardener and began by studying lithography at the J. C. Vogelschen Lithographieanstalt in Frankfurt. From 1825 to 1827, he studied with Karl Friedrich Wendelstadt (1785-1840) at the [[Städelschule]]. In 1835, he later attended the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] on a scholarship and studied with [[Johann Wilhelm Schirmer]].<ref name="ADB" /> He focused on genre art, but also painted [[plein air]] style at the [[Middle Rhine|Mittelrhein]], the [[Main (river)|Main]] and throughout [[Hesse]].

In 1841, [[Gerhardt von Reutern]] invited him to visit the Artists' Colony in [[Willingshausen]], where he created scenes of village life. The following year, he opened a studio at the Städelschule and took further lessons with [[Anton Burger (artist)|Anton Burger]]. In the early 1860s, he and Burger moved to Kronberg, where they founded their own artists' colony.<ref name="ADB" />

During the last ten years of his life, he suffered from an unspecified infirmity which hindered his ability to paint. Therefore, his oeuvre is not as extensive as it might be otherwise.
