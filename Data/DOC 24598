==The Meta-Breed (Static Shock Animated Series)==

The Meta-Breed is a large gangster group of Bang Babies led by Ebon.

===Ebon===
* '''Real name''': Ivan Evans
* '''Voice actor''': [[Gary Sturgis]]

The head of a large group of Bang Babies including Shiv and Talon, Ebon is an unusually powerful and strong umbrakinetic trans-morph; a living shadow and inter-dimensional portal able to hide within, control and manipulate pure darkness and shadows, as well as transport others to various locations of his choice.  His weakness is strong sources of light.  Ebon's real name is Ivan Evans, and he is Rubberband Man's older brother.

Ebon is always recruiting newer and much stronger members to add to his crew and has come head-to-head with several other Bang Babies over the course of his life. An archenemy of Static, Ebon also does not get along too well with [[#Madelyn Spaulding|Madelyn]] or [[Hot-Streak]]. Ebon always holds a grudge against Static for ruining so many of his plans. Some of his attacks against Static could have been lethal, but Static would still defeat him.

When Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure was transforming them back into humans, Ebon stages a plan to get the last vial of Bang Baby gas and stage another [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]], one that would potentially create hundreds more Bang Babies than the first one. Ebon and [[Hot-Streak]] fight over the final vial of gas and, being exposed to an overdose of it, merge into one giant Bang Baby-monster which combined both their powers. [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]], being the only two remaining Bang Babies, are able to take down Ebon and Hotstreak by blowing up a fuel tank inside their body, but it remains unknown whether the bang baby beast survives this final confrontation.

Ebon's powers as a living shadow and inter-dimensional portal, are a nod to the "Shadowslide", the method of [[teleportation]] utilized by the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]], one of [[Milestone Media]]'s title series'.  They are also similar to [[Shadow Thief#Powers and abilities|Shadow Thief's powers]].

===Shiv===
* '''Real name''': unknown
* '''Voice actor''': [[Brian Tochi]]

Getting his '[[Pseudonym|nom-de-crime]]' from a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]] (a kind of bladed weapon), Shiv is the immature jokester of the Meta-Breed; in fact, when he encounters the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], he tells the villain "''Big fan, big fan...''". He has been described as insane by both fans and creators of the show and comics. Shiv may be one of the many Bang Babies whose mental health is affected by the Big Bang, but this is never confirmed; he may simply just be an eccentric, childish jokester. Shiv's abilities enable him to generate pure whitish-pink "light energy", which he can blast at opponents and fashion into numerous useful tools and weapons which he can hold, throw, or fashion around his arms and hands, giving rise to his new alias; 'Shiv.' Shiv is assumed to have either returned to normal, or is now among the reinfected Dakota's Bang-Baby population at the end of the series.

===Talon===
* '''Real name''': Teresa (last name unknown)
* '''Voice actor''': [[Tia Texada]]

A teenage Hispanic girl, Talon is a [[metahuman]] whose exposure to the Big Bang transformed her into a [[Harpy|humanoid avian bird]], a fact she is really bitter about throughout the series. As a metahuman, Talon has claw-like digits on her hands and talon-like digits on her feet; she is covered in white orange feathers, but retains her red hair color. The most notable attribute of her transformation is a set of feathered patagia extending from her scapula to her forearms which enable her to fly by flapping her arms. Talon can emit incredibly strong, large, visible lavender-colored hypersonic shrieks from her mouth and vocal cords which she can use offensively in battle; similar to the Marvel Comics superhero [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and DC's [[Black Canary]]. Her hypersonic sound abilities are completely useless if her mouth is gagged.

Talon is first introduced as a member of the Meta-Breed, making her a frequent opponent of Static. When the cure is introduced, Talon accompanies Ebon, Hot-Streak, and Shiv to steal the last canister of gas. However, before they can escape, Talon is restored to normal, and she wants to stay that way. Ebon, whose powers are deteriorating, is forced to leave her behind; at the hospital, she abandons the name of Talon for her real name, Teresa, and tells Static and Gear that Ebon plans to use the gas to set off another Big Bang. That night, Teresa is kidnapped by Ebon, who refuses to let her leave his side, and is taken to the docks to be re-exposed. She is saved by Static and Gear, who are captured shortly afterwards. In return, she frees them and escapes the area just before Ebon and Hot-Streak begin wreaking havoc as a fused super-enhanced, flame-and-shadow monster.

===Francis Stone/F-Stop/Hot-Streak===
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Hotstreak.jpg|thumb|right|Hot-Streak]] -->
* '''Real name''': Francis Stone (also known as 'F-Stop')
* '''Voice actor''': [[Danny Cooksey]]

Hot-Streak (Francis Stone/F-Stop) was one of the gang members at the docks when the Big Bang occurred. After being exposed to the gas, Francis Stone becomes Hot-Streak. His powers add to his hotheadedness by giving him the ability to create and shoot blasts of [[fire]]. His powers are loosely based on the [[Human Torch]] and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]]. In the TV show, his bullying seems mainly driven by his crush on Frieda.

Hotstreak is one of [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]'s very first rivals, giving him a challenge nearly every time they meet. The fights seem to be personal in some way since Static and Hotstreak already had history with each other before The Big Bang as Virgil and Francis. He seems to mellow out as the series goes on, and with enough time he might have reformed into a good guy. There is evidence of this in the episode "No Man's Island" when he skips a chance to escape the island to go save the others. He stops the troops attacking Static, Gear, Rubberband Man, and Talon by taking Alva hostage. He is also seemingly touched by Static's effort to risk his life to save Alva's son, to the point where he joins Static in the effort to save Edwin. Unfortunately, when Dr. Todd’s Bang Baby cure is turning the Bang Babies back into humans, [[Ebon (character)|Ebon]] stages a plan to get the last vial of Bang Baby gas and stage another "Big Bang", one that would potentially create more Bang Babies than the first one. Ebon and [[Hot-Streak]] fight over the final vial of gas and, being exposed to an overdose of it, merge into one giant Bang Baby-monster which combined both their powers. Static and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]], the only two remaining Bang Babies, are able to take down Ebon and Hotstreak by blowing up a fuel tank inside their body, but it remains unknown whether the monster survives this final confrontation.

===Aquamaria===
* '''Real name''': Maria (last name unknown)
* '''Voice actor''': Erika Velez (''Bad Stretch''); [[Yeni Álvarez]] (''Wet and Wild'')

Aquamaria (real name unknown) is a [[Latino|Latina]] [[girl]] who was transformed into a transmorph, in her case a being of living liquid [[water]], by the Big Bang. Unlike other Bang Babies with transmorphic abilities like Rubber-Band Man, Aquamaria cannot change back and forth from her true human form. The only known background information given about Aquamaria is that she has a mother and a younger sister, who she lived with before she was exposed to Big Bang gas, not returning home after becoming a Bang Baby.

As a life-form composed of [[colloid]]al water, the Bang-Baby known now as Aquamaria is capable of hydrokinetic abilities, able to manipulate her own form, expanding or compressing her physical mass and 'shapeshifting' parts of her body (like turning her hand and forearm into a net/bag to gather up cash when she and Hot-Streak rob a music store in ''Wet and Wild''.) In a fight, Aquamaria can aim a pressurized water attack from her arms similar to a [[geyser]], or become one herself. Able to merge with a larger body of water, Aquamaria can overwhelm opponents by becoming a living flood.

In her first appearance, in ''Bad Stretch'' (in season 2), Aquamaria, having been [[recruitment|recruited]] by Ebon into the Meta-Breed, is undergoing her [[initiation]] by first robbing a stadium with the intention to lure out Static, and then take him down one-on-one. Ebon had been counting on her victory as he had thought that "her water powers would stop him for sure." While Aquamaria successfully shorts out [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]'s powers, she is taken on and captured by [[Rubber-Band Man (Static Shock)|Rubber-Band Man]]. She is then taken into police custody and kept contained by a specialized containment unit that was custom-made just for her. Aquamaria is later broken out of jail, along with other members of the Meta-Breed, by [[Ebon (character)|Ebon]] disguised as Rubber-Band Man in order to frame him. After Static reveals Ebon's deception and Rubber-Band Man fights Ebon alone, he then has to take on Aquamaria, successfully neutralizing her by using [[electrolysis]] to break her down from water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]—while she survives this, it leaves her unconscious.

Aquamaria later teams up with [[Hot-Streak]], but is frozen by Static and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]]. Later, a team of scientists offer her the chance to be the first to try their antidote for the Big Bang mutagen, and despite an attempt by [[Hot-Streak]] to sabotage the treatment, Aquamaria is eventually returned to normal. She was based on a [[Blood Syndicate]] character.

===Slipstream===
* '''Real name''': unknown (only referred to as 'Heavy-C')
* '''Voice actor''': [[Bumper Robinson]]

A heavy-set teenage bully (with a voice pattern similar to [[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids|Fat Albert]]) who always steals food from others, such as kids at Burger Fool. Slipstream was affected by the Big Bang and given incredible wind powers. After his fight with Static where Static defeats him after having to recharge, he is rarely heard from again, but he is seen in ''Power Outage'' among the other de-powered Bang Babies who are following an offer from Ebon to have their powers restored.

===Boom===
* '''Real name''': Byron (last name unknown)
* '''Voice actor''': [[Ricky D'Shon Collins]]

After both of their parents died and they were taken in by their [[grandmother]], Boom and his younger sister, Mirage (Miranda), were exposed to a spill of the Big Bang gas. Boom is able to generate large and unusually strong amounts of hypersonic sound waves from a loudspeaker on his chest, causing massive amounts of damage. Mirage's powers are of illusion-casting. Boom and Mirage steal a lot of money; Boom claims it's for supporting his grandmother. While it is implied that Boom's aggressive personality may have been the result of his exposure to Big-Bang gas (as Mirage reveals to Static that her brother never acted like that before), Mirage keeps her own personality and becomes increasingly disturbed by Boom's actions (as Boom's Quantum Vapour-exposure may have just brought-out a worse side of him he had just never shown before). Mirage finally helps Static trap her brother, and in return, creates an illusion of Static flying away (to mislead Sharon, who was starting to suspect that Virgil and Static were one and the same). Boom is seen in ''Power Outage'' as one of the meta-humans wanting to have their powers restored, but he is not re-exposed to the Big Bang Gas; both Boom and his sister are presumed to have been returned to normal. He resembles [[Siryn]] from the [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].

===Carmendillo===
* '''Real name''': unknown (also known as 'Carmen')
* '''Voice actor''': Matt Ballard (seasons 1 & 2) and [[Jason Marsden]] (seasons 2, 3 & 4)

A teenage boy mutated into a [[humanoid]] [[armadillo]], Carmendillo possesses a bulletproof hide and can be launched like a projectile. He lives in garbage cans and steals food, and mostly has his mind set on eating (he hates robbing places with no food courts). At one point, Carmendillo is accompanied by a dog-like Bang Baby (similar to the [[Blood Syndicate]] character Dogg), whom he calls "''Chomper''". Carmendillo had worked with the Meta-Breed and the Meta-Men, but mostly operates by himself, serving pretty much as [[comic relief]]. In every episode he appears, he only acts at the beginning and is quickly defeated, sometimes without interfering with the central plot.

He is always in a group for one episode and then quits stating that he would not be in any group again seen in ''A League of Their Own''. It is unknown why he joins The Meta-Breed and The Meta-Men. When he first works for The Meta-Breed, he gets scared due to Ebon hearing his brother is one of the good guys after nearly robbing a store; he is defeated after getting repelled by Static, but is later freed by Ebon. He almost fights Static again but does not and is so scared that he hides in a ball pit and quits. His work with The Meta-Breed is short after being taken out by [[Hawkgirl]]. Afterwards, he fights Static again on his own stating that he's been working out and is muscular and his eyes started to have pupils. He appears in the episode "Where Rubber Meets The Road" and is seen in a bar with other bang babies and makes fun of Tarmac for stealing a valuable generator for only $1000 and informs him of Alva's $1.000.000 reward. His last appearance is in "Kidnapped", where Static interrogates him into revealing where Puff and Onyx are.

===Monster===
* '''Real name''': Tamara Lawrence
* '''Voice actor''': Ariyan Johnson (Tamara Lawrence) [[Dee Bradley Baker]] (Monster)

A teenage girl who was caught in the Big Bang. She can now turn into a monster and has superhuman strength. She wants revenge on her boyfriend Marcus Reed for not showing up at the docks, so she decides to frame him. With her appearance, she can easily do so. Static and Gear buy it at first, but Static finds her out and defeats her. She is taken into custody soon afterwards.

She appears in ''Power Outage'' after she started weakening due to Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure which was spreading through the air. She joins Ebon's crew to regain her powers, along with several other Bang Babies.

==The Rough Pack (Static Shock Animated Series)==
The Rough Pack are a gang of three Bang Babies led by Hyde but the group goes inactive after Kangor and Ferret leave the group; Ferret wants to fend for himself while Kangor intends to find a better group.

===Hyde===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Tone Lōc]]

Real name unknown, Hyde is physically mutated with thick folded skin, making him tougher and stronger (like the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] from Marvel Comics' [[Spider-Man]] comics). Hyde manages to grab a piece of Static's coat, has Ferrett track down Static for some payback for ruining his plot, and nearly discovers his identity. The [[name|alias]] 'Hyde' comes from the fact that his skin has become thick and wrinkly like a [[rhinoceros]] or an [[elephant]]'s 'hide'. Hyde's lead is short after being defeated by Static who turns him into a basketball.

===Kangorr===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]

Kangorr is an original character to the animated series who has never appeared in the comic books. Kangorr's real name is never mentioned, and much of his backstory is never brought up in the series—which puts Kangorr across as just another [[juvenile delinquent]] gangbanger, but with some [[common sense]], making him into one of the more formidable Bang-Babies in the series. Kangorr is another of the victims of the 'Big Bang' at the docks. A [[Jamaican American]] in his late teens, Kangorr speaks with a [[Jamaican English|Jamaican]] accent, and Jamaican music plays whenever he shows up or starts a fight. According to the episode "Gear", Kangorr had done time in [[Juvenile hall]] with Ivan/Ebon in the time back before the Big-Bang.

Kangorr’s exposure and reaction to the Big Bang gas has super-developed his lower body, especially his feet; the [[bone]] and [[muscle]] mass of Kangorr's legs and feet is noticeably larger than his upper body, endowing him with incredible lower body strength and giving rise to his [[Pseudonym|nom-de-crime]]. Kangorr prefers to get around by jumping rather than by walking (probably because his big feet keep getting in the way of each other due to their size). In battle, Kangorr typically leaps or [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]]s into action; his kicks are powerful enough to smash stone and concrete with one hit.

Aside from being the first villain featured in the intro for season two—Kangorr makes his first appearance in ''The Big Leagues''. Kangorr, along with Hot-Streak, Talon, Shiv, under the leadership of The Joker form a new team in Dakota. He is first seen when Ferret's gag is taken off and the members of The Joker's crew are revealed. Kangorr uses his feet later on to break into the Dakota Bank in a heist along with the other Bang Babies in The Joker's crew. Kangorr is arrested at the end of the episode, but comes back to make his second appearance in season 2 in "Static Shaq" as a part of The Rough Pack, only to get a taste of his own medicine by Shaq.

Kangorr was the first known Bang Baby to be seen cured by Dr. Todd’s aerosol Bang Baby cure at the end of the series.

===Ferret===
* '''Voice actor''': Chick Vennera

Another victim of the Big Bang gas, Ferret’s nose and mouth became much larger and longer and he gained an incredible sense of smell, which is so acute he can tell when Static is coming by smelling the ionized oxygen which surrounds him when his power is active.

Ferret’s encounters with Static are few. Ferret’s first encounter with Static is at a farmer's market, but ends with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] gassing him. When he refuses to join the Joker's gang, the Joker administers a gas that makes him laugh uncontrollably. He is cured by [[Batman]]’s antidote and eventually begins to cause trouble again. Ferret does not really fight because of his size and non-offensive power, but is forced to by Hyde in ''Static Shaq'' and is defeated and again taken into police custody. After that Ferret and Kangor both quit and join The Meta-Breed; Ferret did not return until Season 4. Like most of the other Bang Babies, he is changed back to normal by Dr. Todd's antidote is spread throughout the city.

==Other villains (Static Shock Animated Series)==

===Aaron Price===
* '''Voice actor''': R.J. Knoll

'''Aaron Price''' is a teenage boy who hangs out with several unruly crowds. Aaron was in reform school when the Big Bang happened and he wanted to gain powers for himself. When he's released and finds out about his step-brother Dwayne’s Bang Baby powers (the ability to warp reality), Aaron tells his brother to manipulate them to get him free money and other goods from the banks and malls of Dakota. Static eventually discovers what’s going on and tells Dwayne to stop listening to his brother. While Dwayne doesn't believe what [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is saying (and tries to kill him in a rage), Static plays a tape of himself (as Virgil) and Aaron talking, in which Aaron expresses his dislike of Dwayne. After Aaron orders him to kill Static, Dwayne stops listening to his step-brother and Static sticks Aaron to a wall. Aaron is then arrested and sent to prison.

===Chainlink===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Bumper Robinson]]

Once a member of the same gang as Dule, both were exposed together to the Big Bang gas and both gained metal tentacles and the ability to absorb metal objects, but Chainlink suffered the brunt of the attack. While Dule can hide his powers, Chainlink could not and was forced to hide in the shadows.

Jealous of the success and fame of his brother's football career, Chainlink attempts to extort Dule into giving him 90% of all his earnings. After Dule attempts to kill Chainlink but fails, the two have a final showdown at the football stadium, where Chainlink is eventually defeated and taken away by the [[police]]. He is similar to the Marvel character [[Doctor Octopus]].

===Ebon/Hot-Streak - "''Ebon-Streak''"===
* '''Voice actor''': No lines

When Dr. Todd’s Bang Baby cure is transforming them back into humans, [[Ebon (character)|Ebon]] stages a plan to get the last vial of Bang Baby gas and stage another “Big Bang”, one that would potentially create more Bang Babies than the first one.

Ebon and [[Hot-Streak]] fight over the final vial of gas and, being exposed to an overdose of it, merge into one giant Bang Baby-monster which combined both their powers.  [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]], the only two remaining Bang Babies, are able to take down Ebon-Streak by blowing up a fuel tank inside their body, but it remains unknown whether either survives this final confrontation.

===Edwin Alva Jr./Omnifarious===
* '''Voice actor''': Matt Ballard

The son of [[Edwin Alva]], he uses stolen Big Bang gas to give himself a variety of temporary metahuman powers (Edwin Alva Jr. found a way to have control over the gas) and calls himself "Omnifarious" (at first, [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] mistakes this for "I'm nefarious."). At first, Alva Jr. attacks his father's factories, warehouses, and cargo ships in order to finally gain his father's respect since he never had time for his son. Later, Alva Jr. combines all the samples of his altered/refined mutagenic gas, intending to use all those powers to destroy the main Alva Industries building, but is instead turned into stone following an overload. He is the first villain to learn Static's real identity.

Only after losing his son in this way did Alva Sr. realize what he had lost and commit all possible resources into restoring him to flesh and blood, including hiring Specs and Trapper as additional help (a useless move, since they would work on their own secret projects rather than do what their employer said). In ''No Man's Island'', Alva finally restores Edwin Jr. to normal with the combined help of Static, [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]], and [[Hot-Streak]]. When Edwin Jr. turns back into flesh and blood, he has no powers and is completely back to normal.

===Royce Axelrod===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Bumper Robinson]]

Royce Axelrod is a student at Dakota Union High School, but is in fact nothing more than a [[criminal|thug]]; Royce is an [[aggression|aggressive]] juvenile delinquent and an impulsive [[thief]] with a history of stealing prior to the events of the episode ''Pop's Girlfriend''. His 'best friend' (the term is used loosely) is Frankie, his shadow, lap-dog, doormat, flunky, and 'Yes-Man' for most of the episode. It is hinted in the episode that he may have had some prior association with [[#Francis Stone/F-Stop/Hot-Streak|F-Stop]]. Although not a Bang-Baby originally, Royce's exposure to vapors of a stolen sample of concentrated Big Bang liquid turns him into a large, misshapen humanoid Bang Baby with light pink skin and reduces his mind to a [[primitive culture|primitive]] [[caveman]]-like [[mindset|mental]]ity. Royce's only appearance is in the episode ''Pop's Girlfriend''.

In his first appearance in the episode, Royce and Frankie are racing to catch the subway; Royce pushes a news stall vendor down as he reaches the steps, followed by Frankie who then both proceed to jump over the turnstiles to avoid paying and run to get on the train before the doors close. While still on the train, Royce sees a large man in a fancy suit, with a metal briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, who then sits down and unlocks the cuffs to tend to his wrist—Royce sees an opportunity to take the briefcase (even though he has no clue what's inside) and times it so that the doors close after he and Frankie have made it off and the man is trapped inside. At school, when a preoccupied Virgil Hawkins bumps into Royce by accident, Royce is hostile towards him, ignoring Virgil's apology, and would have started a fight had the principal not been there in the hallway watching the whole thing. Richie Foley comments on what Royce's trouble-making tendencies would result in: "Royce Axelrod: [[wikt:most likely to succeed|most]] [[Yearbook|likely]] to be sent [[Prison|Upstate]]."

In an alley, after school, Royce and Frankie having taken the metal briefcase, break into it with a screwdriver and discover three vials of a glowing purple liquid inside, along with some papers remaining hidden from a patrolling police car. They keep the briefcase with them now hoping to turn the "purple stuff" into "[[money|green stuff]]." Royce keeps the briefcase hidden in his locker because he can't keep it at home; according to him, "after that shoplifting thing, my mom's been on the lookout for stuff that don't belong to me." Royce then brings up the papers he found inside and tells Frankie they're going to stay behind after school so that Frankie can use the computers to look up the vial's codes "about the purple stuff."

When their research reveals that the 'purple stuff' they stole is, in fact, "Big Bang Super-Juice,"  Royce decides to inhale some the gas, only thinking about the super powers that the gas could give him, "like it did to F-Stop," but Frankie speaks out against it and their arguing causes a few drops to fall into a wastepaper basket, and before their actions go any further, the arrival of a teacher makes them leave the computer lab with the case hidden away. Their actions however, are not without consequences as a spider and a cockroach are exposed to the Big Bang liquid that spilled into the bin and grow to giant size.

The next day, Royce appears at school, and to Frankie's surprise, Royce had grown noticeably bigger, taller, and stronger than before, able to tear a hardback school textbook in half like it were paper, and, to Frankie's dismay, blows Frankie off as a "loser," now that the Big Bang liquid is starting to take effect. This is not enough for Royce; after the results of just smelling the gas, he plans to drink the liquid and see what will happen to him next. Royce never gets to go through with it; during a class test, Royce spontaneously mutates into a hideous, misshapen humanoid Bang-Baby, with pale pink skin and a primitive [[mindset|mental]]ity. The 'monster' that Royce has now become attacks anyone within reach. In the end, Static restrains Royce using the arms of a statue to confine him.

What became of Royce after these events is never revealed before the series cancellation.

====Frankie====
* '''Voice actor''': [[Rel Hunt]]

Frankie (last name unknown) is/was a student at Dakota Union High School. Frankie is a juvenile delinquent, who hung out with Royce all the time. For most of the episode, Frankie can be seen as Royce's lap dog, going along with all of Royce's antics, until Royce opts to expose himself to samples of Big Bang gas they had found in a metal briefcase they had stolen from a man on the subway. Frankie however, is against exposing himself to the gas, not wanting to become a freak.

When Royce's initial reaction to the gas has him grow taller in size, he more-or-less blows Frankie off as a "loser" in favor of his new status. When Royce mutates into a misshapen humanoid in the middle of class, Frankie is confronted by [[Static (DC Comics)|Virgil Hawkins]], who then knows that Frankie knows where the stolen briefcase with the vials of Big Bang gas was hidden. Frankie's fate after the events of the episode remains unknown.

===Leech===
* '''Voice actor''': [[David Arquette]]

Leech is able to do just what his name implies—leech the powers from any Bang Baby and keep them as his own (like his bloodsucking namesake, only different). Unfortunately, after a while the powers wear out, and Leech requires the host to be “sucked” dry again. Every time he drains an unwilling host's powers, he gets a physical feature of them, like a hairdo (as is the case with Hotstreak and Static) or something related to the host's power (like Talon's wing feathers on her arms). The dismissive way he talks about Bang-Babies implies that he is not one himself.

While he has some of the most powerful Bang Babies in his clutches, including Ebon, Hotstreak, Talon, and Static, he has the chance to steal Gear's powers, but not knowing he has any, Leech claims his powers were "the kind you could buy from a hardware store." His plans are foiled by Static and Lil’ Romeo. Remembering what [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] had said about his powers, Lil’ Romeo “shorts” out Leech after he absorbed Static’s powers, frying him and leaving him unconscious. He is based on [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] from [[Superman: The Animated Series]].

===Madelyn Spaulding===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Kimberly Brooks]]

Once attending Dakota Union High School, Madelyn Spaulding is a self-centered and controlling girl. During Season 2 in the episode [[List of Static Shock episodes|"Attack of the Living Brain Puppets"]], no one wants to vote for her for freshman class president, which is so stressful for her that it triggers her Bang-Baby powers. She uses her newly discovered powers to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] the students, making them behave like [[zombie]]s (or "brain puppets," as her victims were referred to in the episode.) Virgil is able to evade her mind control because his powers enhance his body's natural electrical field to block her power. Once she enters Richie's mind, she discovers [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]'s secret identity. After having Pops, Sharon, Richie, and all of the other Dakota Union students turn against him, as a result of Madelyn's mind control, Static electrifies her brain, erasing her memory of ever being a bang-baby and of Static's secret identity. At the end of this episode, Madelyn is hospitalized.

Madelyn shows up again later during Season 4 in the episode [[List of Static Shock episodes|"She-Back!"]]. She was released from the hospital but is not allowed back in school, forcing her to work at a comic book store. She is only able to remember a few moments from her encounter with Static. Her encounter with the superhero had resulted in the loss of her original powers and the gaining of new powers, which enable her to [[Telekinesis|telekinetically]] move things. This is triggered from her anger caused by thinking Virgil and Richie were laughing at her.

She frees members of the Meta- Breed from jail and takes the role as leader of the team. Her lead is short however, as she fights with [[Ebon (character)|Ebon]] over leadership. Static shows up and once again, shocks Madelyn's mind into submission and defeats the Meta-Breed with the help of Gear and She-Bang. This is the last episode Madelyn appears in.

===Puff===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Kimberly Brooks]]

Real name unknown. Puff's exposure to the Big-Bang granted her the ability to either partially or completely transmute her body back and forth from her human state into a mass of living [[gas]], in which state, Puff can become as light as air, allowing her to [[fly]] and become somewhat [[Intangibility|intangible]]. This also makes her vulnerable to [[water]] or large gusts of [[wind]] when she's in her gaseous state. The nature of her gaseous state is affected by her moods; this 'Mood-Gas' can become different vapors such as [[acidic]] (which she makes the most use out of; she also learned to compress these and blow them out like darts, calling them "Puff Darts"), [[knockout gas]], which she can exhale at targets and victims, or a [[combustible]] gas (which she can ignite using a [[blowtorch]]).

According to her first appearance in "Bent Out of Shape", in season 1, Puff and her partner in crime, Onyx dropped out of school after they got their powers; afterwards they started living on the street and Puff started calling herself "Puff". She has more of a temper than Onyx. When they see that a reward is being offered for the capture of [[#Rubberband Man|Rubberband Man]], Puff decides that they will become [[bounty hunter]]s. While Puff and Onyx consider themselves to be aspiring bounty hunters, they are basically no more than thieves and mercenaries working for whoever pays them the most. Puff is always seen accompanied by Onyx, but she does briefly lead a group of Bang-Babies she names the "Meta-Men", a team consisting of herself, Onyx, [[Hot-Streak]] and Carmendillo, whom she recruits to gang-up on Static and Gear; the Meta-Men, however, are easily dispatched by [[Flash in other media#DC animated universe|the Flash]], [[Batman]] and [[Hawkgirl#Justice League and Justice League Unlimited|Hawkgirl]]; after this, the Meta-Men never reassemble.

Puff originally appears in the Static Milestone comics, in a teamup with a girl called "Coil", a girl who could telekinetically control ropes. Her powers are similar to [[Vapor]] from the [[U-Foes]].

====Onyx====
* '''Voice actor''': [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]

Real name unknown. [[Onyx (comics)|Onyx]]'s exposure to the Big Bang transformed him into a giant purple-colored 'boy of stone', granting him superhuman strength and durability, but which also makes him physically slow, heavy and ungraceful. He essentially serves as Puff's strong man, who is able to crush and smash things in his way with very little effort. Onyx is usually more mellow than Puff and early on tries to be the voice of reason, but always does what she tells him to in order to get the job done.

Onyx has been Puff's longtime friend since before they were exposed to the Big Bang gas. According to his first appearance in "Bent Out of Shape", in season 1, Onyx and his partner in crime, Puff, dropped out of school after they got their powers; afterwards they live on the street and he becomes known as "Onyx". When they see that a reward is being offered for the capture of [[#Rubberband Man|Rubberband Man]], Puff decides that they will become [[bounty hunter]]s. While Puff and Onyx consider themselves to be aspiring bounty hunters, they are basically no more than thieves and mercenaries working for whoever pays them the most.

===Ragtag===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Richard Libertini]]

An old man who was affected by the Big Bang gas, Ragtag is able to transfer Bang Baby powers; this allows him to temporarily bestow abilities unto ordinary humans as well as relinquish those belonging to actual metahumans, but apparently he cannot make use of any powers himself. His only real "power" is the one he holds over the people he gives the powers too; once they wear off, they always return to him. In order for him to keep giving, they must steal for him. However, it works both ways as he can suck the powers out of a metahuman as well, as seen with his battle with Static.

[[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] eventually finds out about Ragtag's powers and takes him down with the help of [[Gear (Static Shock)|Richie]].

====Run, Jump, and Push====
* '''Voice actor''': [[Jason Marsden]] (Push), [[Kenny Blank]] (Jump), Philip Tanzini (Run)

The three cohorts of Ragtag, all of whom he granted special powers to do his dirty work for him. Run has super-speed, allowing him to move at a higher rate, both in locomotion and mobility. Jump can practically jump through space instantly - an ability preferably referred to as teleportation. Push can generate purple energy (usually from the hands) to repel or deflect objects (hence the name); Push can also use this power defensively by generating a protective sphere around himself, capable of holding outside forces at bay, at least for as long as he still has power in him. He can also use his powers to exercise a form of levitation where he channels his power to the ground to act as propulsion, propelling him high into the air. Run resembles DC's [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]] and Marvel's [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], Jump resembles [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Push resembles the [[Green Lantern]].

“Push” is really [[Gear (Static Shock)|Richie Foley]], friend of [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]. When Ragtag gives him his powers, he refuses to tell Static where they came from; but when Richie is forced to steal for Ragtag, he turns on Run and Jump and sounds the alarm. Static shows up and together they take Run and Jump down.

===Replay===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Neil Patrick Harris]]

Johnny Morrow was a child superstar, but as he got older, people forgot about him. When he was affected by the Big Bang gas, Johnny gained the ability to replicate himself, making stealing items and running from the cops incredibly easy. Replay is similar to [[Multiple Man]] from Marvel Comics.

In a tangle with [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], Johnny accidentally replicates Static instead of himself. With this Static clone, Johnny takes Static for a "crime spree" across Dakota, framing Static in the process. Static eventually discovers what’s going on and puts a stop to Replay with the help of Richie, who puts the fight between Static and his clone live on air, publicly revealing the duplicity thus clearing Static's name.

===Replikon===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Coolio]]

Replikon is a metamorph with the ability to change his appearance at will by altering his molecular structure. Jealous of his friend’s success, Replikon terrorizes [[Rubber-Band Man (Static Shock)|Rubber-Band Man]] about his record deal with [[A. J. McLean|A.J. McLean]]. Repilkon captures A.J. and poses as him to get a deal signed with Replikon instead of [[Rubber-Band Man (Static Shock)|Rubber-Band Man]]. His plan is eventually revealed, and [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] takes Replikon down.

===Specs and Trapper===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Patton Oswalt]] (Specs); [[Michael Rosenbaum]] (Trapper)

'''Specs and Trapper''' are two villains Static encounters in ''[[Static Shock]]''. They are upperclassmen in the Vanmoor Institute of Science who contemptuously pride themselves with being much smarter than anyone else. [[Patton Oswalt]] voices Specs and [[Michael Rosenbaum]] voices Trapper. In "The New Kid", Specs and Trapper, on the orders of [[Edwin Alva]], tell the students to build an electronic eye to track any electromagnetic energy source that is dialed into it; in actuality, they plan to use this device to track Static down, using a giant robot they control. However, they are defeated, and as a consequence, they seek [[revenge]] on Static.

Much later (in ''Trouble Squared''), they are hired by Edwin Alva Sr. to help restore his petrified son, but Specs and Trapper have other ideas; to effect their revenge on Static, they use the technical facilities to construct special equipment and adopt supervillain personae: Specs becomes '''Spectral''' and Trapper becomes '''Speedtrap'''. After they capture Static, however, Alva fires them because he is no longer primarily interested in capturing his enemy. So Specs and Trapper hit upon a new plan: destroy Edwin Alva's son. At the end, Static saves Alva's son, and Specs and Trapper are both taken to jail.

Some time later (in ''Where the Rubber Meets the Road'') Specs and Trapper have gone truly renegade. They pay a Bang-Baby called Tarmack to steal a state-of-the-art [[fusion power|fusion]] engine from Alva Industries. They plan to hold the city for ransom. They turn on Tarmack out of greed, and in the middle of a fight with Static, Gear, and Rubber-Band Man, Tarmack makes off with the fusion engine. In the end, Static and Gear defeat Specs and Trapper by disabling their gadgets, and Rubber-Band Man subdues Tarmack and disables the unstable fusion engine.

===Speed-Warp===
* '''Voice actor''': [[James Arnold Taylor]]

Speedwarp is a technology-user villain who is able to move very quickly. His real name is Eddie Felson. He was called "Weird Eddie, the nerd who all the other nerds would pick on", according to Virgil. Eddie knew Virgil and Daisy from a science camp and developed an obsessive crush on her. After getting an internship at a laboratory, he steals a device called the Time Gauntlet, which allows the wearer to move so quickly it appears that the world is standing still. He uses his new power for thievery and offers to steal gifts for Daisy, he also discovers Gear's and Static's identities with it. When his colleague Dr. McDonald discovers he stole the device, he leaves a message on Eddie's answering machine that he had seen security footage of him stealing the Time Gauntlet and advises him to turn himself in immediately. With the Time Gauntlet, Speedwarp uses it to reclaim the security footage Dr. McDonald was going to turn over to the cops and sabotage the airplane he is on (which Static and Gear safely landed). Gear designs a one-time use device for Static that mimics the Time Gauntlet's affects. Speedwarp uses the Time Gauntlet to crash the [[B2K]] concert to get to Daisy, but ends up fighting Static. When Speedwarp touches Static's device, it has the effect of causing him to move
extremely slow, and he can't expose the duo's identities. Static later has the police pick him up, but tells them not to rush because he now moved slower than a snail.

===Starburst===
* '''Voice actor''': [[David Faustino]]

Starburst is one of the new technology-user villains on the show. His real name is Brandon, a disgruntled employee of sleazy producer Bernie Rast. As "Starburst", he attempts to sabotage Bernie’s new reality TV show with Static and Gear. With his knowledge of physics technology, Starburst was able to create a device that absorbed Static’s powers and after it is activated, humiliates him on TV.

Static and Gear eventually discover the source to Starburst's powers and are able to disable his suit and reveal to Bernie Rast who it really is that was defeating them on his new reality show. When Bernie Rast learns of this, Brandon tells Bernie that he needed the money to start his own TV project. Starburst is taken to jail and is not heard from since. On a related note, Virgil reads an article to Richie that Starburst had learned how to create that technology at a Science Camp.

===Tantrum===
* '''Voice actor''': [[John Cho]]

Whenever Thomas Kim gets angry or upset, he transforms into the “Tantrum”, a purple-skinned, muscular, and violent metahuman that will destroy and wreak havoc on those he was angry at. Similar to Marvel's [[Hulk]], Tantrum is violent, strong, unintelligent, and sturdy; he is Thomas' polar opposite, like Bruce Banner is to the Hulk. They also both have contempt for their alter ego as when Static keeps saying Tantrum was Thomas, he replies, "No. Not Thomas. Thomas weak." Thomas first becomes Tantrum in a nearby restaurant, destroying the inside and hurling Static into a nearby elevator. The next day, after receiving a 99/100 on an essay from Mrs. Pettibone due to a typographical error, he attacks her in the school parking lot. Later Richie finds Thomas' near-perfect essay in the parking lot, leading Virgil and him to suspect Thomas was Tantrum. They confront Thomas about this in his home. Feeling threatened, accused, and teased, Thomas gets angry and sends them away, transforming into Tantrum just moments later. Back at the Hawkin's home, Richie and Virgil are watching some home movies, in particular one where baby Virgil is throwing a fit. His mother tells his sister "sometimes you've got to let them work through that crankiness." Minutes later Tantrum arrives, breaking down the front door in the process, angry at them for accusing and teasing him. Virgil manages to distract him so Richie can escape. Virgil (now Static) leads Tantrum away from the inner parts of the city and into an abandoned amusement park. Still enraged, Tantrum begins throwing equipment and debris with Static dodging and blocking but not attacking. [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is eventually able to “tire” Tantrum out by letting his rampage run its course without making his anger worse by attacking; by doing this, Tantrum reverts to his human form. Thomas' father seemed to raise his son for academic perfection. This is implied to cause social problems for Thomas, including stress and anger. After Static verifies that Thomas and Tantrum are the same person, he tells this to Mr. and Mrs. Kim, so that Thomas can get help for his problems. It is unknown if Thomas is one of the Bang Babies that is exposed to the Bang Baby cure and, if he is, whether he is reinfected again.

===Tarmack===
* '''Voice actor''': [[John DiMaggio]]

'''Tarmack''' is one of the characters in the series that originated from the 93-97 Milestone comic book series, making his first appearance in '''Static''' issue# 3. Tarmack would also appear in an issue of '''Blood Syndicate''' and '''Icon''', as well as the '''My Name is Holocaust''' miniseries. Revealed in the comics, Tarmack's real name is Charles Bell.

After the Big Bang, Bell became a transmorph, a large man of living hot [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]]; as such Tarmack is as strong and as tough as [[tar]], able to pummel his way through any obstacle, and is also able to project heat energy to melt obstacles. He is highly vulnerable to water.

Like his comic book incarnation, Tarmack is a character with low intelligence and this element was carried on to his animated portrayal in ''Where the Rubber Meets the Road''; where at intervals throughout the episode, other characters make fun of Tarmack's slow wits and how easily he was talked into doing a job for Specs and Trapper for so little money.

When he is recruited by [[#Specs and Trapper|Specs and Trapper]] to steal a device from [[Edwin Alva (comics)|Edwin Alva]], Tarmack decides he wants in on the ransom money. Unfortunately for him, [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]] interfere, leaving the ransom [[money]] to never arrive.

===Omnara===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Wendie Malick]]

Dr. Karen Roberts was the head of [[Edwin Alva (comics)|Edwin Alva]]’s project to find [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]’s secret identity and expose him, but her funding is pulled when Alva loses interest in the project following the revival of his son. Angry with Alva for going back on his word to fund her other project, she finds out Static’s identity herself and hires Puff and Onyx to capture his father as a hostage, forcing Static into stealing the components she needs for her project back from Alva Industries. Though she initiates the project successfully, Static is able to stop Omnara’s plan of controlling every computer in the world via a virus with the help of an anti-virus created by [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]]. She is last seen being carted away by the paramedics, her brain having "crashed" because of the anti-virus.

===Heavy Man===
* '''Voice actor''': [[Ron Perlman]]

Heavy Man was a scientist who worked with She-Bang's parents on a project involving cell matter absorption. The project was canceled but Heavy Man remained, using himself as a test subject. The results were strength and the ability to absorb non-living matter, but a gruesome look as well. Worse, he would eventually become as heavy as a statue and unable to move, so he kidnaps She-Bang's parents and threatens to poison them if they do not help him make an antidote. They devise the antidote, but he had absorbed so much matter by this time, it does not get through his thick skin. He leaves them to die, but Static, Gear, and She-Bang intervene and while Static fights him, Gear and She-Bang free her parents. He is beaten when he absorbs too much matter while fighting Static, accelerating the process and making him too heavy to move.
He is last seen being taken away by government officials; it is unknown if they ever find a cure.
