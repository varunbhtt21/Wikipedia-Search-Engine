The '''1983 [[ECAC Hockey]] Men's Ice Hockey Tournament''' was the 22nd [[ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|tournament]] in league history. It was played between March 4 and March 12, 1983.<ref>{{cite news|title=ECAC Tournament|url=http://www.augenblick.org/chha/ecac_trn.html|publisher=College Hockey Historical Archives|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref> Quarterfinal games were played at home team campus sites, while the 'final four' games were played at the [[Boston Garden]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. By winning the tournament, [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey|Harvard]] received the [[ECAC Hockey|ECAC]]'s automatic bid to the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].

==Format==
The tournament featured three rounds of play. The three teams that were division champions automatically qualified for the tournament while the remaining five seeds were given to the teams with the highest winning percentage. The top four seeds were given out to the three division champions and the top qualifier and assorted based upon winning percentage. The remaining four seeds were assigned to the other qualifiers and assorted based upon winning percentage. In the quarterfinals the first seed and eighth seed, the second seed and seventh seed, the third seed and sixth seed and the fourth seed and fifth seed played a two-game series to determine the winner. In the two games no overtime was permitted and if the two teams remained tied after the two games then a 10-minute mini-game would be played where a sudden-death overtime was allowed if the scheduled time did not produce a victor.<ref>{{cite news|title=College Hockey Notebook; Road to Final a 3-Way Route |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/08/sports/college-hockey-notebook-road-to-final-a-3-way-route.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=1988-03-08|accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> After the opening round every series becomes a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] game. In the semifinals, the highest seed plays the lowest remaining seed while the two remaining teams play with the winners advancing to the championship game and the losers advancing to the third place game. The tournament champion receives an automatic bid to the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].
