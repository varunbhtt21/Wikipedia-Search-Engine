==Plot==
Elmer is an elf who lives with a family of bakers. One day the family bakes a blueberry pie, which Elmer proceeds to jump into and eats his fill. Upon eating the pie, Elmer falls in love with blueberry pie and can't wait to get his hands on another one. Unfortunately, the family cannot see him, hear him, or feel him, and he is forced to wait for them to bake another delicious pie. The next week, Elmer notices that they are baking another pie and gets very excited, but is in vain when he smells baking apples. Frustrated with his inability to communicate or be seen by the family, Elmer sets out to try and alert the bakers to his presence. To do this, he begins helping out around the house making beds, washing dishes, and doing other chores to get noticed. Though his efforts are appreciated, the family continues not to notice him and they bake another pie, cherry this time. Deciding he would try to determine whether he likes a different flavored pie better than blueberry, Elmer jumps into the fresh-baked pie and starts eating. Disappointed in the taste, and not realizing that the cherries stained his feet red, Elmer hops out of the pie and walks away. The family notices his footprints and realize that the it was the little elf who had been doing the house work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunch.com/Reviews/book/Blueberry_Pie_Elf-wiki-1656382.html |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424233020/http://www.lunch.com/Reviews/book/Blueberry_Pie_Elf-wiki-1656382.html |archivedate=April 24, 2014 }}</ref>
