Text : {{one source|date=October 2017}}
'''Bielsk Land''', (Polish: '''ziemia bielska''', named after the town of [[Bielsk Podlaski]]) was an administrative unit ([[ziemia]]) of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Created in 1413, it originally belonged to the Lithuanian [[Trakai Voivodeship]]. In 1513, it became part of newly created [[Podlaskie Voivodeship (1513–1795)|Podlasie Voivodeship]], and from 1569 until 1795, it belonged to the Kingdom of Poland.

Bielsk Land had its capital in Bielsk Podlaski, local [[sejmik]]s also took place in this town, with two envoys elected to the [[Sejm]] in [[Warsaw]]. Bielsk Podlaski however was not the largest town of the land, as it was smaller than [[Bransk]], [[Tykocin]] and [[Goniadz]].

The Land of Bielsk was created after a merger of territories of three smaller entities: 
* the land administered by medieval [[Gord (archaeology)|gords]] at Bielsk itself and [[Suraz]]. Until the mid-14th century, it had been part of the Land of [[Drohiczyn]], 
* former [[Mazovia]]n [[Castellany]] of Swiecko, which was seized by Lithuania in the mid-14th century, 
* the [[powiat|county]] of [[Goniadz]], which had been part of Mazovian Land of [[Wizna]]. It was captured by the [[Teutonic Knights]], who handed it over to Grand Duke [[Vytautas]]. Goniadz County retained some administrative independence, with its own land court.

Altogether, Bielsk Land was the largest of the three lands of Podlasie Voivodeship - it made its northern half, with such towns, as Bielsk, Bransk, Tykocin, [[Goniadz]], [[Kleszczele]], [[Bialystok]], [[Knyszyn]], [[Choroszcz]], [[Rajgrod]], [[Narew, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Narew]], [[Augustowo, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Augustowo]], [[Orla, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Orla]], [[Bocki]] and [[Jasionowka]].

Bielsk Land had two [[starosta]]s - those of Knyszyn and Tykocin.
