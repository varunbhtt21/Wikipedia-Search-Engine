Title : Czersk Land
Text : '''Czersk Land''' (Polish: '''ziemia czerska''', named after the town of [[Czersk, Masovian Voivodeship|Czersk]]) was an administrative unit ([[ziemia]]) of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. With its capital in the town of Czersk, it belonged to the [[Masovian Voivodeship (1526–1795)|Masovian Voivodeship]]. 

The history of Czersk Land as a separate administrative unit dates back to 1245, when Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] moved the seat of the [[castellany]] from [[Grójec]] to Czersk, making Czersk the major urban and political center of southern Mazovia. In 1377, [[Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia]] called a council in [[Sochaczew]], during which he disbanded castellanies, and following the example of the Kingdom of Poland, created ten [[ziemia|lands]], all divided into [[powiat|counties]]. Therefore, the Land of Czersk was established, with three counties: Czersk, [[Warka]] and [[Grójec]]. It stretched from [[Minsk Mazowiecki]] to Grojec, along both banks of the [[Vistula]], including the town of [[Garwolin]]. 

Czersk Land was the second biggest land of the province of [[Mazovia]], after the Land of [[Lomza]]. Its total area was 4042 sq. kilometers; Czersk County had an area of 2440 km<sup>2</sup>., Grojec County 697 km<sup>2</sup>., and Warka County, 904 km<sup>2</sup>. 

In 1526, Czersk Land was annexed into Poland, continuing to exist as a separate administrative unit within Mazovian Voivodeship, with local [[sejmik]]s taking place at Czersk, and two envoys sent to the [[Sejm]] in [[Warsaw]].
