== History ==

The Nordzucker AG was formed by the merger of the Braunschweig-based Zuckerverbund Nord AG (ZVN) and the Uelzen-based Zucker-Aktiengesellschaft Uelzen-Braunschweig (ZAG) in 1997. 

Between 1999 and 2003, Nordzucker expanded to Eastern Europe and acquired its Polish plants Chełmża and Opalenica and its Slovakian plant Trenčianska Teplá.<ref name="175 Years of Nordzucker – A History of Sugar">175 Years of Nordzucker – A History of Sugar, Braunschweig, 2013.</ref>

In 2003, the Nordstemmen-based Union-Zucker Südhannover GmbH was integrated into the Group.

In March 2009, Nordzucker acquired the Copenhagen-based sugar manufacturer '''Nordic Sugar''' A/S (formerly known as [[Danisco]] Sugar) for EUR 730 million. Nordic Sugar runs sugar plants in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Lithuania.<ref>[http://www.foodbev.com/news/nordzucker-acquires-danisco-sugar#.U1aGx1dFpK2 Foodbev article.] Retrieved 24 April 2014.</ref>

The roots of the company date back to the year 1838, when the Klein Wanzleben plant, the first plant of the company that is still in service today, was founded.<ref name="175 Years of Nordzucker – A History of Sugar"/>
