I'm not sure what's going on here. Looking at {{Google|sunscorch -wikipedia}}, this term refers to a condition in plants, perhaps similar to (but not the same as) animal sunburn. If this term is a synonym for [[sun scald]] or [[leaf scorch]] or something, we could retarget. Otherwise, I think we're looking at [[WP:REDLINK]] deletion. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 21:53, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Delete''' per one of BDD's suggestions</s>, though I can see the others I think that is unlikely search term unless you are a regular listener to [[Gardener's Question Time]]. Let the search engine do it; it has got a ''little'' better in the eight years I have been editing here. Not much, admittedly, but a little. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 22:42, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Retarget''', probably to [[leaf scorch]]. In ''Pests, Diseases and Disorders of Garden Plants'', [[Stefan Buczacki]] and Keith Harris state that high temperatures can induce sun scald on bark and fruit, but then add that "Occasionally leaves, especially of glasshouse or house plants, can be scorched in a similar way .... Most commonly the scorch symptoms result in papery, pale brownish patches on the affected parts." [[User:PaleCloudedWhite|PaleCloudedWhite]] ([[User talk:PaleCloudedWhite|talk]]) 08:23, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::I don't know it is better to redirect to plants being scorched rather than humans being sunburnt. Can we at least agree, before we argue that, that all of them should go one way or another to the same target? [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 11:19, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::All redirecting to the same place seems fine to me, and as per [[User:PaleCloudedWhite|PaleCloudedWhite's]] suggestion, [[leaf scorch]] would be the best choice. The two pages [[leaf scorch]] and [[sun scald]] should have hatnotes directing to one another, which I've just added. [[Leaf scorch]] is a better target because its effects are more noticeable to lay people, whereas [[sun scald]] seems unlikely to be familiar except to specialists. [[User:Sminthopsis84|Sminthopsis84]] ([[User talk:Sminthopsis84|talk]]) 12:01, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::::''''Agree with Sminthopsis84'''. I think you are right to redirect them to the plants instead of the animals. I haven't heard [[Stefan Buczacki]] on [[Gardener's Question Time]] for years &ndash; did he jump or was he pushed? He was a favourite when [[Clay Jones]] presented it, may he ever rest in peace. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 16:05, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::At least Clay Jones is still [[pushing up the daisies]]. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 02:11, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Delete'''. Anberlin's fifth studio album, which is entitled ''[[Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place]]'' and was released in 2010, now has its own well-fleshed-out article. An article was created at this title in early 2010 and was quickly redirected, essentially, as a [[WP:CRYSTAL]] violation. That's fine, but "Anberlin's fifth studio album" is not a plausible search term for Anberlin nor for ''Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place''; this placeholder-style article title is moot, since the album in question now has a name and was released years ago (they are now working on their seventh album, which also has a name). The redirect history has nothing worth saving; it's two sentences of speculation on the album months before its release, with no sourcing. [[User:Chubbles|Chubbles]] ([[User talk:Chubbles|talk]]) 20:01, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Delete''' per Chubbles.

:The result of the discussion was <!-- Template:Rfd top--> '''keep'''.  Though the commentators are split on whether this redirect should be deleted, the arguments and policy clearly point this way.  Redirects are solely search aids and the lack of neutrality is not a ground for deletion; see [[WP:RNEUTRAL]] that states "Perceived lack of neutrality in redirect names is therefore not a sufficient reason for their deletion.".  The default position is that redirects are kept. For deletion a ground of [[WP:RFD#DELETE]] must normally be present and no commentator has suggested such a ground. I also take the points that there is no ambiguity and that this is a used redirect. Finally, this is a long established redirect so deletion could break external links. NAC.

::@{{ping|Steel1943}} Arrrgh, sorry I just had a minor heart attack from Steely's grammar: "Due to them participating"... how about "because he participated"? It takes talent to make three grammatical errors in four words &ndash; I have to try really hard to do that. "Due to" does not mean "Because", see Fowler. I am not "them", I am singular. "participating" is continuous present tense, not past tense.

*'''Comment'''. I created the noticeboard, obviously (it's in my userspace) and also the redirect, which is in Wikipedia space, so I'd rather not register a formal "keep" here; let the uninvolved decide. But I'd like to suggest for your consideration a) that the redirect is useful, and b) that it's not needed for any other noticeboard.

:The redirect is useful, in that it's in use. People mention it.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Wikipedia:AN/S] Plus, an editor recently made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jimmy_Wales&diff=606711060&oldid=605772665 these] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jimmy_Wales&diff=next&oldid=606711721 edits] to [[Talk:Jimmy Wales]], probably intending them for [[User talk:Jimmy Wales]], and [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] reverted with some advice in the edit summary: "remove: wrong page, you want [[User talk:Jimbo Wales]] although [[WP:AN/S]] is more appropriate". The user followed the advice and indeed posted the text next at the dedicated noticeboard for clueless complaints — the first real complaint there![https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bishonen/Clueless_complaints_about_Sitush_noticeboard&diff=606948847&oldid=599218681] And was that not a good thing? It saved not only [[WP:ANI]] but [[User talk:Jimbo Wales]] from bloat. Note also that the IP had by then already received excellent advice from [[User:NeilN]],[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jimmy_Wales&diff=prev&oldid=606711480] in the form of a reference to [[Wikipedia:Raju (Kshatriya) sources|a page dedicated to the sources of Raju]], many of which sources were being offered by the IP. (Great work by Joshua Jonathan there.) Absolutely serious and useful advice, to which the IP was not receptive. S/he did go to the source page and edit it, but not usefully and not showing any comprehension of it.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Raju_%28Kshatriya%29_sources&diff=606804660&oldid=604306954] I don't see what we can do next, except, indeed, invite him/her to a noticeboard for clueless complaints. But, you cry, this RfD does not deny the usefulness of the [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ''noticeboard''; what about the usefulness of the ''redirect''? I'm coming to that: ''would Johnuniq have referred the IP user to the special Sitush noticeboard if he, John, hadn't had the easily remembered redirect WP:AN/S in his mind?'' I don't know. He might. Since I've now pinged John, perhaps he'll come and tell us.

:The redirect is not needed for any other noticeboard. As Basalisk says, "If there were a pressing need for WP:AN/S to redirect somewhere else more important then fair enough, but there isn't." If a Wikipedia space noticeboard which that shortcut would be appropriate for is created one day, then indeed fair enough, but that day it'll turn out that the elasticity of Wikipedia will make it extremely easy to re-direct this redirect. If we want to keep the redirect WP:AN/S clean and pure and folded away with lavender in the meantime, so be it, even though it seems overly pious to me. [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] &#124; [[User talk:Bishonen|talk]] 22:49, 6 May 2014 (UTC).
::Bishonen you can do whatever you like in your userspace, but i dont think we should condone trap-redirects from sounds-like-official-titles which only serve the purpose of intentionally misleading new editors. Im sure you can find other ways to do so. If we let this particular cross-ns redirect stay what would prevent WP:AN/B and all the other letters of the alphabet, and then people can get into using unicode redirects to be even sneakier. --[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 01:34, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::…? I'm a little taken aback by the [[WP:ABF|ABF]] here. You're sure I can find other ways to intentionally mislead new editors? Gee, that went [[WP:NPA|nuclear]] fast. Is my reputation for what you call sneakiness and entrapment worse than I thought?

:::Furthermore, it's very wiki-politically correct of you to [[WP:AGF|AGF]] that the dynamic IPs and caste-warrior sock drawers at pages like [[Raju]] are genuinely new users. But perhaps you might ask Sitush and the other people who defend these pages (but it's mainly Sitush, and that's why there are so many clueless complaints), if they think it's a reasonable assumption. Some of them may be new some of the time, of course.

:::Also, I think it's only to somewhat experienced editors such as you or me, that the WP:AN/x formula sounds "official", and that's because we've seen its variants a thousand times. The logic of saying WP:AN/S would (intentionally, yet) mislead ''new users'' is flawed. It might momentarily mislead tribal elders such as RexxS or John (only until they looked at the actual page, of course), but how would it sound any more "official" to the genuinely new than any other [[WP:WOTTA|alphabet soup]]? [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] &#124; [[User talk:Bishonen|talk]] 15:22, 7 May 2014 (UTC).
::::Bish, I'm not '''assuming''' any bad faith at all. You, and everyone else defending this redirect, explicitly are doing so because it could possibly work - i.e. it could possibly mislead someone, and indeed you [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bishonen/Clueless_complaints_about_Sitush_noticeboard&diff=607069951&oldid=607051207 were happy] when it actually did. Now, whether misleading troublesome users is good or bad for the wiki I'll let wiser souls decide, I just don't think we should sanction it with a trick redirect. The very point of the redirect is simple - to mislead, and the way it has been used, to date, is to mislead, so again I'm not assuming anything, you've all been very upfront about it. I have no idea what goes on at caste pages and I hope I never do - and if there really is a need for a different forum and a way to ease the pressure on Sitush, then create a real board, under wikiproject India or somewhere that is serious, where centralized discussions about caste issues can be had. But I think this approach is still mean spirited - I'm not going to nominate your userpage for deletion, but the redirect has to go. We have a friendly system of warnings for obvious vandals, and our templates still direct them once they're blocked to reasonable, serious pages - we don't send them off to boards where other admins will poke at them and laugh.
::::Finally re: alphabet soup, I'm not convinced - every day I learn one new acronym or redirect to some crucial section or key board. I think a complete newbie with 3 edits may not understand the context, but one with 500 or 1000 who has already seen references to [[WP:AN]] and [[WP:ANI]] may be successfully trolled. We have to remember also that English is not a first language for all editors here, and humor or sarcasm is interpreted differently by different people. Again, it's an itsy bitsy redirect and you can still have fun without it, just keep it to userspace - and I'd suggest putting the humor tag back on, but I guess that would spoil the fun?--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 15:36, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::You seem to be missing my point. I have no notion of misleading anybody, least of all new editors. (It never occurred to me that anybody would actually ''post'' at the Sitush noticeboard. It took three months before anybody did, even though it's been recommended in [[User talk:Sitush/Editnotice|Sitush's edit notice]] for most of that time.) I really don't care that much about the redirect, nor in fact about the userpage — it has perhaps served its purpose (which was to register support for Sitush and cheer him up a little, because his wikilife seemed pretty miserable). Any admin should feel free to fucking speedy either of them. But I wasn't expecting the kinds of slurs to my good intentions that you have posted: {{tq|"which only serve the purpose of intentionally misleading new editors. Im sure you can find ''other ways to do so''"}}. If you didn't mean that the way it reads, why don't you man up and apologize, or alternatively stop dancing around and take ownership of your words. [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] &#124; [[User talk:Bishonen|talk]] 17:47, 7 May 2014 (UTC).
::::::I think you're missing mine. I first came across this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=607074785&oldid=607074437 here], where {{ping|Liz}} pointed out that this redirect may be confusing. Read what you wrote above: {{tq|The redirect is useful, in that it's in use...The user followed the advice and indeed posted the text next at the dedicated noticeboard for clueless complaints — the first real complaint there. And was that not a good thing?}}. You also said, earlier, the following: {{tq|Sitush has been known to use the shortcut to point the group "users of extreme cluelessness complaining on his page" (this is in my opinion a group distinct from the group "general user") to the dedicated noticeboard. Do them good. Anyway, none of them have posted on the Sitush noticeboard yet (which is frustrating, but that's by the way)...}} ([[User:Bishonen/Archive_18|here]], in response to {{ping|NE Ent}}). Thus, in your own words, you are saying this redirect is useful, in that it will send clueless editors to a board where they will post things that will henceforth be ignored (or they will be mocked), and you have in the past expressed disappointment that it hadn't yet trapped anyone. When I said "I'm sure you can find other ways to do so", what I meant was, you could find other reasonable shortcuts that aren't so close to the core admin boards, or even simple things like hiding wiki links like this: "post your complaint at [[User:Bishonen/Clueless complaints about Sitush noticeboard|WP:AN/S]]", etc, which is what Sitush did in his edit notice and which results in the full title appearing in the URL, unlike when you use a redirect. I wasn't suggesting that you regularly walk around the wiki trying to trap new users, and I'm sorry if you took it that way - I simply meant that you, and people defending this specific redirect, clearly '''intend''' the redirect to mislead (now maybe you say this is not intended to mislead new users, it is intended to mislead clueless users, but I think that's semantic, it's not that big of a difference). You also clearly '''intend''' the whole thing as a big inside joke, and I'm sure Sitush appreciates your effort to lighten his load, and I have nothing against humor. I just think the redirect goes one step too far. If you didn't intend to mislead, you wouldn't have created it, and you wouldn't be celebrating your first victim. Maybe the victim is a caste-warrior, maybe they deserve it, who knows - but the '''intent to mislead''' is clear from the way the redirect is named and cannot be denied, and your removal of the {{tl|Humor}} tag from the page in question furthers the point. The only corrective action I'm suggesting is not sanctioning such cross-namespace redirects with one that is very close to a number of serious admin boards. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&prefix=AN%2F&namespace=4] for example, the vast majority of these are serious, except [[Wikipedia:AN/ISUCKSTHELIFEOUTOFYOU]]. You're acting all offended that I dare to suggest you are trying to mislead users, yet you openly celebrate your success at having done so.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 18:27, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' There is and will continue to be an enormous amount of nonsense in the topic underlying WP:AN/S—a really gigantic pool of muck. The editors who try to maintain related articles need all the support they can get, and a very unusual humor redirect is an important tool to show support for those who have to deal with a very unusual situation. The benefit of keeping AN/S is that humor is a good defense against relentless attacks, while no benefit would arise from deleting it. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 01:45, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Delete''' the redirect, '''Keep''' the page</s>. [[WP:POINT]]y. We can't have WP namespace redirecting to user namespace, sorry. It is a bit of a personal attack as well. I do realise it is good-humoured and is not intended seriously, but unfortunately it can ''seem'' that way. I've tried the same kind of thing with redirects or stub articles for [[Countries that are not the United States]], [[Oxygen thief]] and things like that, and they've very quickly got deleted. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 07:13, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Refuse jurisdiction'''. This is a patently a good-natured spat between three editors that should be discussed between them and not come to RfD. Turn away, refuse jurisdiction: let them sort it out amongst themselves. I wish Wikipedia occasionally was a bit more humourous; [[User:Sitush]] has replied in good nature and obviously doesn't find the page offensive, the problem is that a casual reader will come to it and find this to-and-fro instead of an encyclopaedia. Much as I enjoyed it, I think the page should stay but the redirect should go, and then to continue it at RfD is compounding the felony. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 16:37, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::I'm a bit confused. Isn't RfD the proper jurisdiction for deleting a redirect?

*'''Keep'''--though I'm obviously somewhat involved here, given the topping of Drmies one can order with their complaint. The fact that the thing is called "'''CLUELESS''' complaint generator" (and the image of the dog, perhaps) is a dead giveaway to anyone but the clueless--and those clueless ones have generated an enormous amount of hullabaloo over nothing, causing disruption for many. In other words, that the redirect would mislead (the rationale for the RfD) is not easy to see, given that [[Wikipedia:Competence is required|competence is required]].

But all roads lead to Rome: an external search brings up The Free Dictionary and so on, which doesn't mention it, and other sites such as dictionary.com and onelook.com and dbpedia.org, none of which mentions it (the last mirrors content partially from Wikipedia but at least ''says'' it does); I presume their Web crawlers see the title on Wikipedia and kinda add it in to their own redirect mechanisms but there is no mention in any of them.

My guideline is, would someone be likely to search for it this way? The stats suggest not (fewer than 1 hit per day, and that's just this discussion).

This is ridiculous, it is titled Spanish or Portuguese, but with bad grammar [[User:TheChampionMan1234|The]][[User talk:TheChampionMan1234|ChampionMan]][[Special:Contributions/TheChampionMan1234|1234]] 04:05, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' the first page is not the Main Page, it's the portal at www.wikipedia.org ; further, this is not English, and this is not the Spanish/Portuguese Wikipedia either. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.206|65.94.171.206]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.206|talk]]) 06:06, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' also as I think it was Wikid77 pointed out before, ''the main page is the '''easiest''' page to find''. While I am not averse to foreign-language links if they are genuinely helpful, this is just stupid. Presumably it would be la primera pagina or el premero pagino, if anything to sort out the gender; but in Portuguese it is {{lang|pt|Página_principal}} and in Spanish it is {{lang|es|Portada}}, as [[Nigel Molesworth|any fule kno]] checking the interwiki links on the left. So this is just silly. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 08:27, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
