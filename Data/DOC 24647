'''Giffen Hill''' is a highpoint on the campus of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] in [[Arbutus, Maryland]], and is a historic site of the [[Manual Labor School for Indigent Boys]]. The hill is a gathering place near the [[UMBC Stadium]], and will be adjacent to the future site of the UMBC Events Center, planned to open in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umbc.edu/fm/documents/UMBCSpringForum2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503055108/http://www.umbc.edu/fm/documents/UMBCSpringForum2014.pdf |archivedate=May 3, 2014 }}</ref>

==History==

Originally, the site was the location of the brick residence for the [[Manual Labor School for Indigent Boys]], constructed in 1860.<ref name="Marker">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcpl.info/sites/default/files/images/community/images/community-history-arbutus-plaque.jpg|title=Image of bronze marker|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}</ref> The school was also simply known as the Baltimore Farm School, due to agriculture being the main focus of curriculum. Numerous renowned Baltimoreans were involved with the school's operations, like [[Johns Hopkins]], and Gustav W. Lurman Jr. who both served on the school's board of directors. The Farm School operated from 1839 to 1922, until it was absorbed by the [[Spring Grove Hospital Center]], and then subsequently transferred to its present owner, the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]].<ref name="Marker" />

In May 1996, the Coalition for the Preservation of Southwestern Baltimore County, the Catonsville Historical Trust, and the Baltimore County Historical Trust dedicated the historical site.<ref name="Greenspaces">{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=208426867276218721859.0004e401e6c1e06f6272a&dg=feature|title=UMBC Greenspaces map|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}</ref> UMBC named the hill for Vice President Sallie Giffen.<ref name="Greenspaces" /> Historic [[white oak]] trees also occupy the historic hilltop.
