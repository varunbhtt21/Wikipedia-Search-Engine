* '''Support''' the one corrected for lens distortion. The Minster in Bad Doberan is a medieval building of the highest technical and artistic perfection. It is not new, if anyone would think that, it is an old building, and it is handmade bricks and the altar is really unique. High EV, what is it now, folks? It is a highly spectacular building, don't we want this one for our Wikipedia?

::Would a closeup of the altar, carved around 1300 (!), be better in terms of visual interest? [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 00:25, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

::This picture need more input, relist maybe? [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 14:01, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Picture feels a little weird. Was it was taken slightly off-centre, then perspective-corrected without taking that into account? Because the altar doesn't line up quite with the centre of the arched roof behind it. But I'm not really sure...  <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])</sup></span> 23:49, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
