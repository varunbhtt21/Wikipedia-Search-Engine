Title : Louis Mollier
Text : Rev. '''Louis Marie Mollier''' (29 October 1846 in [[Chamb√©ry]], Savoie, France - 10 February 1911 in [[Clyde, Kansas|Clyde]], [[Cloud County, Kansas]]) was a priest of the Roman Catholic Church who served in the pioneer regions of Kansas, United States, from 1874 to his death in 1911.

His first assignment after his 1874 ordination was to the parish at [[St. Joseph, Kansas]]. It was from this base that Mollier traveled by horse to communities as distant as 120 miles.

Mollier provided spiritual guidance to the villages as they were formed and advised on the establishment of new parishes as the communities grew. Although he is credited with building churches in these communities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olphconcordia.org/home/history |title=History |publisher=Olphconcordia.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/cloud/1903/concordia6.shtml |title=1903 Cloud County Kansas History p.197-206 |publisher=Skyways.lib.ks.us |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref> it is more accurate that his influence as one closely involved with the pioneer and territorial residents was recognized by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina|Diocese of Concordia]] in establishing new parishes as needed.<ref>http://www.la-commanderie.org/uploads/13-mollier-louis.pdf</ref>
