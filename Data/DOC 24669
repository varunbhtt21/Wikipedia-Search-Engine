==Research areas==
Greenspan’s principal research interests lie in [[moral philosophy]], [[moral psychology]], and the [[philosophy of action]].<ref name=obio>{{cite web|title=Patricia S. Greenspan {{!}} Department of Philosophy|url=http://philosophy.umd.edu/people/greenspan|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Her work has ranged among several interconnected subtopics, as follows:

*[[Deontic logic]]: Greenspan’s Ph.D. dissertation and her first published article dealt with the logic of ought-judgments, arguing that “oughts” are “time-bound” and that wide-scope conditional ought-judgments allow for detachment only when their antecedents are no longer avoidable.<ref>Derived Obligation: Some Paradoxes Escaped (unpublished Ph.D. Dissertation, Harvard, 1972); “Conditional Oughts and Hypothetical Imperatives,” Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 259-76.</ref>
*[[Free will]] and [[moral responsibility]]: Greenspan’s second major article and ongoing work argues that freedom depends on the difficulty of doing otherwise, rather than simply ability, and hence admits of degrees.<ref>“Behavior Control and Freedom of Action,” Philosophical Review, 87 (1978), 225-40.</ref>  Greenspan’s developed view also distinguishes between freedom and responsibility, arguing that the compatibility of responsibility with free will does not imply a similar compatibilist view of freedom.<ref>“Free Will and Rational Coherency,” Philosophical Issues, 22 (2012), 185-200.</ref>  Greenspan has applied some of her work on these subjects to questions arising from the U.S. Genome Project and to the issue of the responsibility of psychopaths.<ref>"Free Will and the Genome Project," Philosophy and Public Affairs, 22 (1993), 31-4; "Responsible Psychopaths," Philosophical Psychology, 16 (2003), 417-29.</ref>
*[[Emotion]]:  Greenspan next began a long-running project on the rational and moral role of emotion with the publication of an article defending the rationality of ambivalent emotions in an argument designed to cast doubt on attempts by several contemporary philosophers to equate emotions with evaluative judgments or beliefs.<ref>“A Case of Mixed Feelings: Ambivalence and the Logic of Emotion,” in A. O. Rorty (ed.), Explaining Emotions (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 191-204</ref>  Her first book argues instead that emotions amount to feelings with an evaluative intentional content short of belief that makes them both susceptible to a distinctive kind of rational assessment and important in a distinctive way to rational and moral motivation, paradoxically serving as a counterforce to weakness of will.<ref>Emotions and Reasons: An Inquiry into Emotional Justification (New York: Routledge, Chapman and Hall, 1988). [0-413-90049-2]. Cf. M. K. Morris, ”Review of Emotions and Reasons by Patricia S. Greenspan,” Noûs, 26 (1992), 250-252; B. N. G., “Review of Emotions and Reasons: an Inquiry into Emotional Justification by Patricia S. Greenspan, Philosophical Quarterly, 46 (1996), 281-282.</ref>  A second book and some later essays simplify this account, defend it against some common objections, and apply it to further issues, as outlined below.
*[[ethical dilemma|Moral dilemmas]]: In an essay and in her second book Greenspan argues for the coherency of irresolvable moral dilemmas, cases in which all alternatives are forbidden.<ref>Practical Guilt: Moral Dilemmas, Emotions, and Social Norms (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995); cf.  “Moral Dilemmas and Guilt,” Philosophical Studies, 43 (1983), 117–125.  Also, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-dilemmas; T. McConnell, “Review of P.S. Greenspan’s Practical Guilt,” Ethics, 106 (1996), 854-856.</ref>  She sees dilemmas as a result of the need to establish the motivational force of morality by forging a connection in childhood between emotions and rules simple enough to be learned at that early stage.<ref>Cf. “Learning Emotions and Ethics,” in P. Goldie (ed.), Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Emotion, pp. 539-59 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010).</ref> 
*[[Metaethics]]: Greenspan defends what she calls a “social artifact” version of moral realism, in which morality is invented, yet “real” (in the sense of mind-independent) insofar as it reflects the requisites of life in a viable social group.<ref>Practical Guilt; cf. "Moral Responses and Moral Theory: Socially-Based Externalist Ethics," Journal of Ethics, 2 (1998), 103-22.</ref>  She sees emotion as essential to the motivational force of moral judgments in general terms, though not necessarily on each occasion of use or for every agent.  She thus departs from contemporary “internalist” understandings of moral meaning that deny the possibility of understanding a moral judgment without being motivated by it.
*[[Practical reason]]s and [[rationality]]: Greenspan argues that emotions play a significant role in rational thought, as noted.<ref>For simpler reworking of her original argument cf. “Emotional Strategies and Rationality,”  Ethics, 110 (2000), 469-87; “Emotions, Rationality, and Mind/Body,” Philosophy, 52 (2003), 113-25; "Practical Reasoning and Emotion," in A. Mele and P. Rawling (eds.), Oxford Handbook of Rationality (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004); “Craving the Right: Emotions and Moral Reasons,” in C. Bagnoli (ed.), Morality and the Emotions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012).</ref>  In recent work she gives an independent account of practical reasons as registering or responding to criticism.<ref>"Practical Reasons and Moral 'Ought'," in Russ Schafer-Landau (ed.), Oxford Studies in Metaethics, Vol. II (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 172-94; cf. "Asymmetrical Reasons," in M. E. Reicher and J. C. Marek (eds.), Experience and Analysis: Proceedings of the 27th International Wittgenstein Symposium (Vienna: oebv&hpt, 2005), pp. 387-94.</ref>  The account allows for the rational permissibility in certain cases of action against one’s strongest reason and is brought to bear on issues including the rationality of "satisficing" (choosing less than the best) and the notion of “imperfect” obligation (an obligation that leaves room for options).<ref>“Resting Content: Sensible Satisficing?,” American Philosophical Quarterly, Special Issue on Rationality, 46 (2009), 305-17; "Making Room for Options: Moral Reasons, Imperfect Duties, and Choice," Social Philosophy and Policy, 27 (2010), 181-205.</ref>
