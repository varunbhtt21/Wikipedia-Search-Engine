The '''Veterans' Memorial Hall''', formerly the '''First Universalist Society Meeting House''', is a historic community building on [[New Hampshire Route 32]] in [[Richmond, New Hampshire]].  The 1-1/2 story clapboarded wood-frame building was built in 1837 by members of the local [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist]] congregation.  Richmond was the birthplace of [[Hosea Ballou]], a theologian influential in the development of Universalism; he left the town before this building was built.  As originally built, the meeting house had a small tower and belfry, which were removed in 1892 when the building was acquired by the local Grange.  The building has seen only modest external alterations since then; the interior has had most of its religious trappings removed, but is also otherwise little altered.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=86002160}}|title=NRHP nomination for Veterans' Memorial Hall|publisher=National Register of Historic Places|accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref>

The building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.<ref name="nris"/>  It is now owned by the town.
