John ONeill of ''[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]]'' comments: "It was a beautiful product that rose above the gimmick at its core. Sanctuary was the city where anything could happen, where characters created by some of the best fantasy writers of the generation crossed paths and shared adventures. Chaosium's ''Thieves' World'' became the setting where gamers of every stripe could likewise gather and share a beer... and perhaps an expedition into the caverns beneath The Maze together."<ref>https://www.blackgate.com/2013/04/18/vintage-treasures-chaosiums-thieves-world/</ref>
