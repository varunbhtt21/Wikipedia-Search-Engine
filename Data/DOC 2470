'''''Sol da Justiça''''' is the fourteenth album in the live praise and worship series of [[contemporary worship music]] by [[Diante do Trono]].

== About the project ==
In the pre-recording of the ''Sol da Justiça'', the mining group released ''[[Aleluia]]'', recorded at the Cowboy Park Barretos, in [[Barretos]].

The album was recorded in Natal. On the disc, the group manages to bring a new musical influence in his music, being different from ''[[Aleluia]]'', its predecessor. The orchestra band was absent in the work.

The work was also responsible for making the group receiving his first [[Latin Grammy]] nomination in the category Best Portuguese Language Christian Album in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latingrammy.com/en/winners/116 |title=Christian |publisher=Grammy Latino |date= |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928013111/http://www.latingrammy.com/en/winners/116 |archivedate=28 September 2012 |df= }}</ref> Also received several nominations Trophy Promises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trofeupromessas.com.br/vote/ |title=Vote |publisher=Troféu Promessas |date= |accessdate=30 August 2012 }}</ref>

On 16 July 2011, with an estimated 120,000 people in Beach of Meio public recording of the album was made. But by heavy rains leading up to that day, the recording was impaired by time. So to solve the problem, two days after the group recorded the album again, but in the Riachuelo Theatre, also in Natal. The recording was attended by Asaph Borba and former members of the group, who participated in a medley singing the older songs the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supergospel.com.br/analise_cd-diante-do-trono-sol-da-justica_2986.html |title=CD Sol da Justiça (Diante do Trono) - Análise |publisher= |website=Super Gospel |date= |accessdate=25 October 2011 }}</ref>
