All 7 of Angelou's autobiographies are now FAs, so they're worthy of a separate FT.  Her main bio article and the article about the themes in these books are also FAs. There is already an Angelou FT, but I think that this FT would be a good addition.  Thanks for your consideration.

:[[List of Maya Angelou works]] is probably a better lead article, perhaps piped as [[List of Maya Angelou works|Maya Angelou autobiographies]]. [[User:Adabow|Adabow]] ([[User talk:Adabow|talk]]) 01:16, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''' Shouldn't this FT be added to the main FT as a sub-topic?—[[User:Indopug|indopug]] ([[User talk:Indopug|talk]]) 14:33, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
::Not sure what you mean.  What would this look like? [[User:Figureskatingfan|Christine (Figureskatingfan)]] ([[User talk:Figureskatingfan|talk]]) 04:00, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
:::For eg, [[Wikipedia:Featured topics/Solar System]] has subtopics under Jupiter etc.—[[User:Indopug|indopug]] ([[User talk:Indopug|talk]]) 04:14, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Oh I see.  I'd prefer that these topics were separate, but where would the articles in this proposed FT go? [[User:Figureskatingfan|Christine (Figureskatingfan)]] ([[User talk:Figureskatingfan|talk]]) 15:58, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

The main topic would then look like this:
{{Featured topic box |title=Maya Angelou |bookname={{#if:''Maya Angelou''|''Maya Angelou''|''Maya Angelou''}} |count=4|image=|imagesize=
