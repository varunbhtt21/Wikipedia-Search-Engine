'''''Elfquest''''' is a [[role-playing game]] published by [[Chaosium]] in 1984, based on the [[Elfquest]] series of comics.

==Contents==
A licensed tabletop Elfquest [[Role playing game|RPG]] was produced by [[Chaosium]] in 1984, utilizing the [[Basic Role-Playing]] system which had first appeared in the game ''[[RuneQuest]]'' and some original illustrations by Wendy Pini, including the character sheets. Only 3 supplements were produced for the game, ''ElfQuest Companion'' – which included random character generation tables, and was included in the paperback second edition.<ref>[http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_3115.html review of Elfquest Companion by Steve Perrin on rpg.net]</ref> ''Sea Elves'' – noteworthy for introducing information and art provided by the Pinis describing the Sea Elf tribe long before they appeared in any of the comics. ''Elf War'' – which contained several adventures outside of the comic-book continuity.
6 boxed sets of 25&nbsp;mm white metal miniatures for the game were released by [[Ral Partha]].

''Elfquest'' did not sell nearly as well as hoped. Sandy Petersen, who worked at Chaosium at the time Elfquest was developed, blames this on it being given to the same developer as the new edition of ''Runequest'' which was being worked on at the same time, which resulted in ''Elfquest'' being used as a 'test bed' for complex mechanics that were going to be used in ''Runequest''. Petersen speculates that the resulting game was much more complex than fans of the ''Elfquest'' comics were likely prepared for.<ref>Petersen, Sandy.
