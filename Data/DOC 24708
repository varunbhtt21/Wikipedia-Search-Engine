It's food? I don't know what category this falls under, it's just instructions to making "Aramaic cookies". There is some incredibly advert-like history at the bottom about the cookies. No reliable sources either. [[User:123chess456|123chess456]] ([[User talk:123chess456|talk]]) 00:51, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. One ghit for "Aramaic cookies". Also, Wikipedia is not a cookbook. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 01:38, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
