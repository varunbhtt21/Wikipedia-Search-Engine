Title : Neri and Bonacini
Text : '''Neri and Bonacini''', also known as '''Nembo''', was a small [[coachbuilder|''carrozzeria'']] and mechanic shop based in [[Modena, Italy]], active from the late 1950s to around 1967. Founded and run by Giorgio Neri and Lucciano Bonacini, the shop worked on and produced bodies for [[Ferrari]], [[Lamborghini]] and [[Maserati]] road and race cars, both in an official capacity for those manufacturers and for private owners. Their best known projects are the [[Ferrari 250|Ferrari 250 GT]]-based Nembo spiders and the [[Lamborghini 400GT Monza]]. Neri and Bonacini also designed a car under their own name, the Neri and Bonacini Studio GT Due Litri. Two [[prototype]]s of this car were made between 1966-1968 but it never entered [[Mass production|series production]]. The shop closed around 1967 when Bonacini went to work for [[De Tomaso]] and Neri started his own shop, Motors-World-Machines (MWM).<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Coltrin|first=Pete|date=October 1968|title=Studio GT Due Litri|url=|journal=Road & Track|volume=20|issue=2|pages=64–65|via=}}</ref><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" />

The nickname of the firm, "Nembo," was invested by Tom Meade because it was a convenient contraction of the proprietors' names and because it evoked the Nembo Kid, an Italian [[comic book]] version of [[Superman]].<ref name=":5" /> The Nembo Ferraris were designed by Tom Meade (the designer also of the Ferrari Thomassimas) and executed in great detail by Neri and Bonacini.

==Racing cars==
Neri and Bonacini were employed by the Maserati factory racing program as mechanics and body fabricators. Following the closure of Maserati's racing program in the late 1950s, they began maintaining customer-owned Maserati racing cars through their own independent firm.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/12174/lot/629/|title=Bonhams : The property of a lady,1966 Lamborghini 400GT Monza two-seater aluminium berlinetta  Chassis no. 01030|website=www.bonhams.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> They also took commissions for modifying racing and road cars from other manufacturers such as [[Ferrari]], [[Iso (automobile)|Iso]] and [[ASA (automobile)|ASA]], only some of which are well documented.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jonathan|date=November 1966|title=Neri and Bonacini|url=|journal=Road & Track|volume=18|issue=3|pages=42–44|via=}}</ref>

=== Iso Daytona ===
The [[Iso (automobile)|Iso]] Daytona or Iso Nembo was designed by Giotto Bizzarini and [[Renzo Rivolta]] as a racing car that could also be adapted for street use. It used an American [[V8 engine]] in a [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]], a lightweight aluminum body, [[Independent suspension|independent front suspension]] and rear [[De Dion tube|de Dion axle]]. After Bizzarini left Iso in 1965, Neri and Bonacini were contracted to complete the unfinished design and build prototype bodies. The prototype was displayed to the public at the [[1966 Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]. As many as 5 Iso Daytonas were built<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportscardigest.com/iso-rivolta-daytona-car-profile/|title=Iso Rivolta Daytona - Photos and Information|date=2008-09-19|work=Sports Car Digest - The Sports, Racing and Vintage Car Journal|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-US}}</ref> and details around their production history and specifications are unclear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mycarquest.com/2013/01/strale-daytona-whats-in-a-name-a-custom-exotic-italian-classic-car-part-3.html|title=Strale Daytona What’s In A Name? – A Custom Exotic Italian Classic Car – Part 3|last=Koobs de Hartog|first=Jack|last2=Gulett|first2=Mike|date=2012-01-20|website=mycarquest.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref> One car of this type was showcased in the August 1966 issue of Road and Track, under the name "Nembo II."

A possible precursor to the Iso Daytona was the 1965 Bizzarini "Nembo," featured in the May 1966 Road & Track issue.

===Ferrari Nembo===
[[File:Copy (2) of focconcours04 031.jpg|alt=Ferrari 330GT Nembo, rebodied by Giorgio Neri in a style similar to the early 205 Nembo spiders|thumb|Ferrari 330GT Nembo, rebodied by Giorgio Neri in a style similar to the early 250 Nembo spyders]]
The Ferrari Nembo cars were a series of rebodied Ferrari sports cars built by Neri and Bonacini in collaboration with American designer Tom Meade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/1960-ferrari-250-gt-nembo-spyder-4554166-details.aspx|title=1960 FERRARI 250 GT 'NEMBO SPYDER'|website=www.christies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> Three Nembo spyders and one Nembo coupe were built, all based on [[Ferrari 250|250 GT]] chassis and engines. Like all Neri and Bonacini-bodied cars, they were individually hand-built and differed in many details.<ref name=":5" />

The first Nembo spyder used a 1960 [[Ferrari 250#250 GT Cabriolet Pininfarina Series II|250 GT PF Cabriolet S2]] donor car (chassis 1777GT) and was built in 1965 for Meade's customer Sergio Braidi.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/1777GT.250GT.Coupe.htm|title=Detail - 250 GT Coupe 1777GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref> Bradi wanted an open [[Roadster (automobile)|spyder]]-bodied car inspired by the [[Ferrari 250 GTO|1964 series II 250 GTO]], and initially proposed using a GTO chassis. Meade convinced Bradi to use the longer 250 GT chassis as he believed the extra length would result in a more harmonious design.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Sonnery|first=Marc|date=1998-04-25|title=The Nembo Ferraris - Part I|url=|journal=Ferrari Market Letter|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1–5|via=}}</ref> The final steel bodywork was reminiscent of both the [[Ferrari 250 GTO#Variants and related models|Series II 250 GTO]] and the [[Ferrari 275#275 GTB/4 NART|275 GTB/4 NART Spyder]]. The car was originally painted a very dark blue, almost black.<ref name=":2" />

Immediately following completion of the first Nembo spyder, a Nembo coupe was constructed using a 1959 250 GT PF Coupe donor (chassis 1623GT). The aluminum [[notchback]] body somewhat resembled a 1964 250 GTO, due in part to using a windshield from this model. The body was primarily designed by Neri and Bonacini, rather than Meade, as Meade disagreed with the shop over their preference for a notchback body instead of his design for a [[fastback]]. The completed car was originally painted red, very close to the standard Ferrari color "Rosso Chiaro." <ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/1623GT.250GT.Coupe.htm|title=Detail - 250 GT Coupe rebodied as Nembo 1623GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>

The second Nembo spyder was built during 1967-68, based on a wrecked [[Ferrari 250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]] (chassis 3771GT). This car was commissioned by Bill Dixon, who asked Tom Meade to replicate the appearance of the first Nembo sypder. The body was again built by Neri and Bonacini, although the two ended their business partnership while the car was in progress. Although designed similarly to the first Nembo spyder, there were differences in body work mandated by the shorter wheelbase of the donor chassis. A removable hardtop was also provided. Meade equipped the car with then-new [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 40 DCN carburetors, which required significant tweaking to run well for street use. This car was originally painted in a dark burgundy color.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Sonnery|first=Marc|date=1998-05-09|title=The Nembo Ferraris - Part II|url=|journal=Ferrari Market Letter|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1–4|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/3771GT.250GT.htm|title=250 GT s/n 3771GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>

Fabrication of a third Nembo spyder was begun concurrently with the second one. It was based on a 250 GTE 2+2 chassis (number 2707GT). The body of this car differed from previous Nembo spyders, with a "sharknose" like the [[Ferrari 156 F1|156 F1]] and a rounded tail like the 250 GT SWB. This car was ordered by a customer in [[Lebanon]] through a dealer in [[Paris]]. The car was never completed but was shipped to Lebanon as an unfinished body and chassis at the request of the dealer.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/2707GT.250GTE.htm|title=Detail - 250 GTE s/n 2707GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> Ferrari Classiche has confirmed the authenticity of the 2707GT in 2019 and had added a "Classiche" stamp to the chassis, to clearly differentiate it from other replicas (one of such replicas is supposedly a Drogo). The car is still in Tom Meade's estate and is currently undergoing restoration.

In the early 1990s, a customer commissioned Giorgio Neri to rebody a [[Ferrari 330|330 GT 2+2]] (chassis number 5805GT) in the style of the earlier 250 Nembo spyders. The project was finally completed in 1998 and is sometimes considered another Nembo spyder.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://drive-my.com/en/test-drive/item/2495-1964-ferrari-330gt-nembo-spyder-road-test.html|title=1964 Ferrari 330GT Nembo Spyder road test|last=Thorne|first=Malcolm|date=2017-02-11|work=Drive|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/5805GT.330.GT.htm|title=Detail - 330 GT 5805GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>

===Lamborghini and the 400GT Monza===

[[File:1966 Lamborghini 400 GT Monza.jpg|thumb|1966 Lamborghini 400 GT Monza]]
{{Main|Lamborghini 400GT Monza}}
Neri and Bonacini were contracted by Lamborghini in 1963 to build the chassis for the first Lamborghini prototype, the [[Lamborghini 350GTV|350 GTV]].<ref name=":2" /> Once Lamborghini began series production of the [[Lamborghini 350 GT|350 GT]], Neri and Bonacini continued to supply chassis, which were then bodied by [[Carrozzeria Touring]]. As production increased, this task was contracted instead to the firm of Marchesi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/c12-0603-1966-lamborghini-400gt-monza/|title=The Ultimate Barn Find: 1966 Lamborghini 400GT Monza|last=Dredge|first=Richard|date=2006-06-18|website=Motor Trend|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-12}}</ref>

Through this pre-existing relationship with Lamborghini, Neri and Bonacini were commissioned to create a one-off two-seater sports car based on a [[Lamborghini 350 GT|350 GT]] chassis (number 01030) and a [[Lamborghini 400 GT|400 GT]] V-12 engine. Possibly built for an unknown American client to race at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the car was completed in 1966 and named the 400 GT Monza. The aluminum body was hand built in the Neri and Bonacini shop and went through many revisions during the fabrication process.<ref name=":5" /> The final result shows visual similarities to other Italian sports cars such as the [[Bizzarrini Strada|Bizzarrini 5300 GT]] and the [[Lamborghini Miura]], with a long hood and [[Kammback|Kamm tail]].<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/features/octane_features/261562/lamborghini_monza.html|title=Octane {{!}} Lamborghini 400GT Monza|last=Adams|first=Keith|date=2011-01-01|website=Octane|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810090558/http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/features/octane_features/261562/lamborghini_monza.html|archive-date=2014-08-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>

The 400 GT Monza never raced at Le Mans, possibly due to [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] problems. It was displayed at the 1967 [[Automobile Barcelona|Barcelona Motor Show]] on the Lamborghini importer Amato's stand. A wealthy Spaniard purchased it at the show and the 400GT Monza remained in his family until 2005, when it was sold at Bonhams' December 2005 auction in London for £177,500 GBP.<ref name=":1" />

=== Studio GT Due Litri ===
[[File:1968 Neri & Bonacini Studio GT Due Litri left front.jpg|alt=1968 Neri and Bonacini Studio GT Due Litri|thumb|1968 Neri and Bonacini Studio GT Due Litri]]
In 1966, Neri and Bonacini decided to produce a road car under their own name. The result was the Studio GT Due Litre, a [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|rear mid-engine rear-wheel-drive]] two-seater [[Coupé|coupe]] sports car with an aluminum body of their own design.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" />

The Studio GT chassis was produced in-house and incorporated a central sheet metal tub, steel tube subframes at the front and rear and an original suspension design. Wheelbase measured 92 inches, overall height was 42 inches, and track was 53 inches at the front and 52.5 at the rear. As the Studio GT was intended to be a [[grand tourer]], it had a fully trimmed and soundproofed interior. The body was a compact and sleek [[fastback]], with pop-up headlights on the final version and rear bodywork visually similar to that of the [[Lamborghini Miura]]. The car was designed around a 1.8 litre [[Lancia Flavia]] [[Flat engine|flat-4 engine]], but a [[Ford Taunus]] V4 and [[Automobili Turismo e Sport|an ATS]] [[V8 engine]] were also installed in prototypes for testing purposes as availability of the Lancia engine for series production was uncertain.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" />

Neri and Bonacini produced two prototypes between 1966 and 1968. During this period their partnership ended and Giorgio Neri independently searched for an investor interested in purchasing the second prototype and all tooling and designs for production purposes. Neri was unsuccessful and the car never entered mass production.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=http://oldconceptcars.com/1930-2004/neri-bonacini/neri-bonacini-studio-gt-1968/|title=Neri & Bonacini Studio GT (1968) – Old Concept Cars|date=2015-12-21|work=Old Concept Cars|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}</ref>
