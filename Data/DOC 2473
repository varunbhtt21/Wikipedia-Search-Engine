Upon its release, ''State of Mind'' was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Gregory Heaney of [[AllMusic]] said, "While Dizzy might claim that "You don't know shit about me" from a position of relative obscurity on "Nuttin' Bout Me," an EP this solid is going to have a whole lot of people interested in rectifying that situation as quickly as possible."<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/state-of-mind-mw0002665885</ref> Praverb of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' gave the album an L rating, saying "With stellar production, improved songwriting, and a mesmerizing approach, Dizzy is destined to shine a lot brighter. Dizzy still has room for improvement, though, as flashes of transparency here only hold him back from being greater. Let this glimpse of Dizzy’s cognitive state be a proper warm-up to his sophomore effort."<ref name="xxlmag.com"/> Sheldon Pierce of [[HipHopDX]] said, "Despite flashes of the creativity that powered his earlier projects, Dizzy Wright's ''State of Mind'' is plagued by subpar production and a lack of identity."<ref name="hiphopdx.com"/>
