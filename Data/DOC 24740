INTRO AND HISTORY 

Both Manuel Gonzales and Ruben Guaderrama were the original founding members of the Blazers and were the core of the group as it was always tough to find band members that would were dedicated. As life long friends from their early school days in (Theodore Roosevelt High School) in the City of Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles. Both Manuel and Ruben grew up on the rough streets of East Los Angeles and because of their mutual love of music that strengthen them they became influential musicians for those inspiring young musicians that grew up in the same conditions. The Blazers influenced many local bands like (La Terra etc) and help create that unique soulful sound of Mexican American Rock n Roll we call East Side Soul also known as Chicano Rock that we know today. Pioneered by famous groups like Los Lobos. (Cesar) of Los Lobos saw this talent and potential that The Blazers had and not only inspired them but produce their first two records Short Fuse and East Side Soul...
