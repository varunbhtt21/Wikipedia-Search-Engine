"'''Cut Her Off'''" (also known as "'''Cut That Bitch Off'''") is song by American rapper [[K Camp]] with a [[guest appearance]] from fellow Atlanta rapper [[2 Chainz]]. It was co-written by both artists and [[Record production|produced]] by Will-A-Fool. It was released on December 11, 2013 as the first single from his debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''In Due Time''. "Cut Her Off" has since peaked at number 49 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and peaked at numbers 5 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart.

== Critical reception ==
"Cut Her Off" was met with generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' named it the forty-first best song of the first half of 2014. In his review Justin Davis said, "K Camp has started the year with a number of hits, but "Cut Her Off" is undoubtedly his catchiest. The song's subject matter is simple enough—Camp is fed up with the stress from clingy women—but his melodies grab the listener to repeat his rebellious verses verbatim. It's literally the rap version of [[Beyoncé]]'s "[[Irreplaceable]]." Add in an equally wacky 2 Chainz verse and "Cut Her Off" is easily the breakup anthem of the year."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/06/best-songs-of-2014-so-far/k-camp-cut-her-off|title=The Best Songs of 2014 (So Far): K Camp f/ 2 Chainz "Cut Her Off"|last=Davis|first=Justin|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|publisher=[[Complex Media]]|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref>
