==History==
===Constitutional Law on National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities===
[[File:Kotar Glina i Knin.jpg|right|thumb|Two Autonomous Districts of Croatia are shown in dark green]]
In December 1991 Croatian Parliament adopted the ''"Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and Rights of National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia"'' which was prerequisite for [[Independence of Croatia|international recognition of Croatia]].<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law">{{cite web |url=http://www.ijf.hr/Eu2/Vasiljevic.pdf|title=Pravni aspekti zaštite manjina u procesu stabilizacije i pridruživanja|accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=[[Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb]]|language=Croatian}}</ref>

From period of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] [[Croatia]] inherited and recognized relatively high level of protection of collective minority rights.<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /> Problem arose with protection of rights of "new minorities", respectively members of other six constituent nations of former state excluding [[Croats]] ([[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]], [[Slovenes of Croatia|Slovenes]], [[Bosniaks of Croatia|Bosniaks]], [[Macedonians of Croatia|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins of Croatia|Montenegrins]]).<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /> The problem was especially pronounced with [[Serbs of Croatia]] that had status of sovereign people within [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" />

In 1992 Croatia changed law in order to include right on [[political autonomy]] in areas where minorities are actually majority of population.<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /> In addition to right to be represented and wide rights on [[cultural autonomy]] law now provided right to establish autonomous districts in areas where some minority constitute majority according to 1981 Yugoslav census.<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /> However, in practice this provision was never implemented since areas that fulfilled conditions were part of [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]].

Constitutional Law provided two types of monitoring of its implementation- international monitoring and cooperation in its implementation with Autonomous Districts.<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" />

In late September 1995 after [[Operation Storm]] Croatia returned control over its entire territory except [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995–98)|Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] region which came under control of [[UNTAES]]. Croatian Parliament initially temporarily suspended application of Law provisions granting right on political autonomy sparking international criticism.<ref name="University of Zagreb-Faculty of Law" /> Subsequently that part was completely abolished.

One of the first preconditions for starting of [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union]] was adoption of new law on national minorities rights.

==Criticisms==
On tenth anniversary of Constitutional law [[Serb Democratic Forum]] sent a statement arguing that law served just to strengthen minority elites and did not actually strengthen the rights of national minorities.<ref name="SDF-2">{{cite web |url=http://www.poslovni.hr/hrvatska/ustavni-zakon-ojacao-manjinske-elite-a-ne-prava-nacionalnih-manjina-225365# |title=
'Ustavni zakon ojačao manjinske elite, a ne prava nacionalnih manjina' |accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=Poslovni dnevnik|language=Croatian}}</ref> According to them, Constitutional Law is just collection of good wishes and European standards which face constant obstruction from state and at local levels.<ref name="SDF-2" /> They add that national minority councils have failed to consume their role and become bodies without any real role and functions in local communities while Council for National Minorities became politicized institution through which minority elites generate their own, and not the interests of the minority communities they represent.<ref name="SDF-2" />

In 2011 [[Constitutional Court of Croatia]] after [[Left of Croatia]], [[Serb Democratic Forum]], [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]] and [[GONG (organization)|GONG]] repealed Law provision which guaranteed that Serbian minority will elect three members of parliament in one of regular constituency.<ref name="Ustavni sud ukinuo zakon koji Srbima jamči tri zastupnika">{{cite web |url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ustavni-sud-ukinuo-sporni-clanak-o-pravima-nacionalnih-manjina.html |title=
