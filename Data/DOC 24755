Title : OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)
Text : '''OPALS''' is an acronym for Ogren Plant Allergy Scale.<ref name = "Ogren" /> It is an allergy rating system for [[plant]]s that measures the potential of a plant to cause [[allergic reaction]]s in humans.

== Scale System ==
The OPALS allergy scale was first published in "Allergy-Free Gardening", by Thomas Leo Ogren, in 2000.<ref name = "Ogren" /> It covers over 3,000 common [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[flower]]s, and [[grass]]es.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harrar|first=Sari N.|title=Sick of Sneezing? Allergy-Proof Your Yard|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AllergiesSeasonal/prevention-allergy-proof-yard/story?id=13697401|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The allergy scale was updated and extended in 2015 in "The Allergy-Fighting Garden".<ref>{{cite web|last=Zacharias|first=Colleen|title=Sneeze, wheeze... solutions, please|url=http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate-articles/renovation-design/Sneeze-wheeze-solutions-please/id-2779|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Ogren|url=https://calpoly.academia.edu/TomOgren|work=calpoly.academia.edu|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Ogren|first1=Thomas|title=The Allergy-Fighting Garden|date=2015|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=9781607744917}}</ref>

The Ogren Plant Allergy Scale takes into account [[Pollen allergy#Hay fever|pollen allergies]], [[Contact allergy|contact allergies]], and odor allergies, with higher weighting given to pollen allergies that are caused by inhaling pollen into the lungs. Additionally, plants that cause contact allergies (such as [[rash]]es or [[itch]]ing), or that are highly [[poison]]ous when ingested even though their [[pollen]] does not cause respiratory allergies, are never given low ratings.<ref name = "Ogren">{{cite book|last=Ogren|first=Thomas Leo|title=Allergy-Free Gardening|date=2000|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1580081665}}</ref>

Low allergy ratings are considered to be 1 through 3 on the allergy scale. Mid-range ratings are 4 through 6, and high ratings are 7 through 10. Plants with ratings of 9 or 10 have an extremely high potential to cause allergic reactions.

|-
! OPALS Rating !! Guideline<ref name = "Ogren" /> 
|-
| 1–3 || Very low potential to cause allergic reactions
|-
| 4–6 || Moderate potential to cause allergic reactions, exacerbated by over-use of the same plant throughout a garden
|-
| 7–8 || High potential to cause allergic reactions, advise to plant as little as possible
|-
| 9–10 || Extremely high potential to cause allergic reactions, should be replaced with less allergenic species

== Usage ==
'''Within the [[United States]]''': OPALS has been adopted for use by the [[American Lung Association]] and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] Urban and Community Forest Service.<ref name = "Ogren" /> More recently, the [[California Department of Public Health|California Public Health Department]] has endorsed the use of this allergy scale in city [[landscape planning]] to reduce [[asthma]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ogren|first=Thomas|title=A Plan for Cities Wishing to Reduce Pollen-Allergies and Related Allergic-Asthma|url=http://www.icangarden.com/document.cfm?task=viewdetail&itemid=9614|work=icangarden.com|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Strategic Plan for Asthma in California|url=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/EHIB/CPE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/SPAC2014_7-28-15APR.pdf|work=cdph.ca.gov|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref>

'''Within [[Canada]]''': The OPALS allergy scale was used in the Canadian Urban Allergy Audit, which was conducted in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Urban Allergy Audit|url=http://file.marketwire.com/release/PolleNation_Report.pdf|work=Marketwire.com|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=McCusker|first=Kris|title=Urban allergy audit provides glimmer of hope for Toronto allergy sufferers|url=http://www.680news.com/2012/09/02/urban-allergy-audit-provides-glimmer-of-hope-for-toronto-allergy-sufferers/|work=680news.com|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

'''Within the [[United Kingdom]]''': OPALS allergy scale labels for plants sold at [[Plant_nursery|nurseries]] have recently become available for use within the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|title=OPALS|url=http://www.safegardening.org/opals.html|website=Society for Allergy-Friendly Environmental Gardening|accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hansen|first1=Jolene|title=Put Pollen in its Place|url=http://www.gardencentermag.com/article/put-pollen-in-its-place/|website=Garden Center|accessdate=25 June 2016}}</ref>
