'''Koordarrie Station''', often referred to as '''Koordarrie''', is a pastoral lease that once operated as a [[sheep station]] but now operates as a [[cattle station]].

It is located about {{convert|73|km|mi|0}} south of [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]] and {{convert|102|km|mi|0}} south east of [[Exmouth, Western Australia|Exmouth]] and in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]].

Koordarrie occupies an area of {{convert|1186|km2|sqmi|0}} and shares boundaries with [[Minderoo Station|Minderoo]], [[Yanrey]] and Urala Stations. The property is composed of broad sandy plains with low dunes and alluvial clay plains that all make suitable grazing for stock.<ref name=R1/>

The property was established prior to 1912 when it was owned by Joseph McGrath, Frederick Wright and Frederick Lapthorn, whose company ran it until 1915 when Lapthorn retired and the partnership was dissolved.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75110846 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Northern Times]] |location=Carnarvon, Western Australia |date=12 June 1915 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> McGrath  retained possession of Kooordarrie until he died in 1922.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4701184 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne|date=17 February 1922 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1978 the property was carrying 7,269 sheep and was estimated to be able to carry up to 24,000 sheep.<ref name=R1>{{cite web|url=http://archive.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/lwe/rpm/catman/62%20part%202.pdf|title=Station Reports|year=1980|accessdate=2 May 2014|publisher=[[Department of Agriculture and Food (Western Australia)|Department of Agriculture]]}}</ref>

The homestead was later abandoned and the property was run as part of a neighbouring station since the early 1980s. Rory and Kristie de Pledge acquired Koordarrie and switched to cattle production. The property was running a herd of 4,000 [[droughtmaster]] cattle in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centralstation.net.au/meet-the-crew/koordarrie-station/|title=Koordarrie Station|year=2013|accessdate=3 May 2014|publisher=Central Station}}</ref>
