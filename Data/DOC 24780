The village and associated fishing area were used by the [[Kwicksutaineuk]] and [[Mamalilikala|Mamalilikulla]] divisions of the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]].  During his work allocating lands for native groups, [[Gilbert M. Sproat|Commissioner Sproat]] designated the location as a fishing site for the Mamalilikulla in 1879, later designating it Meetup IR No. 2.  The site was originally owned by the Kwicksataineuk.<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/65362.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Meetup 2 (Indian reserve)"]</ref>
