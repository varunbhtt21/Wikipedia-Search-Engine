'''''Megacyllene decora''''', the '''Amorpha borer''', is a species of [[beetle]] in the family [[Cerambycidae]] occurring in the central [[United States]]. Its larvae feed only on the false indigo plant, ''[[Amorpha fruticosa]]'', and its range largely overlaps that of the host plant. It was described by Olivier in 1795.<ref>Bezark, Larry G.
