|Low_resolution = Yes
|Purpose        = Illustrates notable person in question.  Used one additional time for Abraham Jacob Hollandersky's article as well.  Norfolk was Hollandersky's most important opponent, and they fought a championship bout for the Panamanian Heavyweight Title. No photos of Norfolk were found either in newspapers prior to 1923 or library of congress which would render them public domain.   
|Replaceability = Subject of photo is deceased. Therefore, creating a free one is impossible.
