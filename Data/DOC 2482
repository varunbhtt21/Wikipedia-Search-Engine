The song "Preciso de Ti", like other tracks on the album as "Deus de Milagres", was written in a moment of sadness in the life of Ana Paula Valadão. Newly married, during the honeymoon, her husband Gustavo Bessa crashed jet ski.

The song "Preciso de Ti" is the most re-recorded by the ministry Diante do Trono. Two versions of the song in English, both written by Ana Paula Valadão, but with different lyrics, the first was presented in some ministries in the United States and other English-speaking countries were also made.
