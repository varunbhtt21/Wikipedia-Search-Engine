'''''El Chavo Kart''''' ('''''Chaves Kart''''' in Brazil) is a [[racing video game|kart racing game]] created by Mexican developers Effecto Studios and Slang and published by [[Televisa|Televisa Home Entertainment]] for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. A conversion of the game was also released on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], but was later removed. The game features almost all of the characters of ''[[El Chavo: The Animated Series]]'' (except for [[List of El Chavo characters#Supporting characters|Jaimito]] and [[List of El Chavo characters#Minor characters|Gloria]]), with tracks loosely based on locations from the animated series.

==Gameplay==
''El Chavo Kart'' is a mascot-based [[kart racing]] game, in the same vein as ''[[Konami Krazy Racers]]'', ''[[Nicktoons Racing]]'', ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'', ''[[Crash Team Racing]]'' and the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series. Players get to compete as characters from the series (except for Jamito and Gloria), along with tracks loosely based on locations from the animated series.

The game offers three game modes: Cups, Exhibition, and Challenges. In "Cups", the player can unlock characters, while at the end of "Challenges" scenarios and tracks are unlocked. The player can collect [[power-up]]s along the race which can be used to benefit himself and gain an advantage in the race. Tracks include series features and scenarios such as [[Azteca Stadium]], the city of [[Acapulco]] and also the [[Maracana Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]]. Each track can be raced in the opposite direction, and include alternative paths, traps and obstacles. The game features [[local multiplayer]], allowing up to four players to compete against each other simultaneously. The game features 45 trophies or achievements that can be unlocked to progress through the game.

==Development==
''El Chavo Kart'' was announced by Roberto Gómez Fernández, son of Mexican comedian and series creator [[Roberto Gómez Bolaños]] known as "Chespirito", coinciding with Bolaños' 85th birthday. Voice actors from the animated series reprised their roles in the game.

The game is developed with [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 3|Unreal Engine 3]], and features graphics that mimic the series' art style. Each character has different animations that appear in races when the player hits or jumps, or win a race. Also, the development team took more than two years to carry out, as also with the participation of about 150 people in the studio.

The Brazilian version of the game (where it is given the title ''Chaves Kart'') features Rio de Janeiro's [[Corcovado]] as the background image on the game's cover.

==Reception==
''El Chavo Kart'' was received with mixed reviews.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
