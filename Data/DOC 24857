Title : Mineral alteration
Text : {{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
'''Mineral alteration''' refers to the various natural processes that alter a [[mineral]]'s [[chemical composition]] or [[crystallography]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.minsocam.org/msa/collectors_corner/arc/alteration.htm | title=Alteration}}</ref>

Mineral alteration is essentially governed by the [[laws of thermodynamics]] related to energy conservation, relevant to environmental conditions, often in presence of [[catalysts]], the most common and influential being [[water]] (H<sub>2</sub>O).

The degree and scales of time in which different minerals alter vary depending on the initial product and its physical properties and susceptibility to alteration. Some minerals such as [[quartz]] and [[zircon]] are highly resistant to alteration under normal weathering conditions. Yet quartz may alter to [[stishovite]] with intense pressure, and zircon to ''crytolite'' (a [[metamict]] zircon) with amount of radioactive components and time.

In some circumstances, a mineral alters while maintaining its outer form known as a [[pseudomorph]].

Mineral alteration is distinctly different than the rock alteration process [[metamorphism]]. It also differs from [[weathering]]. However, these processes assist in mineral alteration. Some minerals are members of a [[solid solution]] series and are samples of a range of compositional changes in a continuum, and thus are not 'mineral alteration' products.

==Examples of mineral alterations==
===Oxidation===
A common [[oxidation]] example is when a natural [[ferrous]] [[iron]] mineral such as [[pyrite]] is oxidized to form [[goethite]] or other [[ferric]] iron [[hydroxide]]s or [[sulfate]]s.

===Hydration and dehydration===
The common mineral [[gypsum]] is a hydrous [[sulfate mineral]] that readily alters to the [[anhydrous]] sulfate aptly named [[anhydrite]] with prolonged desiccation. 
:CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O  <=>  CaSO<sub>4</sub>
This is a reversible reaction.

===Kaolinization===
[[Kaolinization]] refers to the alteration of [[alkali feldspar]] into the [[clay mineral]] [[kaolinite]] in the presence of slightly acidic solutions. [[Rain]] readily dissolves [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere, promoting weathering of [[granitic]] rocks. As demonstrated in the following reaction, in the presence of [[carbonic acid]] and water, [[potassium feldspar]] is altered to kaolinite, with potassium ion, bicarbonate, and silica in solution as byproducts. 
:2 KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 9 H<sub>2</sub>O => Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub> + 4 H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup> + 2 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>

===Epidotization===
[[Epidosite|Epidotization]] is the alteration process in which [[plagioclase feldspar]]s convert into the [[epidote]] group minerals.

===Chloritization===
[[Chloritization]] is the alteration of [[pyroxene]] or [[amphibole]] minerals into the [[chlorite group]] minerals. Chloritization is a common process in [[metamorphic]] transitions to the [[greenschist facies]], and [[amphibolite facies]] retrograde metamorphism.

===Shock induced alteration===
As observed in and around astroblems such as [[impact craters]], ordinary silica or quartz crystals may alter to the minerals [[stishovite]] and [[coesite]] as a result of meteorite impacts producing an extreme pressure and high temperature environment.

===Radioactive decay===
A common example of a radioactive decay alteration is when a [[radioactive element]] bearing [[zircon]] or [[allanite]] [[crystal]] becomes [[metamict]] or [[amorphous]] due to structural damage.

===Serpentinization===
[[Serpentinization]] is the mineral alteration process that results in the formation of [[serpentine group]] of minerals mainly from the [[olivine group]], with hydration and changes in pressure as major factors.

===Dolomitization===
[[Dolomitization]] refers to the varied suggested manners in which a predominantly [[calcite]] rich [[calcium]] bearing [[sedimentary rock]] such as [[limestone]] may alter into the [[magnesium|magnesian]] [[dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] rich rock [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]. [[Diagenesis]] is a likely culprit that involves volumes of water and fairly low heat, as an [[ionic exchange]] catalyst.
The reaction is as follows:
:2CaCO<sub>3(limestone)</sub> + Mg<sup>2+</sup> -> CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2(dolomite)</sub> + Ca<sup>2+</sup>

===Pyritization===
[[Pyritization]] involves the [[ions|ionic]] replacement by [[iron]] and [[sulfur]] atoms that combine to form the mineral [[pyrite]].

===Opalization===
Opalization is the alteration of amorphous silica, often as organic remains of siliceous microfossils in lithified sedimentary rocks, into the mineraloid [[opal]].

=== Uralitization ===
Uralitization is the process of deuteric alteration of pyroxene (most commonly [[augite]]) to form [[amphibole]] ([[actinolite]]-[[tremolite]]). The alteration occurs during either late-stages of magmatic crystallization at low temperatures (< 500&nbsp;°C) or during low-grade metamorphic events (sub-greenschist facies metamorphism). The reaction is paramorphic, meaning that the structure of the mineral is modified, but its original chemistry is retained.<ref>{{Cite book|doi=10.1016/S0422-9894(08)70953-X|chapter=Deuteric Alteration|title=Petrology of the Ocean Floor|volume=33|pages=329–331|series=Elsevier Oceanography Series|year=1982|isbn=9780444419675|last1=Hékinian|first1=Roger}}</ref>
