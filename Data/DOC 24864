The syrups were also shipped to and used at [[soda fountain]]s as an ingredient to add flavor to various beverages.<ref name="SPJ"/><ref name="Thomas"/> In 1911 Bludwine was marketed as having health benefits, such as aiding in digestion, and some physicians in Athens, Georgia and other areas of the state prescribed it to their patients.

The information asserted that consumers would be misled to believe that the product contained wine when no wine actually existed in it, per the package labeling.<ref name="USBOC"/> A court trial with a jury occurred, and Bludwine was found not guilty in the proceedings on May 28, 1913.<ref name="USBOC"/>
