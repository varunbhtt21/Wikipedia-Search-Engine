Nellie Grey is a young woman who works in the cloak department of a department store. She lives in a boarding house with her abusive great uncle and his handicapped son, Tom. Long separated from her mother, she is unaware that she has a fortune coming to her. Her nefarious cousin, Walter Hilton, hopes to secure the money for himself. He first intends to marry Nellie, but her co-worker Hortense Drake has her own eyes on Walter, so Hortense convinces him that it is better to dispose of Nellie completely. Nellie is then subjected to four acts of plots against her by Walter and Hortense. They tie her to train tracks, but she is rescued by Jack Carroll, a handsome young man who lives in the boarding house. They try to crush her with an elevator, but Tom saves her. Walter ties her to the mast of a yacht, but a co-worker from the store frees her. She is blown off a bridge with a bomb, but Jack pulls her from the water. Only in the fourth act is Walter finally thwarted, and Nellie is reunited with her mother.<ref name="Adams">{{cite journal |title=Beautiful Nellie |first=Franklin P. |last=Adams |authorlink=Franklin Pierce Adams |work=The Green Book Album |date=July 1909 |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=202}}</ref><ref name="Kabatchnik">{{cite book |title=Blood on the Stage: Milestone Plays of Crime, Mystery, and Detection: An Annotated Repertoire, 1900–1925 |last=Kabatchnik |first=Amnon |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8108-6123-7 |oclc=190860037 |pages=66–73}}</ref>

==Dramatic analysis==

''Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model'' was a classic melodrama, one of the most popular of its day. It contains a number of elements that were typical of the genre, and especially of the melodramas written by Davis, a prolific author who turned out several such scripts per year. (''Nellie'' was his seventh production that season.)<ref>{{cite book |title=American Theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama, 1869–1914 |last=Bordman |first=Gerald |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |oclc=25787552 |isbn=0-19-503764-2 |page=602}}</ref> Among these common elements were the poor heroine who is secretly the child of a wealthy family, the scheming relative trying to steal her inheritance, and the dramatic physical perils she faces (tied to train tracks, explosions, etc.).<ref name="Kabatchnik"/><ref>{{cite book |editor-first1=Jackson R. |editor-last1=Bryer |editor-first2=Mary C. |editor-last2=Hartig |title=Encyclopedia of American Drama |edition=3rd |chapter=Davis, Owen |location=New York |publisher=Facts on File |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4381-4076-6 |lastauthoramp=yes}}</ref> Davis estimated that Nellie faced death 17 times during the course of each production.<ref>{{cite book |title=The People at Play: Excursions in the Humor and Philosophy of Popular Amusements |first=Rollin Lynde |last=Hartt |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |year=1909 |oclc=11723142 |page=187}}</ref> Even the title was typical, reflecting the main character's affinity to the expected working class audience.<ref>{{cite book |title=The People at Play: Excursions in the Humor and Philosophy of Popular Amusements |first=Rollin Lynde |last=Hartt |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |year=1909 |oclc=11723142 |page=160}}</ref>
