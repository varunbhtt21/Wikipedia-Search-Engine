One of Vaucher's most famous climbs was the [[Matterhorn]] in July 1965. When she reached the summit on July 14, she became the first woman to have climbed the Matterhorn's north face.<ref name=times>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19650715&id=svZRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H3QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7215,2416845|title=Swiss Housewife Steals Matterhorn Show|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=July 15, 1965|page=16-A|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> She made the ascent with her husband on the 100th anniversary of the first successful ascent of the mountain, and their "surprise climb" was noted to have "stole[n] the spotlight" from two other climbing teams who were planning to climb the Matterhorn at the same time with film crews to broadcast their ascent on live television.<ref name=times/> An article in the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' about the Vauchers' success was titled "Swiss Housewife Steals Matterhorn Show", and when interviewed about her plans after the descent, Yvette answered, "to go have a hair-do – fast."<ref name=times/>

Yvette and Michel Vaucher made numerous significant climbs in the Alps throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including [[Piz Badile]], the [[Aiguille de Triolet]], the [[Aiguille du Dru]], the [[Eiger]], the [[Große Zinne]] and the [[Grandes Jorasses]]. In 1966, they made the first direct ascent of the north face of the [[Dent Blanche]].<ref name=women/> They climbed frequently with [[Loulou Boulaz]] and her partner [[Michel Darbellay]].<ref name=berg/>

Vaucher and her husband joined an international expedition to [[Mount Everest]] headed by [[Norman Dyhrenfurth]] in 1971; she intended to become the first woman to reach the summit of Everest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Defeat on Everest|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|pages=22–29|date=July 2, 1971|first=Murray|last=Sayle}}</ref> Tensions and conflict were rife within the team, however, and the expedition was ultimately unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Mountain: My Time on Everest|first=Ed|last=Viesturs|authorlink=Ed Viesturs|pages=235–245|year=2013|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]}}</ref> Vaucher, upset with Dyhrenfurth's leadership, is said to have thrown snowballs at him before leaving the expedition.<ref name=women/>

Vaucher was denied membership of the [[Swiss Alpine Club]] until 1979, when she became one of the first women to be made an honorary member.<ref name=berg/><ref name=presse/> As of 2012, she continues to hike regularly in the Alps, despite having hip and knee replacements.<ref name=berg/>
