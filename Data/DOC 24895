The '''Commonwealth Railways CN class''' was a class of {{whyte|4-6-0}} [[steam]] locomotives purchased by the [[Commonwealth Railways]], Australia, from the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) during [[World War II]], for use on the [[Trans-Australian Railway]].

The eight locomotives in the class had been built in 1907-1908 by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]], [[Montreal]], Quebec, for the [[Canadian Northern Railways]], and, after passing into CN ownership in 1918, had been part of CN's H6c class.<ref>{{harvnb|Fluck|Marshall|Wilson|1996|pp=42â€“43.}}</ref>
