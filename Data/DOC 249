'''Nightfever''' is a night of prayer and part of the Nightfever initiative which is rooted in the Catholic Church. The goal is to help those far away from the Church to encounter God and to experience His love and mercy. 

''Nightfever'' events take place in over 80 cities in Europe, North and South America, and Australia.,<ref name=mission/><ref name=London/> and is especially centered in [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Germany]] where it began after the [[20th World Youth Day]] in Cologne.<ref name=mission/><ref name=young/> To celebrate Nightfever one must be trained by the Nightfever international team to receive permission. 

==History==
''Nightfever'' was founded by students Katharina Fassler-Maloney, a member of the [[Emmanuel Community]], and Andreas Süß, then a seminarian and today a priest.<ref name=London/><ref name=canada/> After [[World Youth Day]] 2005 in Cologne the pair thought, "This cannot be the end. This great vibe/spirit of the WYD has to go on in our daily lives…!"<ref name=catches/> Only one event was originally planned, but due to its success it was continued, and then spread across Germany, Europe, and beyond.<ref name=London/> The first Nightfever in North America was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2012.<ref name=canada/>

On Saturday nights volunteers stand on streets near bars, theaters, and parties in city centers.<ref name=young/> They approach strangers and say things such as "Hey, want a candle? We’re praying for peace."<ref name=young/> If the passerby agrees they are welcomed into the church, or the volunteer walks them to nearby church where the event is taking place.<ref name=young/> Participants are welcome to light their candle and leave, or to stay and pray for as short or as long of a time as they like.<ref name=students/> When they leave, "their candles burn on as a symbol of their concerns and thoughts."<ref name=students/>

In addition to lighting candles at the altar, common elements inside the church include the Eucharistic exposed for [[Eucharistic adoration|adoration]], contemporary Christian music, submitting prayer intentions, and priests on hand to administer the [[Sacrament of Reconciliation]] or to provide prayer, support, and counsel.<ref name=mission/><ref name=students/><ref name=spreading/> Nightfever typically goes late into the night.<ref name=young/>

As they leave, participants are often given items to take with them. In New York, it is small cards thanking them for coming and quoting {{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|29:11|NAB}}: “For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.”<ref name=simple/> In Dublin attendees also left with a verse from the Bible to reflect upon,<ref name=spreading/> and in Chicago they were given hot chocolate.<ref name=young/>

An organizer in Britain describes Nightfever as "a door opener. For those who once had faith in God we hope they will be renewed through their experience at St Patrick's. For those who have never met Christ we hope this becomes a moment of fruitful encounter."<ref name=mission/> Events often see hundreds and even thousands of people attend.<ref name=mission/><ref name=young/>
