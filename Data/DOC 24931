== History ==
The Rochester Factory School was established in 1908. In 1911 it was moved to a building in Exposition Park (which had formerly housed the [[Western House of Refuge]], a [[youth detention center|reform school]]) owned by the district, and around 1913 the name was changed to the Rochester Shop School. It was moved to a different building in the park in 1917, and in 1918 to another building at Joseph Avenue and Avenue D. In 1926 it was moved again, to several floors of a building on the grounds of the [[Bausch & Lomb Optical Company]] plant. In 1931, the name was changed to the Thomas Alva Edison Technical and Industrial High School, and soon shortened to Edison Technical School.<ref>[http://www.libraryweb.org/~digitized/books/History_of_the_Public_Schools_of_Rochester_NY.pdf "Edison Technical High School", in ''A History of the Public Schools of Rochester, 1819-1935'' "Prepared in the Offices of the Board of Education" Rochester, N.Y., n.d. (1935?)]</ref>

In the 1990s Edison Tech was converted to the Edison Technical Education Center, housing a group of CTE programs which would subsequently be established, abolished and combined in various ways. Students share the same site and operate a single combined sports program, which still uses the Edison Tech name; the community perceives that the students go to "Edison Tech".  As of 2013, reports from a state agency concluded that the new schools were failing to meet the needs of 21st-century employers, and offered a number of possible solutions, none of which involved re-establishing the traditional Edison Tech.<ref>[http://roc.democratandchronicle.com/assets/pdf/A2218581211.PDF Career and Technical Education Technical Assistance Center of New York.
