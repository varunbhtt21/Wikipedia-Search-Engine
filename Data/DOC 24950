The '''2013–14 chikungunya outbreak''' represented the first recorded [[Chikungunya outbreaks|outbreak of the disease]] outside of tropical Africa and Asia.  In December 2013, the first locally transmitted case of [[chikungunya]] in the Americas was detected in [[Saint Martin]]. Shortly after the first case the disease began to spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean region.  By the end of the year, it had spread to [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], with suspected cases in [[Saint Barthélemy]].  By the end of January 2014, cases had been confirmed in Saint Barthélemy, as well as the [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Dominica]], and [[French Guiana]].  On the basis of 4,000 confirmed cases and over 30,000 suspected cases, the [[Caribbean Public Health Agency]] (CARPHA) declared a Caribbean-wide epidemic of the virus in early May.  By the end of May, four cases of chikungunya had been confirmed in Florida.  By July 2014 there were an estimated 355,000 cases in the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/07/chikungunya-outbreak-exceeds-355000-cases|title=Chikungunya outbreak exceeds 355,000 cases|publisher=[[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy]] ([[University of Minnesota]])|date=14 July 2014}}</ref>  By August 2014, 25 Caribbean countries had confirmed at least one case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/chikungunya-caribbean|title=Chikungunya in the Caribbean|publisher=Centre for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref> The epidemic was over by 2015.

==Background==
{{main|Chikungunya}}
Chikungunya is an [[arbovirus]] common to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is spread to humans by ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes (primarily ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'') that breed in stagnant water.<ref name=AP />  The virus was first isolated in 1953, and likely first arose during the 1700s.<ref name=APfirst /><ref name=Cherian2009>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cherian SS, Walimbe AM, Jadhav SM |title=Evolutionary rates and timescale comparison of Chikungunya viruses inferred from the whole genome/E1 gene with special reference to the 2005–07 outbreak in the Indian subcontinent |journal=Infect. Genet. Evol. |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=16–23 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18940268 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.004|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Chikungunya is characterized by a sudden high fever and intense joint pain, between four and seven days after infection.<ref name=AP /><ref name=Antigua />   It can also cause headaches, muscle pain, fatigue, and rashes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chikungunya spreading to other countries in the Caribbean|url=http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/05/02/Chikungunya-spreading-to-other-countries-in-the-Caribbean/4561399051386/|date=May 2, 2014|agency=UPI|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Most infected patients recover within 10 days, and deaths are rare.  However, in some cases joint pain can linger for months or years. There is no [[vaccine]] or treatment for chikungunya and preventing its spread is difficult.<ref name=AP />  Outbreaks are primarily dealt with through preventive measures, such as wearing long-sleeved clothing, and [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] population control.<ref name=CIDRAP />

==First cases==
In early December 2013, health officials confirmed two cases of locally transmitted chikungunya on the French half of [[Saint Martin]].  It was announced to the public on December 17, by which time 10 cases had been confirmed and many more suspected cases were undergoing lab tests.  Vice President [[Guillaume Arnell]] declared that his country had an "obligation" to prevent the disease from spreading.  "It started here so we have to contain it here", he said.<ref name=APfirst>{{cite news|title=Mosquito virus spreads to Caribbean |work=Caribbean Business |agency=AP |date=December 17, 2014 |url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/mosquito-virus-spreads-to-caribbean-92039.html |accessdate=May 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221214825/http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/mosquito-virus-spreads-to-caribbean-92039.html |archivedate=December 21, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>  Swift action was taken, and a [[Pan American Health Organization]] representative said she was satisfied by the response.<ref name=APfirst />  Even so, there were 66 confirmed cases by the end of the month, including at least one case on the Dutch half of the island, and more than 180 suspected cases.  The virus had also spread to [[Martinique]] (3 cases) and [[Guadeloupe]] (1 case) by the end of the year. In [[Saint Barthélemy]], there were 21 suspected cases.<ref name=CIDRAP>{{cite news|title=Caribbean chikungunya outbreak grows, poses threat to US|publisher=CIDRAP|author=Lisa Schnirring|date=December 30, 2013|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/12/caribbean-chikungunya-outbreak-grows-poses-threat-us|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

Previously, chikungunya had not been found in the Americas.<ref name=AP />  Although it had never previously been found, it was considered an emerging threat and preparations for its spread were underway by 2012.  In July 2013, a Caribbean-wide virtual meeting was held to educate high-ranking medical personnel on how to detect the virus.<ref name=Jamaica>{{cite news|title=Chikungunya now an epidemic in the Caribbean|date=May 1, 2014|work=Jamaica Observer|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Chikungunya-now-an-epidemic-in-the-Caribbean|accessdate=May 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503071055/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Chikungunya-now-an-epidemic-in-the-Caribbean|archive-date=May 3, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  It is unclear how the virus first spread to the Americas' mosquito population.<ref name=APfirst />

==Spread of the chikungunya virus==
By January 21, 2014, cases had been St. Barthelemy and the [[British Virgin Islands]].  [[Dominica]] and [[French Guiana]] both had one reported case due to travel in the affected islands.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/mosquito-borne-chikungunya-virus-infects-people-on-5-caribbean-islands-1.2504922 |title= Mosquito-borne chikungunya virus infects people on 5 Caribbean islands |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate= May 2, 2014}}</ref>  At the start of April, chikungunya was confirmed in the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2014/04/04/i555291_pruebas-laboratorio-confirman-virus-chikungunya-nigua.html |title= Pruebas de laboratorio confirman virus de Chikungunya en Nigua |work= Diario Libr|accessdate=May 3, 2014|date=April 4, 2014|language=Spanish }}</ref>  On 24 April, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] announced the island had three confirmed cases of chikungunya and an outbreak was officially declared. Two days later, [[Antigua and Barbuda]] announced its first confirmed case, on the island of Antigua.  Four other cases were suspected.<ref name=Antigua>{{cite news |url=http://www.caribbean360.com/news/antigua-latest-caribbean-island-to-be-hit-by-chikungunya-disease|title= Antigua latest Caribbean island to be hit by chikungunya disease|work= Caribbean 360|date=April 26, 2014 |accessdate= May 3, 2014}}</ref>

At the end of April, there were more than 4,100 probable cases of chikungunya across fourteen different Caribbean countries.<ref name=epidemic />  In addition to thirteen island nations, the virus had been confirmed in French Guiana. Martinique, Guadeloupe, and St. Martin had the most reported cases.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=Recently Arrived Chikungunya Virus Gains Foothold In Caribbean|date=May 2, 2014|agency=AP|work=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/02/chikungunya-virus-caribbean_n_5256278.html|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

During the week of April 27, 2014, health officials from multiple agencies met in the Dominican Republic to discuss the outbreak.<ref name=AP />  On May 1, the [[Caribbean Public Health Agency]] (CARPHA) declared a Caribbean-wide [[epidemic]] of the virus.<ref name=Jamaica /><ref name=epidemic>{{cite news|title=Caribbean-wide Chikungunya epidemic declared |date=May 2, 2014 |publisher=Cayman 27 |author=Mona Tatum |author2=Kevin Watler |url=http://www.cayman27.com.ky/2014/05/02/caribbean-wide-chikungunya-epidemic-declared |accessdate=May 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503074914/http://www.cayman27.com.ky/2014/05/02/caribbean-wide-chikungunya-epidemic-declared |archivedate=May 3, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>  The United States-based [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] said it was "working with state health departments to increase awareness about chikungunya and to facilitate diagnostic testing" in preparation for possible introduction into [[South Florida]].<ref name=AP />
