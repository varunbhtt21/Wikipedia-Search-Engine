Published 13 February 2014 by Doubleday Children's, the book includes a new story by Wilson, ''Leonie's Pet Cat'', as well as extracts from such classics as [[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]], by Dodie Smith, and [[Through the Looking Glass]] by Lewis Carroll.<ref name=AmazonToc>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0857533525/ref=sib_dp_bod_toc?ie=UTF8&p=S009#reader-link Paws and Whiskers preview: Table of Contents]</ref>

Also called '''''Battersea Cats and Dogs Anthology''''' before publication,<ref>[http://booko.info/9780857533524/Battersea-Cats-and-Dogs-Anthology Battersea Cats and Dogs Anthology]</ref> the book is under licence from "Battersea Dogs' Home Ltd.", with royalties from book sales going to support the registered charity.<ref name=AmazonCopy>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0857533525/ref=sib_dp_bod_cr?ie=UTF8&p=S006#reader-link Paws and Whiskers preview: Copyright page]</ref> Although dogs appear before cats in the name of this [[animal welfare]] organisation, the anthology has the section with excerpts from ''Cat Stories'' first, and ''Dog Stories'' last, with the special ''Pets' Corner'' section in the middle, featuring new stories by notable children's authors about their pets.<ref name=AmazonToc />

The cover art includes illustrations of pets. "That's [[#Shanti|Shanti]] on the cover, in the bottom right hand corner", said [[Francesca Simon]], who wrote the story about her Tibetan Spaniel.<ref name=Shanti>{{cite web |url=http://www.francescasimon.com/supporting-battersea-cats-dogs-home/ |title=Supporting Battersea Cats and Dogs Home |author=Francesca Simon |date=13 February 2014 |website=www.francescasimon.com |publisher= |format= |accessdate=10 June 2014 |quote=This book is very special to me because it includes a piece about Shanti, my wonderful Tibetan spaniel, who very sadly died last autumn.
