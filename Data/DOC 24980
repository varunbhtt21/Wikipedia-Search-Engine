While there are some of this author's books have been collected ([http://www.worldcat.org/title/australias-gold-rushes/oclc/43580390&referer=brief_results]), I don't see any evidence that he or his works have received in-depth attention by reliable sources.  Additional sources welcomed, as always. [[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|<sup><small><i>talk</i></small></sup>]] 02:54, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete.''' This article has been marked as a BLP unsourced article '''longer than any other existing article'''. Since obviously no one has ever been able to find good sources on this guy, the article's time is up. [[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 21:09, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
