Unsourced, previously unsourced save to random web sites.  Can't verify much if anything here, there's no ar.wiki article on the fellow (at least under معالي سعادة الامير حمد بن خالد بن حمد بن عبد الله آل ثاني ), and i can't verify the signficant claim to notability here -- chief of the Qatar police force, everything else is either a bit promotional or genealogical cruft.  But additional sources--even verification of being chief of the Qatari police in a reliable source, would be of assistance here.  Thanks.

*'''Keep''' He does seem to be notable.  The police in Qatar are under the Ministry of Interior. It would appear that they are under Director General of Public Security Staff in Qatar which is currently Maj. Gen. Saad bin Jassim al Khulaifi. ( [http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/news/2014/05/20/32229.html here]).  I don't know what that says about the status of a police chief. Hamad's fuller name is "Hamad bin Khalid bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani". Hamad's father's Wikipedia article [[:ar:خالد بن حمد بن عبد الله آل ثاني]] (Khalid bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani) says that the son Hamad was "Adjutant General of Police" before entering commerce, but provides no years.  Now an article at wikimapia [http://wikimapia.org/14601299/قصر-سعادة-الشيخ-حمد-بن-خالد-بن-حمد-بن-عبدالله-ال-ثاني this page] agrees with his birth year and place (city of [[Al Rayyan]] in 1952), but says Hamad was Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces 1973-1978 and Police chief, 1978-1988; which is at variance with our article. [http://www.al-aji.com/vb/showthread.php?t=36877 Here] is an obituary from the Aji Network of 16 September 2012 for Hamad bin Khalid bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, which agrees with the wikimapia article. Aji Network appears to be as reliable as I can find. [http://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/177717 here] on 15 Sept. 2012 is another obit, without much content, just praising him.  A mosque in the area of Ain ​​Khalid has been named after him and an foundation established to provide for a Quran school. the quran school is "حمد بن خالد لتعليم القرآن ". Oh, Arabic for his shorter name is حمد بن خالد آل ثاني and for his longer one  :  حمد بن خالد بن حمد بن عبد الله آل ثاني  --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 02:44, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
