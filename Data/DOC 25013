Dowdeswell|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/people/dowdeswell/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>

==Education==
Dowdeswell graduated with a BA in geography from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1980, and studied for a master's degree at INSTAAR in the [[University of Colorado]] and for a Ph.D. in the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]].<ref name=Geographical>{{cite web|title=Professor Julian Dowdeswell|url=http://livegeo.www2.solvention.de/Magazine/People/Julian_Dowdeswell_-_Nov_09.html|website=Geographical Magazine|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195822/http://livegeo.www2.solvention.de/magazine/people/julian_dowdeswell_-_nov_09.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Career==
He started his career as a lecturer in [[Physical Geography]] at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]. He subsequently went on to work as a Professor of Physical Geography and Director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre, [[University of Bristol]] and then to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 2001. He became the director of the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] in 2002. He is also a professorial fellow at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].<ref name=Geographical />

His research focuses on the form and flow of [[glaciers]] and [[ice caps]] and their response to [[climate change]], and the links between former [[ice sheets]] and the marine geological record, using a variety of satellite, airborne and shipborne geophysical tools.<ref name=spri />

In 2019 Professor Dowdeswell is Chief Scientist on the [[Weddell Sea Expedition 2019]], which aims to:
*investigate the ice shelves around the Weddell Sea and, in particular, the Larsen C Ice Shelf from which a giant iceberg broke off in July 2017
*document the rich and little-studied marine life of the western Weddell Sea ecosystem
*attempt to locate and survey the wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s ship ‘Endurance’, which was trapped and crushed by the ice and sank in the Weddell Sea in 1915.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Expedition - Weddell Sea Expedition|url=https://weddellseaexpedition.org/the-expedition/|website=Weddell Sea Expedition|accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Unprecedented international scientific expedition to Weddell Sea announced|url=http://toucanmoon.com/unprecedented-international-scientific-expedition-to-weddell-sea-announced/|website=Toucan Moon|accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>
