Unsourced for nine years.  

Unable to find reliable, secondary sources which provide in-depth coverage of this poet in order to evidence notability under [[WP:BASIC]].  Additional sources welcome, as always. [[User:Joe Decker|j⚛e decker]][[User talk:Joe Decker|<sup><small><i>talk</i></small></sup>]] 03:16, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''': I haven't located anything on the Jim Dunlap of this longstanding unreferenced [[:WP:BLP]] either. Despite the directory listings that are claimed, even if these were verified they would not be sufficient for [[:WP:CREATIVE]]. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 18:37, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. I found these online. He's also been named among the top 100 in Writer's Digest's "Poets & Writers magazine". He seems notable. I think we can at least use the second link, the on the boston poetry site. Hope this helps. [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 01:57, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I am unhappy that the sources may not be reliable.  I have posted a request at [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#Boston Poetry Magazine]], regarding one of them. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 03:24, 23 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' While he seems to have a good claim to notability in the [[:WP:LEAD|lead sentence]] of his article, none of the sources can be considered reliable sources.  See comment at [[:Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard#Boston Poetry Magazine]] regarding what might have been the best of the touted sources. He has no awards and I was unable to verify the statement about top ranking in ''Writer's Digest'' magazine. For example he is not mentioned on their website. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 23:01, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
