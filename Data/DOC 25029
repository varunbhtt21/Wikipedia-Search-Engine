:::I think (on the basis of previous requests) that what WhisperToMe wants is a transcription, not a translation, of the text. [[User:Deor|Deor]] ([[User talk:Deor|talk]]) 19:36, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

== Translating and pronouncing a Russian sentence ==

Hello. I have no knowledge of how to speak Russian, and I am trying to translate a certain phrase - "You are probably the only person here who can understand this" for a line in a play. I have run it through Google translate, which comes up with the following phrase: "Вы, вероятно, единственный человек здесь, кто может понять это" - which, when run back through Google translate again, comes out as "You're probably the only person here who can understand it", which would be acceptable apart from the final word - it needs to refer to "this" as in the Russian sentence itself. 

Firstly, does anyone know a more appropriate phrasing? 

Secondly, my main issue is that the actor reading the line would be unlikely to be able to read or pronounce the cyrillic characters - what would the appropriate pronounciation of such a phrase be, in a manner that could be written down and understood by an actor? 

Thank you,

:In Russian there is only one word for "it" and "this". I'd say Вы, вероятно, единственный здесь человек, который может это понять.--[[User:Любослов Езыкин|Lüboslóv Yęzýkin]] ([[User talk:Любослов Езыкин|talk]]) 16:57, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:: For a complete beginner, I'd suggest the following pronunciation: Vee, veh-ra-YAT-na, ye-DINST-ven-ee zd-YES che-lav-YEK, ka-TAW-ree MAW-zhət E-ta pun-YAT.  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 20:52, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Actually, Google Translate has [http://translate.google.com/#auto/en/%D0%92%D1%8B%2C%20%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%2C%20%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%8C%20%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA%2C%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D1%8D%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8C pronunciation mode] (click on "Listen" icon in the bottom right of the edit box), which does a decent job. Only the last syllable is odd: I hear /pɐnʲetʲ/ instead of /pɐnʲatʲ/. [[User:No such user|No such user]] ([[User talk:No such user|talk]]) 21:33, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:::: Cool, I had no idea of that feature.  It also seems to say veh-ra-YET-na (вероeтно).  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 21:45, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
