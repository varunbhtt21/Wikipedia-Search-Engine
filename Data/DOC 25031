== jazzy flights ==

Are there any other songs about fictional flight numbers by American jazz music artists? I know there's ''Flight #448'' by [[Tom Coster]].[[Special:Contributions/142.255.103.121|142.255.103.121]] ([[User talk:142.255.103.121|talk]]) 13:48, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:There's also "Flight 808" by [[Paul Taylor (musician)|Paul Taylor]]. --[[User:Canley|Canley]] ([[User talk:Canley|talk]]) 11:26, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== Toronto Blue Jays rivals ==

Which teams in the American League are considered rivals against Toronto Blue Jays?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/65.95.107.145|65.95.107.145]] ([[User talk:65.95.107.145|talk]]) 18:39, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:They all are, but IMO the Yankees rank first (no surprise), followed by Boston, then Baltimore and lastly Tampa Bay. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 19:56, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::This is in terms of loathing, despising and all-around detestation. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 21:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:::The Yankees fit that description regardless of who they're playing. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 21:30, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:In short, everyone in their division, especially as that division has been pretty stable for a good while. Going well back, the Oakland A's were at least a post-season rival, when they were both good. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 21:17, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:Not every sports team is part of a binary rivalry, in the way that the Red Sox-Yankees or Dodgers-Giants rivalry works.  The Blue Jays lack that single team that is their bitter mutual rival.  As noted, any team in the [[American League East]] would be considered a rival, but that's just because they play more often.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 12:12, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::I don't even follow sports that much, but the non-transitivity of rivalry is apparent even to me! E.g. Ohio State only seems to consider Michigan as a real football rival, but several other schools consider Ohio State to be ''their'' rival... [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 15:58, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::No, all rivalries are transitive.  If they aren't transitive, it isn't a rivalry, it's just "crappy team that is jealous of good team".  Rivals need a mutual competition between each other.  Ohio State/Michigan.  Lakers/Celtics.  Celtic/Rangers.  Red Sox/Yankees.  Duke/UNC.  Those are rivalries.  No matter how many tickets get sold when the Yankees come to Toronto, the Yankees are not the Blue Jays' rival.  They're just a popular team that lots of people care about.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 02:45, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Certain teams tend to be annoying to non-fans of those teams. Ohio State and Alabama qualify. The Yankees qualify. The Lakers qualify. Keep in mind that these rivalries play a big part in ticket and merchandising sales. The owners love these rivalries, because they ensure an increase in attendance. From the days of Babe Ruth onward, for example, the Yankees coming to town meant more money flowing in, maybe sometimes even to the extent of the ball club staying in the black for the season. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 16:13, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::A little off the track, but same general topic. When Bill Veeck owned the minor league Milwaukee Brewers in the late 1930s or so, one of the other owners (either Minneapolis or St. Paul, I forget which) told Veeck he was strapped for cash. Veeck paid a visit to a local radio station and bad-mouthed both the local team and the Twin Cities. Angry fans filled the ballpark for the next Milwaukee series, and the local owner remained solvent. And of course, Veeck's Brewers saw an increase the next time that Twin Cities team came to town. Rivalries are good. Rivalries work. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 16:16, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:Getting back to the question, the surest way to estimate rivalries would be to look at average attendance for games vs. each team during a given season. That could require some tedious research, but it would be a good indication. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 16:17, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::Probably still the Yankees and the Red Sox. Usually you can buy some cheap 5th-deck tickets and sneak down to field level, but there are too many people there to get away with that when Boston or New York are playing. By the way, in the 80s I would say the Jays rivals used to be the Detroit Tigers (judging from how much I hated Detroit as a small child). [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] ([[User talk:Adam Bishop|talk]]) 19:28, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::The Jays' real rivals were the late [[Montreal Expos]], even though they did not play each other often. There was a real battle over which team would control which part of the Canadian market, with the Blue Jays eventually coming out on top. See David Luchuk's book ''Blue Jays 1, Expos 0: The Urban Rivalry That Killed Major League Baseball in Montreal''. --[[User:Xuxl|Xuxl]] ([[User talk:Xuxl|talk]]) 12:00, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
