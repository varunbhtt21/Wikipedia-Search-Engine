:({{Find sources|Paul Rosenberg (publisher)}})
Long-term unreferenced biography, presumably BLP.  Unable to find reliable secondary sources which evidence the notability of this fellow.  If we had an article on the publishing house, I'd have no qualms about a redirect, but as near as I can tell we don't.

*'''Delete''': I can see a couple of listings of this person as a bookseller but nothing indicating biographical notability. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 18:20, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
