== Rong-guang Yu and Jackie Chan ==

We are viewing a western which lists Rong-guang Yu as a prime actor.  But it appears to be Jackie Chan.  

Searching the best I can, it appears that a great number of films feature both appearing.  It's weird, but the photos of them do not appear to be consistant.  Are they related, or are posters mixing up the two?  It appears Chan was from Hong Kong and Yu was originally from China and later Hong Kong.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:OldGuy808|OldGuy808]] ([[User talk:OldGuy808|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/OldGuy808|contribs]]) 01:12, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
