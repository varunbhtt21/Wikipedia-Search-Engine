== Is there in your country possibility to get an high school certification in any time?  ==

For example if someone reach 27 years old and he wants to learn for getting the university or just to get an high school certification, can he do that? In my country [Israel] there is no a limit and every one can be examed on the matreials of the high school in any time. (it gives opportunity for those who didn't learn when they were in the school (or for those who were not there at all...). So it interests me to know about other countries [[Special:Contributions/5.28.189.179|5.28.189.179]] ([[User talk:5.28.189.179|talk]]) 00:53, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:The is no "high school certificate" in the UK, but [[GCSE]] and [[A-level|GCE Advanced Level]] examinations can be taken at any age on payment of the entry fee (around £30 per subject for GCSE and £80 per A-level).

:And people who wish to go to university, but who don't have a high school diploma or equivalent, may be classified as an [[adult learner]]. That's a horrible article, but the gist is that above a certain age, universities may waive the usual high school diploma requirement.

::Also in the UK we have Access to Higher Education Diplomas, offered by a range of colleges in various subjects. More information [https://www.accesstohe.ac.uk on this link] [[User:DuncanHill|DuncanHill]] ([[User talk:DuncanHill|talk]]) 19:02, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

== Gas Sampling ==

what are the types of gas sampling techniques?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/101.63.147.50|101.63.147.50]] ([[User talk:101.63.147.50|talk]]) 03:54, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:The only relevant Wikipedia page I can find is [[Modified active gas sampling]].  Other than that, there's [[Olfaction|sniffing]]  [[User:Rojomoke|Rojomoke]] ([[User talk:Rojomoke|talk]]) 09:09, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:[[Eddy_covariance]] is very popular for assessing what gases go in/out of system. This page [http://sio.ucsd.edu/marianas/equipment/gas_sampling.cfm] describes how they sample gasses at hydrothermal vents, and this describes and integrated [[flask]] sampling system [http://www.picarro.com/resources/literature_publications/an_integrated_flask_sample_collection_system_for_greenhouse_gas_me].
