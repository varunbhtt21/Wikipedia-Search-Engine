== Notepad++ ==

If I want to delete empty lines in a document, than, [http://superuser.com/questions/621720/remove-empty-lines-and-spaces-in-notepad according to the second answer here], I should go to Edit>Line Operations>Remove empty lines. for some reason - I don't have such option in my Notepad++. why would that be?

:Are you using the latest version? It looks like this menu item was added in v6.2.3. -- [[User:BenRG|BenRG]] ([[User talk:BenRG|talk]]) 07:50, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::I didn't even think it would be matter, You proved me wrong! messier BenRG! thank you! [[Special:Contributions/109.67.164.204|109.67.164.204]] ([[User talk:109.67.164.204|talk]]) 08:10, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== iPhoto ==

I want to copy all my iPhotos from my Mac laptop to a flash disc whilst retaining their present positions in Groups, Holidays, Family etc.  How do I do that please?[[Special:Contributions/85.211.136.204|85.211.136.204]] ([[User talk:85.211.136.204|talk]]) 18:50, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:If by Groups, you are referring to what iPhoto calls Events, then you can do this. Go to File > Export..., and in the File Export tab, select "Event Name" in the Subfolder Format dropdown menu, and your other export specifications such as size, compression and naming convention. When you click the Export button, iPhoto should export all the photos in a folder for each Event group. --[[User:Canley|Canley]] ([[User talk:Canley|talk]]) 02:17, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for this but when I refered to 'Groups' I meant the groups that I have created ie Holidays, Family etc.  I think that Apple's Events are date related.[[Special:Contributions/85.211.136.204|85.211.136.204]] ([[User talk:85.211.136.204|talk]]) 14:12, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:Use the Export menu, which will allow you to export groups of photos as sub-folder trees, or in several other formats (including auto-generation of HTML pages).  I found the menus to be pretty self-explanatory; but if you need help, [http://support.apple.com/kb/PH15210 the official documentation] explains more details.

Thanks again[[Special:Contributions/85.211.136.204|85.211.136.204]] ([[User talk:85.211.136.204|talk]]) 16:44, 29 April 2014 (UTC). I will look at this option which I had not explored at all.
