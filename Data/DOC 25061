== Use of PDFs in Wikipedia articles ==

I wish to write an article on the 1982-86 Electronic Manuscript Project of Association of American Publishers, a project that led to ANSI/NISO/ISO 12083. It was a four-year undertaking involving forty industry groups. I would draw from 12 articles that can be referenced only as PDFs inasmuch as there are no links to them. Can Wikipedia store PDFs? [[Special:Contributions/71.84.104.89|71.84.104.89]] ([[User talk:71.84.104.89|talk]]) 00:18, 28 April 2014 (UTC)NAA
:It would be preferable to link to the PDFs in question, ideally hosted by an officially-related or otherwise [[WP:RS|reliable]] website.  It is possible to upload PDFs, but there are [[WP:C|copyright concerns]] with any file upload.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  00:57, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:::PDF is just a format.  Plenty of reliable sources are in PDF form.

Thanks NYKevin and TRPod. I'm interested in the possibility of uploading the 12 PDFs. All are of articles published in a 1986 issue of Electronic Publishing Business, a then-reputable industry publication of a now-defunct and agent-less publisher. Interestingly, one of the articles is by the former Director of New Technology and Copyrights for the Association of American Publishers. If proper attribution can be made of these copyrighted articles, do I assume correctly that the PDFs could be uploaded for storage by Wikipedia and then linked to the article I write? <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.84.104.89|71.84.104.89]] ([[User talk:71.84.104.89|talk]]) 02:31, 28 April 2014</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->

== Hiroko Mima Miss Universe Japan ==

Dear Help desk,

I have updated Hiroko Mima Miss Universe 2008 wiki page. It is about 5 years out of date. I have updated comprehensively but tnothing has happened so far. Can you please tell me what I need to do for action to be taken.

With thanks
Alex  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:AWMH|AWMH]] ([[User talk:AWMH|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/AWMH|contribs]]) 02:38, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

: You posted your new material on [[Talk:Hiroko Mima|the article talk page]], rather than on [[Hiroko Mima|the article itself]].  You also caused confusion on the talk page by deleting all the previous content, so I have now added the previous content back in, and collapsed the display of your new text.  It appears that few editors are watching that talk page, so I would suggest that you be [[WP:BOLD|BOLD]] and edit the article directly, making sure that you include [[WP:REFB|references]] to [[WP:reliable sources|reliable sources]] to support your changes. --[[User:David Biddulph|David Biddulph]] ([[User talk:David Biddulph|talk]]) 02:56, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

The page you ''thought'' you were updating was [[Hiroko Mima]], which is '[[wp:semi-protected|semi-protected]]' so you are unable to edit it unless your  user account is "more than four days old and [has] made at least 10 edits". On Wikipedia this will make you '[[wp:autoconfirmed|autoconfirmed]]' and able to edit protected articles.

== What happens to copyrights if the owner no longer exists ==

What happens to the rights if a publisher is liquidated and no record of a transfer of copyright to a new owner can be found? Does the publication become public domain by default? [[User:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)]] ([[User talk:Dodger67|talk]]) 11:38, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::It sometimes happens that no-one knows who owns the copyright, even the owner.

== Greg A. Hill ==

Hi there.  I wonder if you could lend a hand to the [[Greg A. Hill]] article.  I noticed that an editor had made a bunch of good faith edits to the page, which required lots of cleanup.  I left the editor a note on their talk page, then tried to roll back the edits and move forward (the editor had only made cosmetic changes, little new info).  Anyway, it didn't work, as a bot had already tried to help (and I know that's not what my rollback is for, but my intent was a good one).  Would you have a moment to look at the page?  It may need a rollback to a point prior to the good faith edits of Jcbmxer.  Thanks!  [[User:Magnolia677|Magnolia677]] ([[User talk:Magnolia677|talk]]) 11:41, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

I'm a new guy who recently joined. I play ultimate frisbee and I can't help but notice that the Chinese version of the article is really thin.

:and note that, as it is the Chinese article you will be improving, it is the Chinese-Wikipedia rules on referencing that you will need to follow. I can't read Chinese, so I can't be sure; but I expect that
:*they will regard the existence of a reference in the English-Wikipedia article (or the French-Wikipedia article, etc.) as irrelevant;
:*they will prefer references to Chinese-language sources, but may accept references to sources in other languages where none in Chinese can be found.

== I messed up an edit and cant fix it ==

====   ERROR IN A REFERENCE -  HELP  ====
In the article about dowry: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry)

I apparently do not know how to edit a reference, nor undo the change I made). This is the first time I have tried to edit something. I thought it would be easy to change one number. Somebody reading this, please fix/change. I'm really sorry!

Reference 67 wrongly gave the page number as p 43 (or some two digit "4x" number). On google books, after hunting around the book, I found it on p 149 in an article on Bhutan.

Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1 edited by Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. p 149.

:: {{Ping|71.89.130.205}} The reference issue has now been fixed, and honestly it is no wonder you ended running into this. When working with references it is possible to give a reference a name, which allows it to be reused without having to enter all the details on a different part of the page. This is not only convenient (You will only need to change 1 piece of text to update all mentions of this reference), but it will also shorten the amount of text on the page since one only needs to enter the name of the citation to reuse it. Reference 52 on that page is an example of the result - the "a" and "b" denote multiple instances where the reference was used.

:: The section you edited was actually such a reference to another reference. The actual reference looks like this:
::*''<nowiki><ref name="Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan 2011 43">{{cite book|last=Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=43}}</ref></nowiki>''
::If i were to refer to this reference elsewhere i would only have to cite its name. Like so:
::* ''<nowiki><ref name="Stange, Mary Zeiss, and Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan 2011 43" /></nowiki>''
:: Since the reference includes the page number it is easy to mistake it for the page number displayed. Once you changed it to 149 the mediawiki software started searching for a reference that has the modified name. Since there was none it simply displayed the error you saw before (There is no reference with that name). The solution can be seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dowry&diff=606213827&oldid=606207770 here]. Effectively i created another full reference that includes the entire reference, instead of just a pointer. 

:: Feeling confused? I can imagine that since this isn't an easy issue to start with!

It is a photo of Lloyd warming up the audience at NBC for his show FIGHT BACK.

==Inappropriate user conduct==
Hello, I would like to report and potentially block a user who persists in deleting sourced content and in edit warring, and who has a clear conflict of interest in editing a certain article. I am prepared to provide diffs, but I am unclear as to which dispute resolution process I should turn to.

== SkyBlu ==

I have been editing the Wikipedia article on [[SkyBlu]], the American rapper.  The title of the article is "SkyBlu", but throughout the text his name appears as "Sky Blu".  The Talk page for the article raises the discrepancy but no-one there has been able to resolve it.  I saw a reference there to his Facebook page, where I see he calls himself "Sky Blu".  Can I take it that this is the correct spelling, or could SkyBlu be his proper rapper name?  (I know very little about these things!)  If I can take it that "Sky Blu" is the correct spelling, it would mean altering the title of the Wikipedia article which would then lead to linking problems wherever his name is mentioned in other Wikipedia articles as "SkyBlu". If his Facebook page can be quoted as a source, how would I do the footnote? < ref > Facebook < /ref >, or would there need to be more than that?  (Had to put gaps round "ref" to stop it showing up as a footnote here!)  --[[User:P123cat1|P123cat1]] ([[User talk:P123cat1|talk]]) 23:18, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

Mdann52 has given the Wiki article on [[Sky Blu]] a new title and a Facebook reference, but since you said Facebook is not ideal, using WP's Referencing manual I added a news article that supports the "Sky Blu" spelling as another reference.  I then had a message on my Talk page saying I had missed out a square bracket, so I added it in, but the footnote now looks a bit strange. Can you correct my mistake, please, and tell me how you did it? Sorry, I am very new to all this.  --[[User:P123cat1|P123cat1]] ([[User talk:P123cat1|talk]]) 13:28, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
