== disambiguation question ==

Hi,
I want to disambiguate between two topics, no disambiguation page needed, so I want to place notices that this article is about "THIS" for that, see "THAT" on both pages. I tried the redirect tag, but that only points to a disambiguation page. Thanks, I don't do this so often anymore. [[User:Sephiroth storm|Sephiroth storm]] ([[User talk:Sephiroth storm|talk]]) 04:29, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:There are several [[wp:Hatnotes]] that may be able to do something like this, but I think you want template {{tlx|About}}, eg:

:<nowiki>{{About|USE1|USE2|PAGE2}}</nowiki> displays 

:''This page is about USE1. For USE2, see PAGE2.''

== Need assistance with Wikipedia article editing ==
{{lwt|Articles for creation/Bifrost Technologies}}

Hi,

I am trying to create an Article in Wikipedia and have a small doubt in it. I need to create a section where the heading is in one color and the section is in another. Unfortunately, I am not able to see the colors stretch to the complete width of the page and rather gets restricted to the space until which the content are available. 

I am using the following code. 

<nowiki>
{| class=infobox
|colspan=2 align=left style="background:#61C4CF"|'''Heading'''
|-
|style="background:#C6EDF2"|

Content 

|}
</nowiki>

I am not sure which attribute to use for the function as |style="background:#61C4CF" "width:100%"| is not working. Please advice.

Thanks & Regards,

:If you are talking about the article linked above, frankly, I would forget about playing with the colors and concentrate on establishing notability.  If you don't do that it will continue to get rejected and will never be accepted.  Eventually the page will be deleted altogether.
:Anyway, I don't really understand what you are trying to achieve with that code, but
<pre>
===<span style="color:blue;">heading</span>===
<div style="color:red;background:yellow;">Coloured content</div>
Only part of a line with <span style="color:red;background:yellow;">coloured content</span>.

== template creation error ==

I created a Dave Grusin dicography template however I titled it David Grusin. {{Dave Grusin}}
Now, when I try to edit it, Wikipedia is looking to create a new template called "David Grusin", and I cannot edit the original template. 
Can the template be deleted so I can start over, or, can you change the title to read dave grusin so I can edit it?
[[User:BobCC|BobCC]] ([[User talk:BobCC|talk]]) 11:31, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|BobCC}} I changed the title parameter in the template to "Dave Grusin" to match the template's actual title, but left the name parameter as "David Grusin" (to preserve the link to our article on the man). Is that what you want? [[User:Deor|Deor]] ([[User talk:Deor|talk]]) 11:54, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::Oops, I just noticed that the title of the bio article is actually [[Dave Grusin]] as well, so I changed the title parameter in the template to "<nowiki>[[Dave Grusin]] discography</nowiki>". Is that OK? [[User:Deor|Deor]] ([[User talk:Deor|talk]]) 12:12, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

== Copying text from a CC-by-A-licensed journal ==

Hi, please see [[Alain Chabaud]]. In the reference section it is mentioned that this is an abridged version of an article published in an OA and CC-by licensed journal. Is this the correct way of attributing text? I can't really recall having seen something like this before. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 14:06, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:The article in question is the subject's obituary. This explains why the article is so promotional, with words like "visionary", "brilliance", and "prestigious". It also lacks all other references. Someone needs to rewrite the article in an acceptable style; doing so will remove the problem of a possible copyvio of the obituary. [[User:Maproom|Maproom]] ([[User talk:Maproom|talk]]) 15:32, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

Hello,

I am sorry I forgot to mention that it is on Wikiversity. These updates that are being done online are for school grades and my Professor when he checks he finds that it looks that i have submitted my files late on Wikiversity as I mentioned in the beginning that the problem is everything that I upload it takes some time to upload and that might be long as 3 days or more. I  hope you can help me because I losing my grades because of the delay upload. Also you please check if there is any hold against my account that is causing this problem .

== Gerald R. Weeks ==

Someone created a page for me under the heading above. I corrected it a couple of days ago and one of the reviewers changed it back to the original page. I do not understand how this system works. How do I contact the person who changed it. I have read the email and page and do not understand it.

Weeks]] it will take you to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gerald_R._Weeks&action=history the history of all the changes to the article]. You will see that your recent edits were subsequently reverted with the edit summary "''Unsourced and promotional language''".  It is the difficulty of an editor to write about themselves with a [[WP:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] that gives rise to Wikipedia's guidance on [[WP:conflict of interest|conflict of interest]], to which your attention was drawn by a message on your user talk page.  If you wish to suggest changes to the article you can do so, remembering to include [[WP:REFB|references]] to published [[WP:reliable sources|reliable sources]] independent of the subject, on the article talk page.  If you wish to contact the specific editor who reverted your changes, you can do so through the editor's user talk page, accessible by clicking the word "talk" alongside the editor's user name in the article history.

I have created the page Kevin Murphy (offensive tackle) but when i go to places where he is mentioned ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings#Current_roster ) It says the page does not exsist.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:PacoDaKing14Sportz|PacoDaKing14Sportz]] ([[User talk:PacoDaKing14Sportz|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/PacoDaKing14Sportz|contribs]]) 17:53, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:It's due to caching. When you create a page it can take a long time before existing links on other pages automatically change from red to blue. You can force an update of a specific page by [[WP:PURGE|purging]] it, but there is no need for that here. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 17:59, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{ec}} It sometimes takes a little time for the Wikipedia database to catch up with new creations. So, for a little while after a new article is created, old "red-links" will stay red. You could do what is called "purging" each page individually, or give the maintenance a chance to catch up. It sort of "rights" itself eventually. See [[Wikipedia:Purge]] for how to do this. --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 18:00, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

== Finalizing the article ==

I am trying to figure out how to finalize the article I just created.  It is an autobiographical entry.  I saved it, but is it now automatically searchable?  If not, what do I need to do to make it live?  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:DoctorJackson|DoctorJackson]] ([[User talk:DoctorJackson|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/DoctorJackson|contribs]]) 20:07, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:The article is live, which is what I suppose you mean by finalized. The references are still a mess--the giant block of references at the bottom should be included into the article's body so that they appear neatly. The existing numbered references only appear to be titles, they're not formatted properly. Please read [[WP:REFB|Referencing for Beginners]], also, please read [[WP:COI]]. [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 20:15, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

Isn't the main problem here the fact that it "is an autobiographical entry"? If the subject is the author, the article should be up for deletion, shouldn't it? [[User:Melbourne3163|Melbourne3163]] ([[User talk:Melbourne3163|talk]]) 03:14, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*Not necessarily. Autobios are ''discouraged'', not forbidden. If the article is too promotional to be salvageable, it should be deleted as CSD#g11. If not, then it depends on notability what should be done. If the person is notable, the article may need cleanup to make it neutral and remove any POV. Only if the person is not notable should the article be taken to AFD. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 11:17, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

== References on Italian and English Wikipedias ==

Hello, I would like to know the following:
1) How I put a reference into a wikipedia page I edited ([[:it:Monumenti e luoghi d'interesse di Bari]]) if there is no reference section
2) What should I write into the reference section of the english wikipedia page [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione]] if I added content that is into the italian wikipedia page [[:it:Lega Pro Prima Divisione]] ?
