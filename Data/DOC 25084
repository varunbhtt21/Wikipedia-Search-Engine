*'''Keep''' - this is a 500-year-old church that remains the centre of important annual celebrations, contains important religious relics and houses a collection of 16th, 17th and 18th century religious art from notable artists. The fact that nobody bothered to create an article for it until yesterday does not make the subject non-notable.

*'''Keep''' per Stalwart111. A basilica, as I understand it, is a church which has received a special designation of significance as a site of pilgrimage by a Pope. This one is 500 years old and is connected to a notable religious festival. In a few minutes, I was able to find many mentions in travel guidebooks, plus a mention in National Geographic. I am confident that an editor who reads Italian could find much more coverage, and that the encyclopedia is better off with this article than without it.

::Yes, if nothing else, there should be Church records somewhere related to the church's elevation to the "rank" of ''basilica'' by whichever pope issued that decree. My experience is that such basilicas have generally been considered notable by default and a 500-year-old one, probably more so. But it was a new article with no real independent references so there's nothing wrong with having a discussion about it.

*'''Strong Keep''' - As per above - The article needs improving, Not deleting, If I'm honest I'm slightly baffled as to how anyone could think a 500yo church isn't notable but there you go.... -[[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 15:41, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*clear '''Keep'''. As I understand it basilica refers to a church of a particular type of floor plan, but nevertheless this building is clearly notable, despite not being a retired ice-hockey player.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 15:48, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - for the reasons given above. ("Basilica" refers to both a floor plan and a status: the status is significant enough to = notability). Bizarre and [[:WP:Trout|troutworthy]] nomination. [[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]]) 19:29, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::Yes, an assumption on my part because of the "pilgrimage" nature of the church's location and the seeming lack of ''basilical form'' in the architecture itself. It may well be referred to as a "basilica" for its design rather than its status but I'm not sure that really matters in this instance.
