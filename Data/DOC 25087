'''Aythos, Inc.''' (formerly known as Helambu Project USA, Inc.) is a U.S. based economic development [[nonprofit]] working in [[Nepal]] fostering health and sustainable livelihood programs.<ref> https://www.aythos.org/about-aythos </ref> Its goal is to provide economic development in environmentally sustainable ways, while reducing barriers to participating in markets.

== History  ==
Aythos was founded in October, 2009 after Beau Miller visited the village of Gangkharka in the [[Helambu]] region while a boarding school was being built. He came back to the [[United States]] and worked with David Mabry and others working in Nepal to start Helambu Project USA, Inc.  Early efforts were focused on fundraising for the boarding school and managing a volunteer program for foreign teachers to work in villages in [[Helambu]].  In January, 2012 the focus changed to economic development projects and the organization was rebranded as Aythos, Inc. Economic development programs provided training and subsidies to support fruit cash crops such as apples and kiwifruit, as well as spices and tea.

At 11:25 AM on April 25, 2015, Nepal was struck with a [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|magnitude 7.8 earthquake]] followed by a magnitude 7.3 aftershock on May 12. The Aythos board temporarily suspended its economic development mission to engage in recovery efforts, including providing medical teams and delivering tarps, food, and building materials.<ref>https://www.aythos.org/our-impact</ref>

== Projects  ==
In 2012 Aythos was asked to consult for a grant to develop [[apple]] tree and [[kiwifruit]] plant farms in villages in Helambu.<ref name=Reset1>{{cite news|url=http://en.reset.org/blog/one-team’s-key-ingredient-peace-apples |title=One team’s key ingredient for peace: apples. |publisher=Reset |accessdate=2 May 2014  |first1=Anna|last1=Rees |date=2013-01-22 }}</ref><ref name=Reset2>{{cite news|url=http://en.reset.org/blog/eco-changemaker-chatting-aythos-nima-sherpa|title=Eco-Changemaker: Chatting with Aythos' Nima Sherpa|publisher=Reset|accessdate=2 May 2014|first1=Anna |last1=Rees |date=2013-07-16}}</ref> The end result included 2,000 [[apple]] trees and 1,000 [[kiwifruit]] plants in the ground in the villages of Sermathang, Ghangyul, Tarkeyghang, and the Ani Gumba Nunnery.<ref name=Apples>{{cite news|url=http://www.aythos.org/#!Apples%20for%20Peace%20culminates%20with%20the%20planting%20of%203%2C000%20fruit%20trees/cppi/9A11FFB3-70C9-4D3B-A638-6B1B708651F3|title=Apples for Peace culminates with the planting of 3,000 fruit trees|publisher=Aythos|accessdate=2 May 2014|first=Andrew|last=Miller|date=2014-02-05}}</ref>

In 2013 Aythos began beekeeping projects in several villages in both [[Sindhulpalchok District]] and [[Dolakha District]] of [[Nepal]].  The goal of the project is to train villagers on beekeeping and offer subsidized cost for beekeeping supplies.<ref name=onepercent>{{cite news|url=http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/2014/04/sweet-success-for-beekeeping-in-the-himalayas/|title=Sweet Success for Beekeeping in the Himalayas|publisher=1% for The Planet Blog|accessdate=2 May 2014|first=Nima|last=Sherpa|date=2014-04-27}}</ref>
