== Reuse of Wikipedia data ==

I have opened a site which shows timelines using information taken verbatim from Wikipedia pages. It can be seen here: http://www.timelinecontinuum.com/Default.aspx

I have read the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_content, but not being a lawyer, I have difficulty understanding it.

I think I have covered my copyright liability by:

1. Including these phrases in the Sources section of my page:

  "The data in this timeline is from Wikipedia's daily listing of world events."
  "The data was automatically converted from Wikipedia.org licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License." 
2: All hyperlinks from the Wikipedia text are maintained in my data.

Any comments or assistance you can give me on this would be much appreciated, as I am keen to "do the right thing". The intention of this site, where Wikipedia information is used, is to make it even more useful and accessible.

TIA

:Hi, [[User:ZermattMan|ZermattMan]]. You're doing well, but there are two issues that remain (both of which are addressed in the section of ''reusing Wikipedia content'' titled "[[WP:REUSE#Re-use of text under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike|Re-use of text under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike]]":
:* Share-alike means you have to release your own work that modifies Wikipedia text under the same license. So, you should include "These timelines are available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License", with a link to it (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). (You can also use a later version, such as 4.0 International.)
:* The notice about Wikipedia's license should include a link to the license (again, http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). (I say "should" instead of "must" because the Wikipedia pages are already linked, and those have a link to the license already, so this {{em|may}} be enough.)
:(While I try my best, the above is [[WP:NOLEGAL|not legal advice]].)

:[[User:ZermattMan|ZermattMan]], I'm not a lawyer but I have spent a lot of time researching copyright law. I guess I'll copy the "[[WP:NOLEGAL|not legal advice]]" used above :) Basically, we have three things here. We have the Wikipedia content, we have your software, and we have the processed output. Your software is an independent work and I think it's safe to say you can license (or not license) your software any way you like. Putting your software under a Creative Commons license would be cool, but almost certainly not required. The concern here is that the output generated by your software still carries the Creative Commons "property" that was carried by the input. I think you probably need to say somewhere that the results you are displaying are licensed for other people to reuse, under the same Creative Commons licensing terms.

:Hi Alfred. Are you saying that you want us to add or remove something from the article [[Schloss Herberstein]]? (or possibly [[Eggenberg Palace, Graz]]?) Please note that our touchstone for adding content is whether the information can be found and cited to [[WP:IRS|reliable]] published sources (and often removal involves the inability to find the content therein). If you're just looking for information, you can ask at the [[WP:RD|reference desk]], but I must say I find your post a bit hard to follow. By the way, typing in all capital letters makes it harder to read and is considered by online convention to be SHOUTING.

== Author affiliation in citation template ==

I am using citation templates for the references of an article. I want to note the affiliation of the author of a published piece which is cited, specifically an "op-ed"-type piece, as this would be important for readers trying to assess the reliability and objectivity of the statements made in it. I do not see in the "cite news" template a clear way to note an author's affiliation with a particular institution. How is this best done? [[User:Davidhof|Davidhof]] ([[User talk:Davidhof|talk]]) 09:41, 14 September 2014 (UTC)
:Hi Davidhof. Add to the cite news template: 
::<tt>|last=''InsertSurname''|first=''InsertGivenName''</tt>
:You can note it's an op-ed piece by adding
::<tt>|department=''Op-ed''</tt>
:Best regards--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 11:22, 14 September 2014 (UTC)
::[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]], thank you for your response. However, that was not my question. I did not ask how to include an author's name in a cite news reference; that is very clear from the template's documentation. My question was about how to note "an author's affiliation with a particular institution". For example, if the president of the [[American Cancer Society]] wrote an op-ed published in the ''[[New York Times]]'', urging that the US government change its approach to supporting cancer research, the ''Times'' would add a line at the end of the piece, reading "So-and-so is president of the American Cancer Society." If I want to report the fact of the advocacy, I would write in the body of the article, "In 2014, the American Cancer Society's president urged that...." etc., etc., in which case it is not essential to note the affiliation in the footnote because I already did so in the article itself. But if I am just using the op-ed as a reliable source for some factual statement for which it could be relied on, e.g. "From 2003 to 2013, US government spending on cancer research increased by X%," I don't want to put a description of the source in the body of the article, but I do want to note it in the footnote, so that the reader doesn't think that this fact comes from reporting by the ''Times'' itself. My question was, Is there a standard way to do this? [[User:Davidhof|Davidhof]] ([[User talk:Davidhof|talk]]) 04:47, 16 September 2014 (UTC)
:::<small><small><small>@[[:User:Davidhof|Davidhof]]:</small></small></small> Ah, Sorry. Just add to first=, e.g. <tt><nowiki>first=David (president of the [[American Cancer Society]])</nowiki></tt>--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 12:30, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

::::Adding descriptive text to a CS1 parameter corrupts the citation's [[COinS]] metadata.  In this example, '(president of the [[American Cancer Society]])' is not part of David's name.  CS1 does not provide a mechanism to identify an author's affiliations.  If it is necessary to somehow note an author's affiliations, that information can be placed between the CS1 template's closing <code>}}</code> and the closing <code><nowiki></ref></nowiki></code>.

::::—[[User:Trappist the monk|Trappist the monk]] ([[User talk:Trappist the monk|talk]]) 13:03, 16 September 2014 (UTC)
:::::In my view that's the tail wagging the dog. Citation template output is for readers; for proper attribution to sources and verification. Placing this after the closing code results in a less well formatted citation in which the attribution is not as accessible. Of course, the citation can be done manually. And if there is a better way to place this information next to his name using the template without the metadata issue coming into play, that would be superior. But weighing the secondary function of metadata against citation clarity, I choose the latter by a very wide margin.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 15:23, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

::::::Close.  The purpose of the citation template output is twofold: primarily for editors to [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT]] and secondarily to present that information in formats usable by readers whether they are human or machine (which will be read by humans later).  An author's affiliation has nothing to do with WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT; if it did, then every scientific journal citation would also need to list the affiliation of every scientist who contributed to the research or the paper.  Of course, editors are free to hand-craft citations if CS1 (a general purpose tool) isn't the right tool for the job.

::::::—[[User:Trappist the monk|Trappist the monk]] ([[User talk:Trappist the monk|talk]]) 15:42, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

:::::::Thank you. [[User:Davidhof|Davidhof]] ([[User talk:Davidhof|talk]]) 17:37, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

:::::::Oh no, not even close. Say where you got it is barely a footnote here. Verifiability, no original research and neutral point of view and by virtue of them, good attribution is the  lifeblood of the encyclopedia. Every thing we do that makes a source's use better attributed utterly dwarfs any concern over metadata.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 22:29, 16 September 2014 (UTC)

::::::::All of that is more or less true except that WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT is much more important than you suggest.  Without editors adhere to WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT, readers can't verify, can't check for original research, can't be assured of a neutral point of view.  But none of that is grounds to require or even encourage editors to provide author affiliations in citations.

::::::::That most readers consume a citation's information in its visual form, is not justification for intentionally corrupting that same information for readers who consume it in its metadata form.  They are all readers regardless of how they read.

::::::::—[[User:Trappist the monk|Trappist the monk]] ([[User talk:Trappist the monk|talk]]) 11:41, 17 September 2014 (UTC)
:::::::::Say where you got it is very important. I did not mean to imply it is not. The issue is that it is generally ''irrelevant'' to what we are talking about here. That is, its guidance to say where you got it, is not germane to the nuanced attribution issue here, that will inform readers of something substantive about the particular source's character. Meanwhile, what do you think: is it  .01%, .02%, a bit more of our readers that will consume the information in metadata form for the purposes I am talking about?  I understand your point. But it omits proportionality, which is phenomenally one-sided here. That is why I stated it previously as a balancing test; that in "weighing" a less well formatted citation in which the attribution is not as accessible, against this metadata issue, "I choose the [in this case, former] by a very wide margin".--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 17:48, 17 September 2014 (UTC)

== Translation of Wikipedia Articles ==

Good day
I am unable to determine how to access the text of an existing English translation of an article.

The current English article is very small and would like to provide the full Lithuanian article in translation. 
I have read the translation section and understand what I need to do once I have completed the translation.
Do I sign in with my user name and password, select Edit and then place my translation in the code?

Please advise.

Thanks

:Hello, {{U|WarrenAnthony|Warren}}. Basically yes. If there's really nothing worth keeping from the original page you can just delete what's there; but consider merging what's there if there's anything which isn't in the Lithuanian, especially if it's sourced. Do bear in mind the remarks at [[WP:translation]] about attributing the source. And also remember that everything in the English Wikipedia ought to be referenced to [[WP:IRS|reliable independent sources]] (English ones if possible, but if they don't exist, other language sources are acceptable): different Wikipedias have different rules on this (and older articles, even in en.wikipedia, may be inadequately sourced by current standards), so if you are going to translate into English, please provide comprehensive references even if they are not there in the original.

== Is there another medication like Provigil/Nuvigil/Modafinil? ==

I have "Refactory" or "Treatment Resistant" Depression. I don't mean to assume you don't know what that is, but the things necessary in order to be diagnosed as such are:  1) Many combinations of anti-convulsants together or combined with anti-psychotics or mood stabilizers, 2) Having had Electro Shock Therapy Treatments, and 3) Having had the Vagus Nerve Stimulator implanted (which device is inserted in major surgery under your arm near your left (in my case) breast and run up to rest in your neck.  It then sends brain waves to your brain to stop depression.

I have had all of these beginning in 1983.  I have been disabled since 7/31/85.  My depression also incudes a lack of motivation to the point of being unable to do anything but lie around a lot of days.  I also have other mental illness diagnoses, along with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and a few physical problems.

I live in New Jersey, U.S.A., and have Medicare A $ B plus Medicare Part D for prescriptions plus PAAD--New Jersey's Pharmaceutical Aid for the Aged and Disabled, which cuts the cost of the prescriptions a bit more.

Five or 6 years ago, my Psychiatrist tried me on Nuvigil.  It was amazing how it worked immediately and took away the depression and gave me motivation!  Then my Doctor got a letter, which I was cc'd on, stating they weren't going to pay for it, try the medication at the end of the letter.  It was Provigil.  It worked just as well, and then I got a letter the same as the one for Nuvigil, but there was no suggestion for another medication.  I went back to the way I was.

I then proceeded with my Doctor's permission to buy Modafinil from Overseas.  Three months ago, I got a letter from U.S. Customs that they seized my package and I would be fined and criminally responsible (at the Federal level) if I tried to order it again.

Now I am a mess again.  My Doctor put me on Ritalin, but it is not helping.  His next move is to put me on Aderall, which he said he has his doubts about since it isn't much different to Ritalin.

Ny question is, has anyone ever heard of something that would work and not be outrageously expensive, that my doctor can prescribe for me.

The reason they denied them in the first place is they weren't approved by the FDA for my diagnosis.  The price of each for 30 pills here is between $800 and $1,000.

Needless to say, I can't afford that.

I am not living.  My life consists of talking on the phone, playing games on my computer, and doing what chores I can push myself to do, which isn't much.

If there is anything you can suggest to me, I would appreciate it.  I want my life back.  I had 5 years of life since 1985.  I would never commit suicide because I am a Christian, but if someone told me I wasn't going to wake up tomorrow morning, I would be relieve.

I am sorry this is so lengthy.

Thank you for anything you may be able to relate to me to help.

:1) for help determining copyright and usability status of that image on Wikipedia, you may find <s>[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems]]</s> to have the appropriate subject matter experts to help determine the facts for your specific question for use on Wikipedia. 
:2) participation in any Wikipedia project is open to any wikipedia editor (unless they prove themselves too disruptive and become subject of a topic ban). I have a feeling though, Lithuania  wiki project is probably a pretty small and not very active group. you may find more activity and community help in the Military wiki project. [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history]]
:3) the notice is probably referring to you as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&diff=prev&oldid=625395323 you identified yourself] as [[WP:COI|having a personal relationship with the subject of the article]] and have been the majority editor. -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]] 22:23, 14 September 2014 (UTC)
:::{{ping|Zckjsrbn }} Actually [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]] is probably a better a better forum, since the "Problems" forum is related to images currently on Wikipedia. -- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]] 16:07, 15 September 2014 (UTC)

== ‎MediaWiki message delivery ==

I have a lot of user/talk pages on my watchlist. Many of those users receive these messages (for the Signpost). Is there any way to hide those messages on my watchlist. I don't want to hide anything else. Thanks.--[[User:Bbb23|Bbb23]] ([[User talk:Bbb23|talk]]) 22:06, 14 September 2014 (UTC)
:Signpost is delivered by a bot.  You can block bot edits from showing up on your watchlist.  Though that doesn't then show you the next previous non-bot edit on your watchlist.  I don't think there's a way to block edits from a specific user (bot or not) on your watchlist.  <span style="font-family:monospace;">[[User:Dismas|Dismas]]</span>|[[User talk:Dismas|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 00:47, 15 September 2014 (UTC)
