The '''2014 Emirates Cup''' was a pre-season [[Association football|football]] [[Exhibition game|friendly tournament]] hosted by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at its home ground, the [[Emirates Stadium]] in London. It was the eighth [[Emirates Cup]], an invitational competition inaugurated in 2007. Held on the weekend of 2–3 August 2014, the participants were Arsenal, [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]].

The competition follows a point scoring system whereby each team plays two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a loss. An additional point is awarded for every goal scored. Arsenal did not face Valencia, and Benfica did not play against Monaco. On the first day of the Emirates Cup, [[Yaya Sanogo]] scored four goals as Arsenal eased to a 5–1 victory over Benfica, while Valencia and Monaco played out a 2–2 draw. Arsenal's failure to earn a point against Monaco on the final day meant Valencia won the tournament having come from a goal down to beat Benfica by two clear goals.

==Background==
The [[Emirates Cup]] began in July 2007 once Arsenal finalised plans to stage a pre-season competition at its [[Emirates Stadium|home ground]].<ref name="deta">{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/155/unhoused-import-pages/latest-stadium-news/valencia-replace-hamburg-at-emirates-cup |archiveurl=https://archive.is/rpntb |title=Valencia replace Hamburg at Emirates Cup |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=11 June 2007 |archivedate=29 June 2016 |accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> [[Primeira Liga]] champions [[S.L.

Arsenal played Benfica in the day's second match. [[Alexis Sánchez]], who joined Arsenal from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the summer was named in the squad, while new signing [[Calum Chambers]] started in defence.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Ornstein |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28177987 |title=Alexis Sanchez: Barcelona forward signs for Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="gua">{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Murray |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2014/aug/02/arsenal-v-benfica-emirates-cup-live-report |title=Arsenal 5–1 Benfica: Emirates Cup – as it happened |website=theguardian.com |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> The hosts made a lively start and went ahead in the 26th minute; [[Yaya Sanogo]] with his back on goal managed to back-flick the ball past goalkeeper [[Artur Moraes]].<ref name="gua"/> Sanogo and [[Héctor Bellerín]] linked up well to set [[Joel Campbell]] up to score Arsenal's second and before the half was over Sanogo added two more goals to complete a hat-trick.<ref name="gua"/> Arsenal made it 5–0 early in the second half as Sanogo profited from Artur's failure to hold onto the ball.<ref name="obsr">{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Doyle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/02/arsenal-benfica-emirates-cup-match-report |title=Arsenal’s Yaya Sanogo hits four in friendly rout of Benfica |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> [[Nicolás Gaitán]] scored Benfica's only goal of the match, but the hosts were rarely troubled after that.<ref name="gua"/> Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] said of his opponents after the game: "It is very difficult to draw any conclusions after a game like that. Benfica might be on a different level of preparation. But for important periods of the game we played the way we want to play."<ref name="obsr"/>

On the second day Valencia beat Benfica 3–1. The Spanish side went a goal behind in the second minute after Benfica forward [[Franco Jara]] ran down the right and crossed the ball in the [[penalty area]] for [[Vanderley Dias Marinho|Derley]] to score.<ref name="valbenf">{{cite news |first=Max |last=Jones |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20140803/benfica-1-3-valencia-match-report |title=Benfica 1–3 Valencia, match report |publisher=Arsenal F.C |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref> Though Valencia responded well by creating a few chances of their own, Benfica almost scored a second, but for Jara's {{convert|25|yard|m}} strike hitting the crossbar in the 39th minute.<ref name="valbenf"/> As the match resumed in the second half, Valencia started well and equalised in the 49th minute thanks to [[José Luis Gayà]].<ref name="valbenf"/> Four minutes later [[Pablo Piatti]] scored and [[Andrés Guardado]] made sure of Valencia's victory when he took advantage of Artur's inability to hold onto the ball.<ref name="valbenf"/>

Arsenal went into the final day of the tournament as favourites to win the Emirates Cup.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Dyer |url=https://betting.betfair.com/football/premier-league/emirates-cup-arsenal-odds-on-to-make-it-a-winning-weekend-030814-205.html |title=Emirates Cup: Arsenal odds-on to make it a winning weekend |website=Betfair |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> Against Monaco, they started Sánchez and [[Mathieu Debuchy]], while [[Olivier Giroud]] came in for Sanogo – the notable changes from the win against Benfica.<ref name="rest">{{cite news |url=https://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1415/post/first-team/arsenal-v-as-monaco-match-report |title=Arsenal 0–1 Monaco, match report |publisher=Arsenal F.C |date=3 August 2014 |accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref> Monaco's Falcao headed in the only goal of the match, coming at a time when his team "became more urgent".<ref name="rest"/> Though Arsenal picked up the pace in the second half, aided by Wenger's substitutions and the decision to play Sánchez in a central forward position, they were unable to score.<ref name="rest"/> Valencia therefore won the tournament, finishing one point ahead of runners-up Arsenal.<ref name="rest"/>

==Standings==
Each team played two matches, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a draw and a point for every goal scored. In addition, shots on target were taken into account and used to decide the competition winners if teams are level on points and goal difference.<ref name="emline"/>
