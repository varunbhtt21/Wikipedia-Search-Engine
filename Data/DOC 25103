== Review of: [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Jeddah_Guide]] ==

Would appreciate it if someone could review my article before I submit again. Is the content enough?

:{{unnecessary}} If you want to write a travel guide, read about [[Wikitravel]].  That said, the previous reviewer told you there was no content and that's more or less still true.  You have a couple wikilinks and a few [[WP:EXT|external links]] in the body, which is not recommended. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 07:17, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Oliver JS Bruce]] ==

Could I just check that this article we have written on Oliver is pending review?

:{{replyto|PPOffice}} {{declined}} First, I become concerned when I see a user with your name writing a promotional article about a company called PinPoint.  It [[WP:NOTHERE|doesn't appear you're here to write an encyclopedia]]. Second, your entry doesn't have near enough [[WP:CITE|citations]] and without [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], there's no reason to believe the subject is [[WP:ANYBIO|notable]]. <font face="copperplate gothic light">[[User:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">Chris Troutman</span>]] ([[User talk:Chris troutman|<span style="color:#36454F">talk</span>]])</font> 19:16, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

== Review of [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Bharath Gyan]] ==

Hi

I have re-submitted my article based on feedback sometime back which I have been building for almost a year now.  I am keen to hear back from the reviewers.
I have taken up the case of creation of this article to espouse the alternate view of researchers (research-collators in htis case) who have dared to go into the ancient and pre-historic era which is otherwise consigned to the brackets of "mythology". mainstream and the dominant narrative is not inclusive, and look forward to free-world wikipedia to help me out here!!!

Looking forward to a communication from your end!!!!

:@[[User:Amudha ram|Amudha ram]] - I have asked WikiProject India [[WT:WikiProject India#Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Bharath Gyan|for an opinion]] as editors there are more likely to be familiar with the topic of your draft. Meanwhile you can try to improve the structure and flow of your text as it is currently rather hard to read.
