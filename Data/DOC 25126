Text : [[File:2007 05230149 Câlnic AB-II-a-A-00196.jpg|thumb|Câlnic Citadel]]
The '''Câlnic Citadel''' ({{lang-ro|Cetatea Câlnic}}; {{lang-de|Burg Kelling}}) is a citadel located in [[Câlnic, Alba|Câlnic]], [[Alba County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]]. It was built by a nobleman whose family later sold it to the local [[Germans|ethnic German]] [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community at a time when the area belonged to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. When still used for defensive purposes, the double walls encompassed a residential [[keep]], storerooms and a [[Roman Catholic]] chapel that became [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheran]] following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Together with the surrounding village, the citadel forms part of the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

==Description==
===Background and construction===
[[File:Ansamblul „Cetate” -vedere aeriana.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of the citadel]]
The [[Battle of Mohi|Mongol invasion of 1241]] prompted a surge in military construction in Transylvania, with wood and earthen defenses abandoned in favor of stone, assembled in haste and without much initial attention to artistic detail.<ref name="com"/> At Câlnic, the citadel began as a residence for a [[Graf]] ([[count]]), one of the last such to be built in Transylvania. Around 1270, the nobleman Chyl de Kelling, whose family gave the village its German name, built a keep for his residence.<ref name="org"/> The strong [[parallelepiped]] structure, with a ground floor and three floors for living space, came to be known as the Siegfried tower.<ref name="ghinea">Dan Ghinea, ''Enciclopedia geografică a României'', p.390. Editura Enciclopedică, Bucharest, 2000. {{ISBN|978-97345-014-8-9}}</ref> Frequent [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attacks led the keep to be fortified with a defensive level and surrounded by a massive wall.<ref name="org">{{ro icon}} [http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/caxlnic-kelling/ Câlnic/Kelling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503095742/http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/caxlnic-kelling/ |date=2014-05-03 }} at biserici-fortificate.org</ref> The oval precinct around the keep was fitted with a guard tower to the south and a [[gate tower]] to the north.<ref name="com">{{ro icon}} [http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/calnic___kelling/91/ Câlnic/Kelling] at biserici-fortificate.com</ref><ref name="ghinea"/> The structure was surrounded by a water-filled [[moat]], with access only by [[drawbridge]]. The noble owners never went along very well with the local notables, and in 1430, the final Graf sold the citadel to the villagers and moved away.<ref name="org"/>

Once the Saxon community took ownership, they extended it by building a second fortification wall and a tower in the southern part, using the structure for refuge during Ottoman raids. Within were built storerooms and living quarters for withstanding sieges; these have not survived.<ref name="org"/> After the second wall was finished in the 16th century, two levels were added to the keep (which reached over 20 m in height) so that defenders could fire guns outside the wall precincts.<ref name="djc">{{ro icon}} Marius Porumb, Ciprian Firea, [http://www.alba.djc.ro/ObiectiveDetalii.aspx?ID=2235 Cetatea Câlnic] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140503045610/http://www.alba.djc.ro/ObiectiveDetalii.aspx?ID=2235 |date=2014-05-03 }} at the Alba County Cultural Affairs Office site</ref> At the end of the 15th century, a small [[hall church]]-type chapel with an [[apse]] was built for the fort<ref name="org"/> on the site of an earlier, ruined sacred building. The chapel interior features fresco fragments from the beginning of the 16th century. Its western side has a wooden platform decorated with panels painted in 1733 in a floral, folk-[[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] style.<ref name="djc"/> In the mid-16th century, the moat was filled and the drawbridge replaced by a [[gatehouse]] fitted with a [[portcullis]]. The Ottomans destroyed the village in 1658, but failed to take the citadel.<ref name="org"/>

===Surroundings and recognition===
Restoration work was done between 1961 and 1964. Since 1995,<ref name="djc"/> the site has been administered by a foundation of [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]]. The tower hosts a museum detailing the local Saxons' lifestyle and traditions,<ref name="org"/> while the chapel hosts lectures. Nearby, there is a former Lutheran parish house built in the 16th century and enlarged in 1779; beyond that is a church on a hill, surrounded by a cemetery.<ref name="com"/> Villagers built the church in the 15th century, although it was much altered in the 19th century and now has a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style. Its two [[Church tabernacle|tabernacles]] and the [[sacristy]] portal are original carved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] items, while two [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[pulpit]]s are from the second part of the 18th century.<ref name="djc"/>

In 1999, Câlnic, together with five other places, was added to the already-listed [[Biertan]] to form the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165 "World Heritage Committee Inscribes 48 New Sites on Heritage List"] at the UNESCO site</ref> Additionally, the citadel is listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by Romania's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], the following considered separate monuments: the keep, the chapel, the inner wall, the outer wall, the church and the parish house.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_AB.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Alba]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
