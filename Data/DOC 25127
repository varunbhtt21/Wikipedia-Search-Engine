'''xHamster''' is a [[Pornography|pornographic]] media and [[social networking]] site headquartered in the Cypriot city of [[Limassol]],<ref name="TNW-BW"/> with offices in [[Houston]], [[Kyoto]], and [[London]]. xHamster serves user-submitted pornographic videos, [[webcam model]]s, pornographic photographs, and [[erotic literature]], and incorporates social networking features. xHamster was founded in 2007. With more than 10 million members, it is the third most popular pornography website on the Internet after [[XVideos]] and [[Pornhub]].

The site produces ''[[The Sex Factor]]'', a [[reality TV]] series in which men and women compete to become [[porn stars]]. The site has been targeted as part of [[malvertising]] campaigns, and some governments have blocked xHamster as part of larger initiatives against [[Internet pornography]].

==History==
In early 2007, a group of anonymous individuals decided to create a new adult video service,<ref name=TNW-BW/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://xhamster.com/about.php|title=About Us|website=xHamster|accessdate=4 July 2016}}</ref> and xHamster was launched on 2 April 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whois.domaintools.com/xhamster.com|title=XHamster.com WHOIS, DNS, & Domain Info - DomainTools|work=[[WHOIS]]|date=2016|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> xHamster was envisioned as a [[social network]]; a spokesperson said the site's content organization scheme was intended to allow "people who wanted to chat, exchange erotic pics and share amateur videos ... to find mutual friends online and maybe discover partners interested in intimate relationships."<ref name=TNW-BW>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/03/03/the-almost-invisible-men-and-women-behind-the-worlds-largest-porn-sites/|title=The (almost) invisible men and women behind the world’s largest porn sites|website=The Next Web|date=3 March 2016|author=Ben Woods}}</ref> Surpassing 10 million members in 2015, xHamster became the third most popular pornography Internet website, after [[XVideos]] and [[Pornhub]].<ref name="TNW-BW"/> In May 2016, xHamster launched ''[[The Sex Factor]]'', a reality series competition where contestants compete to become a [[porn star]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/belle-knox-host-x-rated-reality-show-sex-factor-article-1.1808954|title=Belle Knox to host X-rated reality show, ‘The Sex Factor’|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/05/30/porn-star-belle-knox-to-host-racy-reality-show/ |title=Porn star Belle Knox to host racy reality show|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/53171/duke-porn-star-sex-factor-porn-reality-tv/|title=Belle Knox: Duke Porn Star Lands Hosting Gig on Porn Reality Show|author=Michelle Arrouas|work=TIME.com|accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>

xHamster has restricted access to its site and removed content in response to political issues concerning the [[LGBT community]] and [[rape culture]]. The site blocked users with IP addresses based in [[North Carolina]] during April 2016, after the state enacted a law that stopped its counties and cities from passing laws to protect [[LGBT]] people.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bruce Springsteen or porn site, who will get North Carolina to change its anti-LGBT laws?|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/world/2016/04/12/Bruce-Springsteen-or-porn-site-who-will-get-North-Carolina-to-change-its-anti-LGBT-laws|accessdate=12 April 2016|work=Times Live|date=12 April 2016}}</ref> In response to the verdict of the ''[[People v.

In August 2016, Alex Hawkins stated that xHamster will be sponsoring a trip for [[Brendan Dassey]] to [[Wrestlemania]]. He stated "We are pleased that we can make this young man’s dream of going to Wrestlemania come true...

In September 2016, Alex Hawkins speaking for xHamster confirmed that they had purchased a sex tape alleged to portray American actress [[Alexis Arquette]], which was put up for sale by an ex-lover shortly after her death. xHamster destroyed all copies of it, announcing that "Ms. Arquette was an icon and activist in the [[transgender|trans]] community and we could not see someone smear her memory the way the selling party was trying to do."<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/alexis-arquette-sex-tape-report_us_57dabeede4b08cb14094251c?section=us_queer-voices|title = Porn Site Buys Alexis Arquette Sex Tape But Not For The Reason You'd Think|date = 17 September 2016|accessdate = 18 September 2016|newspaper = [[Huffington Post]]|last = Wong|first = Curtis.}}</ref>

In February 2017, xHamster held auditions for U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Trump's family members, and Trump cabinet member lookalikes. The winners will be cast in porn parodies.

In August 2017 xHamster sent a letter to the creators of the television series ''[[Sense8]]'', [[The Wachowskis|Lilly and Lana Wachowski]], requesting to host the third season of ''Sense8''. ''Sense8'' was originally broadcast by [[Netflix]] which chose not to renew the season. Lana Wachowski stated that content for a third season was being created hoping that someone would pick the series up. In the letter to the Wachowskis, Alex Hawkins stated, "xHamster has a long history of fighting for the rights of sexual speech, and non-normative sexuality. In addition to allowing billions of users to connect with individual articulations of gender and sexuality, we continue to use our audience to speak up against repressive anti-LGBTQ laws in the US and abroad, and for sex-ed in public schools Planned Parenthood and the rights of sex workers."<ref>{{cite web|title=Porn site xHamster steps in to save ‘Sense8’|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/xhamster-save-sense8/|publisher=The Daily Dot|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Porn Site Wants To Revive ‘Sense8,’ And Not As A Parody|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-porn-site-wants-to-revive-sense8_us_59984aeee4b0e8cc855dff58|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>

In response to Utah lawmakers rejecting a sexual education bill in February 2017, xHamster started presenting a popup to visitors from Utah, offering them to view xHamster's sexual education series "The Box".

In April 2017 in response to President Trump's decision to allow states to deny federal money to Planned Parenthood, xHamster stated that they would be posting to their site information on Planned Parenthood with a popup encouraging donations to the organization.

===Censorship===
xHamster has been blocked by various governments. In August 2015, the [[government of India]] ordered [[Internet service providers]] to block several sites, including xHamster, under the [[Information Technology Act, 2000|IT Act]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/porn-block-in-india-hundreds-of-sexual-websites-banned-internet-outraged-10434499.html|title=Porn block in India: hundreds of sexual websites banned, internet outraged|date=3 August 2015 |work=[[The Independent]]|last=Griffin|first=Andrew}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Consumer/fUzuGl0WR2TTShRUu8TxcM/How-blocked-websites-are-trolling-Indias-porn-ban.html|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]|date=4 August 2015|title=How blocked websites are trolling India’s porn ban|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> In Russia, a local court in the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] ruled in favour of a block on xHamster and other pornographic websites in April 2014; the ruling was passed on a year later to [[Roskomnadzor]], the state media overseer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/russia-porn-ban-tatarstan|title=Century-old law cited in request to ban 136 porn sites from Republic of Tatarstan|date=14 April 2014|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/585309|date=13 April 2015|publisher=[[Izvestia]]|script-title=ru:Роскомнадзор внесет сразу 136 порносайтов в черный список|trans-title=Roskomnadzor will add 136 pornographic sites to the blacklist|last=Zykov|first=Vladimir|language=Russian}}</ref>

Legislation to restrict pornographic sites include efforts targeted at reducing [[human trafficking]] which may mandate electronic manufactures to install content filters to restrict "obscene" material. Nevertheless, organizations in support of free speech have been speaking out against the efforts to include porn sites such as xHamster which noted 125 million clicks from Thailand and 95 million clicks from users in Turkey in which the site is banned.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porn Ban: Free Speech Groups, Porn Sites Oppose Legislation To Block 'Obscene' Content|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/porn-ban-free-speech-groups-porn-sites-oppose-legislation-block-obscene-content-2524767|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>

Other attempts at censoring has its basis in violating [[net neutrality]], whereby governments may restrict bandwidth to various Internet categories. xHamster's Alex Hawkins stated, "As an international company, we see every day how restrictive governments use regulatory tools, like traffic throttling, to limit access to not only porn but political speech."<ref>{{cite web|title=Porn Companies Tell Us Why the End of Net Neutrality Will Make Porn Boring|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbjyx4/porn-companies-tell-us-why-the-end-of-net-neutrality-will-make-porn-boring|publisher=Motherboard|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>

===Copyright infringement===
In 2011, xHamster was sued by Fraserside Holdings, Ltd., a producer of adult films and a subsidiary of [[Private Media Group, Inc.|Private Media Group Inc.]]<ref>{{cite web |title=COMPLAINT and Jury Demand|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Iowa_Northern_District_Court/3--11-cv-03025/Fraserside_IP_LLC_v._Hammy_Media_Ltd_et_al/2/ |publisher=Docket Alarm|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref> Fraserside and Private alleged that XHamster had infringed their copyrights by streaming copies of their adult media over the Internet. Fraserside brought the case in Iowa, and in 2012 Judge Mark Bennett found that U.S. courts lacked jurisdiction over xHamster because it is a Cyprus-based company with "no offices in Iowa, no employees in Iowa, no telephone number in Iowa[;] ... xHamster does not advertise in Iowa[;] No xHamster officer or director has ever visited Iowa[; and] ... All of xHamster’s servers are located outside of the United States."<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum re Defendant's Motion to Dismiss|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Iowa_Northern_District_Court/3--11-cv-03025/Fraserside_IP_LLC_v._Hammy_Media_Ltd_et_al/50/|website=Docket Alarm|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref> The copyright infringement case was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fraserside IP LLC v.
