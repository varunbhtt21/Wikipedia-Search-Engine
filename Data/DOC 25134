While it is sad that this man, a concept artist for a major games company died, enough time has now passed to allow a detached evaluation of weather this article should be on the wiki. Prior to Adamowicz' death in 2012, this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Adamowicz&oldid=473099293| diff] shows how the article stood: a stub linking to a development diary and a note suggesting at the time the article perhaps did not meet the [[Wikipedia:Notability]] guidelines.

Now, the article is little more than a memorial page pulling info from tribute pages. The tribute pages, including one from the company he worked for, seem better placed than the wiki to tell people about who this artist was. While there are a few news articles, it would seem largely created around the time of his death, I do not believe the artist meets the definition of the notability guidelines. Thus, this discussion for deletion.

*'''Keep''' The obituaries in the [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/arts/video-games/adam-adamowicz-artist-for-lush-video-game-worlds-dies-at-43.html?_r=0 NYT] and [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V9hM_XbAOcQC&pg=PA2 elsewhere] are ample evidence of notability. [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 09:13, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*:While I recognize that NYT is a reliable source, it does seem that most coverage about this artist is coming from obituaries. Surely more is needed to warrant an article to meet the "Significant coverage" category, not to mention the notability article cautions "if reliable sources cover the person only in the context of a single event, and if that person otherwise remains, or is likely to remain, a low-profile individual, we should generally avoid having a biographical article on that individual."
*:This returns to the point that the page, is largely a memorial page sourcing from obituaries and other memorials, rather than an article detailing why this artist is notable.[[User:Tempaccount040812|Tempaccount040812]] ([[User talk:Tempaccount040812|talk]]) 10:11, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::* Obituaries are typically about a person's life, not their death.  They are ideal sources for our purposes because they summarise their entire life rather than focussing upon some particular news event. [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 10:25, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''<s>Delete''' per [[WP:Notability]] and [[WP:NOT]]. Google search shows info is coming from obits and blogs.</s> [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 20:41, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - there's already two [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] with [[WP:SIGCOV|significant coverage]].  Therefore, he is [[WP:GNG|notable generally]]. This [[WP:STUB|stub needs work]], but that's not a reason to delete. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 17:57, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''': I do think the New York Times obit is a valid source. I'm impressed with the artist's work. However, I don't see [[WP:SIGCOV|significant coverage]] of this artist before his death and I really looked for it. I appreciate that he was very good at what he did and the fans certainly think highly of his work, but unless there's a wider notability, I can't see changing my ivote. As the nominator stated, this article is more a tribute and would be more suitable for a fan website, than a Wikipedia article.

:::* Numerous artists were not recognised until after they died — [[Van Gogh]], [[Gauguin]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] &c.  Coverage during the artist's life is therefore not required. [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 19:07, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Is that a Wikipolicy regarding artistis? [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 23:55, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Even if many artists are not recognized until after they have died (This borders on an OTHERSTUFFEXISTS argument, by the way), the question remains, has Adamowicz received any coverage outside of the single event of his death? For example, following his death, has any more coverage occurred? While obituaries may contain a lot of useful information about his life, that merely satisfies verifibility. Notability needs something more. It doesn't appear that he got coverage before or after his death, everything links to the single event. -- [[User:Ferret|ferret]] ([[User_talk:Ferret|talk]]) 18:26, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::IMHO, having a ''Times'' obit is proof of notability. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 21:53, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::I agree with that. After re-reading the 'significant coverage' rule, that seems to apply more to a one-time event. This fellow left his mark on these games. He was well-known in his circle, which means he had high visibility there. We have articles on writers and actors most people wouldn't recognize, but they were known among fans, critics, etc. I'm changing my ivote.
