'''BioMotiv''' is an accelerator company associated with [[The Harrington Project]], a $340 million initiative centered at [[University Hospitals of Cleveland]]. BioMotiv's mission is to accelerate breakthrough discoveries into medicines by advancing a portfolio of novel therapeutics in all disease areas and types of therapeutics. The BioMotiv model efficiently aligns capital and collaborations for the benefit of inventors, investors, and ultimately physicians and patients. Therapeutic opportunities are identified through relationships with [http://www.uhhospitals.org/services/harrington-discovery-institute The Harrington Discovery Institute], university and research institutions, disease foundations, and industry sources. Once opportunities are identified, BioMotiv oversees the development, funding, active management, and partnering of the therapeutic products.

==History==
The Harrington Project was launched as an effort to bridge varying aspects of the drug development sphere.
