'''[[Frederick Delius]]''' (1862â€“1934) was an English composer. Born in the north of England to a prosperous mercantile family, he was sent to [[Florida]] in 1884 to manage an orange plantation. Influenced by [[African-American music]], he began composing. After a brief period of formal musical study in Germany from 1886, he embarked on a full-time career as a composer in France, living in [[Grez-sur-Loing]] with his wife [[Jelka Rosen|Jelka]]. His first successes came in Germany in the late 1890s; it was not until 1907 that his music regularly appeared in British concerts. [[Thomas Beecham]] conducted the full premiere of ''[[A Mass of Life]]'' in London in 1909, staged the opera ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]'' at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1910, mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, and made gramophone recordings of many works. After 1918 Delius began to suffer the effects of [[syphilis]], became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions with the aid of [[Eric Fenby]]. His early compositions reflect the music he had heard in America and Europe; later he developed a style uniquely his own. The Delius Society, formed in 1962, promotes knowledge of his life and works, and sponsors an annual competition for young musicians. {{TFAFULL|Frederick Delius}}
