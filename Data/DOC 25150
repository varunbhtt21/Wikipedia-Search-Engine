*'''Comment:''' Subject does not meet [[Wikipedia:Notability]]. There are plenty of documentaries on the war, this one does not seem more notable than the rest. Wiki is not the IMDB. [[User:Tempaccount040812|Tempaccount040812]] ([[User talk:Tempaccount040812|talk]]) 05:13, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': This looks like it was actually a series as opposed to an individual documentary, but coverage is somewhat limited from what I can see so far. I may just recommend redirecting it to [[Guido Knopp]].

*'''Comment:''' Germany-made, German language documentary series about the major German generals of WWII. Will look for German-language sources and come back to this discussion.

:*'''Addendum:''' With further research, it appears that each of the stand-alone [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783649/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1 individual documentaries] that comprise this series have received individual commentary and analysis upon their particular releases.  To reflect the notability of the separate parts when lacking separate articles about those parts, this article should be expanded to list and describe each and include the critical response toward each.

*'''Keep:''' I think the issue is settles now. The documentary is the only documentary featuring Manstein's and Rommel's sons. It's the last documentary featuring Johann von Kielmansegg before his death in 2006. It's very well-known and notable because of the key insight into the life and career of 6 of some of the most famous military officers in German and military history given by unseen relatives and known veterans. The article has, also, vastly improved. [[User:Jonas Vinther|Jonas Vinther]] ([[User talk:Jonas Vinther|talk]]) 21:05, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
