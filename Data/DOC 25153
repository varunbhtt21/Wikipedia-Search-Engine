Subject does not meet [[Wikipedia:Notability]]. There are plenty of documentaries on the war, this one does not seem more notable than the rest. Wiki is not the IMDB. [[User:Tempaccount040812|Tempaccount040812]] ([[User talk:Tempaccount040812|talk]]) 05:13, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. I did some digging and found enough coverage via RS reviews to assert notability. It also looks like it's used in classrooms, or at least was, as it's recommended in a teacher's academic text.

*'''Keep'''. Considering the info you dug up and how you have fleshed out the article, which makes it clear it is not just ''another'' ww2 documentary, I rescind my objection to the article and agree it meets notability.[[User:Tempaccount040812|Tempaccount040812]] ([[User talk:Tempaccount040812|talk]]) 07:21, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
