To make matters worse, Timóteo decides to hang Jesuíno soon after the wedding ceremony. Everything seems to happen as expected.

In addition to the usual unrest in Brogodó caused by disputes between Timóteo and Jesuíno, a group of stars of silent film in Rio de Janeiro moves the city. Silverio Duarte, Tomás Lampedusa (Gillray Coutinho) and Vicentina Celeste (Mayana Neiva) want to film the story of Princess Aurora and need an actress to play her. They decide then organise a competition to find the most talented girl in the city. Vicentina Celeste is the super star of the capital and is dead jealous with the choice of a new artist. But, because she has a shrill voice, can only participate in even silent films. Farid, with his Lebanese blood, charm and accent, leaves the woman madly in love. And Vicentina use all her wiles to win him over. In the film, Thomas Lampedusa has another mission. The acclaimed director search to Brogodó an actor to take the capital. The chosen is Belarmino (João Miguel), right-hand Herculano captain. Bel stood out in the film of the bandits, presented by Penelope (Paula Burlamaqui) in Rio de Janeiro.

Belarmino takes the first steps to leave behind the life of a cangaçeiro, and rises to fame in the capital. The bandit acts with Lilica (Nanda Costa) in his first acting test, under the direction of Tomás Lampedusa. Penelope observes her beloved's talent with the text in hand, but is uncomfortable with the insinuations of Lilica. The journalist is afraid of being betrayed again, as was done to her by Said/Farid. Fond of Penelope, the bandit asks her to marry.
