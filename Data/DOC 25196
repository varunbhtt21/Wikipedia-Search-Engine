Title : Cord lining
Text : '''Cord lining''', cord tissue, or umbilical cord lining membrane, is the outermost layer of the [[umbilical cord]]. As the [[umbilical cord]] itself is an extension of the placenta, the umbilical cord lining membrane is an extension of the amniotic membrane covering the placenta. The umbilical cord lining membrane comprises two layers: the amniotic (or epithelial) layer and the sub-amniotic (or mesenchymal) layer. The umbilical cord lining membrane is a rich source of two strains of [[stem cell]]s: epithelial stem cells (from the amniotic layer) and [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s (from the sub-amniotic layer). Discovered by Singapore based CellResearch Corp in 2004, this is currently the best known source for harvesting human stem cells.

== Source of mesenchymal stem cells ==
The sub-amniotic region of the umbilical cord lining has been reported to be a source of [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)]].<ref>Kita, K. (2008). Isolation and characterization of mesenchymal stem cells from the sub-amniotic human umbilical cord lining membrane. Stem Cells and Developments, 19(4), 491-502.</ref><ref>Jeschke, M. (2011). Umbilical cord lining membrane and Wharton’s Jelly- derived mesenchymal stem cells: the similarities and differences. The Open Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Journal, 4, 21-27.</ref> These cells express MSC specific markers such as CD73, CD105 as well as Oct 3/4 and Nanog. Furthermore, these [[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSC]] can also be differentiated in-vitro into osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages. [[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSC]] from the sub-epithelial region of the cord lining can be expanded in-vitro for more than 30 passages or 90 population doublings without losing their multi-lineage differentiation capability or going into senescence.<ref>Patel, A. N. (2013). Mesenchymal stem cell population isolated from the subepithelial layer of umbilical cord tissue. Cell Transplantation, 22, 513-519.</ref>

[[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSC]] isolated from the cord lining membrane have been reported to be immune-privileged. Compared with MSC from the bone marrow, cord lining [[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSC]] showed more effective immune suppression presumably due to lower expression of HLA Class I on their surfaces and also higher expression of immune suppressive cytokines.<ref>Deuse, T. (2011). Immunogenicity and immunomodulatory properties of umbilical cord lining mesenchymal cells. Cell Transplantation, 20, 655-667.</ref> Compared with MSC from cord blood, placenta and Wharton’s Jelly, cord lining [[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSC]] showed the highest proliferation and migration potential. Furthermore, they expressed lower levels of HLA Class I and II, contributing to their lower immunogenicity.<ref>Stubbendorff, M. (2013). Immunological properties of extraembryonic human mesenchymal stromal cells derived from gestational tissue. Stem Cells and Development, 22(19), 1-9.</ref>

Pre-clinical studies performed on the cord lining [[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSC]] have revealed their potential in repairing heart muscle damage due to ischemia. A study performed in the rat model showed improved heart function and reduction of damaged myocardium when cord lining MSC combined with a fibrin gel carrier and a vascularized graft were introduced to the ischaemic area.<ref>Lilyanna, S. (2013). Cord lining-mesenchymal stem cells graft supplemented with an omental flap induces myocardial revascularization and ameliorates cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of chronic ischemic heart failure. Tissue Engineering Part A, 19(11-12), 1303-1315.</ref> A similar study combining the cord lining [[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSC]] with carrier endothelial cells within a fibrin matrix in-vivo also revealed improvement in cardiac function, reduction in scar tissue formation and better vascularization.<ref>Martinez, E. (2013). Grafts enriched with subamnion-cord-lining mesenchymal stem cell angiogenic spheroids induce post-ischemic myocardial revascularization and preserve cardiac function in failing rat hearts.

== Source of epithelial stem cells ==
The amniotic layer of the umbilical cord lining has been shown to contain a large population of [[Amniotic epithelial cells|epithelial stem cells (EpSC)]]. These cord lining [[Amniotic epithelial cells|EpSC]] exhibit classical pluripotent stem cell markers such as SSEA-4, Oct-4, SOX2 and Nanog.<ref name=":0">Huang, L. (2011). Stem cell-like properties of human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells and the potential for epidermal reconstitution. Cytotherapy, 13(2), 145-155.</ref> They also express p63, a specific marker of epithelial progenitor cells.<ref>[[Graziella Pellegrini|Pellegrini, G.]] (2001). p63 identifies keratinocyte stem cells. PNAS, 98(6), 3156-3161.</ref><ref name=":1">Reza, H. M. (2011). Characterization of a novel umbilical cord lining cell with CD227 positivity and unique pattern of P63 expression and function. Stem Cells Reviews and Reports, 7(3), 624-638.</ref> In-vitro organotypic culture of cord lining EpSC using the air-liquid interface method resulted in stratified epithelium being formed with expression of various forms of cytokeratins.<ref name=":0" /> Furthermore, due to their similarity in terms of phenotypic expression of keratins compared to normal human epidermal keratinocytes, cord lining [[Amniotic epithelial cells|EpSC]] have the potential to be an alternative source of cells for skin repair and regeneration.<ref>Ruetze, M. (2008). Common features of umbilical cord epithelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes. Journal of Dermatological Science, 50(3), 227-231.</ref>

Animal studies on cord lining [[Amniotic epithelial cells|EpSC]] have shown that genetic modifications using the proinsulin gene allowed transplanted stem cells to lower blood glucose levels in diabetic animals.<ref>Zhou, Y. (2011). Characterization of human umbilical cord lining-derived epithelial cells and transplantation potential. Cell transplantation, 20, 1827-1841.</ref> These cells also express HLA-G in the transmembrane and soluble form, aiding in their immunosuppressive behavior. In vitro studies also indicated that cord lining EpSC can be differentiated biochemically to become hepatocyte-like cells (liver cells) as shown by the expression of hepatic-specific markers such as â-fetoprotein, albumin and hepatocyte-specific cytokeratins.<ref>Cheong, H. H. (2013). Metabolically functional hepatocyte-like cells from human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells. Assay Drug Development and Technologies, 11(2), 130-138.</ref>

Cord lining [[Amniotic epithelial cells|EpSC]] show similarities to limbal [[stem cell]]s in terms of expression of ABCG2, HES1 and BMI1 in addition to p63.<ref name=":1" /> When transplanted onto rabbit eyes with corneal defects on a human amniotic membrane scaffold, these [[stem cell]]s could reconstitute the natural morphology of the corneal epithelium similar to that of a natural corneal surface. Such results were not seen when human amniotic membrane was used without the cells indicating the therapeutic value of the cord lining [[Amniotic epithelial cells|EpSC]].
