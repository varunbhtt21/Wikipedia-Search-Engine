Title : Category:Cricketers who have taken ten wickets in an innings
Text : The feat in [[cricket]] of a [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]] taking ten [[wicket]]s in a single [[Innings (cricket)|innings]] of a [[first-class cricket|first-class match]] is rare and has been recorded 83 times by 77 different players to the start of the [[2014 English cricket season]]. The earliest known instance was by [[Edmund Hinkly]] in 1848, though it may have been done in earlier times when scorecard compilation was rudimentary and catches were not credited as wickets to bowlers. [[Tich Freeman]] achieved it three times and three other players – [[W. G. Grace]], [[Hedley Verity]] and [[Jim Laker]] – have done it twice. Laker and [[Anil Kumble]] have taken all ten in a [[Test cricket|Test innings]].
