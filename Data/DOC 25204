* '''Keep''' Though I agree that this reads like a tribute to Mulay, the references are not weak. The [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article3381908.ece Hindu] calls him "Well-known Marathi author Dnyaneshwar Mulay". Also, he was the Ambassador of India to Maldives. Along with him being Member of Advisory Board, [[Sahitya Akademi]].  --[[User:Redtigerxyz|<font color = "red" >Redtigerxyz</font>]] <sup> [[User talk:Redtigerxyz|Talk]] </sup> 14:36, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''', albeit the article needs a rewrite for tone and npov, the person is notable enough to warrant an article, and there are sources availible. --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 23:54, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
