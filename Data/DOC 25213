===Career===

His views on [[evolution]] were incompatible with those of the Baptist Union and in 1948 he resigned from the ministry and became the museum's Curator of fossils, succeeding Alexander Robert Keble (1884–1963). He went on to be appointed assistant director in 1964, deputy director in 1969 and remained at the museum until his retirement in 1973.<ref name="adb" />
