==Life and career==
Selkowitz was born March 8, 1948 and grew up in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. His father was a [[pharmacist]].<ref name=PostApril2014 />

Selkowitz graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a B.A. in [[physics]].<ref name=lbl_resume /> While an undergraduate, Selkowitz's interest in the environment was increased through participation in [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[World Game]].<ref name=PostApril2014 /> He received a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Environmental Design from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (CalArts) in 1972.<ref name=PostApril2014 /> Before beginning his career at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Selkowitz taught at CalArts and worked at a consulting engineering firm.<ref name=lbl_resume /><ref name=PostApril2014 />

Selkowitz led research at Berkeley Lab to reduce the amount of heat transfer through windows. The [[low-emissivity]] (low-E) windows they developed have saved $7.7 billion on energy costs and 1.2 quadrillion BTUs, according to National Academy of Sciences' data.<ref name=PostApril2014 /> Selkowitz had to convince window manufacturers of the benefits of low-E glass before its use became widespread.<ref name=NPR>{{cite web| last =Harris| first =Richard| authorlink =| title =Energy-Saving Windows A Legacy Of '70s Oil Crisis| work =| publisher =[[National Public Radio]]| date =October 15, 2008| url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95309739| format =| doi =| accessdate =May 3, 2014| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/6PHt8JpCg?url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95309739| archivedate =May 3, 2014| deadurl =yes| df =}}</ref>

==Awards==
Selkowitz received the ENR Award of Excellence "for relentlessly working to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings and for moving the nation toward better building performance, as well as for being the master of commercializing energy-efficient building technologies and the mastermind of [[FLEXLAB]]," the Facility for Low-Energy eXperiments in Buildings located at Berkeley Lab.<ref name=PostApril2014 />

Selkowitz is a recipient of the Berkeley Lab Prize – Lifetime Achievement Award in the area of societal impact. This award honors a career of achievement and Selkowitz was recognized for his work to reduce energy use in buildings.<ref name=LabPrize>{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Bissell, Selkowitz Recipients of Lifetime Achievement Awards| work =| publisher =Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory| date =| url =http://today.lbl.gov/bissell-selkowitz-recipients-of-lifetime-achievement-awards| format =| doi =| accessdate =May 2, 2014| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/6PHq7og8F?url=http://today.lbl.gov/bissell-selkowitz-recipients-of-lifetime-achievement-awards| archivedate =May 3, 2014| deadurl =yes| df =}}</ref>
