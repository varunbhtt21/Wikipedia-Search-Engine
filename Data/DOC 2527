In 2012, the U.S.-Japan Council (Japan) was created to support the administration of the TOMODACHI Initiative. In 2013, U.S.-Japan Council (Japan) became a Public Interest Corporation (''Koeki Zaidan Hojin'').<ref>{{cite web | url = http://usjapantomodachi.org/about-us/usjc-japan_operations/ | title = U.S.-Japan Council (Japan) Operations | publisher = TOMODACHI Initiative | accessdate = 24 April 2014 }}</ref>

President [[Barack Obama]] and Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] praised the work of the U.S.-Japan Council in supporting the U.S.-Japan relationship in a Joint Statement issued during their April 2014 Summit.  The Joint Statement particularly highlighted the importance of the Japan American Leadership Delegation and the TOMODACHI Initiative, two of the U.S.-Japan Council's signature programs.<ref>{{cite web|last=White House|first=Briefing Room|title=U.S.-Japan Joint Statement|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/25/us-japan-joint-statement-united-states-and-japan-shaping-future-asia-pac|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

==Organization==

==The Tomodachi Initiative==
The Tomodachi Initiative is a [[public–private partnership]] between the U.S.-Japan Council and the [[Embassy of the United States in Tokyo|U.S. Embassy in Tokyo]]. Born out of support for Japan’s recovery from the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami]] in 2011, Tomodachi invests in the next generation of Japanese and American leaders through educational and cultural exchanges as well as leadership programs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://usjapantomodachi.org/ | title = TOMODACHI Initiative | publisher = TOMODACHI Initiative | accessdate = 24 April 2014 }}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great Tohoku earthquake]], USJC created the U.S.-Japan Council Earthquake Relief Fund, which supported the relief and recovery efforts of several NPOs and NGOs in Japan. Ambassador [[John V. Roos]], who was serving in Japan at the time, approached USJC to work with the embassy to implement a public-private partnership. This then became the Tomodachi Initiative.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://journal.accj.or.jp/interview-partnership | title = Investing in the future: Initiative helps foster young leaders to strengthen US–Japan relations | publisher = ACCJ Journal | accessdate = 24 April 2014 }}</ref>
