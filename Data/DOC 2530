==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Render to Caesar'' has been met with mixed reviews. ''Sodas & Popcorn'' gave it a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, it cited that the film has plot holes, says the technicalities are flawed mostly as a result of "lazy job". It concluded by stating: "For a genre which hasn’t really been explored in the Nigerian movie scene much, it tries to be unique by bringing in witty dialogues and a good degree of continuity, until pieces of the big puzzle (which are supposed to add up) fail to do so. ''Render to Caesar'' is an experiment, which even with its many flaws, in the end is a big step forward".<ref name="Sodas&Pops">{{cite web | url=http://www.bellanaija.com/2014/04/02/sodas-popcorn-movie-review-render-to-caesar/ | title=Sodas & Popcorn – Movie Review: Render To Caesar | publisher=BellaNaija.com | work=Bella Naija | date=2 April 2014 | accessdate=24 April 2014 | author=Sodas and Popcorn}}</ref> Wilfred Okiche of [[YNaija]] says: "''Render to Caesar'' wants to be many things at once. A crime thriller, a police procedural, a love story and a twisty film noir". He pointed out that although the film has its good moments, the moments are often ruined with bizarre turn of events, easy predictability or ridiculous plotholes. He added: "The special effects are not as spectacular as they could have been, the acting isn’t as fine as it should and the screenplay, with its twists and turns isn’t as impressive as it fancies itself". He concluded by saying the film seem more like an "experiment" than a "confident production".<ref name="YNaija">{{cite web | url=http://www.ynaija.com/movie-review-render-to-caesar-makes-a-credible-spirited-effort/ | title=Movie review: Render to Caesar makes a credible, spirited effort | publisher=[[YNaija]] | work=Ynaija Magazine | date=1 June 2014 | accessdate=20 June 2014 | author=Okiche, Wilfred}}</ref>

Wilfred Okiche commended the film for its brilliant portrayal of the Nigerian Police force. He cited Ejim as the outstanding act in the film, but also stated that there is no chemistry between Omoni and Gbenga on screen and that their romantic scenes turn out to be one of the down sides of the screenplay.<ref name="YNaija" />

===Accolades===
''Render to Caesar'' received 9 nominations and won 2 awards at the [[2014 Nollywood Movies Awards]]. It also received 3 nominations and won 2 awards at the [[2014 Best of Nollywood Awards]].
