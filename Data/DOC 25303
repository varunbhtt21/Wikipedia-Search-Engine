The '''First National Bank''' is a historic building located at 101 S. Main St. in [[Erick, Oklahoma|Erick]], [[Oklahoma]]. The two-story frame building was built in 1907. The building was primarily used as the city's bank; however, it also housed a barbershop in the rear and at one point had a second barbershop in the basement. The second floor of the building held various professional offices, including the courts of local justices of the peace. The bank operated in the building until 1968, during which time it served as Erick's commercial center.

After the bank closed, the '''100th Meridian Museum''' occupied the building; the museum commemorates the survey of the [[100th meridian west]], a benchmark of which is set in the bank's wall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruth|first=Kent|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: First National Bank|url={{NRHP url|id=79001987}}|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=May 3, 2014|date=June 1979}} {{NRHP url|id=79001987|title=Accompanied by photos|photos=y}}.</ref>
