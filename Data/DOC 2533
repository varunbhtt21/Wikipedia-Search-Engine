'''''Gracixalus lumarius''''' also known as the '''thorny tree frog''' is a species of [[rhacophorid]] frogs discovered in 2014 that is native to [[Vietnam]].<ref>http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/03/new-frog-species-vietnam-animals-science-world/</ref><ref name=Rowleyetal2014>{{cite journal|authors=Jodi J.

==Etymology==
Gracixalus Lumarius (lat. lumƒÅrius, associated with the thorns) is named after their extensive [[conical tubercles]] on the dorsum of the male.

==Description==
[[File:Gracixalus lumarius 02.png|thumb|Gracixalus lumarius,Male,breeding season]]
Gracixalus Lumarius is a medium-sized rhacophorid.The species has a strong [[sexual dimorphism]].
From the snout to the vent Adult females measure about 36 millimeters,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=A striking new species of phytotelm-breeding tree frog|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2014/f/zt03785p037.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> while the males are larger with about 38-41 millimeters.<ref name=":0" />
The Head of Gracixalus Lumarius is wider than long, while viewed dorsally its snout is rounded. 
Their dorsum has a colour between brown and dark yellow, their vent is pink. 
The pupil is horizontal and oval, while their Iris is gold.

The back and the head of the males displays tuberculated skin with keratinized spikes, which is often referred as a sandpaper skin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/03/new-frog-species-vietnam-animals-science-world/|title=New Species: Pink-and-Yellow Frog With Spikes|website=National Geographic (blogs)|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> 
This specific dorsal structure is name giving and shows the male's breeding readiness.
Females have a constant clear, smooth skin.
Gracixalus Lumarius is a [[phytotelma]] breeder it deposite their Eggs above water on walls of them.
Females lay about 130 blue-gray Eggs.

==Habitat==
Gracixalus Lumarius is known to live underwater in tree holes.
Its natural [[habitat]] is in the relatively undisturbed montane bamboo and evergreen forests on a height of 5,900 feet and in the surrounding area of [[Mount Ngoc Linh]] (Vietnam).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Gracixalus&where-species=lumarius|title=AmphibiaWeb - Gracixalus lumarius|website=amphibiaweb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>

==Status==
Gracixalus Lumarius is an [[Endangered species|endangered]] (EN) species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=IUCN|title=Gracixalus lumarius: IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/73726400/0|journal=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|doi=10.2305/iucn.uk.2015-4.rlts.t73726400a73726406.en}}</ref>
The geographical range with a [[extent of occurrence]] of 426&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is very restricted. There is an ongoing decrease in populations due to further habitat loss and degradation. One reason for this is the conversion of forest to agricultural land. There is a high probability that the gold mining activity has also an influence on the forest quality. 
Half of their extent of occurrence is unprotected, so the natural habitat is endangered.
