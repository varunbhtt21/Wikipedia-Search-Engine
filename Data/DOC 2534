This roller coaster is a mass-produced roller coaster. There are several roller coasters that have the exact same layout/characteristics of this roller coaster. A search on Google and Yahoo returned no reliable sources regarding the roller coaster that could be included to support the notability of the topic.

*'''Delete''' Per nominator. There's nothing here about why this particular version of this design is notable. In fact, there's almost nothing here except for a prose version of the infobox.  --'''[[User:McDoobAU93|<span style="color:#000080">McDoob</span>]][[User talk:McDoobAU93|<span style="color:#cc5500">AU93</span>]]''' 23:11, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. Non-notable article created by banned user. <span style="color:orange">[[User:Andrewman327|Andrew]]<sup>[[User talk:Andrewman327|327]]</sup></span> 04:31, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::While I agree it was started by a user who is indeed now banned, [[WP:AGF]] suggests that shouldn't be a factor in its potential deletion at this point. The ban came after the article was created and after the previous AFD resulted in "keep".  --'''[[User:McDoobAU93|<span style="color:#000080">McDoob</span>]][[User talk:McDoobAU93|<span style="color:#cc5500">AU93</span>]]''' 21:12, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I agree with you that an article should not be deleted merely because its author was later banned, but this particular article is also non-notable for the reasons discussed here in greater detail. <span style="color:orange">[[User:Andrewman327|Andrew]]<sup>[[User talk:Andrewman327|327]]</sup></span> 04:13, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Pinfari built over 200 Zyklon coasters. This is just one of 200 small portable coasters — nothing notable about that.[[User:JlACEer|—<span style="color:#6209d1;background:#dcdcdc">'''JlACEer'''</span>]] ([[User talk:JlACEer|<span style="color:#808c8e">'''talk'''</span>]]) 15:05, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
