Title : ATP11C
Text : {{Infobox gene}}
'''ATP11C''' is an [[enzyme]] that in humans is encoded by the ''ATP11C'' [[gene]].

== Function ==

ATP11C encodes a member of the Type IV [[P-ATPase|P-type]] ATPase family that is thought to transport or 'flip' aminophospholipids. The corresponding protein in mice is essential for the development of [[B cells]] and [[red blood cells]],<ref name="pmid21423172">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siggs OM, Arnold CN, Huber C, Pirie E, Xia Y, Lin P, Nemazee D, Beutler B | title = The P4-type ATPase ATP11C is essential for B lymphopoiesis in adult bone marrow | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 434–40 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21423172 | pmc = 3079768 | doi = 10.1038/ni.2012 }}</ref><ref name="pmid21423173">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yabas M, Teh CE, Frankenreiter S, Lal D, Roots CM, Whittle B, Andrews DT, Zhang Y, Teoh NC, Sprent J, Tze LE, Kucharska EM, Kofler J, Farell GC, Bröer S, Goodnow CC, Enders A | title = ATP11C is critical for the internalization of phosphatidylserine and differentiation of B lymphocytes | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–9 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21423173 | pmc = 3272780 | doi = 10.1038/ni.2011 }}</ref> and for the prevention of intrahepatic [[cholestasis]].<ref name="pmid21518881">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siggs OM, Schnabl B, Webb B, Beutler B | title = X-linked cholestasis in mouse due to mutations of the P4-ATPase ATP11C | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 19 | pages = 7890–5 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21518881 | pmc = 3093471 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1104631108 }}</ref>
