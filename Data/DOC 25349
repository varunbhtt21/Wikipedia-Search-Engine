I despise getting into this sort of thing (and in fact, I believe this is the first time I've ever actually filed an ANI report that wasn't a ban request for a sockpuppeteer, but...), but the behavior of {{User|Skookum1}} has not moderated since the last ANI, in fact if anything, it's become worse. His previous assumptions of [[WP:OWN|entitlement]] on the basis of being an expert on subjects are continuing, and he is flat-out telling other editors to "[keep] your nose out of categories you know nothing about the subject matter thereof", and he continues to assume any opposition to him is an attack on him personally. However what spurred this report is that he and {{User|BrownHairedGirl}} have been...engaged in discussion...at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2014 April 17#Category:Rivers of the Boundary Ranges|this CfD]] (where the above behavior is ongoing), and my attempt to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=604820381&oldid=604817395 provide a caution and a suggestion for calming the waters] was met with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=604823100&oldid=604820381 this response]. This is wholly unacceptable behavior for any Wikipedian, and I would appreciate somebody to please make this clear, since it's obvious Skookum1 has decided that I am the enemy. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 03:17, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Reply''' "The Witchunt Part II" huh?  What is needed is not a ban to get me out of Wikipedia, but as noted/"hinted" by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_April_17&diff=604726336&oldid=604713597 RadioKAOS] what is really needed here is an interaction ban against BHG and now you for harassment and obstructionist behaviour.  The CfD was launched moments after I created the category and is without guidelines to back it, or anything but IDONTLIKEIT and is entirely AGF in tone; BHG demands evidence and examples, I provide them, she says they're " 95%...irrelevant" and presumes to tell me to "cool down" and calls my detailed explanations "diatribes".  "Walls of text" I'm avoiding by bulleting and paragraphing but failing that complaint, she engages in denial and obfuscation and more "bring me a shrubbery" gambits despite lots of shrubbery already being provided.  
***The CfD has consumed three (two? - seems like longer) days of what would otherwise be productive time for this ''contributing'' editor; as with the regional district hyphen-endash RMs and last year's native endonyms RM, which were similarly stonewalled by demands for irrelevant picayune information, what underlies the categories being challenged is both consensus and very findable citations; but you can put reality in front of someone, they will still go IWANTMORE as BHG is doing; failing that the tactic being mounted here is to get me banned.  Given that BHG has targeted whole hierarchies of categories she doesn't even understand where or what they are about is a case in point of people who don't have a clue what they're talking about not being useful in such discussions; and who have no business nominating them unless they'er ''clearly'' against guidelines; which these categories are not, as the 'oppose' votes have pointed out.
***Calling for a ban against me is draconian and destructive.  I wanted to stay away from procedural discussions after the painful round of insults and NPAs and pat-judgments that typified the "burn him, burn him!" "votes" in the last ANI, which was closed "no consensus for a ban or block", but in the wake of which (maybe within minutes, I haven't looked at the date/timestamps) I was blocked by BHG anyway, and then she went and conducted hostile closures on RMs where she ignored consensus, view stats, googles, guidelines and the prevailing and emergent consensus which closed/moves 90%+ of similar RMs.  
***And though I went at trying to work on articles and get away from the witchhunt mentality that prevails in this oh-so-negative "discussion board", I created some river articles arising from creating [[Tsetsaut]] and created a category for the many rivers in the region in question and was ''immediately'' faced by a CfD from an admin who had blocked me ''without consensus''. The CfD should be tossed out on those grounds alone, never mind that she has ''yet'' to provide a ''valid'' argument for deleting/merging the categories she's assailing, and has expanded her challenge to my work by going after whole hierarchies of categories which, in various phases and on various talkpages, ''do'' have consensus as necessary.
***This is a nuisance ANI, just like the CfD is a nuisance CfD, and though you claim you're not my enemy, your [[WP:DUCK]] action here says otherwise.  "A subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will not advise nor submit to arbitrary measures" (Junius) comes to mind.  Arbitrary and high-handed abuse from a certain cadre of admins is now far too common in Wikipedia, and is entirely destructive and anti-contributing-editor in tone/intent time and again; this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&diff=prev&oldid=604821136 deleted/censored comment] of the now-banned Kumioto is one of many of this kind.  
***Actions like yours here and your obstructive presence on a CfD you yourself say you don't care about the outcome of are what is disruptive and anti-Wikipedian....not somebody who stands up to pointless criticism and denials of evidence/example; making me the target instead of addressing the evidence provided is your hallmark; as is deluging discussions with personal-related criticism instead of actually useful, thoughtful comments on the ''issues'' and the ''topic''.  
***And yes, if someone knows nothing about geography of a certain region, or about the category system on such topics, then it is not their business to intrude and create ''more procedure'' just to stonewall and make specious demands which are then ignored or derided.......I'm having computer problems probably from the 100 degree plus heat here in [[Ko Samui]] (sleep mode happening repeatedly without being asked) so won't be able to respond to the inevitable dogpile of condemnations and hypocrisy like surfaced last time around.
*** the previous anti-consensus block by the person who launched the CfD calls into question her motives; her anti-AGF behaviour about citations and explanations provided is just sheer obstinacy and is disruptive and tendentious.  I was contemplating an ANI or RfA or RfC or some other measure to discipline her, but I dislike procedure, as most contributing editors do, and want to ''write articles'', not be hauled in front of kangaroo courts where attacking contributing editors is a past-time.  The CfD is a waste of time and groundless and purely personal in motivation, and amounts to wiki-stalking by someone who has already taken actions in defiance of a 'no consensus' closure that said not to; how ironic she would claim that long-standing region titles should need "consensus"....they have it; but like evidence that 95% of which I'm sure she didn't read, "consensus" is really not what she wants, other than to use the CfD to overturn it.  But ''why?''.  "Because it's Skookum1 who started that category so let's pretend there's something wrong with it"......and now, hell, let's just go after every category and title he's ever written huh?  
***Banning me would be a dangerous loss for Wikipedia, but you seem insistent on it ''for purely personal reasons'' and here as on the CfD and in previous discussions you indulge in [[WP:BAIT]]ing and what amounts to purely ''destructive'' behaviour.  I just want to write and improve articles, but my time is being taken up defending myself against baiting and groundless anti-AGF criticism and ''harassment''.  Maybe one day "ordinary" (contributing) Wikipedians will be free from the tyranny of the vocal minority who infest discussion boards, be it here or on RMs or CfDs or in guideline discussions; but as long as public crucifixions and stonings of people who do ''constructive'' work continue, that day is a long ways off yet.
***What is needed here, again, is not a ban to rid Wikipedia of me, but an interaction ban against those who have persistently harassed me and who refuse to read or acknowledge evidence and who have no logic or guideline citations to speak of; just IDONTLIKEIT and that's it.  I have a great deal yet to contribute to Wikipedia, but the last few months have seen procedural attacks that are totally counterproductive and timewasting......so rather than goading me so you can condemn me, why don't you just stay out of my way and not jump on every discussion you see me in??

**Thank you Carrite and Obiwan for your ''sanity''.  Days of article-writing time have been consumed by the demands made in the CfD, and this ANI is just more harassment of someone who is acknowledged as a highly productive and prolific editor who "knows his shit".  I submit again as I did above that an interaction ban is maybe needed; but less formal would be [[WP:DISENGAGE]] on BHG's and Bushranger's part; the RMs that were harmed by their biases against me should also all be revisited because of the prevailing and mounting consensus that would have seen them passed/moved.  The COI passage on closures says nothing directly about personal vendettas, but that's all that CfD really is, and what this ANI is.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 05:55, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

***"calming advice"??? you're either flattering yourself or just not clued in; you engaged me repeatedly before, always condemning and criticizing while claiming you are "giving advice", but your actions cluttered a CfD to the point where even when I produced citations from TITLE you accused me of continuing to BLUDGEON; the bludgeoning is yours, you painting yourself as innocent and even ''friendly'' is just..... there are a host of adjectives available...... given your track record with me saying you did not "engage" me by chiming in with a "support" and very AGF vote on a very AGF and ''pointless'' CfD puts the lie to the saintliness you are painting yourself as here.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 08:11, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

**I'd aver that a plain ol' RfC be held on BHG's launch of the CfD and her bad closes on sundry RMs, and her unilateral unsanctioned block of last week.  I'm trying to be be a productive editor but finding my time tied up, and my presence here threatened, every time I turn around.  The CfD, despite disclaimers that it's not anti-AGF, is very much so and in the context of recent events and words is highly COI in origin.  The "Squamish matter" and the against-consensus/precedents closures of [[Haida people]], [[Bella Bella, British Columbia]] and others need to be all redone because of the personal bias against me but the closer and their context within the recent ANI discussion/period.  As Obiwan and Carrite have observed, ''I just want to be let alone'' so I can focus on article writing instead of having horseshoes thrown at me by people who have really nothing constructive to offer; I tried to "stay out of the way", but found myself stalked and pounced on and a whole host of categories challenged by someone who's ''never even heard of them before''.  As I said in the last ANI, ''I'm'' not the problem here; bad attitudes are, and the prevailing negativity of kibbitzers who nitpick on titles and topics without even knowing what they're about.....[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 07:43, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
***Raking me over the coals in an RfC/U would just be ''more procedure'' and no doubt an even more hostile and prejudicial environment than ANI is.  And to what end?  To alienate yet another long-time contributing editor and either drive or ban him from Wikipedia forever?  The amount I could have gotten done in the last few weeks/months is obviously considerable; instead I have been regularly attacked and vilified and finally subjected to a public stoning and then a peremptory, unsanctioned-by-ANI ban by the person who now is asking ''non sequiturs'' and ignoring evidence provided as asked, and sticking her tongue in her cheek pretending innocence while castigating my information as irrelevant and wikilawyering ''in extremis''.  I was accused in the ANI of being a "time sink", but ''I'm'' not the time sink; procedure of the sake of the sport of it ''IS''.  How much of my last year or two has been taken up by time-consuming procedure of all kinds?  Way too much.  How many articles could I have improved and created in the meantime??  Subjecting me to an RfC/U to please those who have nothing better to do than criticize others is just gonna be more of the same....[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 07:55, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
** What is being requested here is that somebody give Skookum1 a plain-English warning that personal attacks like the one linked in the OP are simply not on, since it would be improper for me to do so both on account of being involved overall (and the target of said attack) and since it would be taken as just more proof of being persecuted. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 07:58, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

I've reviewed most of the Cfd -- well, actually I skimmed the last part because it just went on and on.... Skookum1's unwillingness to stay on topic and repeatedly personalize the discussion there is inappropriate. '''Comment on content, not contributors''' I find myself surprised this is coming from a 50K mainspace 9 year editor -- it's not a viable long term approach to collaborating on Wikipedia. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 10:30, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
: A quick visit to my talkpage this morning shows just how badly Skookum personalizes things.  The short version is this: Skookum made an edit to this page earlier - they must have got an edit-conflict, but clicked "save" anyway.  It erased someone else's post, so I reverted with an appropriate edit-summary.  Skookum then happily dropped by my talkpage to make accusations, and even when they restored their post, the edit-summary accused my of something nefarious.

=== Comment from BHG ===
On the narrow issue of this CFD, the situation is simply that after I had blocked Skookum1, I noticed that on his return he was posting complaints about me in various locations on my watchlist (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&diff=604548047&oldid=604538341]).  So I looked at his contributions to see where else this was going, and saw a newly-created  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Rivers_of_the_Boundary_Ranges&diff=prev&oldid=604573592 Category:Rivers of the Boundary Ranges] which didn't fit into any other category of rivers.  I looked for similar categorisation schemes, didn't see any, and nominated for discussion at CFD with the rationale: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=604604585&oldid=604567757 ''The categorisation of rivers by which mountain range they originate in doesn't appear to have any parallel in Category:Rivers, tho pls correct me if I have missed anything''].

There is nothing unusual about any of this.  Topics can be categorised in many different ways, and CFD regularly discusses whether new types of category schemes are appropriate. Skookum1's response was ballistic. Non-neutral notifications to no-less than 5 WikiProjects .([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Geography_of_Canada&diff=604615482&oldid=602544597], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Alaska&diff=prev&oldid=604616250], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Canadian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&diff=prev&oldid=604615697], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Rivers&diff=604610903&oldid=604610740], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Geography&diff=prev&oldid=604615839]) and to User:Obiwankenobi[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Obiwankenobi&diff=604635207&oldid=604527691].

As Obi pointed out, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Obiwankenobi&diff=604636756&oldid=604636004  this scheme could create thousands of more categories so before pursuing it further I'd get broader consensus at the geography page].

Unfortunately, the CFD page is filled with long rants from Skookum1. His  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=604823100&oldid=604820381 reply] to the Bushranger was merely one of many diatribes on that page alone.

Skookum1 is clearly a very enthusiastic editor, keen to expand coverage of the topics which interest him.  But he has great difficulty with collaboration, and with consensus-forming processes.  Instead of [[WP:BRD|Bold, revert, ''discuss'']], the Skookum1 version seems to be bold, revert, ''diatribe''.  In more discussions than I can count, editors who disagree with him have been denounced at length, often to the detriment of the discussion; countless editors have been accused by him of personal vendettas, and of failing to respect his expertise. I first encountered Skookum1 when I closed a [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_February_19#Squamish|CFD which had been open for over a month]].  Not hard to see why was unclosed: Skookum1's comments were far too long to read in any reasonable length of time.

I subsequently encountered a lot more of his battleground conduct while closing some of the RM backlog; [[Talk:Chipewyan people#Requested_move_2|one of those discussions]] was what prompted me to block him, because although the thread was a bit stale, the disruption was still ongoing elsewhere.  Skookum1 alleges that I have been making "hostile closures on RMs" and that I "ignored consensus".  If he genuinely believes that, then rather than repeating attacks on me in countless pages, why not just take the closures to [[WP:Move review|Move review]]?  If he's right, the closures will be overturned.

The personal attack which prompted this thread was in response to a warning from The Bushranger, who is merely one of a long series of editors to plead with Skookum1 to calm down. Others include:

A warning here seems justified, but I doubt it would change anything.  Skookum1 appears to have pre-emptively dismissed it as persecution, and to have categorised [[User:The Bushranger]] as one of his legion of persecutors.

It seems to me that the question is how can Skookum1 be helped to work collaboratively? Sometimes our contributions to Wikipedia are challenged, and discussing those disagreements civilly and concisely (see [[WP:TPYES]]) is fundamental to editing Wikipedia works.  Sometimes the result is decisions we like, and sometimes we disagree with the result, but that's how it works here.

Skookum1 hasn't cracked how to work within that framework.  Would a mentor help? --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 18:16, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:: I don't think using a lot of words on a talk page is a problem. It's an annoyance for some, and it no doubt reduces the effectiveness of arguments of principles being made, but some people use more words than others. It's a minor party foul if it is a party foul at all. I also appreciate that there is a lot of venom and antivenin being spilled all over the place. Everyone involved needs to just let it go, forgive, forget, and move along. l've strongly advised Skookum not to answer here and I hope he doesn't. I similarly hope that this thread is shut down expeditiously — it has done nothing but fan the embers. Skookum is a productive content contributor; just let him go without whacking him in the head every five minutes. Differences in deletion discussions happen and sometimes they get needlessly heated. Everybody needs to breath deeply, to step back, to do something else for a while. Wikipedia is a big place and there is plenty to be done without launching into rounds 6, 7, and 8 of a fight that inevitably ends up with a productive contributor's head on a pike.

::: The problem, Carrite, is that while everyone else forgave, forgot, and moved along, Skookum1 did not, and that is the reason this thread was opened. Being a "productive content contributor" does not excuse unprovoked and vehement personal attacks, it does not permit tossing around accusation of bad faith, and it does not allow someone to tell people to [[WP:OWN|"get their nose out" of areas that person edits in]]. We can address the fact that Skookum1 has done all of these things (repeatedly, over and over) now, and hopefully retain him as a contributor, or we can close this and just come back to it in a week, month, or year, with another even stronger outburst of drama and the likely loss of the contributor. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 04:30, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

Once again we are hear and once again I notice borderline and outright personal attacks in difs and in the ANI comments. This obviously needs to stop, and the only way to do so is to force the individual to step away. Being cautioned has done nothing, and closing the previous thread before enough people weighed in for the week block last time prevented any action forth coming.

::{{ping|Doc9871}} Whether or not a block is the solution, there is a problem. Skooum1's conduct repeatedly disrupts consensus-forming discussions.
::Skookum1's response to a discussion where he doesn't like the proposal, or where the debate isn't going his way, is to flood it with rants about all the rest of the ways in which he perceives himself to have been wronged, about the alleged ulterior motives of anyone who disagrees with him, about their intruding into topic areas which he feels are his preserve, etc. In the CFD which started this ANI discussion, Skookum1 has already posted 39,333 characters (2/3 of the thread), most of it unrelated to the CFD. His on-topic points are mixed in with the diatribes, so anyone trying to follow the substantive discussion can't easily skip over the outpourings of his frustration.
::This sort of disruption has been seen in countless other discussions. See for example [[Talk:Chipewyan_people#Requested_move_2|this RM]], and [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_February_19#Squamish|this CFD]], where the substantive discussion was drowned out in extraordinarily verbose outpourings of rage. All of this runs counter to [[WP:TPG]], and impedes consensus-formation.
::Skookum1 has repeatedly been pointed to appropriate ways of addressing his grievances. Don't like a CFD closure? Take it to DRV. Don't like an RM closure? Take it to [[WP:MR]]. But instead of using the established channels to review these issues, he rants about them in other discussions, so nothing ever gets resolved.

:::why should I ''not'' raise the issue of your motives in those closes, or in starting the CfD, which you still have not provided any ''tangible'' rationale per guidelines or conventions; that I supplied examples and direct citation evidence only to have you pronounce all of that as "irrelevant" and then make further demands, is obstructionism pure and simple.  
::::*You stylize my posts as "diatribe(s)" and worse plus other similar/usual NPAs and AGFs you have fielded at me both in the CfD and in the RMs and stonewalled, claiming evidence was still needed - when lots was provided.  You ignore the points made by the "oppose" votes, you mumble about consensus and evidence despite the evidence already being there; and re the regions categories you have hinted should also be deleted, you have ignored consensus that lay behind their development and yet now you want a consensus on geography categories and a centralized discussion. To what end?  The guidelines and policies already exist, you just refuse to acknowledge them.  In that context, why should I ''not'' point out the AGF content of the CfD's launch, and your COI with me, personally. 
::::*You have expanded the CfD to several categories and counting, yet when I fielded bulk RMs "procedural" objections were raised....and most of those RMs done individually, other than yours and DavidLeighEllis' were closed contrary to mounting consensus and ''also'', as in the CfD, by ignoring votes and also view stats; 
::::*you made false claims that SOURCES says that only GoogleBooks and GoogleScholar should be used for googles; in fact it says no such thing.  TITLE/AT was invoked on the RMs that went in "my" favour (i.e. according to the integrity of the title per ''policy'' and also per actual sources) and waved at COMMONNAME as if it somehow bypassed PRECISION and CONCISENESS.
::::*your resistance to actually debate the evidence provided but instead lecture me on particulars that ''you'' demand (they were already provided, I'm convinced you didn't actually read what I posted, as you have before elsewhere) is proof of your AGF in this matter, as is the targeting of a category I created minutes after I created it in the wake of your unilateral and peremptory block, during which you "went after" some of the remaining RMs and gave them "negative closures"....... this is politics, and "in politics, optics is everything.  You claiming neutrality and "UNINVOLVED" is laughable.
::::*Pompously suggesting I need a mentor is patronizing in the extreme; yet when I suggested you need remedial reading so you have the ability to read longer passages of text, you pronounced it a personal attack.....
::::*Move Review is not about issues, it is all about wikiquette; pointless for me to go there, the negative accusations/judgments fielded by you and others here will only resurface there ''while the issues and guidelines go undebated''; an RfC as noted by CBW elsewhere is only about single guidelines as they apply to single articles; so that's not the place to go either as in all cases various policies and guidelines, not just one, apply; RfM maybe, but to me the RfC/U being mumbled about here is just more victimization while the issues remain undebated.
::::*in the case of the CfD you wave at a convention about political geographic units that, as noted by an "oppose" vote (and also in my points about the different systems of political geography/regionalization within BC), are ORIGINALRESEARCH on the one hand and RECENTISM on the other.  There is no policy or guideline supporting your nomination and its expansion; there is only IDONTLIKE IT and your very evident "get Skookum1" attitude and tone of "debate".
::::*your failure to address evidence and your ignorance of the complete texts of the guidelines you presume to cite, and then rant about my supposed lack of coherence, is just "more of the same" and recognizable in style as similar to the stonewalling and POV forking going on at [[NCL]] and [[NCET]]; denial, misrepresentation, condescension, pontification, pretending something someone says doesn't make sense or is relevant, and ongoing demeaning comments about my writing (and my personality) you refuse to (or are unable) to read or ''logically process''.
::::*I agree with those who say I should stay away from this bearpit and proceed with my work, which I have been doing; but to see the ongoing condemnation and what seems like provocation requires me to clarify the ''full context'' of this situation, and point out why your frustrating behaviour ''does'' call into question your motives and your very evident AGF towards me.  I have contemplated an RfA on ''you'', or an RfC/U, because of your behaviour overall, and your refusal to acknowledge policy or evidence while you continue to drum up hostility towards me.  But I dislike process, ''obviously'', and just wanted to be left alone to work on articles; ''then'' you came at me with a CfD without any substance behind it whatsoever.
::::*No doubt you will pronounce this as a rant to avoid having to answer to your behaviour and your violations of titling policy and more.  Ranting about me, and provoking me with ''non sequitur'' questions and your refusal to acknowledge relevant citations and examples as relevant, point to you being unfit to even ''comment'' about "proper discussion" and also the shallow context of your CfD, which as I have said there is ''vexatious'' and ''disruptive''.  As with Bushranger, I'm not the problem here....I'm a contributing editor finding myself interfered with by people who, to me, have been harassing and demonizing me.  When that gets pronounced a "persecution complex", it's just more AGF and NPA and amateur psychiatry masquerading as "proper behaviour". 
::::*for knowing the material ''and'' the sources, and for being the one who built the mountain and geography categories, I have been wrongly accused of OWN.  What I see instead is people who try to OWN Wikipedia, even referring to their opinions with the royal "we", and generally behaving so as to not encourage contributing editors or give them credit where credit is due, but to control them and, if they don't submit to hectoring and lecturing and AGF comments, propose to get rid of them.  All because you have a problem with not being willing or able to understand more text than your impatience or inability can tolerate.  And you make a personal issue of it, and have closed CfDs and RMs on the basis of those prejudices towards me.  That is "not according to the spirit of the guidelines, and violates the every wikiquette you wrap yourself in while violating it with nearly every post you make in response to me.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 15:43, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::*Skookum1, you have a long set of complaints about a number of editors, of whom I am one. You make serious allegations against many of them, alleging all sorts of misconduct. The curious thing is that in most cases, it seems to be only you who complains of persecution by them. As I noted above, several uninvolved editors have suggested that you step back and consider why it is that you alone find all these alleged miscreants on your case, and consider what ''you'' can do differently to change the situation. So far, I don't see any sign of you doing that.<br />You have a few choices in how you can deal with this.<br />One option is to continue to post about all your grievances in every forum available to you: ANI, user talk pages, Jimbo's talk, XFDs, RMs, your own talk.  That takes up a lot of your time, and maybe it is satisfying to you to air your grievances, but it doesn't change anything. So you remain frustrated, and you also frustrate other editors who want to discuss only the matter in hand.  When they complain, you then add them to the list of editors out to get you.<br />Another option is for you to use established processes to review decisions which you don't like.  [[WP:MR]] exists to review whether move requests were closed correctly, and [[WP:DELREV]] has the same role for CFD.  If you list closures at those reviews, you can explain exactly why you consider the closes to be flawed, and you concerns will be assessed by uninvolved editors. Those reviews are ''not'' (as you wrongly claim) about wikiquette; they are about whether the discussion was closed correctly. However, you have apparently written off the review process without even trying it.<br />You could open an [[WP:RFC/U|RFC/U]] about any editor (including an admin) whose conduct you find problematic. There you will plenty of other editors ready to review your concerns. But instead you denounce process and say that you "just wanted to be left alone to work on articles".<br />Wikipedia is a collaborative environment.  Editors discuss content and processes, review and critique each others contributions, and use established processes to resolve issues where they can't agree. Why do you expect to contribute to a collaborative environment and be "left alone"?  Solitary writing is a fine thing, but it's not how wp works.<br />[[WP:BATTLEGROUND|Wikipedia is not a battleground]]. To avoid it turning into a battleground, there are a wide range of [[WP:Dispute resolution|dispute resolution processes]]. You choose to neither use those processes, nor to let go and move on from the things which you feel have been unfair.  Instead you bring every conflict with you wherever you go, such as denouncing RM closes in a CFD discussion.

Unless an editor has a topic ban, there is nothing preventing any editor from working on any article or project, whether they are an expert or newbie. We don't get to choose who edits which articles, who comments on an AfD or CfD discussion, who votes on an RfA.

=== Solution ===
This is about Wikipedia ''Categories''?? Not [[WP:BLP]] nor POV nor RS nor article content? Between this and the [[Amanda_Filipacchi#Wikipedia_op-ed]] categorization fiasco, I wonder whether they're worth the aggravation. (I'm reminded of an [[Emo Phillips]] comedy routine about schisms: [http://www.christenacleveland.com/2012/10/die-heretic-the-absurdity-of-divisions-in-the-church/ text here], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2y_kI_-x1Q 1:17 youtube video].)

Obviously Skookum1 cannot continue the not concise personalized comments long term. See [[WP:First Law]]. Given that they're a 9 year, 50K / 60% mainspace editor [https://tools.wmflabs.org/supercount/index.php?user=Skookum1&project=en.wikipedia], "solutions" (such as blocks) that are as likely as not to lead to their departure from the project are not actual solutions.

On the other, BHG stalking his edits post-block isn't ideal. While technically not against ''the rulz'' -- [[WP:INVOLVED]] is wikilawyerishly admin action ''after'' editorial engagement -- it violates the spirit of strict separation between an individual's admin and editorial roles. Call it [[WP:DEVLOVNI]] -- backwards involved. It's important to the gestalt of pedia that authority been seen as impersonal.

So how about a two parter:
* BHG will ignore Skookum1's category activities. (Given {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} admins and {{NUMBEROFACTIVEUSERS}} users, surely it can fall upon someone else to Cfd categories if they're not quite right?)
* Skookum1 agrees to keep their Wikipedia: space posts less than 2000 characters and stop the personalization of disputes. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 16:53, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{ping|NE Ent}} I appreciate the problem-solving spirit of your suggestion, but I'm not so sure it works.
:First, the constraint on Skookum1 doesn't achieve much, because even one post of 2000 characters is grossly excessive in most discussions, and Skookum1 could easily evade even that generous limit by simply making multiple posts, as he often does. I'm not sure how to define a limit, because sometimes posting relevant evidence requires length.  This is where I think that a mentor could help him to craft more concise and focused replies.
:Your suggestion that he stop the personalization of disputes is a valuable one, and would certainly help. However, he also needs to be constrained to discussing the narrow issue in hand, rather than using each discussion to air his wider grievances.
:As to me, I certainly wasn't "stalking" Skookum1; I was looking at his contribs to see the extent of his complaints about me.  Since he chosen not to use any of the formal dispute-resolution or review processes (or to ping me when mentioning me), it is the only way to find out where I am the subject of complaint.
:Along the way I spotted an odd-looking category, so I examined it. I can see why it is possible to read that CFD nomination as some sort of personal thing, but I just ask editors to look at the grounds for the nomination.  This category of rivers was not parented in any other category of rivers, and did not appear to fit into any wider categorisation scheme; the geohpysical regional basis of it is at best diffusely documented.
:I would be happy in principle to make a clearer separation between my admin role and my long-standing interest in categories, and thereby ignore Skookum1's category edits in future.  If my good faith attempt to open a discussion about a category is seen as blurring lines, then it evidently had an unintended bad effect. I don't share NE Ent's optimism about categories being generally well-scrutinised, but am happy to leave that aside.
:My reservation about this is not for me, but that I think it sets an unfortunate precedent. So far as I can see, any editor who has challenged Skookum1's edits or proposals gets accused at length of bad faith.  In a long series of RMs, editors who expressed views different to Skookum1's were denounced ferociously; where his opponents agreed with each other, they were labelled as cabals.
:I fear that this is setting off on a path where Skookum1 seeks restraints on other editors rather than learning to work collaboratively and follow [[WP:TPG]]. That's just pushing the problem down the road, and impeding the normal scrutiny which editors apply to each others work. Skkoum1's repeated demand to "leave me alone" just isn't viable in a collaborative environment. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 18:17, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*{{ping|NE Ent}}  I'm not going to bother commenting more here today, it's the usual one sided rants and (as with Neotarf below) cherrypicked examples, all with AGF as their theme, but I would like to point out I just ran a word count on BHG's post immediately above - '''''450 words=2,623 characters'''''  - while her very editorialized and misrepresentative "hostile close" at [[Talk:Chipewyan people#Requested move 2]] is '''''537 words=3,249 characters''''' - longer than some CfD/RM posts she pronounced TLDR as an excuse not to read them (when it was pointed out she shouldn't be using TLDR on discussion boards, she went and dug out a "behavioural guideline").  And what is going on at the CFD is not "normal scrutiny", it is groundless and ''not normal'', but as noted COI/AGF in origin and targeted; disavowals of that are made, but the refusal to acknowledge evidence provided (or in the inability to read/digest it)  is what it is.  The claim by Neotarf below that my problem is with "every person" [I interact with] is just more typical conflation and misrepresentation and attack-mode "IDONTLIKESKOOKUM1", and the rants here and in other threads about numbers of characters per post overloading wikipedia's servers are ironic; it's fruitless and venal and often ''mean'' discussions here and elsewhere that are taking up ''far more space''.....and I know from the BCGNIS template dispute long ago that Jimbo and the MWF told the code-writers to write as if t hey had unlimited space.....so what's the big deal about actual ''text'', or is code more important than ''words'' and ''meanings''.

''This'' user has contributed huge amounts to titles/articles and also to discussions of all kinds, including weather NPA/AGF accusations on various titles and topics; your pretense that I have "stayed under the radar" i.e. escaped official harrassment is equally specious and also confrontational and is "incitement" of yet more.  I'd rather work on ''real'' material than have to defend myself against campaigns to get rid of me; I'm not alone in that sentiment, as a glance at various other witchhunts and rants about "walls of text" (while committing same) elsewhere on this board and in its archives.  Why don't you go write some articles (since you can't go the beach) and drop the axe-grinding and pitchfork-wielding as you are doing here?  I'm not the one being disruptive, but my work is being disrupted and obstructed ("tendentious editing") on a regular basis, including here.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 03:18, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:::{{ping|NE Ent}} As Uyvsdi points out, I raised this - not because of verbosity (indeed, in the current CfD there was marked improvement from the concerns that had arisen for me in the previous one that's relevant), but because of the personal attacks, particularly the blistering ones unleashed when a caution that a trip down NPA Road was being taken was delivered. Regardless of categories, the personal attacks, inability to accept dissenting viewpoints, and assumptions of bad faith to the point of reading attacks that aren't even there into statements (i.e. the repeated vehement insistience that I raised this ANI to get him banned) are the problem here. 150K of discussion on a single topic ''can'' be productive - but it has to be made in a productive fashion, and ''that'' is where the problem is here. Neither of us want to lose a productive contributor: quite the opposite. But a productive contributor must be willing to contribute collegially, or at the very least to be willing to accept dissenting viewpoints and remain calm and even enjoyable to discuss content with, even when opposite sides of the issue, as long as [[WP:BEAR|the bear doesn't get poked]]; Skookum1 has shown little sign of being willing to do so, no bear-poking required. All that's needed here is for a simple, good-faith statement that an attempt will be made to keep discussions, regardless of length, on the content and not the contributor ''or the contributor's motive'' in the discussion, and the drama will be over. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 20:29, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

=== Another personal attack from Skookum1 ===
Please look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=605114705&oldid=605112926 this edit] by Skooukm1, at 0700 UTC today. It's his most recent contribution to the discussion, and it is a mixture of personal attack and misrepresentation, which distorts any debate.  Responding to this sort of thing is time-consuming and verbose.

It was made in response to my original nomination, which said in full: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=604604585&oldid=604567757 ''The categorisation of rivers by which mountain range they originate in doesn't appear to have any parallel in Category:Rivers, tho pls correct me if I have missed anything. All the 6 pages currently in the category are already in other categories of river-by-political-geography'']. That nominator's rationale has not been amended or added to.

Skookum's reply is: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=605114705&oldid=605112926#Category:Rivers_of_the_Boundary_Ranges That's an outright falsehood/distortion but all too typical of your lack of knowledge of this region; only the Whiting, Unuk, Craig and Lava Fork (4 articles) have ''Alaskan'' political geographic divisions on them, none have ''Canadian'' political geographic units on them; the Keta is in Alaska but was newly-created and has not yet had Alaskan p.g. units added; your argument is even more irrelevant as there are no British Columbian equivalents for same (the Alaskan boroughs are regional municipalities; there ''are no municipalities'' in this region of BC, other than tiny Stewart at the southern end.]

The 6 pages then in the category were [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=604604585&oldid=604567757 Craig River], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iskut_River&oldid=604574076 Iskut River], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keta_River&oldid=604574170 Keta River], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lava_Fork&oldid=604574418 Lava Fork], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unuk_River&oldid=604573938 Ununk River], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Whiting_River&oldid=604574204 Whiting River]. (In each case I have linked to the version at the time of nomination).

Unpicking Skookum1's comment:
# ''"an outright falsehood/distortion"''<br />Very harsh words, but possibly justifiable if true. However, they are demonstrably false.
# ''"all too typical of your lack of knowledge of this region"''<br />A [[WP:NPA|personal attack]], particularly when I had explicitly asked for clarification of anything I had missed.
# ''"only the Whiting, Unuk, Craig and Lava Fork (4 articles) have ''Alaskan'' political geographic divisions on them, none have ''Canadian'' political geographic units on them"''.<br />This is demonstrably untrue: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_17&diff=604604585&oldid=604567757 Craig River], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iskut_River&oldid=604574076 Iskut River], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unuk_River&oldid=604573938 Ununk River], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Whiting_River&oldid=604574204 Whiting River] were all in {{cl|Rivers of British Columbia}}. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lava_Fork&oldid=604574418 Lava Fork] was in {{cl|Creeks of British Columbia}}. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keta_River&oldid=604574170 Keta River] was in {{cl|Rivers of Alaska}}. I had referred to "river-by-political-geography". BC is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province of Canada]]; it is a Canadian political geographic unit, so all 5 rivers in BC did have Canadian political geographic units.
# ''"your argument is even more irrelevant as there are no British Columbian equivalents for same (the Alaskan boroughs are regional municipalities"''.<br />I made no reference to boroughs or municipalities. How can an argument be made irrelevant on the basis of points neither asserted nor alluded to?

Now we have at the top of the CFD debate, a personal attack based on a false representation of the nominator's rationale, and an assumption of bad faith.  How much more of this is to be tolerated? --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 10:54, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:::From what I read above, skookum was doing new, independent work, and it is the followers sparking contention, i.e. being "attackers" in a general usage sense (probably not in the wikipedia jargon of "personal attack";  in wikipedia we too much allow deeply incivil attacking to go on and then castigate those who react to provocation, saying they are using personal attacks).

::::That is a definition of "attack" which doesn't fit with any policy I know of.  It also misrepresents the nature of the CFD, which was explicitly framed as a question about whether an apparently new form of categorisation was appropriate.

:::::To [[User:BrownHairedGirl|BHG]], I don't know about "most" CFDs, but I do know that many AFDs and probably CFDs are in fact attacking in nature.  It depends upon apparent motive and perceptions between editors.  If there was indeed some past history of conflict, it seems reasonable that Skookum could perceive this CFD to be an attack.  It was not a neutral discussion, it was a proposal to delete categories Skookum was setting up.  It rambled on with more accusations (of "disrupting" Wikipedia somehow by Skookum separately creating more categories, of Skookum supposedly violating wp:Canvas, and more) that seems like badgering.  It was as if Skookum could not dare set up some reasonable-sounding categories without advance permission from one editor.  If one editor wants to question an initiative that an experienced editor is proceeding with, do it mildly, literally ask a question at a Talk page or something, and consider whether it couldn't be raised in an RFC eventually, months or years later.  It seems confrontational and unnecessary to immediately open a proposal to delete work in progress, and yes that is a kind of attack.  And even without me knowing about past history, all the other charges in the CFD plus the opening of this ANI seem to confirm that it was personal, in truth, or at least that it was very reasonable for Skookum to perceive it to be personal.  

:::::Speaking not especially about this incident, but about others, Wikipedia would be a lot better if we had a proper process to stop followers who have become perceived by a target to be bullying, from continuing to follow and poke.  I do not understand how some editors who know they are being perceived as hurtful and bullying, nonetheless choose to continue with the following and bullying-appearing activities.  Avoid the perception of bullying.  If you know you are hurting someone, be humane and stop.  Let it go, let someone not perceived to be a bully in the situation raise a question some other way later, if indeed anything ever needs to be discussed. Again, I really do not know the parties and the history in this case, so I am not speaking about parties in this case so much.  But, it is obvious to me that contending against quite reasonable-seeming categories with only lame "reasons" or with attacks on other fronts like claims of personal attacks or whatever, is really really not helpful for building wikipedia or for making Wikipedia a nice place. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 05:10, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::{{ping|Doncram}} I have always understood [[WP:BRD]] to be quite fundamental to how Wikipedia works. Any edit is open to challenge, and it is then discussed.  That's a crucial part of the whole collaborative process by which content is scrutinised
::::::There are broadly two ways of discussing an issue.  The first is one-to-one discussion; the second is at a centralised location, such as XFD, which exists for discussing various types of content.
::::::There are multiple advantages to having those discussions in a centralised venue. It gets wider input to the discussion, and it ensures that the discussion is archived in a place where it will be easy to find in future.
::::::With categories, there are great advantages to having those discussions sooner rather than later.  If the categorisation scheme stays, those building it know that they are on the right track. If the consensus is that it's not a good idea, then everyone avoids a lot of wasted work.
::::::Categories are different to articles.  Articles largely stand or fall on their own merits, but categories are often part of a much wider system. Geographical categories work as intersections between consistent sets, where we have a broadly consistent set of topics intersecting with a broadly consistent geographical framework ({{cl|Roads in New York}} and {{cl|History of New York}} parallels {{cl|Roads in Yorkshire}} and {{cl|History of Yorkshire}}). Introducing a new geographical framework creates a set of categories which don't fit in that structure. Far from being "lame" (as you put it), it seems to me to be much better to have a centralised discussion at an early stage about the viability of the proposed new geographical framework. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 14:18, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
 
:::::::Thanks, [[User:BrownHairedGirl|BHG]] for responding.  But you didn't start a centralised, neutral discussion in a leisurely RFC or conversationally at a WikiProject talk page.  You started a CFD which called for relatively immediate deletion of the categories that Skookum had set up, which is simply not friendly or neutral.  You called for stopping Skookum from continuing (you labelled other Skookum edits creating categories to be "disruptive", while I really do not see how they could be viewed as disruptive), and seemed to be seeking to criminalize Skookum's actions on various not-central-to-the-content/category "issue" that could be discussed.  And you were forcing immediate discussion, when it was not convenient for Skookum.  Perhaps some discussion, saying you think the larger implications oughta be considered sometime, could have led to productive discussion.  And the target could be asked and have opportunity to explain his intentions, whether they were limited to covering just the rivers of British Columbia for example, and then would he agree that the time would be ripe to call for a larger discussion, rather than interrupting and freezing the productive edits immediately, as if there was some huge crisis (not the case, no downside present for Wikipedia readers).  And, it was you in particular who was pushing, and while I am not familiar with the background, I gathered that you and Skookum had previous confrontations.  IMHO the wikipedia policy should be that an administrator/editor who previously played a policing/attacking/monitoring role that came to be perceived as harassing should be discouraged/disqualified from doing that again...there could be a random assignment of another administrator or just leave it to chance for anyone else to pick up a new issue, but whoever was involved previously and is perceived as being bullying should not be the one.  Some one else oughta be appointed, if there is actual real damage to readers going on. (Again please forgive me that I am not completely clear on whether a characterization of past interaction like that applies here with you and Skookum.)  One reason for such a rule is that a previously involved policeperson has an obvious apparent-to-the-target conflict of interest or bias, that the previous enforcer-type may be more likely to want to prove the target is a criminal, to justify their past action.  And whatever a perceived bully says is quite reasonably taken differently by the target than the same words from a perceived-to-be uninvolved other editor.  This is not to suggest that any violator of Wikipedia policies should be allowed to disqualify whoever they want, merely by falsely claiming bullying.  There need to be some standards.  However I perceived the discussion above and at the CFD to indicate that there was evidence suggestive of appearance of bullying.  (Standards of evidence oughta be defined somewhere...I have some ideas). 

:::::::Also, and this is a huge point that I have thought a lot about, you reference [[wp:BRD]] guideline.  From past experience, i STRONGLY believe that BRD guideline ought to be clarified to express whose edit is the Bold vs. whose is the Revert, when one editor is creating a bunch of stuff, believing it to benign, and another editor follows.  I strongly believe it works best if the creating editor is understood by default to be creating, not boldly doing anything.  And a following editor is doing the Bold step, if they interrupt and delete.  So the creating editor is given some deference, and may Revert, and go on (and it should all be discussed at a suitable Talk page of course, to exchange views and so on).  It should NOT be understood that any following editor gets the right to call their edit deleting to be the Revert and claim power to call any reversion by the creating editor to be edit warring, past BRD.  It simply is horrible policy, to empower anyone/everyone to interrupt and have precedence over a productive creating editor, who really probably does have a good rationale of what they are doing.  Later, eventually, in an established article, the BRD process would work normally.  BRD is written about bringing change productively to established articles, it is not written properly to apply to new works.  Wikipedia is not well served by overly empowering following critics;  Wikipedia is well served by empowering creators with some respect, some deference, some "ownership" in a good way, for a time (definitely not forever, but the creator should be given some space and some power for some amount of time). 

:::::::So, BHG, i don't know where you were going with mention of BRD, whether you wanted to claim Skookum was in violation of that, but my sentiment would be that a) Skookum was creating editor and has right to call a following edit to be a Bold, unexpected change that Skookum can fairly Revert, and then, yes, b) Skookum should indeed participate in discussion eventually, but there should be no rush and the discussion should be in a neutral venue and not with ultimatums of imminent deletion and other negativity. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 23:31, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::::Please read [[WP:NPA]]. I did not attack.

:::::To [[User:The Bushranger|Bushranger]], you may well have not meant an attack, but by Skookum's reaction that editor did seem to perceive it that way, and it was adding on to other I-am-guessing-to-be-reasonable belief by Skookum that there was unjustified attacking type stuff going on.  So, back off, say it is not important to you, let the editor proceed.  My humble opinion.  We don't have enough consideration for avoiding the appearance of bullying, and we don't generally have enough appreciation for a target's opinion.  Frankly, if someone says they are being bullied and it is not incredibly absurd to think they really mean that, and they are not doing it for some crazy commercial selfish advantage (not the case here), then don't dispute that, let the target say that.  It should not be a crime (a personal attack) for someone to say the truth that they feel they are being treated unfairly, that others are seeming to bully.

===A suggestion===
{{collapse top|Brrrrr, it's snowing here. Forget I said anything... —Carrite}}
Perhaps the solution would be mutual interaction bans between Bushranger and Skookum on the one hand; and Brown Haired Girl and Skookum on the other. Skookum needs to be more nice and these two need to leave him alone so that he can work without feeling stalked. [[User:Carrite|Carrite]] ([[User talk:Carrite|talk]]) 16:30, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - It's quite clear that Bushranger and BHG aren't the problem, and Skookum is, so unless you plan on instituting an IBAN on every editor Skookum gets into conflict with in the future, this is not the solution.  The solution is for Skookum to alter his uncollegial and uncollaborative behavior, and fast, before a block or ban comes his way. [[User:Beyond My Ken|BMK]] ([[User talk:Beyond My Ken|talk]]) 16:49, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''- Obviously the actions of Skookum are the problem here, not the reactions to the actions. If those editors who really want this to end without some kind of sanction of Skookum, they should try to make sure he stops this kind of behavior before uninvolved watchers of this unnecessary drama start weighing in. [[User:DD2K|Dave Dial]] ([[User talk:DD2K|talk]]) 16:55, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' I sympathize with Brown Haired Girl et al and am in fact monitoring this board because of another editor whose tactics are remarkably similar to Skookum's (so much so that he dropped a message of encouragement on that other editor's talk page). Such editors can have a toxic effect that counteracts whatever other good they do. I don't care if they have 100 or 100,000 edits. [[User:Coretheapple|Coretheapple]] ([[User talk:Coretheapple|talk]]) 20:10, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose as proposed subject'''. I respect Carrite as an editor but I'm dissapointed in him for implying that I'm "following" or "stalking" him. ''No such thing has taken place''. I saw a CfD, I !voted in the CfD, and then (seeing the quality of discourse in the rest of the discussion) I posted a caution that '[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|You don't want to do that, Dave]]'. And got absolutely blistered with personal attacks in return. (Diffs in OP.) As I said above, an interaction ban is not what is needed here: Skookum1 agreeing to be [[WP:CIVIL]] ''is''. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 20:40, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose as proposed subject'''.

Plenty of others have been the subject of his personal attacks, but those seem to be the ones who he is most vociferously denouncing at the moment.  AFAICS, none of these 4 editors has accumulated other "enemies" in the same way.  Which is more likely: that these each of these 4 editors have jointly or separately decided to persecute Skookum1? Or that one editor (Skookum1) has a persistent problem interacting with editors who disagree with him? --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 21:39, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.  Are you kidding?  Don't stop the bad behaviour, but topic-ban people who have attempted to address it?  I started to say that Brown Haired Girl's been entirely reasonable in her dealings with Skookum (I haven't been following Bushranger), but I take that back:  She's been unreasonably tolerant of him.  The only reason I haven't complained about his atrocious behaviour is that it's so ludicrous I can no longer take it seriously. — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 21:51, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' this is not the answer. The editor at fault should be banned but unfortunately the more edits you have here, the lesser the chance of you being held accountable for your appalling behaviour. In my mind this drives away more good editors than any other issue facing the project '''<font color="blue">[[User:Flat Out|Flat Out]]</font>'''&nbsp;'''''<span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;color:red">[[User talk:Flat Out|let's discuss it]]</span>''''' 23:18, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' as a dangerous and counterproductive solution designed to close this particular ANI thread but which fails to address the larger problem.  Skookum has a ''long'' history of interacting very poorly with anyone who disagrees with him.  Throwing up interaction bans against two editors acting in good faith because Skookum threw a hissyfit will only result in his throwing similar invective at anyone who challenges him in the expectation that similar interaction bans would be entered.

===Request===
:As the admin who blocked Skookum1, I would like to request ANI's assistance in reducing tensions here.
:Skookum1 feels, rightly or wrongly, that the ANI episode and criticism elsewhere was a form of ganging up on them.  This has clearly been driving their behavior.
:I believe that everyone is now aware that a wide contingent of editors feel that there's a significant problem here.  The above threads show a consensus on that point, but not unanimous by any means.  I would like to note for the record that the message is understood and received by uninvolved admin (hopefully, admins).
:I also believe that Skookum1 is widely felt, including by some of the commenters in the emerging consensus, to be a valuable content creator and editor.
:I would like to request that we attempt to simply de-escalate from here.  No good outcome is served by further poking.  I would like to archive the sections above later this evening.
:Skookum1 clearly felt that the threads above were contributing to the ganging up, and said so above and on their talk page and on the CFD.  Ideally they can just walk away from the discussions and leave it be.
:I would also like to see if anyone with experience mentoring would be willing to engage with Skookum1 and see if they can assist in cooperative tension reductions.
:If there is significant objection to archiving I won't do so, but hope everyone will take a deep breath and let that be the outcome.

What would help to reduce tensions is if Skookum would stop with the personal attacks and walls of text. He has now been blocked for 4 days, and then for 12 hours ("de"-escalating blocks??), but even now is busy filling his talk page with--you guessed it--personal attacks and walls of text. On his talk page he refers to this as "in flow", or "managing multiple thoughts", or "in stream of consciousness mode".
What to do. A mentor might help, if the user could find someone he trusts, but he would have to be the one to initiate this. He could also take a voluntary break--this can be a stressful time of year with the Songkran holidays, and with many expats in the region moving to cooler or drier climates.  A couple of weeks exploring the qualities of Singha or Tiger with a closed browser might do wonders, and allow him to eventually return to tranquil editing.  Again, he would have to be the one to agree to this. Might dispute resolution help, after a cooling off period? 
If nothing is done, or if the problem is merely postponed, the user will be lost to the project, and may even take some good editors down with him. —[[User:Neotarf|Neotarf]] ([[User talk:Neotarf|talk]]) 06:53, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::Well, British Columbia geography is rarely an area of high conflict.  Skookum is a better editor when he's left to edit on his own.  His past conflicts (usually over politics) have often been short bursts without quite this level of ranting, and he's often taken a break before going too far. In this case, Skookum took the CFD extremely personally and that magnified what usually just simmers under the surface.  And the dumb thing is, he needn't have reacted the way he did.

* I'm sorry, but I'm all in favour of de-escalation, but this bullshit idea that the above thread is somehow "bullying" or "ganging up on" has to be nipped in the bud.  The '''intent''' of ANI is to provide a [[forum]] (from Latin meaning "gathering place".  In complex cases, multiple involved and uninvolved users discuss the situation to come up with a method of resolution.  Hundreds of editors have this page watched, and ALL are permitted to comment based on their findings.  As is often the case of extremely problematic users, the quantity of discussion is huge.  As is often the case when the editor complained about plays [[WP:IDHT]], the rhetoric gets ratcheted up a few notches.  '''That''' is what Skookum needs to learn and understand - a broad swath of the community finds him to be pesky.  The sheer quantity (or "gang") should tell Skookum just how many people he's pissed off.  Look, if someone runs for town council election, and they get 1 vote, and 10,000 votes against them ... those 10,000 didn't "gang up" on them!  Those 10,000 are independent voices - just like in ANI <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User talk:DangerousPanda|<font style="color:#ffffff;background:black;"> the panda </font><font style="color:#000000;background:white;"> ₯’</font>]]</span></small> 08:38, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::Yikes.  BHG, this is not at all a fair legal process, and you are absolutely wrong to imply that justice is free for a targeted person being criminalized in Wikipedia.  The target is criminalized, dragged down, in an ANI proceeding, or in CFD or AFD, where the target does not enjoy participating and it is hugely demanding and cost-imposing.  While it may be enjoyable, or is at least less repugnant, for the accuser(s).  It is effectively way too easy, too free of cost, for the follower/critic/accuser(s) to open multiple "trials", imposing costs on a target in Wikipedia.  In the U.S. legal system there are counters:  a plaintiff has to pay fees, and incur legal costs that they may never recover, and they risk getting deemed by a judge to be frivolous/nuisance.  In many civil and other courts a judge can rule the frivolous plaintiff to have wasted the defendant's time and the court's time, and to fine the plaintiff, even requiring the plaintiff to pay all the defendant's legal fees plus a further fine.  It is absurd to suggest that this ANI court is free, or that DRV or other appeals courts are free for the target. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 00:27, 23 April 2014 (UTC)  (p.s.

:::::::::ANI is an arduous process for anyone involved (and so ArbCom many times more so), but DRV and MR are lightweight for the petitioner. All they need to do is to write an opening statement, and let it roll. The person being held to account is the closer, not the petitioner (who can do more if they choose, but many don't).
:::::::::In this case it would be a lot less work for Skookum1 to open move reviews than to continue writing at length about the alleged injustices in multiple forums. Not only would it provide an answer one way or another to some of his grievances, it would also allow other discussions to focus on the issue in hand, reducing stress on everyone including Skookum1.
:::::::::The practice of breaking down problems and trying to fix them one at a time is a crucial tool for solving all sorts of problems. Not doing that is what leads to the patterns of conflict which come to ANI.
:::::::::I think it is a fundamental mistake to view XFD as in any way "criminalising". Much better to regard them as a form of interactive peer review.
:::::::::Similar processes are familiar to people writing in many other contexts.  As a student, my writing was dissected twice a week in tutorials, by fellow-students briefed on how to find holes in my work. As a policy analyst, my colleagues and I performed destructive testing on every piece of writing any of us produced; we canned a significant chunk of each others work, and sent.  As a journalist, every piece of work was dissected in an editorial conference, where justifying is existence and content was part of the job.
:::::::::I think that one of the very big problems Wikipedia faces is that this sort of scrutiny is an essential part of quality control, but many enthusiastic editors lack experience of working in this way. We don't do enough to convey how important it is, or to assist editors in learning the techniques required. When I first started editing, every edit page used to warn editors with words something like "your contribution may be edited without mercy". Those words may have been a bit harsh, but it's a pity we no longer have something in a similar vein to remind contributors that we are not here as bloggers. We are collaboratively developing the world's most widely-read encyclopedia, and editors should expect that ''any'' contribution may be challenged, debated, modified, or even removed.

====Where are the diffs====
{{reply to|The Bushranger}} You say above that [[User:Skookum1]] has not provided diffs, but neither have you. 

It appears that even though you are the one who started this this whole ani-thread   you feel you are above  providing   support for your accusations. This is a mystery since your  complaint is taking an enormous toll on the community, and  to me at least,  is looking more and more like a [[Witch-hunt]] than anything else. Your very short [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Skookum1_again|opening remarks]] talk vaguely about another ANI (which?) and alludes to behavior by Skookum1 which is not supported by one single diff. It seems that the whole  basis for your complaint is that Skookum has rejected your “attempt to provide a caution and a suggestion for calming the waters”.

As an uninvolved editor it seems to me that you feel that Skookum1 should automatically defer to you. Since I have not had any(?) dealings with you I do not understand why you expect other editors to automatically defer to your suggestions.

===An attempt at a summary===

Let me try again. (1) Everyone agrees that Skookum needs to start being nice fast or he is going to be out the door for disruptive behavior. (2) Everyone agrees that Skookum is a productive, expert content-writer who is here to build an encyclopedia. (3) Some people think Skookum feels persecuted, particularly in deletion discussions, and lashes out — a correctable situation; others think this behavior is a fundamental personality trait and that collaborative work is impossible for him. (4) Some people think this is already a lost cause; others think there needs to be some sort of active mentoring process to turn this downward spiral around. (5) While all agree that it is enormously annoying that this situation continues to continue, most people think that further blocking or banning sanctions are not justified at this time. Fair enough summary? [[User:Carrite|Carrite]] ([[User talk:Carrite|talk]]) 16:38, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

===Request for sanctions on Ihardlythinkso===

I have attempted to adopt a water-off-a-duck's-back policy regarding the continued personal attacks and [[WP:HOUNDING|hounding]] in this discussion by Ihardlythinkso, however his most recent comment indicates that he is determined to continue to manufacture accusations that have zero basis in truth, personally attack me, and hound me (as evidenced by both his appearing here at ANI, and only in this one section of ANI, to attack me, and more notably his use of "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=606023623&oldid=606022204 RfC/U is →thataway]" which is mocking my closing style of discussions here, something that indicates a search of my contribution history). At ''least'' three times now Ihardlythinkso has invented a charge against me, two of them involving words attributed to me that I did not say or imply: the "busyness" claim from the previous discussion regarding IHTS ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=602347817&oldid=602347629 His manufactured charge], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=602256055&oldid=602254966 what I actually said]), claiming that I was "crystal-balling 'intent'" somehow ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=605999015&oldid=605997741 his claim], having no basis in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=605954329&oldid=605953097 what I actually said]), and most recently "my posts here were not addressing you until you addressed me", which even if you don't count [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=605452843&oldid=605447915 his first comment in this thread] as "addressing [me]", [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=605999015&oldid=605997741 this is] (and was in reply to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=605954329&oldid=605953097 my reply] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=605929918&oldid=605929834 Ottawahitech], not IHTS).

I have disengaged from IHTS following the previous discussion, however IHTS refuses to disengage from me - and, in fact, claims that ''I'' am not disengaging from ''him'' - refuses to cease making [[WP:NPA|personal attacks]], without any evidence, to the point of making up things I did not say or do, and claiming that I do not substantiate my claims after I clearly have, and evidences [[WP:HOUNDING|hounding]] behavior while leaving edit-summaries, here at ANI of his comments aimed at me, of "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=606173560&oldid=606173512 creepy]" and "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=605999015&oldid=605997741 putrid]". And, after my request above for his latest baseless personal attack to be stricken, he responds by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NE_Ent&diff=606177310&oldid=605638168 posting this] at NE Ent's talk page (which, if he hadn't wikilinked my username and thus triggered the ping function, I would have been unaware of).

:Agreed. I got about 4 paragraphs into this, then scrolled (for a while) to the bottom. Editors need to back away and stop beating the dead horse. In addition, some thicker skin is in order for the people that believe it is a personal attack to insinuate someone has a lack of knowledge in a subject matter. I mean... really? Grow a pair; someone has to say it. Heck, even "you're being stupid" is more of a personal attack, but not enough to run and tell an adult.

=== It's getting worse ===
An attempt by [[User:Resolute]] to persuade Skookum1 to moderate his approach has been unsuccessful. See [[User talk:Skookum1#Re:_this]].

Most of it is just the usual verbosity, and a large chunk of it is repeated allegations of bad faith in my closures of XFDs and RMs, including assertions that I made "bad closures and false invocations of guidelines that do not, in fact, say what is being claimed", "Suggesting that I should show BHG good faith when she has showed me none at all, whether to do with the facts of the Squamish matter, or the presentations of citations and policy in the RMs".

However, the bit that catches my attention is :  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Skookum1&diff=606445027&oldid=606440131#Re:_this I collapsed them to avoid yet another invocation of "walls of text" and TLDR; the latter is not supposed to be used on discussion pages at ''all'' and its use, as it says clearly, is seen as unCIVIL...but was the pretext for ignoring all the very valid arguments on the Squamish CfD, and part of that close. "She" has since found an actual "behavioural guideline" to use instead in such instances; it's one of the many reasons the Squamish CFD close was ''bunk'' and illegal; but as I've found out by looking around, places like Move Review and Dispute Resolution and RfC are not about lookign at issues and guidelines, but only about wikiquette and "conduct".. Not about content, in other words, but about editors].

This repeats yet gain the false charge that I invoked TLDR; I didn't use that term, or link to that page. It also claims that the close was "illegal", which is nonsense; an editor may believe that the close was wrong, but WP does not have laws. Above all, if an editor believes that a close was flawed, they can take it to review, where uninvolved editors can assess whatever case Skookum1 wants to make about flaws in the closure.  However, instead of doing that, Skookum1 continues to make a stream of vicious allegations about me, repeatedly denouncing my integrity.  This is pure [[WP:BATTLEGROUND]] behaviour. Per [[WP:ADMINACCT]] I am quite happy for any closure I have made to be reviewed, and I will accept the outcome.  But no admin should be subjected to an ongoing barrage because an editor refuses to use the review processes.

The worst bit, though is Skookum1's use of scare quotes in referring to me as she: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uשser_talk:Skookum1&diff=606445027&oldid=606440131#Re:_this  "She" has since found an].  This is a pure ''ad hominem'' attack.

*'''Comment''' I have to say that the use of scare quotes around "she" jumped out to me as well as questioning, at least, her lady-like behavior (a la Thatcher or Hillary Clinton). But as others have noted, it is hard sometimes to know what Skookum is intending with his writing style. It was clear that he was quite upset with BHG in that reply but his intent is not as clear. However, in an earlier comment in that same thread about another admin with whom Skookum seems to have also clashed with, [[User:Kwamikagami|User:Kwami]], he doesn't use the scare quote when referring to him in comments like ''"[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Skookum1&diff=606411388&oldid=606398863  And it was you who observed that we don't use Sarcee anymore vs. Tsuu Tina; that was indeed how those articles were.....''until Kwami came along and turned the clock back forty years'' unilaterally, along with all the rest I mentioned (oh, including Heiltsuk-Bella Bella and Nuxalk-Bella Coola, too... and says he would have liked to move Kwakwaka'wakw to Kwakiutl and Nuu-chah-nulth to Nootka....).]"''.

If you want an example of a wildly inappropriate gendered reference, scroll up to the "grow a pair" comment earlier in the thread.  Apparently BHG and other users are now expected to obtain male gonads, and prove they are "masculine" by putting up with abuse. No wonder Wikipedia has only 8% (soon to be 7%) female editors, and is routinely criticized in the press for systemic bias.

*{{ec}} Neotarf pointed out "us" in quotes in one of Skookum's posts.  That's clearly intended to be scare quotes:  Who counts as "us" when outsiders name Native Americans, tying into his accusations of racism against anyone who agrees which the opinions on TITLE he himself held a year ago but has since abandoned.  I haven't seen any evidence that Skookum mistakenly uses quotes where he intends italics or other emphasis.  The obvious conclusion is just what BHG believes:  that he's implying that, while BHG claims to be a woman, he has his doubts, or maybe even that he rejects her claim to be a woman as some sort of plot against him.  If that's too uncertain a point to act on, so be it, but demanding that BHG retract her objection is inappropriate.  Better to have the occasional charge of sexism that people judge hasn't been proved than to forbid women from making charges that men won't accept.  — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 07:36, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Doc, you did, above.  You regard the evidence as inadequate, which is a conclusion I disagree with, but you are entitled to your judgement.
:::There are several ways you could follow through on that. You could ask Skookum1 to avoid writing which could be interpreted that way.  You could conclude something like "not proven", or "not enough to act on".
:::But instead you have chosen to problematise only the complainant, and demand that I refrain from even raising a concern.  The parallel situation in the non-virtual world would be that if a good faith complaint to authorities were judged not to require any further action, those authorities would give the complainant a hard time to deter further complaints. 
:::The context of this is important too. I acted as an admin in closing some backlogged discussions in which Skookum1 had a stake, using my best judgement in applying policy to the closures. Editors may disagree with that judgement, which is why we have review processes which allow a closing admin's actions to be reviewed, and overturned if there is a consensus to do so. That allows the issue to be settled, so that everyone can move on.
:::AFAICR, the first closure of mine which Skookum1 objected to was my [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2014_February_19&oldid=600811914#Squamish closure on 23 March of the Category:Squamish CFD]. Skookum1 posted to my talk page about it, where I rejected the complaint and invited him to open a deletion review. If he had done so, the community could have settled the issue long ago.
:::Similarly with the RM closures to which he objects. Take for example my [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Chipewyan_people&oldid=603942827#Requested_move_2 12 April close of the Chipewyan people RM], which he is still complaining about in [[User talk:Skookum1#Re:_this]]. Move review is available for that too.
:::Instead, Skookum1 persistently refuses to use the community's review mechanisms.  He has chosen instead to post numerous lengthy attacks on me in multiple forums, with a repeated barrage of allegations that I was not acting in good faith, that I abused policy etc.  These attacks have continued for over a month, are still ongoing.
:::The message from Skookum1 is loud and clear: that if he dislikes a closure, he will not seek a review. Instead he will hurl insults and abuse until he gets the answers he wants. This is plain bullying.
:::And the response at ANI has so far been that the admin's response should be to simply accept being on the receiving end of this macho rage, and not even to object unless the evidence on any individual point is undisputable. Neotarf is right: no wonder there are so few female editors.
:::This isn't a new problem.

*'''comment''' I understand why BHG feels the way she does and she's undoubtedly been the subject of personal attacks and accusations of bad faith lodged by Skookum on multiple occasions. However here we are reading way too much into editing style - if you look at the recent missive posted to his talk page he puts "he" in quotes, as well as many other words which aren't themselves problematized but rather emphasized. E.g you can read it like ''She'' told me to do that then ''he'' told me to say the other thing, even though the ''place''  we were talking about was... It can be seen as dismissive or nagging but I don't see it as a slur on BHGs gender. Anyway it's just his writing style, sometimes scare quotes are used for emphasis and sometimes they are used to problematize something - another respected editor who uses scare quotes in this way is Bearcat, who is "constantly" using such quotes to "emphasize" the "main" points. We here need to come up with a reasonable path to help Skookup adjust his behavior but picking on a stylistic issue like this isn't helping IMHO.--[[User:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[User talk:Obiwankenobi|talk]]) 11:47, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[WP:AGF|FWIW]], I'm not convinced that Skookum was intending to use quotes in that instance as a gender-based attack.  He's pretty much going all Springs1 <small>(seriously, Google that name)</small> on his talk page at the moment, and just seems intent on adding emphasis all over the place. I don't wonder if he intended to italicize "she" but ended up with quotes instead of double apostrophes.  In any case, BHG is correct above.  Skookum needs to step back and look for a review rather than continue down this path. I was trying to point him toward an RFC, but I am not confident of it happening.  At this point, I am going to disengage and leave him be since there is nothing I productive I (or any of us) can do right now while he's off in such a rage.

Either this ends in another block for Skookum, or we find a way to modulate his behavior. I agree there are avenues like move review he could pursue but he has chosen not to.

== [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Vanja_Buli%C4%87]] ==

I am reporting the exchange between myself and [[User:QuackDoctor]] [[User talk:QuackDoctor]] at [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Vanja_Buli%C4%87]]. I began in good faith, but instead of offering calm arguments for retention, he laid into me and immediately questioned my motives. When I advised him to stop, he laid into me with the whole deletionist troll routine, after which I will decline to interact with him in any other way, other than to replace the required ANI warning on his talk page. If he has arguments for retention, he should just make them and not question my motives or the motives of any other user.

:: It is quite the contrary, the editor Safiel, who has evident deletionist practice, has questioned MY motives, by accusing me of having conflict of interest about the biography of a well known Serbian author and journalist (author of several bestselers, among other things), even accusing me of being Vanja Bulic. This is clearly ad hominem attack and not assuming any good faith. He also wants to remove page about a perfectly valid and well known person (that has page on Serbian wikipedia, has written screenplays for major Serbian movies, hosted over 2000 TV shows, was editor of a major news magazine etc) that a friend of mine created as a way to experience wikipedia editing. What he experienced is major abuse, and it is extremely annoying (obviously, Safiel is now extending his abuse to me).

If you had merely given your reason for retaining the article and not attacked me to begin with, there would be no argument. I would have had no problems. But you choose to go personal right away.

::::::Look at the article history. The very moment it was created, it was suggested for speedy deletion. I removed the notice, and told my friend to continue editing.

Then it was proposed for deletion, and then had article for deletion page, despite the fact that the article was extended (now by me) to show more of the content. Yes, articles do get deleted, but people should give it more time and some google check since the effect is that you turn away potential contributors. If you assume that every new article is some hoax (despite the very numerous google pages with news sources, albeit in Serbian), you are damaging the project. This is the real issue here, since many people get scared away in this way and never come back to edit. If my reaction was strong, it was justified. It should make people here reassess this attitude, which is not doing any good, and this is a problem that has been discussed at length here [http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/]. I had opportunity to see it happen with this article and a friend of mine, but I am sure it happens all the time. People who I reacted to are not going to leave the project.

'''Comment''' On the basis of several good faith keep rationales by other users, I have withdrawn and closed the AfD. Had the other party behaved civilly towards me in the first place and given a good faith reasoned defense of the article, rather than attacking me, I would very likely have withdrawn the AfD then.

::Quite the contrary, the evidence [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Safiel&offset=&limit=500&target=Safiel] shows the opposite. In fact, out of his last 1000 edits, that almost exclusively consist of proposals for deletion of pages not a single proposal for deletion of an article that he suggested, Safiel closed in this way - a pretty impressive track record. A typical situation, that shows how this deletionist behaved is this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ernest_Hill_(author)]: Clear keep concensus (without even a single vote for deletion of Ernest Hill article), similar arguments like here (google in fact shows notability etc), but did Safiel speedy close the proposal? No, it was there for a week, until someone else closed it. The only speedy thing he did was speedy delete - A LOT.

== More IBAN violations by Ihardlythinkso ==

{{archive-top|1=Ihardlythinkso has been blocked for 24hrs for a first violation (after a generous first warning) of the IBAN.  It's also extensively supported by consensus that the "narcissist" comment HAS ALWAYS been considered to some form of PA, and that a warning coupled with MaxBrowne's own IBAN have been sufficient "penalty" - the long and short term issue will be this: '''further discussions regarding a now-very-old PA that has already had "penalties" applied will FOREVER be considered to be a violation of Ihardlythinkso's IBAN, and will such lead to escalating blocks - no matter who the discussion is with'''.  Everybody here needs to drop whatever [[WP:STICK|sticks they're holding]] (exept for [[Divining rod]]s because we all thirst for something other than rehashing ancient issues).  MaxBrowne is asked to try to NOT follow IHTS's comments - and perhaps allow someone else to make reports in the future unless the IBAN violations are flagrant <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User talk:EatsShootsAndLeaves|<font style="color:#ffffff;background:black;"> the panda </font><font style="color:#000000;background:white;"> ɛˢˡ”</font>]]</span></small> 11:31, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

This proposal for a new WikiProject had lain dormant for months; why did he suddenly feel compelled to post a whole lot of inflammatory stuff ''immediately after'' I posted there? This wasn't picked up in the recently closed thread but it should have been.

* It appears to me, much to my disappointment, that the reservations I expressed when endorsing the restriction are simply justified. I honestly do not see why the both of you should not be sanctioned, if not for anything else, but as an enforced wikibreak to get your priorities straight and start figuring out a more effective way to dedicate your time in Wikipedia. Yes, sure, this editor is clearly acting foolishly by not following the very sensible advice he has been given to take a voluntary wikibreak, and instead, making the comment cited in this ANI which consists of grievances about old issues. Lack of clue is also an issue which is affecting his behaviour (which would probably warrant normal dispute resolution before running back here). However, by the same token, I also don't understand why this editor's comments are being followed or scrutinised in this similar-to-obsessive fashion with blocks being sought at every turn. And even ignoring that, if the user to whom the comment was made is in no way affected by it, do you not see how counterproductive it is to bring it back here so that it receives 10 times the amount of attention it would have otherwise received? It's exactly why I would seriously consider whether or not the Community restriction should be vacated now. It would mean you have to air your grievances in an arbcom case rather than here at every turn; ultimately one of you might be a lot better off than the other (or not) after you've exhausted each other, but at least it would mean the community could address other (more serious) issues more promptly rather than losing time checking the repeated relatively-petty complaints of this squabble. (I use the word petty in this way because if the violation in the earlier thread were as serious as suggested, the clear consensus of the uninvolved eyes would've been to block rather than issue another warning - an action which I happened to also endorse as it so happens, which frankly, says enough).

::{{replyto|MaxBrowne}} I find it disturbing that you are monitoring IHTS's user talk page. If you are going to bring up the "spirit" of the interaction ban, you should take care to follow the spirit yourself, in that you should be avoiding each other. I do understand that you are not literally violating the ban by bringing your complaint here (reporting the other party for a violation of the ban in an appropriate venue, such as this board, is explicitly allowed) but if you are going to accuse the other party of violating the spirit of the ban while not violating the letter, you should expect to be held to the same standards. I checked to make sure that there was nothing added to the IBAN aside from the standard provisions (because some interaction bans prohibit editors from following each other to pages) but there is no such restriction here. Also, I know that IHTS is heavily-involved in chess matters, so it's not unreasonable to think that he was there only because of his involvement in chess-related matters on the project. And he refrained from commenting until a third party also commented, and restricted his interactions on that page to the other person. In that situation I don't see any violation.

::But I did say that if IHTS didn't drop the stick and kept bringing up the "classic narcissist" comment he'd be blocked. I made that very unambiguous. And yet he did so again. I'm instituting a 24 hour block, because if I don't do so there may as well not even be an IBAN if nobody is enforcing it. IHTS should know exactly where the line is, because it was pointed out very clearly, and to repeat the behavior looks like an attempt to explore the boundaries of the ban. This block helps to set those boundaries. It's my hope that IHTS just moves on and stops bringing up this petty point, it's a waste of everyone's time. I'll also point out that multiple editors (including myself) have already answered his question (is the statement a personal attack) to the affirmative, so to bring it up again seems to be willful disruption.

::That being said, I'm going to try to engage personally with IHTS on his user talk page, because I think there are valid concerns from him in the midst of this, and I don't want to give the impression that he's being ignored. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 16:10, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::::No. That is not at all what's happening. It was explained very clearly in the ANI thread previously that bringing up the comment was an indirect criticism of MaxBrowne, since the personal attack had originated from them. IHTS can complain about Bushranger, and I made sure to express to IHTS that I agree that the suggestion that the comment wasn't a personal attack was incorrect, and that suggestions otherwise were unfair. But to continue to mention the comment specifically is a violation. There was no ambiguity, it was made clear, and there were multiple people supporting that suggestion. IHTS continued to bring it up regardless. So if someone is told "do this and you will be blocked per the ban", and they do it, they are ''willfully'' violating the ban. Also, due to the unambiguity from the closure of the last thread, it is only reasonable to assume that IHTS was deliberately egging on administrators to enforce the ban to test whether or not it was actually going to be enforced. It is critical that it ''is'' enforced, otherwise the interaction ban may as well not exist. I don't know how to make it any clearer than that. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 16:41, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::It's not a matter of clarity, it's a matter of being wrong. In essence, what Atama is saying is that they individually imposed a topic ban on an editor, which is not supported by [[WP:CBAN]]. I'm not seeing any notice on IHTS's talk page nor any logging of it on [[WP:Editing restrictions]]. Arguably, IHTS had moved on from obsessing about MB to obsessing about Bushranger -- see the discussion on his (IHTS) talk and also mine. To me, by stalking IHTS's talk page MB violated the IBAN as much or more than IHTS. (Since they've both been long active on chess related articles, it's unreasonable to think one is stalking the other if both end up on the same page.) Clearly, IHTS has been on the path of self wiki destruction, and I'd hoped they'd change course before they got there, and hearing about Bushranger's incorrect "spade is a spade" endorsement of the PA over and over again ''is'' tiresome. But a bogus 24 hour block on fallacious reasoning is unlikely to improve things. If there was a block to made, it should be on the grounds of [[WP:TE]], ''not'' a flimsy synthetic topic ban out of an iban. Which means that a "reaching out followup," no matter how well intentioned isn't terribly likely to be successful. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 17:03, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::Atama's reasoning is sound, and I agree fully with it, as well as his caution to MaxBrowne of not looking for things IHTS might engage in. Any reference by IHTS to MaxBrowne's conduct, directly or indirectly, regardless of whether he is named or not, is a violation of the IBAN. If IHTS had written
:::::::''" I would like your assessment of admin Bushrangers proclamation that MaxBrowne's "classic [[narcissist]]" name-call is "not a PA"."''
::::::nobody would disagree that it would be a blatant violation of the IBAN, since it is a complaint and mention of MaxBrowne's comment and conduct. What IHTS actually did write,
:::::::''"  I would like your assessment of admin Bushrangers proclamation that "classic [[narcissist]]" name-call is "not a PA".'',
::::::amounts to the same thing, both in spirit and meaning. It is just as much a complaint and mention of MaxBrowne, and mentioning MaxBrowne implicitly rather than explicitly is immaterial.

:::::::Well first of all, "cautioning" MB while rewarding him by blocking the opponent isn't a very effective deterrent. We have a choice between assuming IHTS was continuing his old pissing contest with MB, or continuing his current one with BR. [[WP:AGF]] (at much as it can be applied here) suggests we go with the latter. Reviewing the thread, I'll note the closing summary made no mention of the alleged topic ban, so claiming there was community support for it is suspect. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 18:59, 1 May 2014 (UTC) 
::::::::To your three points. (1) The reason MB "gets off" with a caution, while IHTS receives a block, is that IHTS has already received two cautions, MB hasn't received any before this. (2) Whether IHTS primarily was pursuing Bushranger or MaxBrowne is not really relevant. Obviously, he was going after Bushranger, but in so doing he made a reference to MaxBrowne's comment from several weeks ago even when he was explicitly warned not to. (3) There is no topic ban, but there is an interaction ban that was violated by continually making reference to the "narcissist" comment.

*Answering Ent (and adding it on here because, well, nowhere else is appropriate): After looking things over and consdering it, my choice of words in the original issue was admittedly quite poor. Accusing somebody of narcissism ''is'' a personal attack, however, given the situation, actions, and overall mess that was going on at the time, it was not an ''actionable'' "NPA" - it was provoked, and the editor had not previously been warned, which I should have been clearer about at the time. For my lack of clarity, I apologise, and I also apologise for allowing IHTS' goading to keep me from assessing it further and clarifying what I meant sooner. (And, as I said before, it changes nothing about the actions that would have taken place.) For that, I administer a self-trouting, and resolve to speak clearer and triple-check my words before clicking 'submit' when the heat:light ratio is increasing. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 13:35, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:*What dishonest manipulation, [[User:The Bushranger]]. Here I clearly asked you to redact your PA:<blockquote>So should User:The Bushranger redact what was equivalent to the same PA when he stated at my user Talk that your PA wasn't a PA but rather "calling a spade a spade". Ihardlythinkso (talk) 06:53, 13 April 2014 (UTC)</blockquote>Here was your reply:<blockquote>Let's be very clear here: there will be no redaction, as there was no personal attack to be reinforced. Everybody has told you it isn't a personal attack. The fact that you have shopped your complaint to (at least) four admins and gotten "two threats, one insult, and one nothing" should indicate that the problem is not the 'personal attack' you are claiming. There comes a point where your refusal to listen to what everyone is telling you and continuing to insist they're all wrong and you're right becomes an indication that you are not capable of being part of a collegial and constructive editing environment. - The Bushranger One ping only 23:20, 13 April 2014 (UTC)</blockquote> Also, you say he PA was "provoked". Where's the provoking diff? There were no exchanges between users any time recent prior to the AN. And I handled myself professionally at that ANI up the point of the PA. You blame the victim by saying I provoked that PA. Where's any recent diff prior to the PA that you say provoked it??

Whether or not IHTS is as accepting, who knows. This whole issue has exhausted my patience, honestly, and I'm generally a pretty patient person. I'm going to let other administrators deal with any further enforcement and/or evaluation of the IBAN, for whichever party.

'''Comment''' - Hello fellow Wikipedians. I (user [[User:Science.Warrior|Science.Warrior]]) am pretty sure that user "ishdarian" & user "hullaballoo" are part of a bigger conspiracy on Wikipedia, So let me answer all the baseless allegations reported by them one by one.

*'''Inserting copyrighted material''' The copyrighted material both these users are talking about, are the pictures prepared and uploaded by me using CS6 . When i asked for their help on how to change the license, no help was provided rather both of them vandalized the articles [[Kurt Goldstein]]and [[Self actualization theory]] deleting the images from the articles, which are been solely prepared and uploaded by me. So if they both have problem with the copyright material why don't they guide me on how to make  valid changes in the license section of the pictures?  I really don't know what "3RR" these guys referring to, when i search wiki it shows up this page [[3RR]], I am a new user and have joined Wikipedia 4 days ago, these users are trying to use "technical buzzwords" to cover their act of their vandalism and personal attacks. 

*'''Reference to [[Wp:beans]]''' Well i am new here but i am a fast learner, as user-"Hullaballoo Wolfowitz" stated '''"The account has only been around a few days  and appears to be a returning editor with an agenda, despite suddenly claiming to be a newbie when attention was drawn to his editing"''' I take this as a compliment, that he is so impressed by my contribution to Wikipedia in few days that he thinks i am a returning editor. Yes i have a agenda and anyone can read that on my user page.

*'''Removing the AFD tag''' I think this was a pre-planned conspiracy setup by both the user "Hullaballoo Wolfowitz" & "ishdarian". They reverted my edits endless times on the article [[Kurt Goldstein]], [[self actualization theory]] and user-"Ishadharin" 8 times in a row reverted the link of the article [[self actualization theory]] to the article [[self actualization]], The primary motive of writing the article [[self actualization theory]] by me was because the article [[self actualization]] does not meet the quality standard of Wikipedia and was tagged with 3 "Bad article" tags, if i would have edited the article i would have to delete the previous contributions of other contributors, so i rather decided to write a new article and let other editors decide what can be done, This information can be seen on the talk page of the article [[self actualization]], where users have complaints about the quality of the article. So after their constant attacks i also tried to do the same & fell in their trap, i am a new user 4 days old & i don't know much of technicality of Wikipedia right now.

*Beside this both the users "Hullaballoo Wolfowitz" & "ishdarian" have started personal attacks on the articles i was or working on for past few days, I constantly asked for their guidance on their talk pages but they don't reply or provide any guidance and rather keep on vandalizing the articles i am working on, they have made 28 edits in past 5 hours to the articles i have corrected recently.

*But i would really respect both these users "Hullaballoo Wolfowitz" & "ishdarian" if they are really concerned about the authenticity and quality of material on Wikipedia as they claim, but i rather feel they are trying to establish their unnecessary authority on Wikipedia by forcing other editors and new editors to comply on what they feel is right.

*Both the users "Hullaballoo Wolfowitz" & "ishdarian" use a very strong and rough abusive language on "edit summary" of articles and on other users talk pages, for eg. '''"Just ignore "Carrie"; she's a malicious, dishonest troll"''' which user-"Ishdarian" used to refer to user-"Carriearchdale" on his above comments publicly, You can imagine what kind of language he would be using on other user talk pages.  I strongly feel both these users are trying to establish their unnecessary authority on Wikipedia by their conspiracy tactics and should be reminded that this would not be tolerated here.

Comment-Just to let you and everyone else know Science.Warrior this one user h that was posting back and forth with you on Monday is himself dishonest, instigating, and an inciting troll that picks out victims on wikipedia just to give a hard time to said victims. It appears as if the other user I allegedly went in tandem, or tag team mode with h to try to incite you to be reverting h's ridiculous and vandalizing changes to the articles that you were improving.

I read where h typed a very demeaning message to you when you were trying to discuss with him the issues on his talk page. And then h erased all the banter between you and him on his talk page by reverting or erasing somehow perhaps to hide the evidence of his uncivil and threatening behavior towards you. see WP:CIVIL

I saved this one post he made to you:

"NFCC issues

In response to your question, poorly placed as it may have been, on my talk page, you badly need to become familiar with WP:NFC and WP:NFCC. You've also just broken WP:3RR on the Goldstein article, so unless you immediately revert yourself you're going to get a break from editing in which to do so. Hullaballoo Wolfowitz (talk) 21:32, 28 April 2014 (UTC)"[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Science.Warrior&oldid=606238901] - one instance see WP:CIVIL

That one reads a bit like a threat and or personal attack to me, as well as possibly  violating WP:CIVIL.

I have been a member of wikipedia since 2007. I would like to welcome you Science.Warrior to wikipedia. If you have any questions about wikipedia, or I can help you you in anyway with some of the questions and wiki technical type stuff please do not hesitate to contact me @ my talk page. I hope you and everyone have a most citational and perfect Tuesday! ciao!!! [[User:Carriearchdale|Carriearchdale]] ([[User talk:Carriearchdale|talk]]) 09:56, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Science.Warrior: "been solely prepared and uploaded by me" So you're saying you met [[Kurt Goldstein]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] and took these photos? And this happened when? These images don't particularly look like they were taken close to the age these people passed away, particularly for Kurt Goldstein. So you took the photos or at least the Kurt Goldstein one 70 or more years ago perhaps? 
:Also please see [[WP:Vandalism]]. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the other editors here, their actions clearly aren't vandalism and calling it such seriously discredits any valid point you may have.

::P.S. If you're a new user, this still doesn't explain why you removed the AFD template which clearly tells you not to remove it. Removing the template doesn't of course change the fact the article is at AFD which is why it was later fixed by a bot, and as others have said you're reasoning didn't even make sense (you apparently didn't read the tag properly, it sounds like you didn't even read the article properly). I don't know what nonsense you're talking about a preplanned conspiracy either as you had not edited the article [[Master Liam Lockran]] or its talkpage until you removed the template, unless you're saying you're an alternative account of [[User:Sutorta]]. How was anyone to know you would randomly stalk HW and remove an AFD tag they added to an unrelated article, apparently without reading much at all.

Comment - ok now i (user [[User:Science.Warrior|Science.Warrior]]) can connect the missing dots to this conspiracy, after reverting the edits by User-"Hullaballoo Wolfowitz" and "User:Ishdarian". User-"Lewis Hulbert" was the one to put the speedy delete tag on the images i uploaded, i tried to remove the unnecessary tag but user-"Nil Einne" came and tagged it again, following this i decided to write on user-"Nil Einne" talk page on how the improvements can be made, but before that can be done, to my surprise i see both of these users have already commented here. Are you guys working in a team or what? 
* "been solely prepared by me" means made on Adobe CS6 platform, which i stated above, if you are not aware of the of what CS6 can do please ask your friend Google and I am really confused why are allegations of "returning editor", "old user with new account" cited? am i that good learning things, i even didn't knew that. The best part that makes me laugh is, I am a "returning editor" and writing articles and uploading photos related to "psychology" and "business theories", the allegations would look good if i would be writing promotional contents or extremist articles on religion and countries.  
* right now i am dead sure this team is a part of some "conspiracy planning" or the "teenage superiority war games". "Listen up guys, i  am devoting my precious time to provide quality contribution to Wikipedia, if you ask why? you can find the answer of my user page.

::(multiple EC) Look I doubt anyone really gives a damn what you did or did not do in CS6 which was why I didn't mention it earlier. CS6 cannot magically construct images out of thin air. And it's clear these are photos, not paintings you drew from memory or your imagination or whatever. 
::These photos were clearly not taken by you therefore they cannot be your own work, whatever you may or may not have done with them in CS6. To claim they  "''solely prepared''"" by you, let alone that they were your own work, was quite misleading when the core creative work, that of taking the photographs, was clearly NOT your work. Your apparent inability to understand this doesn't bode well. 
::New editors do sometimes get confused with copyright matters. But as copyright is serious they should read and think about what they are doing and be willing to listen and defer to others and stop any possibly problematic copyright related editing until and unless they properly understand the problems with their editing (seeking help when needed) and are unlikely to repeat such problems. You've shown none of that. While not technically a wikipedia issue, removing the speedy deletion tags not once but twice on commons without converting it in to a normal deletion was clearly not acceptable there. Nor are any reversions of copyright violation removals you're made here. 
::Incidentally the tags were added in commons by [[:Commons:User:The Big Bad Wolfowitz]] who I presume is an alternative account for HW. Lewis Hulbert is correct they were not involved. So again, you've failed to properly read and check before doing stuff (in this case accusing someone). All this might be slightly tolerable were it not for your continual shrill accusations when you appear to be mostly in the wrong (and most of your accusations make little sense), inability or unwillingness to understand what you're being told, and general unpleasant attitude that I've seen here and elsewhere. 
::P.S. Since Kurt Goldstein is deceased and we possibly have no image of them, it's possible a [[WP:NFCC]] claim could be made for some image. That would of course need to be done here, not on commons and particularly given his age, perhaps a check to see if any public domain images exist (I mean it's possible the image you're trying to upload is in the public domain, we just don't have anywhere enough info to say that it is). People could have, and probably would have, discussed this with you if you'd approached it in a more resonable manner rather than the way you did.

===Carriearchdale===
Good. Now what should be done about [[user:Carriearchdale]]? Hr contributions to this thread have been far from helpful (rather the complete opposite), and from reading coments here, it seems she has displayed problematic behaviour for a long time. She e.g. stated [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=606251028 here] that one of HW's statements was not true and that SW only reverted twice: however, looking at the edit history she linked[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurt_Goldstein&action=history], it is very obvious that Science Warrior reverted four times in the span of less than two hours (20.07, 20.27, 20.38 and 21.22). Later comments in the same discussion include things like "h's ridiculous and vandalizing changes to the articles that you were improving." (Hullabaloo removed a copyvio, hardly vandalizing). Her involvement here seems to be rataliation for Hullabaloo's edits at [[Ink Master (season 4)]]

Carriearchdale was editing that article, and removed the GOCE tag at 18.45.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ink_Master_%28season_4%29&diff=606071271&oldid=606070768], making her last edit at 19.29[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ink_Master_%28season_4%29&diff=606076260&oldid=606076115]. 6 Hours later, Hullabaloo edited the article[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ink_Master_%28season_4%29&diff=next&oldid=606076260], and the immediate reaction from Carrie was to readd the GOCE tag[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ink_Master_%28season_4%29&diff=next&oldid=606116938]. Hullabaloo ten makes ten edits to the article, which were all at once reverted by Carriearchdale because "GOCE tag is in place"[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ink_Master_%28season_4%29&diff=next&oldid=606122233] (no edits were made on the article by Carriearchdale between placing the GOCE tag and reverting Hullabaloo). More back-and-forths followed. Apparently they have a longer history, but that doesn't give her an excuse to insert herself into a dispute and try to derail it by spouting incorrect statements and claming that Hullabaloo made personal attacks (see above, no personal attack exists in the example she gives).

===Post-closing comments===
{{ping|User:TParis}} um, what? "As for Carriearchdale, we don't block people for disagreeing with Fram." I have never encountered Carriearchdale, and have no "disagreements" with her. As an editor uninvolved with either party or article in this dispute, I noticed someone (Carriearchdale) coming here seemingly to get someone she has problems with (Hullabaloo) into trouble, and to achieve that she makes some completely incorrect claims here. I don't believe such behaviour should be ignored. But I don't want her blocked for disagreeing with me, please show me where she disagreed with me (or where I asked for a block for that matter, ANI can be used for more than just blocks) before making such statements, and please don't close discussions with such out-of-the-blue misinformed claims.

:For starters this comment from above: "Fram's points that "Carrie" had actively encouraged an obvious copyright violator and misrepresented the simple facts about an editing dispute in order to denigrate editors she disagreed with should not have been dismissed as a mere personal disagreement.

:Now then let us all scroll back up here to this comment: "The only "retaliation" was for someone coming to an unrelated ANI thread not to give useful opinions and perspective, but to get an opponent into trouble, and by making completely incorrect statements to boot.

[[User:Shane Harper 4 Life]] has been adding malicious content, harassed me, and removing/ignoring warnings given. This all started when I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bridgit_Mendler&diff=606039458&oldid=606037525 reverted the user] for adding unreasonable content ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bridgit_Mendler&diff=606025783&oldid=605948180], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bridgit_Mendler&diff=606025922&oldid=606025783], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bridgit_Mendler&diff=606026123&oldid=606025922], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bridgit_Mendler&diff=606037525&oldid=606026123]) on the [[Bridgit Mendler]] article. The user then started an edit war by [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bridgit_Mendler&diff=606040402&oldid=606039458 restoring the unreasonable content]. I then gave the user two warnings: ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shane_Harper_4_Life&diff=606042416&oldid=605723894 one for edit warring], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shane_Harper_4_Life&diff=606049606&oldid=606042416 another for harassment] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IPadPerson&diff=606044278&oldid=605924312 on my talk page]. The user then [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shane_Harper_4_Life&diff=606075983&oldid=606049606 removed my and prior warnings by other users]. After reverting the blanking, the user [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shane_Harper_4_Life&diff=606076397&oldid=606076114 removed them again and claimed that they were attacks]. If this behavior continues and the warnings don't work, I would suggest that an indefinite block from editing altogether and banning from editing Bridgit Mendler-related articles and my talk page will. [[User:IPadPerson|IPadPerson]] ([[User talk:IPadPerson|talk]]) 20:10, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:It's not clear to me why you call those additions 'incoherent content' - they look reasonable on the face of it to me. Could you explain what's wrong with them?
:Also, although it might have been better for Shane Harper 4 Life to engage with you on the talk page instead of reverting your revert, I think slapping them with edit warring templates was a bit of an overreaction on your part. Better would have been an attempt to engage them and discuss the edits. Additionally, I certainly don't think their reply to you was 'harassment'. Finally, editors are perfectly entitled to remove warnings from their own talk pages - it's taken as acknowledgement that they've read them.

**Without regard to the merits here: To my best knowledge, there isn't a normal way to remove Twinkle. <s>Technically, you could remove it from their *.js pages and then full protect all their *.js pages (ugly kludge but should work).  </s>I think the standard way to do it (assuming it isn't covered by [[WP:Discretionary sanctions]]) is to propose it as a type of "topic ban", and if it has consensus and they use it again, you block them.

*Alright, {{U|IPadPerson}} seems no longer interested in this section. Strange! They were all over it at first. Let me tell them, then, that this is a warning. Further abuse of Twinkle, incivility, bullying, and unexplained reverting can be considered a blockable offense. That may seem draconian, but it is important to realize that they already bullied one editor in staying away from an article, and that they apparently do not hesitate bringing someone to the dramah board--though when the tables are turned and the boomerangs start flying, they pretend to not be at home (even though they were active throughout this discussion). A final note on Twinkle--apparently we can't pull Twinkle, and a topic ban for it seems like a lot of work; we'll just consider a block, since such abuse is highly disruptive.

I moved this here to let someone more experienced have a look at this. A new editor is being thrown to the wolves in my opinion. The experienced editor is very aggressive towards the new editor. Attacking new editors only discourages them. It violates the no bite of new comers and assume good faith. Because of this behavior on the parts of some editors I myself will never become a registered editor. I honestly do not know all the policies and procedures but I know when someone is being an ass. What can be done is up to you more experienced administrators. Thanks [[Special:Contributions/172.56.11.196|172.56.11.196]] ([[User talk:172.56.11.196|talk]]) 05:36, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

[[Image:Stop hand nuvola.svg|30px|left|alt=Stop icon]] Your recent editing history at [[Frank Pommersheim]] shows that you are currently engaged in an [[Wikipedia:Edit warring|edit war]]. '''Being involved in an edit war can result in your being [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]'''&mdash;especially if you violate the [[Wikipedia:Edit warring#The three-revert rule|three-revert rule]], which states that an editor must not perform more than three [[Help:Reverting|reverts]] on a single page within a 24-hour period.  Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert.  Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring&mdash;'''even if you don't violate the three-revert rule'''&mdash;should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.

To avoid being blocked, instead of reverting please consider using the article's [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines|talk page]] to work toward making a version that represents [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] among editors. See [[Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle|BRD]] for how this is done.

== National Library of Pakistan and Citations Are not Copyright violations ==
{{la|National Library of Pakistan}}

Hello, I have been trying to add and review items for the National Library of Pakistan and it appears that a contributor named Smsarmad
uses a dire threat of copyright violation to remove content..then reports me as a vandal. There is nothing wrong with content I have added. it is referenced and not copied. Can someone  explain to  Smsarmad that his reporting of me as a vandal is bullying behavior. He has no right to "watch" the library site and remove content with a made up accusation of copyright violation. I have no special interest in Pakistan as I am a librarian who wants all libraries to have good Wikipedia entries..so if Smsarmad is thinking there is some issue here related to Pakistan, this is not the case. <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Brooksky|Brooksky]] ([[User talk:Brooksky|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Brooksky|contribs]]) 00:54, 1 May 2014‎</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

I do not understand what is happening and if Smsarmad has a secret way of deleting edits I have made. These are not copyrighted edits..theya re footnoted tiems about the library.
In all other places Wikipedia retains the edits in the history and mine are gone.
There is no reason that citations to important articles should be deleted by Smsarmad. Smsarmad is insiting this is a copyright issue.

== Jayman85 manually edit warring to push an unacademic POV despite final warnings  ==

{{userlinks|Jayman85}}

Jayman85 (whose behavior reminds me a bit too much of [[Special:Contributions/Jaredkunz30|Jaredkunz30]]) has tried (as I count of this post) nine times as of this post to disguise the views of Mormon apologists as [[WP:GEVAL|equally valid]] claims by secular academia at [[Archaeology and the Book of Mormon]].  He's received multiple warnings and explanations from multiple users, and explanations of site guidelines.  He replied by accusing everyone else and (non-Mormon) academia of being biased, and claiming that nothing can really know anything about history ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Archaeology_and_the_Book_of_Mormon&diff=prev&oldid=606657052], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jim1138&diff=prev&oldid=606659430], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayman85&diff=prev&oldid=606660120]).  He then resumed edit warring, despite [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayman85&diff=prev&oldid=606660737 receiving a warning about it].

This guy isn't going to pay attention to anything but a block.  I understand that yeah, he probably should be given the chance to improve, enough rope to hang himself with, but I'm pretty sure (given how much his behavior reminds me of [[Special:Contributions/Jaredkunz30|Jaredkunz30]]) he's not going to improve and is only going to start tugging for rope right after getting out of his block.

If he wants to prove me wrong, he needs to realize he's messed up and act on that.  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 18:31, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

ian.thomson (who has not returned my discussion on his page) has ignored that the phrase in use 'Mormon Apologists' is biased.  My edits have not removed data or knowledge, I removed 'apologists' as this slights the reader to view any dissenting opinion with the original author as wrong.  I don't know how someone can claim that given the lack of knowledge anyone has of the timeframe.  As far as the related name, I will waste my time in stating I don't know who that username is.  Regardless, you cannot claim a neutral stance if you invalidate any dissenting opinion.

:I have responded.  You just didn't bother to check.  And how is describing Mormon apologists as Mormon apologists biased?  They're Mormon and they're trying to defend a position that no one else accepts.  They're Mormon apologists.  Only someone who is dishonestly trying to present their claims as equally valid as would have a problem with that.
:And as the sources cited state, there's plenty of archaeological evidence for the absence of horses, pigs, etc.
:And it is a neutral stance to present stances as invalid if mainstream academia invalidates it.  Outside of a few [[WP:Fringe]] Mormon pseudo-scholars, no one thinks that the Book of Mormon is right when it says that America used to have horses.  If you want to believe that they were there but all archaeological evidence disappeared shortly before white people showed up, that's your [[delusion|right]].  But if you want to pretend that academia is split on it, that's not jsut lying to yourself, that's lying to others.

::::I think we ''may'' have a misunderstanding here. The word "apologist" is often misinterpreted. Although it is similar to the word "apologize" it does not have the same meaning. An "apologist", by definition, is a person who uses [[apologetics]]; it simply means a person who defends a position through the use of information (usually, but not always, a religious belief). It should not be taken to be a pejorative, on the contrary an apologist is someone who tries to use reason and facts to advance a position rather than simple statements of belief or opinion. At worst, labeling someone as an apologist shows that they are an advocate of whatever they are arguing for with apologetics, and thus may be biased toward that position, but it's not the same as labeling someone a kook; an apologist ''can'' be a crankpot (just as any scientist or doctor can be) but the term itself does not make that implication. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 19:19, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

== TfD discussions "refactored" ==
{{archive top|result=Close by dope demand. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 23:30, 1 May 2014 (UTC)}}
{{U|Meteor sandwich yum}} has "refactored" a group of four TfDs [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ATemplates_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2014_April_20&diff=606666552&oldid=606549590]. The TfD's are from [[Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2014 April 20|April 20]], and still open. I reverted early <s>[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_20&diff=606553896&oldid=606553379]</s> [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2014_April_20&diff=606553896&oldid=606553379], but that was undone.

My first care is that the discussions now are distorted and unrecognisable. I have seen no base (like a WP:guideline) that shows this is useful or good practice. It is ''urgent'', in that any closer now could conclude "useless TfD process". I propose (request) that it is reverted, and that user:Meteor sandwich yum is convinced that indeed that is not the way to do. -[[User:DePiep|DePiep]] ([[User talk:DePiep|talk]]) 19:15, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::I think [[WP:TPO]] applies here somewhat. It's not an egregious violation, in that it's not changing the meaning of what anyone else said. It could even be argued that this is allowed as fixing format or layout errors. But I think you're right, this is causing technical problems. MSY's intentions are good, but the execution was bad, and incorrect. [[WP:TFD]] itself has a method for combining multiple templates into a single discussion:

:::{{tq|Multiple templates: If you are nominating multiple related templates, choose a meaningful title for the discussion (like "American films by decade templates"). Tag every template with <nowiki>{{subst:tfd|heading=discussion title}}</nowiki> or <nowiki>{{subst:tfm|name of other template|heading=discussion title}}</nowiki> instead of the versions given above, replacing discussion title with the title you chose (but still not changing the PAGENAME code). Note that TTObot is available to tag templates en masse if you do not wish to do it manually.}}
 
::That is what MSY should be doing, ''if'' others agree that it's best. They shouldn't first ask if it's okay then just do it anyway when nobody responds. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 19:30, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

: Yes if someone could undo all the refactoring – there are only a couple of edits not due to it that would need to be restored that I can see - then trout MSY for their well meant but disruptive editing it would be appreciated.

::Sorry, I thought you'd already fixed things back. You'd said that there was nothing that said it was a good practice to do what MSY did, and I thought that it would be helpful to show you what good practices are supposed to be in this situation. I missed where you said "I propose (request) that it is reverted", the way you phrased it (instead of saying you request that it ''be'' reverted) reinforced my assumption that you'd already done it (again).

== Edits by Arjunkrishna90 ==

Arjunkrishna90 has been engaged in an edit war with me on the Wikipedia's page on Arjuna. This individual and I quote states "ALL YOUR EDITS WILL BE REVERETED" on my talk page.  I tried to have a rational discussion with this individual and clarify the issues we had to which this person responded by insulting my intelligence and stating that "human stupidity has no limits." I understand the Mahabharata is an ancient text and scholars keep debating about when it was compiled. The consensus now is between 400 BCE and 4 CE. And there is a consensus among scholars and academics that the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata (Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune), which is a compilation of the various manuscripts of the epic by scholars at Pune school, to be the most comprehensive an reliable of sources for the Mahabharata. This is what's used in universities that study this great epic. I tried explaining this to Arjunkrishna90 but to no avail. Here are a list of the issues I have with this individual's contributions to the Arjuna page:

He/she makes selective quotes from the Ganguly translation. He/she does this to misinterpret that Arjuna wasn't a "peerless warrior." In the same version of the epic there are numerous instances and by several individuals where Arjuna is referred to as a peerless warrior and "foremost of warriors." I have extensive background on the subject and with this knowledge I state that if you read the scholarly accepted versions of the epic, no character in the Mahabharata is referred to this honorific more times than Arjuna, with the exception of Krishna. Other are referred to as foremost of warriors but not as much Arjuna.  I just want the readers of this page to get as true a picture as possible of Arjuna in the epic and Arjunkrishna90 is making this task very difficult.  

Arjunkrishna90 inserts erroneous information that is not found in any scholarly compilation of the Mahabharata. For example, he/she refers to an incident in which the sun sets before Karna (another character from the epic) can kill Arjuna. No such act/incident exists in the Mahabharata and I suspect Arjunakrishna90 got this from a TV show on epic that was aired in India in '80s. Arjunakrishna90 is citing this as factual. 

Arjunkrishna90 in our exchanges is citing folklore and recent renditions (not accepted by scholars) such as the Sarala Mahabharata, which was written in 15 CE (over 11 centuries after the last recorded text of the original epic) as his/her sources. 

Finally, Arjunkrishna90 has no regard for the integrity or veracity of the information he/she posts and inserts information from folklore and TV shows. 

I read other user comments on Arjunkrishna90's talk page and I believe other editors had similar concerns regarding this individual. 

Again, I did tried discussing these issues with this individual but he/she keeps accusing me of Vandalism and refuses to engage in scholarly and civil discussion on the subject. 

I hope you'll consider my request. 

The following are the links to the pages to the changes I made and Arjunkrishna90 keeps reverting

::::Just wanted to emphasize [[User:Yoninah]]'s request that we need some type of page protection for the  [[ Street Artists Program of San Francisco]] article. [[User:William J. Clark]] is the most disruptive individual that I’ve met on Wikipedia in seven years. He shows no interest in working with Wikipedia’s most basic rules, and only seeks out articles where there is an opportunity to insert his own name (also notice the [[Sea serpent]] article). With a false sense of  entitlement he consistently ignores the advice of experienced Wiki editors (  [[User:NeilN]], [[User:Seaphoto]], [[User:K6ka]], [[User:Yoninah]] ) and repetitively deletes sourced material while attempting to insert unsouced opinions of his own. A quick reading of his words on the article’s Talk Page [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Street_Artists_Program_of_San_Francisco ]  reveals what we have been dealing with. IMO, it might make sense to first block William Clark from the article, and if he posts again in the future with more Anonymous IP Addresses, then we should consider a greater blocking mechanism.[[User:James Carroll|James Carroll]] ([[User talk:James Carroll|talk]]) 00:52, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::As I read Yoninah's comments, Clark's only used a few IPs; it would be easier to block them than to protect the page.  Am I right, or have I misunderstood something?  The only reason I blocked was his actions in the article; I didn't look at most of his edits to the talk page, since the ones I checked were (at worst) annoying but not outright disruptive.  Unless he's actively disrupting the talk page, I see no reason to restrict his use of it (aside from times like now, when a block is needed), since we can normally ignore him; do you disagree?  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 01:10, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::I agree that ''permanently'' blocking the known IP Addresses and William Clark from the article and its talk page might solve the problem, and if he returns under new IP Addresses we should consider more drastic actions. Have you found the time to look at Clark's many disorganized rants within that Talk Page [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Street_Artists_Program_of_San_Francisco ]] ? His verbose, unformatted, and repetitive rants on the Talk Page disrupt the normal flow of discussion, and fatigue sincere attempts from admins like [[User:k6ka]] who attempt to familiarize Clark with the basic methods of Wikipedia, only to later find Clark ignoring all suggestions and deleting whatever sourced content he chooses. He has been so persistent over the article's short lifetime that it's impossible to ignore him – by the sheer volume of his rants he has become the dominant voice of the Talk Page. IMO, the law of diminishing returns suggests that this ''very obsessed'' individual, who shows no sign of restraint or moderation, is much more of a problem than an asset to this article. To let him remain will only threaten an acceptable DYK article and additionally fatigue and discourage earnest editors from participating at Wikipedia.[[User:James Carroll|James Carroll]] ([[User talk:James Carroll|talk]]) 16:40, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::Dear Nyttend, In the interests of providing extensive diffs, I may not have stated the problem clearly. The main problem is not multiple accounts, but [[WP:DE|disruptive]] and [[WP:TE|tendentious]] editing and [[WP:EW|edit warring]]. I first came across this page in my role as a DYK reviewer, and thoroughly copyedited the page on February 23[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Street_Artists_Program_of_San_Francisco&diff=596802493&oldid=596711615] to make sure it complied with policy. Since then, the page has not been able to be developed in a meaningful way due to the constant edit warring, deletion of sourced material, and addition of unsourced material (specifically, anything mentioning Bill Clark) by [[User:William J. Clark]]. Moreover, editors and vandalism patrollers are spending an inordinate amount of time explaining policy on the talk page (see talk page thread), after which Clark goes ahead and reverts anything on the page that he doesn't agree with. Clark has a clear [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] on this page, as he was involved in the formation of the Street Artists Program, and is uninterested in complying with policy or editing in a neutral manner. He must be [[WP:TBAN|banned]] from this page and this topic. Thank you, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 08:22, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

== Recurrance of disruptive Nazi-related editing by User:Hoops gza ==

[[User:Hoops gza]] has previously caused problems by adding individuals who do not meet the criteria for [[List of Nazis]] to that page and [[:Category:Nazis]], even going so far as to remove those criteria from the page and claim that they'd been added by a random editor (rather than by the creator of the list article, to prevent its deletion).  He has also created an absurd number of redirects in non-English languages on the English WP, arguing that the rules against this didn't apply because the topic was special (the Holocaust).  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Hoops_gza&offset=&limit=500&target=Hoops+gza He's at it again.]  This time he's also creating obsessively-specific categories such as [[:Category:Nazis executed by Albert Pierrepoint]]. -[[User:JasonAQuest|Jason A. Quest]] ([[User talk:JasonAQuest|talk]]) 14:10, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:What are you talking about?  Let me get this straight.  I added the [[:Category:Nazis]] to people who were verifiable Nazi Party members (you can take a look at the German Wikipedia's [[:de:Kategorie:NSDAP-Mitglied]] to see how this is done).  Ergo, they were Nazis.[[User:Hoops gza|Hoops gza]] ([[User talk:Hoops gza|talk]]) 17:00, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:I can say for certain that Hoops gza was incorrect at List of Nazis, the article's [[Special:diff/303197515|creator]] was [[User:Dr. Blofeld|Dr. Blofeld]], and Dr. Blofeld was the person who [[Special:diff/391037935/598888023|originally added that language]]. The statement that Hoops gza made in [[Special:diff/598888168/598888023|this edit summary]] is nonsense (easily seen by anyone checking the article history). However, that edit war ended over a month ago, so it's not really worth bringing up anymore.

:I'm also not sure what's problematic about those redirects, I don't dispute that there are "rules" being broken but I can't see where they are.

:The category you mentioned above is at CfD, so the fate of the category should be settled there. The guideline for creating categories is [[Wikipedia:Categorization|here]].

In view of the "Ergo, they were Nazis" comment above (on top of the discussion at [[Talk:August Landmesser#"Nazi"]] from March), I would support a Nazi-related category topic ban to prevent future disruption and misuse of the category system.

::Looking at the user's last 500 edits to the article space, the Walrus group appears to start with [[Expert texpert]] at 22:11 on 27 April; there's also a group of redirects to [[A Clockwork Orange (disambiguation)]] starting with [[Ultra-violence]] at 20:24 on 26 April and a shorter set of redirects to [[Full Metal Jacket]] starting with [[This is my rifle this is my gun]] at 03:39 on 27 April. I think the redirects to Göring's wives (1st wife, First wife, Goering, Göring, etc., etc.) to "dad" and "mum" of Mozart and Beethoven (composer's names both in short form and spelled out) and to misspellings of [[Thames]] and the different permutations of abbreviations and non-abbreviations for [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] are excessive, but I don't see a similar problem with the [[Porajmos]] categories; it's legitimate to distinguish that specific genocide.

:::Not all of his redirects (and other edits) are problematic.  But so many of them are utterly useless.

On 26 April, there were about 70 Clockwork-Orange redirects using phrases containing "ultra violence"/"ultraviolence"/"ultra-violence" (some of which don't even appear in the film or the novel), almost 50 redirects from variations on the names of [[Moatzart, Wolfgang Amadeus]] [sic] and [[Baytoven, Ludwig van]] [sic] and awkward phrases referring to their relatives. On 25 April were three dozen creative redirects to [[Erwin Rommel]]. In March he created redirects ''within WP-EN'' from [[مرگ انبوہ]] (Urdu), [[ഹോളോകോസ്റ്റ്]] (Malayalam), [[হলোকস্ট]] (Bengali), [[홀로코스트]] (Korean), and dozens of other non-English terms to [[Holocaust]], as if there were circumstance in which they could be useful.

Last month, I reported {{user|A50000}} here because of his disruption at {{la|Soviet Union}}, as seen [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive826#User:A50000 at Soviet Union|here]]. Since then, all he has done is make half-assed attempts at arguing with me over the pedantry of my claim that he was edit warring while constantly claiming that his version is correct and that he was not violating [[WP:CONSENSUS]]. After [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong&diff=prev&oldid=605213554 his last message], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AA50000&diff=605270712&oldid=602063091 I gave him a warning not to bother me again over this matter]. Without my knowing, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong/Archive_95&diff=prev&oldid=605943258 he edited the archived thread] two days ago and today [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong&diff=prev&oldid=606232348 sent me an identical version of the message] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong&diff=prev&oldid=602631957 that he sent me earlier in the month]. It is blatantly clear that A50000 is no longer here to work on this project collaboratively. All he has done is gotten into petty disputes on issues regarding communism and socialism and when asked to drop the stick he does not, multiple times. I don't know if this is because he is a [[WP:SPA]], it's a case of [[WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT]], he's a case of [[WP:NOTHERE]], or just a lack of [[WP:CIR|competence]]. {{u|Drmies}} previously said that he would possibly block him, but because A50000 has not been disruptive in the article space, he saw no need for it at the time.

== Legal threats and COI issues ==

* {{user links|Peter rees tv}}
[[User:Peter rees tv]] claims to be Peter Rees, the subject of [[Peter Rees (producer)]]. He has made some contentious edits to the article, as well as [[MythBusters]], that have been reverted, both as an IP and through his recently registered account but he seems to have some valid concerns. What brings me here though is the [[WP:LEGAL|legal threat]] that he made in a post at the Help Desk, where he said "''I will be forced to take legal action against those who publish this story if it is not corrected''".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&diff=prev&oldid=606736987] There are also concerns that, while he claims to be Peter Rees, he has not verified that his is indeed Peter Rees. As a new editor he is probably unaware of the various issues, although I have informed him that editing [[Peter Rees (producer)]] is a clear conflict of interest. Given the legal threat it may be prudent to block the user, at least until he has verified that he is who he claims to be. He probably also needs some guidance in other areas but after the issues at [[Heleen Mees]], I'm really not up to it. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 09:29, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:IMO, there is a more significant concern about [[WP:BLP]], and I had posted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ABiographies_of_living_persons%2FNoticeboard&diff=606742823&oldid=606724776 this] at [[WP:BLPN]]. The user who claims to be the subject has been reverted, putting back into the article this: "He left the show shortly after a dangerous electrical prank was played on a MythBusters crew member. Rees ordered the crew to connect a 100,000 volt electric fence transformer to a show prop, and then convince Adam Savage to touch the device." With this {{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAcMqWLBK8U|title=Adam Savage on His 100,000-Volt Cattle Prod Shock|work=[[FORA.tv]]|date=22 May 2010}} as the supposed source. Having seen the post at the Help desk, I've now taken it out of the article. If he is the subject we should be more forgiving of his outburst given the poor quality of the source, the seriousness of the BLP accusation and the reversions. [[User:DeCausa|DeCausa]] ([[User talk:DeCausa|talk]]) 09:49, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:Yep that's a legal threat. But [[WP:DOLT]] is still important here, and DeCausa is right that the statement sourced to the YouTube clip should be removed. If a better source presents itself, then that's another matter. It's likely that the safest way to present such a claim, since the facts are going to be disputed, would be to attribute it to whomever claims it... that is "According to X, Rees did Y". —/[[User:Mendaliv|'''M'''<small>endaliv</small>]]/<sup><small>[[User talk:Mendaliv|2¢]]</small></sup>/<sub><small>[[Special:Contributions/Mendaliv|Δ's]]</small></sub>/ 10:50, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::The issue that DeCausa mentions is no longer an issue because the claim has been quite rightly removed from the article. The previous reversions of the editor have been made for quite understandable reasons. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=603398164&oldid=591548342 These edits], as an IP, removed the original claim and replaced it with original research, both related and unrelated to the incident as well as adding a series of inappropriate claims about the hosts of MythBusters. In effect he substituted one bad claim for others. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=next&oldid=606321581 This edit] completely destroyed the article. A check through the article's history shows the same edits, probably by the same editor using different IPs, being made previously.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=365853215&oldid=356884379][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=next&oldid=545889521] Yes, [[WP:DOLT]] is relevant but it's an essay, but [[Wikipedia:No legal threats]] is a policy with legal considerations, so it has more authority than WP:DOLT.

:::The BLP issue is only not an issue now because I took out it today. When he made the legal threat, it was still there. At that point the history of the problematic BLP wording was as follows. It was introduced 23 July 2013 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=561254376&oldid=547748838], he removed it on 9 April 2014 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=603398164&oldid=591548342] in an entirely inappropriate way by adding inappropriate material. On 29 April 2014 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=606321464&oldid=604271532] it was restored at the same time as his inappropriate additions were removed. So, today, he again removed it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=606737440&oldid=606321581] but again included inappropriate additions to his removal. It was once again restored [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=606737743&oldid=606737440] at the same time as his additions were removed. He then removed it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=606738248&oldid=606737743] but this time without adding any of his additions but it it was then nevertheless restored[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Rees_%28producer%29&diff=606738372&oldid=606738248]. So on 29 April and 2 May he had seen this poorly sourced BLP issue restored three times by Wikipedia editors. Removing his additions does not excuse the reintroduction of the material that [[WP:BLP]] tells us should have been removed. Absolutely [[WP:DOLT]] applies. [[User:DeCausa|DeCausa]] ([[User talk:DeCausa|talk]]) 12:28, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::::I should say that [[WP:DOLT]] and [[WP:NLT]] are not mutually exclusive. The point is that while legal threats are not acceptable from a behavioral standpoint, when one is made, the solution is ''not'' to [[WP:RBI|revert, block, and ignore]]. The reverts are understandable insofar as the edits that were reverted did a whole lot more than just remove that one claim... but one must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. —/[[User:Mendaliv|'''M'''<small>endaliv</small>]]/<sup><small>[[User talk:Mendaliv|2¢]]</small></sup>/<sub><small>[[Special:Contributions/Mendaliv|Δ's]]</small></sub>/ 12:36, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::::Looking at the YouTube video and knowing that there is only one producer who is no longer with the series, it is unlikely that anyone but the subject is who Adam Savage was referring to, but that's not enough evidence to keep the claim in the article.

If it is the subject's representative then he should be blocked immediately, as that's a clear breach of [[Wikipedia:Username policy]] as usernames that impersonate other people are not permitted.

==Disruptive, authoritarian editor==
I am reporting an editor ([[User:Winkelvi]]) who has, over the past year, been a huge disruption to the development of a series of articles. The user refuses to work with other users and is quick to attack those who try to resolve disputes via [[Request For Comments]]. The user has used abusive language and has made editing these pages a true hassle. The user has not added any material to the pages over the past year but denies being a disruption. This user's apparent only purpose with these pages is to prevent the addition of new content and rewrite sentences, often times distorting the intended meaning of the sentences and introducing grammatical errors. Nearly all content added to the articles on [[Template:Sound of Contact]] since their creation has been subject to a veto attempt by [[User:Winkelvi]]. Even the very creation of the [[Dimensionaut]] article was argued against by [[User:Winkelvi]]. The user has dismissed [[WP:CONSENSUS]] in the past and expressed hostility towards other editors, for example here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dimensionaut#More_on_reviews]. When talks are taken to that user's talk page, the comments are swiftly deleted; i.e. here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&diff=606135390&oldid=606135096]. Every discussion we seem to have escalates into this user accusing myself or, in one case, [[User:Spanglej]], of various issues, often in the most hypocritical manner. Here is another instance of another editor speaking about [[User:Winkelvi]]'s hostility: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dimensionaut&diff=558426217&oldid=558410017]. Many discussions have been had, and there has been no resolution. The '''current''' discussion prompting this notice is: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dimensionaut#Request_For_Comment]

That entire page (in addition to my talk page, and the talk pages of the affiliated articles), meanwhile, is evidence of that user's repeated attempts to dispute and block every addition made to this article and its related articles. This user has been reported on this noticeboard twice already for similar conduct:

'''First report:''' (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring&oldid=561690390#User:Winkelvi_reported_by_User:Vuzor_.28Result:_No_action.29).

This user has only done harm to the process of developing these articles over the past year. I request a ban on this user ([[User:Winkelvi]]) from editing the articles found on [[Template:Sound of Contact]] in addition to any new affiliated articles that may be added to that template in the future, as the user appears to have an interest in preventing these articles from growing, and refuses to collaborate with others involved. The user has in the past week alone been involved in numerous incidents attempting to block content from being added:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sound_of_Contact#Using_Video_Interviews_as_Sources], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Collins#Removal_of_new_content] (a three-month process to add a paragraph of content). As someone who is undoubtedly frustrated with this and who appears to be one of the only editors working on these articles, this has made me very weary of having to face this obstacle with every revision. Every attempt to add to the construction of the page is a lengthy, difficult process involving the same editor.[[User:Vuzor|Vuzor]] ([[User talk:Vuzor|talk]]) 23:35, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*Comment: I don't have much to say in response other than Vuzor, in my assessment, simply doesn't like having his prose and content changed or challenged.  Strangely, just a few days ago he placed an apology on my talk page for past disagreements we'd had and said he appreciated my help.   He further stated he hoped there were no hard feelings between us.  Then only a few days later, we end up here and everything he said about no hard feelings is history.  It is, however, a good example of his passive-aggressive communication style with me over the last year.  So passive-aggressive that I have seriously wondered if Vuzor isn't a User Name for two people, because he can be complimentary and cooperative one minute then aggressive, angry, uncooperative and unreasonable the next.  My issues with Vuzor's editing have been that he has a tendency to overwrite content, use lofty language, and add extraneous detail and wording.  He also has consistently added content that makes articles about music, musicians, and bands read like fan sites.  After being angered that I copy edited content he added at ''[[Dimensionaut]]'', he opened an RfC at the article talk page where he promptly began to chastise me and bring up old issues from a year back where he perceives I wronged him.  The premise of the RfC he opened was supposed to be about content.  He chose to abandon that premise from the jump and, instead, began personally attacking and making the RfC about me.  Numerous times I reminded him that the RfC was about content and edits, not editors, and asked him to stop.  He refused (as evidenced by his comments there).  That RfC is still open, by the way.   Would coming here without closing the RfC be considered forum shopping?  -- <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #0099FF, -4px -4px 15px #99FF00;">[[User:Winkelvi|Winkelvi]]</span> ● <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #FF9900, -4px -4px 15px #FF0099;">[[User_talk:Winkelvi|✉]] [[Special:Contributions/Winkelvi|✓]]</span>  03:13, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

When member [[Dave Kerzner]] left the band, you removed the template from the page again; I added it back as he was clearly on the template and was important to the band's history.

::::'''Comment:''' I must note that [[User:Spanglej]], a more experienced editor than [[User:Winkelvi]] or I, oversaw the initial development of this series of articles. In the case of the article [[Dimensionaut]], administrator [[User:Boing! said Zebedee]] also oversaw the intial stages of the article. In an early incident involving the article, [[User:Winkelvi]] flagged the article for [[WP:CSD]] (speedy deletion); administrator [[User:Boing! said Zebedee]] (his user page at the time here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Boing!_said_Zebedee&oldid=549544347]) removed the flag, citing that [[User:Winkelvi]]'s criteria were not valid. [[User:Winkelvi]] undid [[User:Boing! said Zebedee]]'s revision. Administrator [[User:Boing! said Zebedee]] then told [[User:Winkelvi]]: "When a speedy deletion request has been declined, it must not be put back - go for WP:AFD if you think it needs deletion." This can be seen here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimensionaut&diff=553650500&oldid=553649885], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimensionaut&diff=553651349&oldid=553650500]. To quell this controversy, [[User:Boing! said Zebedee]] and I decided to move the page's development to my user sandbox: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimensionaut&diff=557697918&oldid=557697868]. Throughout the article's development, [[User:Boing! said Zebedee]] vetoed several of [[User:Winkelvi]]'s revisions: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimensionaut&diff=553934898&oldid=553921168], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimensionaut&diff=554228780&oldid=554228363].

{{od|::::}}Spanglej wasn't overseeing anything.  She was there just like I was, just like Vuzor was.  Boing wasn't overseeing anything, either.  He was just there like the rest of us.  As far as the speedy deletion issue, I have no idea why it's being brought up, why Vuzor thinks it has any bearing on anything.  It was a simple misunderstanding on my part regarding procedure, nothing more.  Boing didn't have an issue with it, we worked it out immediately, that was all there was to it.  And just for the record and complete disclosure: that article written by Vuzor ended up being deleted because it was about a music album by Sound of Contact that had not yet been released (the article was put up again about a month later).  Interesting how Vuzor left that out while retelling his version of the drama.  But, Vuzor is portraying it all dramatically for what purpose?  And who cares if Boing "vetoed" several of my revisions?  That's what cooperative editing is about.  There was no "supervision" or oversight occurring as Vuzor claims.  His need to re-hash stuff that's nearly a year old is puzzling to me, especially when you consider he left the following on my talk page ten days ago: "Hi, Winkelvi. I apologize for some of the past disagreements we've had, and I'd very much like to say I value your opinion and appreciate your help. Hopefully there are no hard feelings between us." found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Winkelvi&diff=604847039&oldid=604846959] -- <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #0099FF, -4px -4px 15px #99FF00;">[[User:Winkelvi|Winkelvi]]</span> ● <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #FF9900, -4px -4px 15px #FF0099;">[[User_talk:Winkelvi|✉]] [[Special:Contributions/Winkelvi|✓]]</span>  21:27, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Boing's vetoing of your revisions has everything to do with your approach to these articles. Spanglej's attempt to mediate (as cited in [250]) was met with your hostile response.

::''You have just threatened me with the three-revert rule on my talk page, Winkelvi. I count five reverts from you within the past twenty-four hours, reverting the edits of multiple editors.

Your hypocrisy and authoritarian approach continue to amaze me. If I were to revert your edit myself, I would be breaking the three-edit rule, but considering you have consciously broken that rule and almost doubled it, I am reporting this; you had the presence of mind to have that link while reverting my edits and had already broken the rule; while we could have waited for a fourth user to make a decision (after all, two users disagreeing with you isn't enough) so you wouldn't have edited a fifth time, you edited anyway, consciously challenging the rule a fifth time just moments before you had the nerve to threaten me with a hypocritical three-revert warning.

:::''I can't believe we are even having this conversation, Winkelvi. A band release an album and then immediately go on tour and you are disputing that the album and the tour are related. In no way are the details of a tour promotional puff. You'd be hard pressed to find an article about any major band or album that doesn't mention its tour. True Blue (Madonna album) (GA), I Am... Sasha Fierce (GA), Achtung Baby (FA), OK Computer (FA), Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (GA), (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (GA), Daydream (Mariah Carey album) (GA). I think you have somehow got hold of entirely the wrong end of the stick about Wikipedia editing. It's supposed to be collaborative, mutually supportive, fun and consensus-based. As the admin said on your page: " I don't see anywhere that you got consensus for this change." You wrote on my page "Edit warriors and those with battleground mentality LOVE to use the excuse: there's no consensus. That excuse is total bullshit." Consensus-based collaboration is not bullshit, the foundation of how Wikipedia works. Wikipedia:Consensus says "Consensus refers to the primary way decisions are made on Wikipedia, and it is accepted as the best method to achieve our goals". It's not a figment of my imagination.

Whatever might be done by an administrator in regard to Vuzor's year-old butt-hurt over all of this ancient history would be punitive, not preventative at this point.  Someone asked him yesterday right after he filed this report: what do you want administrators to do?  I think it's still a valid question.  Valid, because it seems clear (to me, at least) that Vuzor needs vindication, he needs me to be "punished", in spite of the message he left me 10 days ago that said he is sorry for our past disagreements, values my opinion, appreciates my help, and hopes there are no hard feelings between us.  At this point, I'm pretty much done with responding to the drama Vuzor is putting up here because none of it seems to have any point that would serve the community positively.

'''Update (1 May 2014):''' It appears [[User:Winkelvi]] removed an entire section of content on [[Simon Collins]] that was recently approved in a Request for Comment session. The edit history can be seen here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&action=history]. One of the revisions can be seen here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=606721642&oldid=606721401]. All of the content in question was approved in an RfC on that article's talk page last month (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Simon_Collins#Request_For_Comment]). This goes completely against the consensus reached in the RfC. This user even added a "citation needed" template when no such template was required. This is unacceptable behavior and could perhaps be considered vandalism at this point.[[User:Vuzor|Vuzor]] ([[User talk:Vuzor|talk]]) 04:38, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:[[User:Winkelvi]] has now reverted my reversion of that user's vandalism (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=606725535&oldid=606725088]). The comment that user has left is: ''"Reverted 2 edits by Vuzor (talk): No, the content I removed wasn't "approved" and consensus can change. (TW))"'' This is ''ridiculous'', considering the content ''was'' approved. Consensus ''has '''not''''' changed, so the excuse that "consensus can change" is complete nonsense. This has become ridiculous. I have asked in my comment that [[User:Winkelvi]] explain his or her reasoning for this, and I have warned the user not to break [[WP:3RR]]. If the user breaks this rule, I will open a case in the Edit Warring noticeboard as this appears as that would suggest a very active dispute happening. This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable.[[User:Vuzor|Vuzor]] ([[User talk:Vuzor|talk]]) 04:38, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

A "whole section of content" was not removed.  A portion of irrelevant and gossipy, tabloid-like content 
was removed.  It was not recently "approved", an editor thought it was fine months ago.  Consensus changes, and what I removed is most definitely not pertinent to Collins', but more pertinent to his father, and should not be in the Simon Collins article.  The other portions edited and taken out of the article were copyedited and removed due to irrelevance, lofty language, over-stating, and un-encyclopedic material.  Some of it was definite puffery, bordering on peacocking.  In no way are my edits to this article (or any article I edit) "vandalism". Vuzor, however, is now edit warring and has '''twice reverted every single edit wholesale''' that I made at the article over the last hour.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&oldid=606725895&diff=prev]  I have placed and edit warring warning template on his talk page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vuzor&diff=606726884&oldid=605125932]  He has reverted a total of three times at the article: (1) [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=606725006&oldid=606724466]; (2) [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=next&oldid=606725006]; (3) [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=next&oldid=606725535].  Vuzor, [[User:Atama|Atama]] stated a few days ago that I had removed a lot of promotional content from Sound of Contact, that's what I did with Simon Collins tonight, as well.  An IP user stated the same.  No one other than you has been anxious to do anything to this report over three days now.  That should send a message to you about anyone caring about this report.

::'''''"Comment.''' On a first pass view my take is that most of it should be used, perhaps reworked a bit. A good article would include items that arguably can be seen as trivial by others. Certainly items tied to his life as a music performer is relevant. The lawsuit statement should be aligned with a follow-up as to what happened with it, dismissed, settled, etc. Early life sections give readers buy in so that can understand where a notable person came from. I don't particularly care what schools someone went to but Wikipedia readers apparently do. Sportfan5000 (talk) 01:42, 17 March 2014 (UTC)''

:::'''''Comment.''' I think the following tells the story: WP:LEAD The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies. The notability of the article's subject is usually established in the first few sentences. The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources. Apart from trivial basic facts, significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article. I don't like one sentence leads, especially for an online encyclopedia. There should be a brief mention in the lead for each section in the main body of the article. Also, I recently went through a very trying ordeal because I changed the lead of a BLP to read, British-born. I was called a racist and a bigot. Go figure. Atsme ☯ talk 15:13, 29 March 2014 (UTC)''

:::[[User:Winkelvi]] has been reported here as a result of the current edit warring conflict: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring#User:Winkelvi_reported_by_User:Vuzor_.28Result:_No_violation.29].

* Here's a suggestion - how about the two of you just shut up for a bit if you want someone to actually spend some time looking at this? The longer you go on arguing between yourselves here, the more it's turning into a [[WP:TLDR|TLDR]] wall of text that fewer and fewer people are likely to even bother reading. (And before anyone asks, I don't do this kind of stuff any more so I will not be looking into it or offering any opinions) -- [[User:Boing! said Zebedee|Boing! said Zebedee]] ([[User talk:Boing! said Zebedee|talk]]) 08:37, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
* I just closed the AN3 report with no violation. It was easy, since the board is for reporting 3RR (or 1RR) violations, and per your own admission there were only 2 reverts. For [[User:Winkelvi|Winkelvi's]] benefit, your initial series of edits that removed a lot of information counts as a revert. (I don't subscribe to the "any deletion is a revert" philosophy that seems to be a recent trend, but you removed content that was very recently added by Vuzor, and [[WP:3RR]] makes it clear that doing so is a revert.) Regardless, that only makes 2 reverts by each editor. A serious edit war that needs to stop but nothing to block anyone over (and any blocking would be equally applied to both editors).

:Boing! said Zebedee was correct, you need to stop sniping at each other. This boils down to a content dispute and should be handled as such. This should be hashed out on the discussion page of the article if possible. There ''was'' an RfC, and while I see there was no formal closure (the template expired and was removed by a bot) the comments should definitely be taken into account when determining a consensus. If you can't come to a decision calmly between the two of you, you should take this to [[WP:DRN]]. I can't say, however, that any solid consensus was ever hashed out on the talk page of the article; a few editors did provide input but there was nothing actually agreed to. So I can't say that either of you is violating consensus with your actions. But you need to stop attacking each other over this. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 16:01, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::Thanks for taking the time to sew this up, [[User:Atama|Atama]].  Right away after this report was filed I knew the reporting editor was likely to go overboard and inundate the report with examples, old beefs, and walls of text.  My initial response was intended to be my only response.  That said, the more Vuzor put up that was exaggeration and over-dramatization with things uncomplimentary to him conveniently left out, the more I realized I would be forced to put up some kind of response.  This is due to having seen many noticeboard complaints and issues go horribly bad for the accused when administrators didn't look deep enough into what was being claimed to verify it's validity.  

::I have no issue working with Vuzor if he actually tries to work with me.  But, typically, his problem at the articles he works on is about not truly listening to others who have ideas or vision for articles that differ from his own.  He seems to truly hate having his lengthy and over-written, promotional prose copy edited, changed completely, or removed.  He seems to get emotionally tied to his pet articles - and every article he edits becomes a pet article.  Looking at his edit history, you can see that he almost fixates on types of articles or a particular article and its associated articles.  Everything becomes a battle with him.  He makes editing a chore rather than a cooperative effort.  There's a reason why no one comments on his RfCs and noticeboard reports.  I'll leave it to you to conclude why.  As far as the 3RR report he filed, his reverts were obviously [[WP:IDLI]] and out of anger.  Rather than just reverting content the previous RfC was about, he reverted everything I had copy edited in one sweep.  Not once, but twice.  The fact remains that what he reverted back was edit warring behavior, in spite of the decision made at the 3RR noticeboard.  Further, he wants me punished and he wants me out of his way, precisely why he immediately asked for a topic ban at the top of this report.  

::I want to work with him, but he makes it nearly impossible with his rigid interpretation of policy and guidelines in addition to his pettifogging, wikilawyering, and his refusal to understand Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a promotional tool and fan site for his favorite bands and musicians.  Not to mention his inability to allow editors he sees as flawed to change anything he has written.  Based on how he escalated each complaint about me over the last few days and keeps lists of perceived wrongs handy, I just don't see him changing or starting to work cooperatively with me at these articles anytime soon.  Because he takes removal of content or changes to content he's added personally, things will not change until he stops being emotionally connected to his edits.  Until that changes, nothing in Vuzor's editing, cooperative editing, and reverting habits will improve.  Even so, I will continue to try to work with him. -- <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #0099FF, -4px -4px 15px #99FF00;">[[User:Winkelvi|Winkelvi]]</span> ● <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #FF9900, -4px -4px 15px #FF0099;">[[User_talk:Winkelvi|✉]] [[Special:Contributions/Winkelvi|✓]]</span>  16:28, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Rigid interpretation of guidelines and policy? In fact, it's been the exact opposite. I've been willing to work with you on many occasions; as [[User:Spanglej]] noted, you have focused far too much on parts of the MOS you deem non-negotiable (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dimensionaut#Not_a_promotion_tool]): ''"I can't believe we are even having this conversation, Winkelvi... I think you have somehow got hold of entirely the wrong end of the stick about Wikipedia editing. It's supposed to be collaborative, mutually supportive, fun and consensus-based. As the admin said on your page: " I don't see anywhere that you got consensus for this change." You wrote on my page "Edit warriors and those with battleground mentality LOVE to use the excuse: there's no consensus. That excuse is total bullshit." Consensus-based collaboration is not bullshit, the foundation of how Wikipedia works. Wikipedia:Consensus says "Consensus refers to the primary way decisions are made on Wikipedia, and it is accepted as the best method to achieve our goals". It's not a figment of my imagination. Civility and respect for other editors is also one of the five pillars of the community. Span (talk) 19:16, 26 June 2013 (UTC)"''

:::Even here you lightly criticized Atama for saying something you disagreed with: ''"That's not how I read the noticeboard notification policy nor policy on canvassing, but I'll take your word for it. -- Winkelvi ● ✉ ✓ 20:14, 30 April 2014 (UTC)"''). You have cast aside any apparent desire for compromise or collaboration. Your entire spiel here is an attack on me rather than a proposed solution -- also, you have just done a bulk reversion of the [[Simon Collins]] article ''again'', which counts now as '''three''' reverts within the past '''seventeen''' hours (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=606721642&oldid=606721401], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=606725535&oldid=606725088], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=606814022&oldid=606725895]). This is the article you were reported for on the Edit Warring noticeboard earlier today. In fact, more content has been deleted now in bulk than in the original reversion seventeen hours ago. You have actually gutted the entire article at this point; your comment on the talk page insists we negotiate, but it appears we both have opposite stances on this issue. Shall we bring up another RfC or will you complain about it? At this point, there are becoming fewer and fewer solutions because of your unwillingness to reason with other editors.

:::My ''proposal'' to you is that additions be accepted initially unless the edit is clear vandalism. All of the content you have disputed has been deemed fine by others. If you feel so strongly that the content there does not belong or that it is undeniably out of place, call an RfC for its removal. If the content is not adequate enough to remain, hypothetically other editors will agree with your opinion and remove that content. Clearly, most of the content you have disputed has been deemed worthy of being kept in the articles, so unless you feel others will agree with you, it would not be worth removing. This method is founded on compromise, acceptance, fairness, and prompts editors to ask "is this really unacceptable to have on the page" before removing everything that was added. I have proposed this to you before; you have shot it down. Reconsider, as this might be the best solution we have. Preventing every addition and starting edit wars every time is absurd. The content you have disputed has, in every case, been deemed worth keeping by others. It has become a ridiculous process to continually dispute this content with you even after approval of it on RfCs. As of now, you are still edit warring over content that other users have agreed is fine to keep. If you feel the content needs to be removed, then consensus must be reached to remove it.

{{od}}No, I'm not edit warring, I'm attempting to compromise by starting a discussion on the talk page and putting back in the good edits I made on the article. Further, it was never two reversions from me to begin with, just one. The latest is only the second, and not for the sake of edit warring, but to restore the good edits I made that you reverted completely without consideration for the article. And, no, there was no "additional material" "erased" from the page as you just claimed at the 3RR noticeboard. Nothing is being sorted out at this noticeboard as you also claimed at 3RR. Other than officially closing this out, it's over with, too, just like at 3RR. A discussion has been started on the article's talk page. Please put on your big boy pants, comment at the article talk page, work toward a solution, and drop the stick, Vuzor.

:Atama and I counted two reversions before the one last hour: ''"For Winkelvi's benefit, your initial series of edits that removed a lot of information counts as a revert.

A serious edit war that needs to stop but nothing to block anyone over (and any blocking would be equally applied to both editors)... -- Atama頭 16:01, 2 May 2014 (UTC)"''. Your initial bulk removal of content I added a few days ago is a reversion, especially considering comments on the RfC supported keeping it there. Your most recent reversion (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Collins&diff=606814022&oldid=606725895] at 20:13, 2 May 2014‎) is the third reversion in a span of seventeen hours, occurring only five hours ''after'' the Edit Warring report was closed. I don't have a battleground mentality; I have proposed a solution and am waiting for a response to it. Reverting the article ''again'' while we are discussing there here is an instance of [[Wikipedia:Assume bad faith]]. Also, until we have decided on a resolution or an administrator has decided so, this discussion is not over. Unless you are expressing that you are simply unwilling to negotiate, this should be resolved. Otherwise, this time-wasting dispute over every addition will very likely never end.

That is not what Atama said.  He said you came to 3RR with a claim of two reverts and two reverts doesn't equal the three required for the 3RR noticeboard.  And there was NEVER a consensus at the article for that particular block of content.  ONE editor said to keep it, two others said not to keep it, and no acutal consensus was sought nor agreed upon.  Obviously I'm not willing to negotiate since I started a discussion at the article talk page.  This time wasting dispute is all on you.  You have wasted time and bandwidth here and at 3RR.  Stop it and go to the article talk page like Atama suggested.  I will no longer discuss this with you here, only at the article talk page like adults and cooperative editors should.  <s>As I've said to you previously: grow the fuck up.</s> -- <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #0099FF, -4px -4px 15px #99FF00;">[[User:Winkelvi|Winkelvi]]</span> ● <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #FF9900, -4px -4px 15px #FF0099;">[[User_talk:Winkelvi|✉]] [[Special:Contributions/Winkelvi|✓]]</span>  21:47, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:The quotation above begs to differ from your claim that "that is not what Atama said." Atama very clearly stated that your first wholesale deletion of material is considered a reversion. In regards to the content, two editors said to keep material, one spoke about the lead (which I suppose was a general comment on the article and not on the content disclosed in the RfC). Winkelvi, the discussion you have just opened on the talk page ties in with the fact you reverted the content again before doing so. In addition, this discussion on this page is more than just about that particular content but about your conduct and a solution to working together successfully moving forward. You do not provide answers when asked about appropriate content, you do not consider proposed solutions, and you seem very much unwilling to cooperate, negotiate and collaborate. It appears you want absolute authority to veto any additions to these pages. The reason this is on AN/I is because this dispute has been happening over the past year and has not stopped. Every addition is deleted immediately, and once in a while you'll begin to remove material in bulk from pages that had been there for a while. It very much can be considered vandalism. I have proposed a solution to make this easier for all parties going forward. If you can not consider it, we will be running out of options.

::Vuzor is correct. As it stands now, Winklevi is at 3 reverts total, the initial series of edits ([[Special:diff/606724466/605252892|these edits]]) from Winklevi were a revert because they undid (at least partially) [[Special:diff/605252892/601913153|these edits]] by Vuzor that preceded them. Both of you, just '''stop''' please. Reverting isn't needed, there is edit history that you can rely on if you want to refer to past versions of the article just use diffs, you don't need to revert article space to the old version). For example, [[Special:diff/606814022/606725895|this edit]] was totally unnecessary, and perpetuated the edit war. One more revert from either side on that article and I'm going to institute an indefinite full protection to force you to come to an agreement (and I will of course lock it onto [[m:The Wrong Version|the wrong version]] of the article.

This series of articles involving television station articles for the [[Reno, Nevada]] area has had content culled from them without explanation by a series of IPV6 addresses which seems unusually adept at jumping on another IPV6 address within moments of their last edit, doing it several times in the last few days on these articles. This makes asking why they removed content useless as they've jumped around before a talk page notice can flash up (though they have time to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:2602:306:CE9A:860:A149:B80:43A9:B69&oldid=606693012 blank Cluebot notices] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/2602:306:CE9A:860:799C:8C88:AACC:6211 several times] before jumping off).

The question for the community is whether the edit itself is justified ''irrespective'' of any agenda. This "fact" was added by an IP. Its removal is entirely justified on grounds of Undue Weight. I certainly don't think relatives or subjects of articles should have a right to remove any well sourced information they don't want to be public, but in this case it is trivial, and likely also ''added in the first place'' by an editor with an agenda. This should be discussed on the talk page. This has developed from a "tit for tat" over adding the date of birth, which was aggressively removed. As far as I can see there is no controversy about her date of birth. Overwhelmingly dates of birth are uncited in biographical articles. I can't see why it was removed without grounds for dispute. of course MdeBohun has been deleting stuff willy-nilly for not discernible reason (why should the subject's middle names have to be kept secret?) This is just the kind of aggressive deleting/readding content without looking at the context that just ''pisses off'' good faith editors and produces a toxic atmosphere on articles.

* The issue won't go away because the arguments for inclusion are policy based (albeit weak) and the arguments against, are not. As I said at DR/N, if Ms. Lipscombe now wishes she had not married the man, or dedicated a book to him, she needs to avail herself of the services of a time traveller, not Wikipedia.

**Guy, that's a red herring. More truthful is to say that it is possible to decide on including it because it is verified, but that actually including it is an editorial decision. Don't say that this is one-sided, as if the removers had "an agenda"--your comment about some marriage is the first time I hear about this, and it can actually suggest a motivation for those wanting to include it, but I won't speculate any further.

The fact of a marriage is a totally life-changing event, one we should never omit from an article without a policy-based reason. The only argument I am seeing against its inclusion is that somebody ''claiming'' to be close to the subject ''says'' she wants it out, which is both trivial and unsourced.

== 68.228.153.247 ==

{{U|68.228.153.247}} doesn't seem to understand the admonishments that have been given regularly over a number of months regarding the submission of questionable television production codes--and I'm pretty sure this isn't the only IP they've used to do so. User continues to fabricate production numbers for various cartoon series. I suspect they believe production codes should match the season number, episode number and cart number, when in fact, studios can use a variety of numbering/lettering conventions to identify a project, because it is an INTERNAL coding system, used for billing and production purposes, and that it may not match the expected airing order, what with networks routinely re-scheduling episodes per their whims. The fact that Season 1, Episode 3, cart B would not by default be designated 103b is escaping this user's comprehension. Season 1, Episode 3, cart B could be designated any number of ways, from "103b" to "335" to "BBX411105" to "Chipmunk" or whatever the case may be. There has been a very liberal reporting of official "production codes" in children's television for quite some time. Virtually none of these codes are sourced. In [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Sanjay_and_Craig_episodes&diff=606717664&oldid=606713792 this edit] the user tried to split the difference and assign arbitrarily an A and B cart to episode production numbers that were sourced. This is a patent fabrication, since individual carts can have entirely different production codes from the released episode numberings, that may not be released in any way to the public, because as I've said, it's an INTERNAL coding system.

An anonymous user with two IPs so far continues to revert the "notable people" list of [[Eureka, California]].  The most recent diff is shown on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eureka,_California&action=history Eureka, California: Difference between revisions] as are the previous edits from April 26 to the present.  The anonymous editor apparently misunderstands the "notable people" lists and thinks it's only for where someone was born.  As seen all over the project, the "notable people" are not restricted to "born in."  I would appreciate some help with this, Grant was involved with the earliest days of Eureka at Fort Humboldt prior to quitting his US Army commission before the U.S. Civil War; it's not like he just occupied a desk for a couple weeks and went home.

*Well, this is exciting. NOT. First of all, one may well discuss whether being stationed somewhere is enough to warrant a "from"--I suppose it depends on the having been stationed there possibly having been of any kind of relevance to life and career and world history. By the same token I have removed the relevant category from [[Ulysses S. Grant]] just now--it is unverified, even unmentioned in the article (given [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eureka,_California&diff=606854956&oldid=606834695 this edit summary], you should agree), and there is no argument or even mention of "Eureka" anywhere on the talk page or in the archives. Second, this is ANI. You should not think that we (ahem, any of the admins) are likely to take any kind of action over a content matter without vandalism or BLP issues involved until there is any discussion on the talk page ''at all''. I see you left a note for the IP editor (we're all "anonymous", even if you edit under your real name), but that does not suffice. You want to argue for inclusion, then argue. But not here.

::So sorry to bother you. I do agree with you that people should not be on pages where there is no mention of them having been, however the relevant material on [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]]'s service in Eureka and why that was such a seminal moment in his career is on his page: ''<small>Promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] in the summer of 1853, Grant was one of only fifty on active duty, and assigned to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at [[Fort Humboldt State Historic Park|Fort Humboldt]], on the northwest California coast.  Without explanation, he shortly afterwards resigned from the army on July 31, 1854. The commanding officer at Fort Humboldt, brevet Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert C. Buchanan]], a strict disciplinarian, received reports that Grant became intoxicated off duty while seated at the pay officer's table.  In lieu of a court-martial, Buchanan gave Grant an ultimatum to sign a drafted resignation letter.  Grant resigned; the War Department stated on his record, "Nothing stands against his good name."  Rumors, however, persisted in the regular army of Grant's intemperance. (According to biographer McFeely, historians overwhelmingly agree that his intemperance at the time was a fact, though there are no eyewitness reports extant.) Years later, Grant said, "the vice of intemperance had not a little to do with my decision to resign." Grant's father, again believing his son's only potential for success would be in the military, tried to get the Secretary of War, [[Jefferson Davis]], to rescind the resignation, to no avail.</small>''  Thus I think he should be included on notables list of Eureka, California.  It is listed in the article that he served at Fort Humboldt, and Fort Humboldt is entirely within the city limits of Eureka.

::: I am sorry I have offended Helen. I thought we had a good relation as evidence [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Trial_of_Oscar_Pistorius&diff=599150085&oldid=599126920 this interaction].
::: To set the scene here, Helen came to the [[Oscar Pistorius]] article [https://tools.wmflabs.org/usersearch/usersearch.py?name=HelenOnline&page=Oscar+Pistorius&server=enwiki&max=100 on 15 February 2014], the day after Oscar Pistorius shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp and did valuable service correcting POV edits, including numerous edits to the effect either that Pistorius had admitting murdering Steenkamp or that he shouldn't be assumed guilty of shooting her until proved otherwise. In the end she became one of the article's most prolific contributors. As for me I've been editing since November and interesting myself in the Pistorius trial article since its inception. Mostly I contribute to the visual arts.
:::My experience of Wikipedia has been mixed. Contributing to the visual arts means you are likely to run the gauntlet of Wikipedia's copyright overseers. Indeed I did and eventually I complained I felt harassed by one especially punctilious overseer. It happened that an ANI was opened at Commons about this particular editor and I contributed. One of the editor's supporters then referred to me in a post at Wikipedioacracy, a fact I discovered accidentally on a Google search regarding the editor in question. I signed in on mu Wikipedia account name and defended myself. Thus my own introduction to Wikipedioacracy. There are other Wikipedia editors, including administrators and bureaucrats, who contribute at Wikipedioacracy. It maintains the same standards as does Wikipedia regarding personal attacks. I'm not aware that I've been accused of making one there.
:::I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Trial_of_Oscar_Pistorius&diff=603937343&oldid=603920698 recused myself] from the Oscar Pistorius trial article after I could not get agreement about the merits of a particular edit and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Coat_of_Many_Colours&diff=603948544&oldid=603387012 retired my account]. I had made it clear on my Talk page for some time I intended to close the account once I had finished editing at the Pisorius trial. Equally I had made it clear there that I wasn't prepared to enter into edit wars and the like. 
:::On reflection I returned, noticing that the edit I complain of has still not been balanced. I contacted all the editors involved, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HelenOnline&diff=605727889&oldid=605509412 including Helen] setting out my position and a proposal. Helen said that she wasn't prepared to get involved any further, the other editors (including the originating editor) supported me, basically telling me to go ahead.
:::I don't know what the trigger really is for Helen's ANI here. I propose to continue as I suggested I shall(i.e. edit tomorrow evening [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Trial_of_Oscar_Pistorius&diff=605729645&oldid=605273929 along the lines suggested]). If that turns out to be unacceptable then I shall retire from editing at the article. I don't have any problem with that.
::: The "personal attack" (in Wikipedia) is an old charge. I didn't see it had any real validity at the time. Of course I've been ''uiters versigtig'' since not to give offence. I'm aware that I'm something of a bully when it comes to the written word (total wimp real life syndrome, familiar thing) and I do tread carefully because of it. Wikipediocracy however is a good laugh and I do charge in joyously there on all fives brandishing my mojo thing right left and centre up anything that comes my way.
::: As for "admitting" IP editing (is that a crime?) I do edit IP quite often by mistake.

Odd editing is going on at [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] (and [[List of Wharton School alumni]], but that seems to have slowed down.)  If you look at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania&action=history revision history], all kinds of brand new accounts are making one or two edits and then leaving.  Some of the edits are fine, some are heavy [[WP:BOOSTERISM]].  There could be [[WP:SOCK|sockpuppetry]] or [[WP:MEAT|meatpuppetry]] or a class project or something because of the editing behavior.

== [[User:Hotwiki]] ==

[[User:Hotwiki|Hotwiki]] seems to have a problem with other editors posting useful information on the articles on his Watchlist. Take ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' for example. I added information on [[Hugh Jackman]]'s guest appearance on ''[[WWE Raw]]'' as part of a cross-promotion between the film and [[WWE]]. Despite using verifiable references, my edits were reverted by Hotwiki, who claimed that they did not meet notability standards. Apparently, he is the only one who has a problem with the edits, as no other editor has made any similar complaint. Hotwiki had already violated the 3RR with his frivolous claims of non-compliance to [[MOS:Film#Marketing]], and he continues to do so.

In addition, he posted this rebuttal in response to my warning:

<blockquote>I do have a problem with your input, they are unnecessary, uninformation and doesn't meet the standards of Manual of Style for films, so please stop editing. Thank you. And for the record, I don't not own any of the articles here, I just to revert things that aren't needed and if you review my work on that article, you would know my contributions really helped that article. What did you do before that was so good?--SuperHotWiki (talk) 04:45, 2 May 2014 (UTC)</blockquote>

:Areaseven's input doesn't meet the standard of [[MOS:FILM#Marketing]]. I really don't think we should mention every single TV appearance in promoting the film. Hugh Jackman's WWE promotion is hardly notable. The critical commentary he gave was from Twitter users. Areaseven wouldn't even bring up "Twitter reaction" as his critical commentary if I didn't tell him about this Manual of Style for films. And I don't think "Twitter reaction" is enough for the said material to be kept.

{{stalker}} HotWiki's posting is borderline [[WP:PERSONAL|of a personal attack]] and not assuming [[WP:GOODFAITH|good faith]] of the user's actual edits. Telling someone to "stop editing" and asking "what did you do before that was so good" is not very welcoming to other editors. Instead of being hasty with an editor and calling their edits "unnecessary", HotWiki should've explained why their edits were reverted, and ways they could improve their editing, instead. And that would also help in avoiding the episode edit-war that was potentially taking place on the page.

* It appears to me, much to my disappointment, that the reservations I expressed when endorsing the restriction are simply justified. I honestly do not see why the both of you should not be sanctioned, if not for anything else, but as an enforced wikibreak to get your priorities straight and start figuring out a more effective way to dedicate your time in Wikipedia. Yes, sure, this editor is clearly acting foolishly by not following the very sensible advice he has been given to take a voluntary wikibreak, and instead, making the comment cited in this ANI which consists of grievances about old issues. Lack of clue is also an issue which is affecting his behaviour (which would probably warrant normal dispute resolution before running back here). However, by the same token, I also don't understand why this editor's comments are being followed or scrutinised in this similar-to-obsessive fashion with blocks being sought at every turn. And even ignoring that, if the user to whom the comment was made is in no way affected by it, do you not see how counterproductive it is to bring it back here so that it receives 10 times the amount of attention it would have otherwise received? It's exactly why I would seriously consider whether or not the Community restriction should be vacated now. It would mean you have to air your grievances in an arbcom case rather than here at every turn; ultimately one of you might be a lot better off than the other (or not) after you've exhausted each other, but at least it would mean the community could address other (more serious) issues more promptly rather than losing time checking the repeated relatively-petty complaints of this squabble. (I use the word petty in this way because if the violation in the earlier thread were as serious as suggested, the clear consensus of the uninvolved eyes would've been to block rather than issue another warning - an action which I happened to also endorse as it so happens, which frankly, says enough).

::{{replyto|MaxBrowne}} I find it disturbing that you are monitoring IHTS's user talk page. If you are going to bring up the "spirit" of the interaction ban, you should take care to follow the spirit yourself, in that you should be avoiding each other. I do understand that you are not literally violating the ban by bringing your complaint here (reporting the other party for a violation of the ban in an appropriate venue, such as this board, is explicitly allowed) but if you are going to accuse the other party of violating the spirit of the ban while not violating the letter, you should expect to be held to the same standards. I checked to make sure that there was nothing added to the IBAN aside from the standard provisions (because some interaction bans prohibit editors from following each other to pages) but there is no such restriction here. Also, I know that IHTS is heavily-involved in chess matters, so it's not unreasonable to think that he was there only because of his involvement in chess-related matters on the project. And he refrained from commenting until a third party also commented, and restricted his interactions on that page to the other person. In that situation I don't see any violation.

::But I did say that if IHTS didn't drop the stick and kept bringing up the "classic narcissist" comment he'd be blocked. I made that very unambiguous. And yet he did so again. I'm instituting a 24 hour block, because if I don't do so there may as well not even be an IBAN if nobody is enforcing it. IHTS should know exactly where the line is, because it was pointed out very clearly, and to repeat the behavior looks like an attempt to explore the boundaries of the ban. This block helps to set those boundaries. It's my hope that IHTS just moves on and stops bringing up this petty point, it's a waste of everyone's time. I'll also point out that multiple editors (including myself) have already answered his question (is the statement a personal attack) to the affirmative, so to bring it up again seems to be willful disruption.

::That being said, I'm going to try to engage personally with IHTS on his user talk page, because I think there are valid concerns from him in the midst of this, and I don't want to give the impression that he's being ignored. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 16:10, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::IBAN's are transitive now? So not only is IHTS not allowed to discuss the OP, but any editor (e.g. Bushranger) they've also got cross threaded with? <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 16:24, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::No. That is not at all what's happening. It was explained very clearly in the ANI thread previously that bringing up the comment was an indirect criticism of MaxBrowne, since the personal attack had originated from them. IHTS can complain about Bushranger, and I made sure to express to IHTS that I agree that the suggestion that the comment wasn't a personal attack was incorrect, and that suggestions otherwise were unfair. But to continue to mention the comment specifically is a violation. There was no ambiguity, it was made clear, and there were multiple people supporting that suggestion. IHTS continued to bring it up regardless. So if someone is told "do this and you will be blocked per the ban", and they do it, they are ''willfully'' violating the ban. Also, due to the unambiguity from the closure of the last thread, it is only reasonable to assume that IHTS was deliberately egging on administrators to enforce the ban to test whether or not it was actually going to be enforced. It is critical that it ''is'' enforced, otherwise the interaction ban may as well not exist. I don't know how to make it any clearer than that. -- '''[[User:Atama|<span style="color:#06F">At</span><span style="color:#03B">am</span><span style="color:#006">a</span>]]'''[[User talk:Atama|<span style="color:#000">頭</span>]] 16:41, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::It's not a matter of clarity, it's a matter of being wrong. In essence, what Atama is saying is that they individually imposed a topic ban on an editor, which is not supported by [[WP:CBAN]]. I'm not seeing any notice on IHTS's talk page nor any logging of it on [[WP:Editing restrictions]]. Arguably, IHTS had moved on from obsessing about MB to obsessing about Bushranger -- see the discussion on his (IHTS) talk and also mine. To me, by stalking IHTS's talk page MB violated the IBAN as much or more than IHTS. (Since they've both been long active on chess related articles, it's unreasonable to think one is stalking the other if both end up on the same page.) Clearly, IHTS has been on the path of self wiki destruction, and I'd hoped they'd change course before they got there, and hearing about Bushranger's incorrect "spade is a spade" endorsement of the PA over and over again ''is'' tiresome. But a bogus 24 hour block on fallacious reasoning is unlikely to improve things. If there was a block to made, it should be on the grounds of [[WP:TE]], ''not'' a flimsy synthetic topic ban out of an iban. Which means that a "reaching out followup," no matter how well intentioned isn't terribly likely to be successful. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 17:03, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::Atama's reasoning is sound, and I agree fully with it, as well as his caution to MaxBrowne of not looking for things IHTS might engage in. Any reference by IHTS to MaxBrowne's conduct, directly or indirectly, regardless of whether he is named or not, is a violation of the IBAN. If IHTS had written
:::::::''" I would like your assessment of admin Bushrangers proclamation that MaxBrowne's "classic [[narcissist]]" name-call is "not a PA"."''
::::::nobody would disagree that it would be a blatant violation of the IBAN, since it is a complaint and mention of MaxBrowne's comment and conduct. What IHTS actually did write,
:::::::''"  I would like your assessment of admin Bushrangers proclamation that "classic [[narcissist]]" name-call is "not a PA".'',

(2) Whether IHTS primarily was pursuing Bushranger or MaxBrowne is not really relevant. Obviously, he was going after Bushranger, but in so doing he made a reference to MaxBrowne's comment from several weeks ago even when he was explicitly warned not to. (3) There is no topic ban, but there is an interaction ban that was violated by continually making reference to the "narcissist" comment.

*Answering Ent (and adding it on here because, well, nowhere else is appropriate): After looking things over and consdering it, my choice of words in the original issue was admittedly quite poor. Accusing somebody of narcissism ''is'' a personal attack, however, given the situation, actions, and overall mess that was going on at the time, it was not an ''actionable'' "NPA" - it was provoked, and the editor had not previously been warned, which I should have been clearer about at the time. For my lack of clarity, I apologise, and I also apologise for allowing IHTS' goading to keep me from assessing it further and clarifying what I meant sooner.

:::Using Twinkle's rollback isn't the same as hitting "undo" though. For one, [[WP:TWINKLEABUSE]] suggests against rolling back good-faith edits without a proper edit summary. For another, clicking the "undo" button takes a couple of extra steps and forces the editor to slow down a bit and review what they're doing, so it's a bit less prone to mistakes. So I wouldn't dismiss the misuse of Twinkle as a non-issue, it can definitely be an issue and there can be good reasons to restrict its use.

*Uh, the whole point of not allowing rollback (and, by extension, certain functions of Twinkle) to be used on non-vandal edits is because they don't allow one to leave an edit summary explaining ''why'' the edits are being reverted, and so imply that the reverted edits are vandalism when they're actually not. But here, at least on [[Gan River (Jiangxi)]] and in the other diffs that GiantSnowman provides, they actually have left meaningful edit summaries via Twinkle, so I don't think the Twinkle use is actually a problem. (Actually, if we're being technical here, the one at fault for such is ''you'', GS, as you appeared to have used a tool to revert that ''didn't'' leave a meaningful edit summary.) Wanting people to take the few extra steps that it takes to go the "undo" route is nice and all, but it ain't policy. As you say, Atama, the thing says: {{tq|Anti-vandalism tools, such as Twinkle, Huggle, and rollback, should not be used to undo good-faith changes unless an appropriate edit summary is used.}} Well, all these edits had appropriate edit summaries, so I'm not seeing the misuse. Edit warring is still edit warring, of course, but in this case, I don't think there is any misuse of Twinkle aspect to it.

:::*Well, like I said, I did not - and still do not - view his edits as "good-faith", which is what I meant by "non-constructive." How can the removal of valid references for no reason really be considered anything other than vandalism? Yes, it would have been better for me to have clicked 'undo' rather than 'rollback', but my edits were to restore valid content removed without explanation (allowed by rollback!), whereas LoM's edits were not only far greater in number but also far more disruptive. Nice attempt to BOOMERANG, however. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 18:02, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*GS, I'd take it easy here if I were you. WK is not out to get you and he has a valid point. It's clear that abuse of Twinkle is a bit more difficult to pin down than rollback abuse, and really, that shouldn't be the ''real'' issue here--I pointed at a diff, above, that I find much more troubling than the abuse (alleged or not, whatever) of Twinkle. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 18:32, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
 	
:::::*Well, no, it's a fair cop: I didn't look into this as much as I should have, though I still think you (GS) were not reacting to this as ideally as you could have. LoM actually ''did'' have a reason for reverting: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gan_River_(Jiangxi)&diff=605879602&oldid=539692775 the first edit that Eldumpo made] in that series removed the foreign-language information from the lede, and this is what LoM wanted to restore, judging from his edit summary. But Twinkle being Twinkle, LoM actually reverted ''all'' of Eldumpo's edits, not just the first in the series. If this wasn't intentional, that was careless of LoM to revert without looking at what he was reverting; if it ''was'' intentional (which does seem likely), then it was disruptive of him to throw the baby out with the bathwater. So, okay, fair enough, I see where you're coming from, though your rollback-reverting is still something that I don't think is right here. Those reverts of yours were not improved by the lack of an edit summary; on the off-chance that LoM was only trying to revert one of the edits and accidentally reverted them all, a no-comment revert would not have helped them figure out what's going on.

I originally messaged [[User:GiantSnowman]] regarding concerns I had with some of Melkor's edits, in particular the removal of references, especially when it results in no cites left at the article. I think the edits made at Gan River are really poor, and were only restored after intervention, and a number of uncivil talk posts to Snowman. I am not going out of my way to remove Chinese language from intros but am adding sources to articles often without any sources, and thus any cites should be reflecting the text before it. I wouldn't have minded them being re-added as long as the cites remained. I believe there's a big difference between removing references and removing such uncited language info at the start of articles. Melkor's talk page post to me is also unhelpful.

OK, now I've found the right place, it's complaining time.

My initial gripe was with the (imho) indefensible decision not to post the [[Gerry Adams]] news on the front page (if the idea is that people are supposed to make reasoned, informed and sensible arguments). But we are well beyond taking issue with how that crazy decision came about, into 'wtf'? territory regarding the integrity of the people involved in general.

Having complained about that "no consensus" closure on [[Wikipedia talk:In the news]], it was shut down immediately by '''Rambling Man''', at the request of '''331dot'''. I complained about that at [[Talk:Main Page]], but it was swiftly removed by '''Rambling Man''' and '''331dot''', on the technicality that it was the wrong venue. When I found what I beleive is the right venue, [[Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)]], what do you know, it was shut down by '''Doktorbuk''' and '''331dot'''.

What, I hear you ask, connects '''Rambling Man''' and '''331dot''' and '''Doktorbuk'''? I'll tell you. They all apparently comment a lot on the In the News page. Now, considering that the main thrust of my original complaint was about the lack of quality, reason or indeed basic intelligence of the various comments there (including having specically mentioned a comment made by Doktorbuk about the LA clippers), it's beyond the pale that I now seem to be being harassed by the very people I'm criticising? Surely even Wikipedia has something to say about such naked self-interest?

Indeed, in irony of ironies, 331dot is now shamefacedly accusing me of harassing him! My crime? I said I would tell people in the outside world about the things that happen on Wikipedia, using hiM as the poster boy example of the sort of dysfunctional things that happen here

Other miscellaneous complaints:

* 331dot's attempted closure of a section criticising ''his own behavour'' - something he has now elevated into a "Notice of Edit warring noticeboard discussion"
* Rambling Man and 331dot's failure to tell me where the correct venue was to take this issue further (for obvious reasons)
* Rambling Man's failure to tell me about this place, even after I asked him directly where I could complain about him (for obvious reasons)
* Rambling Man's quite ridiculous threats to block me for telling 331dot about the poster boy thing
* The various accusations/insinations by people (including someone claiming to be a teacher no less) that I am a 'smelly sock', from people who apparently don't have enough evidence to do anything more about that, except call me names, perhaps in an attempt to make me cry, or some other lame reason - it all seems designed to make me go away, so they don't have to respond to my legitimate complains about how the rejetion of the Adams story came about

So, I guess my question is, is this evident circling of the wagons and refusal to answer even the most basic criticism of their process, unique to 'In the News', or is it just normal - is this just how criticism is dealt with by everybody at Wikipedia?

:I'm glad you brought yourself to ANI, Lokie, because if not, I would have. This user has been tendentiously editing, posting long blocks of aggressively worded and angry comments in response to those arguing against his rationale for posting the "Gerry Adams" nomination topic for ITN. The closures of said threads in the various venues in which he brought them to were not because his arguments were going unheard, but because the discussions were getting long-winded, disruptive, and borderlining on personal attacks. Yet he continues to insist that Wikipedia is engaging in a grand whitewashing, to the point where he has accused it of being a "cult". I don't think that his behavior amounts to a long-term block, but he must be reminded that Wikipedia is a collaborative environment, and this sort of battleground behavior does not foster collaboration. --[[User:WaltCip|WaltCip]] ([[User talk:WaltCip|talk]]) 16:53, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::That's a nice theory. OK then, if you redraft my original complaint without the bits that are supposedly "long-winded, disruptive, and borderlining on personal attacks", we'll test if it's a good one - we'll see if Rambling Man allows it to be reposted on the page. After all, he seemed confident nobody would be remotely interested in it, so if nobody replies, that will be that, and I will have my answer. I only started this "crusade" as some people are so stupidly calling it, after he shut that original complaint down.

Welcome to the [[WP:FORUMSHOP|forum]]!  As I said, sorry it didn't work out for you, better luck next time, like if Adams gets charged or convicted.  Otherwise this is business as usual and doesn't warrant the tens of KB of Tl;dr being issued across multiple Wikipedia pages.  [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 17:46, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:LOL. Yes, Rambling Man 'welcomes the forum'. That's why this is about the 5th time he has tried to deflect attention away from his role with this 'nothing to see here' act. And I don't know why he keeps trying to portray this as merely sour grapes on my part, but as he's done it yet again, I'll just repeat, yet again, that my complaint goes well beyond that, for me (as if he remotely cares). Anyone who wants the full details of why I think that decision should be considered well beyond 'business as usual' (unless it's just to be accepted that 'In the News' is just a forum for people to talk absolute made up crap, as Rambling Man himself has done quite frequently), then they need only read the section at [[Wikipedia talk:In the news]], which he shut down. Anyone who wants to know why I am annoyed at what has happened since then, only needs to read above. He has absolutely no need to keep trying to mislead others about what happened, or deflect attention away from my accounts, unless of course he has some reason to think that would be to his advantage. Like maybe, people not realising that apparently he seems to quite like getting to decide for himself what is and is not newsworthy enough for the front page, whether it is or isn't news in the real world (part of which of couse is the unfettered ability to shut down complaints when they occur), and he doesn't really want to be put to the trouble of actually explaining why he comes out with such utter stupdity as he goes about giving that opinion, like the recent claim that because the news of the arrest has finally dropped down the page after three days, this shows it wasn't news anyway, not for an international site like Wikipedia anyway. I mean really - either he has some kind of brain injury to think that makes any sense to anyone else but him, or he is showing everyone else at Wikipedia such a massive amount of disrespect by thinking they are just so stupid that they are going to just accept such obvious nonsense as fact, and incorporate it into a calculation of 'consensus' (which sadly appears to be the case with Adams). Either way, he's not anything like what you would expect the average Wikipedia insider to be, but that's just my opinion as an outsider. Maybe from inside the asylum, perhaps he's admired for these special abilities. [[User:Lokie Dokie|Lokie Dokie]] ([[User talk:Lokie Dokie|talk]]) 19:08, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

I don't have a dog in this fight, and I'll give you my thoughts. Firstly, I'm going to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] that since you're new, you didn't know the most effective way of getting your complaint heard, and therefore I'm going to treat the claims of [[WP:FORUMSHOP|forum shopping]] as excusable and understandable. Now, for the actual ''content'' in question, the point that appears to have been made repeatedly by numerous people is this - '''Wikipedia is not a tabloid newspaper'''. We have a very strict [[WP:BLP|biography of living persons policy]], and in particular, [[WP:BLPCRIME|we treat everyone as innocent until proven guilty]]. I'm sure [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] and the [[Daily Mail]] can't wait to trip over this story, just like they couldn't wait to scream from the rooftops that [[Rolf Harris]] was a kiddie fiddler ''par excellence'' .... but just because ''they'' do it, doesn't mean ''we'' do it as well. As was said in the initial debate, ''if'' Adams is charged or convicted, we can revisit the story then. Like the Rambling Man said, people looked at your proposal, suggested it erred too much into violating our enforced BLP policy, and said "sorry, not suitable". It's an old cliche, but I can now strongly advise you to [[WP:STICK|drop the stick and back slowly away from the horse carcass]], as you're not going to get the result you want.

:You may not have a dog in the fight, but you didn't bring anything like a decent point to this table. It's an old cliche, but why don't you get your head out your ass and actually read the policy you think you're enforcing? As someone had already pointed out in that original discussion, BLPCRIME has absolutely nothing to do with this. Is Adams relatively unknown? No. Has the news of the arrest been ommitted from his Wikipedia biography pending conviction? No. Was there any doubt that he has been arrested in connection with a murder? No. So there we are - that's the entire paragraph of BLPCRIME, and not a single part of it remotely supports the idea that this news shouldn't have been reported on the front page. As for trying to claim that the TV and press coverage this news has got the last three days has been tabloid in nature - what an utterly disgraceful thing to say. It cannot be right that people can get away with telling such blatant lies about what's been happening in the real world, outside of the bubble of unreality you seem to want Wikipedia to exist in. This has been the headline story on the BBC TV news, and in every major reputable newspaper. You and Rambling Man and whoever else might wish it wasn't, but you need to open your eyes. The rest of the world is reporting the facts, only Wikipedia is trying to pretend that readers are so stupid that if they did so, they would interpret the headline 'Adams arrested in connection with a murder', as 'Adams is a murderer'. Anyone opposing this on that basis isn't enforcing any policy that I can see. Unsuprisingly, nobody can prove otherwise either, all they can do is keep screaming with incresing intensity, that it's a 'violation'. Hardly the sign of a convincing argument. Not even really an argument, it's just shouting really. And if innocent until proven guilty really was the reason for all this hysterical screaming about 'violations', then it really beggars belief that you could even think there is any material difference to Wikipedia putting on its front page 'Adams arrested in connection with murder' and 'Adams charged with murder' - in both of those cases, in the eyes of the law, he's still actually innocent. Are you really so clueless not to even realise that? It seems so, given everything else. [[User:Lokie Dokie|Lokie Dokie]] ([[User talk:Lokie Dokie|talk]]) 19:08, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

Let's put it this way, if 5 people had been saying it wasn't even in the news (a total lie), and 5 people were saying it should be posted because it was notable, if someone then had the stupiditiy to close that as "no consensus" - you wouldn't then be ignoring the obvious flaws in that judgement, and you certainly wouldn't be shutting down the inevitable subsequent complaints. But yet, you are doing it here. Why? What is there to gain for Wikipedia by rewarding people for lying or misrepresenting policy/reality? Because if you remove the lies and halftruths from the opposition case, you don't have much left to counter the people pointing out the obvious, that this was a notable news event - and Rambling Man/331dot/DoktorB's attempts to prevent that complaint getting an airing are why we are here, no matter how many times Ramlbing Man tries to deceive people into thinking that's not the case at all.

First off, I don't know if I'm in the right place. This person appears to be engaging in [[WP:IDHT|broken-record behavior]] after repeated warnings (below) about editing movie-related articles rather oddly. They won't respond as to why they're doing this, and don't seem to be improving the articles very much.

{{IPVandal|50.47.235.82}}<!--No offense. That's the name of the template-->

The IP listed above keeps changing the dates for movies and removing large chunks of film-related articles and templates.<br />
The sort of thing like changing "[[Belle (2013 film)]], a 2013 film" to "[[Belle (2013 film)]], a 2014 film". [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belle&diff=prev&oldid=606958160]<br />
While I tried to assume good faith and think perhaps the movies were ''made'' one year and released another, it really doesn't all add up. Characteristically, this user will increment the year of a film or movie by one with no explanation. It's sometimes more subtle, such as replacing 2011 with 2012; [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kristen_Wiig&diff=prev&oldid=606860542] even though the film's article says in the first sentence "...a 2011 [film]..."

This isn't once or twice, but a couple dozen times or so. The most recent diffs, date-related: [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Baruchel&diff=prev&oldid=606860031][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Jonathan_Glazer&diff=prev&oldid=602793868][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Richard_Shepard&diff=prev&oldid=602793421][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:James_McTeigue&diff=prev&oldid=602181924][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:The_Wachowskis&diff=prev&oldid=602182019][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Michael_and_Peter_Spierig&diff=prev&oldid=601466213]

Similarly, this user blanks out sections of articles without edit summaries or any hint as to why information should be removed. Why blank out a few related paragraphs concerning awards, special viewings, or accolades, as most recently done [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amma_Asante&diff=prev&oldid=606959003 here]? I really don't get it.<br />
Some more I grabbed: [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Focus_Features&diff=prev&oldid=606847468][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Summit_Entertainment&diff=prev&oldid=603813089][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Punisher_in_film&diff=prev&oldid=603702532][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Donald_Sutherland&diff=prev&oldid=603553371][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inside_Man&diff=prev&oldid=603098387][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sullivan_%26_Son&diff=prev&oldid=602958854][//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dallas_(2012_TV_series)&diff=prev&oldid=602957975]

After warning about blanking [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:50.47.235.82&diff=prev&oldid=602819063]/error-insertion [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:50.47.235.82&diff=prev&oldid=603371862], trying to get across to them in other ways with [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:50.47.235.82&diff=prev&oldid=603507794 a relevant welcome message], [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:50.47.235.82&diff=prev&oldid=603653203 a warning template] and [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:50.47.235.82&diff=prev&oldid=603794292 a personalized note on why edit summaries are necessary], they still don't seem to get it. I can't seem to communicate that what they're doing is probably unhelpful to the articles and templates in question. What do I do now?<br />
...Or, to turn this around... are they making sense, but I fail to see the pattern to what they're doing? Perhaps trimming movie articles they find to be off-topic or inexact, perhaps? I can't really call myself a movie fanatic here. [[User:Meteor sandwich yum|Meteor_sandwich_yum]] ([[User talk:Meteor sandwich yum|talk]]) 23:05, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

Are you talking about the deleted page history? <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 22:08, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:::{{ec}}I created the [[NSA ANT catalog]] article.  I don't recall that any substantial amount of content of the RAGEMASTER article was actually merged into the target article. An admin can check the deleted article to verify this. It also seems that [[WP:NOATT]] might apply.- [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]]
::::I think confusion here is understandable. The article was deleted with the rationale that "The content has been merged to NSA ANT catalog", as the ''request'' was made as "<nowiki>{{db-g6|rationale=The content has been merged to [[NSA ANT catalog]]}}</nowiki>". If it were true that "the content has been merged", then we would be violating the copyright of the contributors to <s>[[PAGEMASTER]]</s>[[RAGEMASTER]]. The question is whether the ''content'' was actually merged or the ''information'' was merged. Since information has no copyright, there's no copyright issue in merging ''that'' without attribution. I've compared the article in history and the new article and I don't see any obvious similarity. I think that [[user: MrX]] is probably remembering correctly that no substantial content was copied. [[User:Elvey]], do you believe that actual creative content was merged? If I may have overlooked something, we can always restore the history for a check. It's not like it's a BLP vio or anything. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 22:27, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::PS I don't see how what I wrote could be so confusing to folks familiar with our policies.  Is the confusion due to too little clue and patience among admins regarding copyright?  Or is my writing far, far less clear than I think it is?  I see so many admin copyright mistakes (like the nonsense posts insisting that I violated the copyright on my own work - even after I made it abundantly clear and obvious beyond a shadow of a doubt that I had merely copied my own original comments <!--(that is, my own work, the copyrights of which I, like most any user, retain ownership even when licensd by the act of submitting it to Wikipedia)--> from one part of the wiki to another) that the evidence is strong for the former . --[[User:Elvey|Elvey]] ([[User talk:Elvey|talk]]) 23:31, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::I've restored the history. Whether there's creative content or not, it's clear that what this is not at this point is "uncontroversial", and, again, it's not like it's a BLP or anything. The will of the AFD is still enacted by the merge. I'm afraid I don't have time to look further for creative content - it's been a busy weekend. :/ If there's anything that needs attribution, we should note it in edit summary at the new article. If not, it should be fine. I think part of the confusion here is the mixing of terms - "merge" and "histmerge" are very different things. With a "histmerge", obviously, there's no history ''left'' at the former article. :) The two are melded together.

::Thanks for that. As a reminder to editors like Elvey and others, undeleting the history is actually only part of the solution to any possible copyvio problems. The contribution history of the article where content was copied to should reflect the fact that content was copied. Otherwise the contribution history of the article content was copied from is somewhat useless as no one checking the article where content was copied to is going to know to check it to find the other contributors of CC-BY-SA+GFDL copyrighted content.

:(Previous section title: ''Move edit warring the metals'' <span id="Move edit warring the metals">)<br>
Trouble in [[WP:ELEMENTS]] paradise. Otherwise respected editor {{U|Nergaal}} started moving article page [[Other metal]] to [[Post-transition metal]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metals_other_than_the_alkali,_alkaline-earth,_lanthanide,_actinide_and_transition_metals&diff=606744860&oldid=606472441]. After initial talk [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nergaal&diff=606793053&oldid=606637019] at [[User_talk:Nergaal#Post-transition_metals|user talk]] by me, it was reverted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Metals_other_than_the_alkali,_alkaline-earth,_lanthanide,_actinide_and_transition_metals&diff=prev&oldid=606845265] by another editor.
Only then at [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Elements#Today.27s_singular_Other_metal.2FPost-transition_metal_move|WT:ELEM]] Nergaal started a discussion (OK in itself), but the moves continued back and forth and into a 3rd title. This is disruptive.<br>
I state that this is counter to earlier discussion outcomes (so should be re-discussed first), and that it is disruptive. For example, the [[periodic table]] articles do not correspond any more.
:I '''request:''' Please restate the prior situation, until discussion at [[WT:ELEM]] concludes:
:#[[Other metal]] has the content
:#[[Other metal]] get anti-move protection as deemed appropriate
:#{{U|Nergaal}} is restricted by words or by bits to stop this warring.

===Something else, but not so much===
{{U|DePiep}} insists on leaving little "unacceptable" messages on Nergaal's talk page, right under my message about my unblocking Nergaal. I consider this in really poor taste, since DePiep seems to have taken great delight in Nergaal's block, even proposing here that 48 hours was "barely enough to restore the damage". In other words, in my opinion DePiep should stay away from that talk page, and is engaging in a kind of gavedancing. If they wish to take issue with my unblock they can do so on ANI; they should not do so there. In addition, they reverted my revert, saying an admin should know better; I think DePiep does not have much of a working knowledge of what admins are charged with (see above also), and I'm getting a bit tired of their bickering. I would like your assistance in keeping them off that talk page. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 02:30, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:Also the user is being very hostile at [[WT:ELEM]] and is not assuming good faith at all, constantly attacking other users.

:It is not the role of admins to censor discussion on Wikipedia, and, unless, Nergaal has specificially asked DePiep to stay off the page, it's hard to see justification for reverting a single word opinion of an unblock. As a practical matter, it just turns a comment and ''one'' talk page notification into ''four.'' As far as factors that may influence Nergaal's future contributions to Wikipedia, I'd suggest the community focus on ''his'' words [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANergaal&diff=607051779&oldid=607042149]. <small>[[User talk:NE Ent|NE Ent]]</small> 10:07, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

Could we have another editor slip in here and help me deal with a rather fiery IP editor? {{IPuser|71.239.82.39}} to be precise. I removed huge blocks of unsourced BLP text from [[Nazanin Afshin-Jam]] and he is simply not having it on the talk page. Help would be appreciated, thanks. [[User:My name is not dave|<sup><font color="#009933">My</font></sup><font color="4000FF"><small>name</small></font><sup><font color="#009933">is</font></sup><font color="4000FF"><small>not</small></font><sup><font color="#009933">dave</font></sup>]] <small>([[User talk:My name is not dave|talk]]/[[Special:Contributions/My name is not dave|contribs]])</small> 16:59, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

:Clearly, Mr "not dave" is trying to begin a political battle; I am not.  The facts of the matter are as follow.  I went to a "celebrity" article, after editing at a serious article, where I have scholarly interest. That first article is [[Nazanin Fatehi]].  The celebrity article referred to in this first article was the further BLP text from [[Nazanin Afshin-Jam]], ''which I found in a mess.''

:I did the following, ''in each case, writing a talk section before making the changes'':
:*updated information on MacKay's current position in government
:*created the "Early life" section (so birth and immigration content did not appear solely in the lede)
:*moved citations from the lede to appropriate places in the main body
:*created a full citation for the Two Nazanins book (and added initial book review-type content)
:*tagged three references inline as poor sources, and
:*added some section and inline tags in the opening sections, to call attention to the direction this article needs to move.
:I also noted that the key biographical detail—before today's work, 9 of 29 references, or >30% of sourcing, were from non-objective sources (i.e., non-independent, where the article subject supplied information to the website; see National Speaker Bureau and Halifax webpages). The citations/sourcing are therefore—for these and further reasons (much unreferenced factual content, bare URL and other footnote format issues, etc.)—substantially deficient. A multiple issues tag was therefore set.

:ALL OF THESE INTENDED EDITS APPEARED IN TALK, BEFORE I ACTUALLY MADE THEM.  

:Mr "not dave" reverted a substantial portion of these changes, ''without any prior discussion at the article's Talk page''. It is for that reason, and for his re-reversion, that the discussion became heated.

:His perspective is that since some material in this article is unsourced it must be immediately removed—'''''note, all of the unsourced material was already there when I began my edits, and had been for years'''''.  I only moved the material around, and added tags calling for new / better citations.  Rather than deleting these, '''''and with them, some information that did have citations, as "not dave" did''''', I took a softer line, per the added opening two section tags: I was asking previous editors to mitigate the situation, and add or improve references as needed.  (Note, all uncited material appearing is positive, and, per the appearing tag, none appears to be libelous, and therefore demanding immediate attention.

:Bottom line, "not dave" rushed to judgement.  '''''Now Neil has done the same'''''.  PLEASE, CONSIDER CAREFULLY, BEFORE TAKING SIDES, OR SIMPLY ADDING TO THIS CHILDISH REVERSION STRING.  

:Finally, it does not matter that I was originally editing IP.  This is unacceptable stereotyping/prejudice, and against WP.  Le Prof  [[User:Leprof 7272|Leprof 7272]] ([[User talk:Leprof 7272|talk]]) 17:33, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Here, in the remaining edits (adding tags), I am calling on them to be consistent.  ''If all unsourced material needs to be removed, remove it all.''  I do not agree with this; I am merely asking this clique of editors to be consistent in the position they have laid out, and enforced together.

:::Finally, note, "He's back" violates a host of WP, beginning with presuming lack of good faith (which I have clearly laid out above).

== Disruptive, authoritarian editor in Snake articles ==

I am reporting the editor [[User:DendroNaja|<span style="background: #000000; font-family:Courier New; font-size: 10pt; color: White">Dendro†Naja</span>]][[User Talk:DendroNaja |<span style="font-family:Courier New; color: #000000;"><sup>Talk to me!</sup></span>]]. The editor has taken over the [[Black mamba]] article, and it has been tedious work to fix erroneous data he added which has been shown to be added by him not in good faith, and one addition which is fabrication of scientific data. Further more he has deleted scientific consensus material from two other articles [[snakebite]], [[Venomous snake]], in order to hide his fraudulent editing in the black mamba article.

He seems to mostly cite from books, thinking nobody will check up on him and then quickly nominates his articles for GA without the reviewer knowing the manipulation of data. gaming the system to lock the articles etc. all in pretense of being an expert.

Basically he's motivation is to make his favorite snake appear more venomous by a huge margin 0.05-0.30. venomous snakes toxicity is commonly compared through subcutaneous injection testing of mice, representing a real bite (as seen in his deletion of the venom list in the two other articles - since his snake is not quoted due to lack of venom potency).

It all started here [[Talk:Black_mamba#Black_mamba_LD50_quote_is_incorrect]]. he defended his source quotation by false arguments, in which finally i was able to show directly from his own source that he fraudulently attributed to their quotation.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/79.178.6.4|79.178.6.4]] ([[User talk:79.178.6.4|talk]]) 16:35, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

* Fabrication of scientific data on the black mamba article [[Talk:Black_mamba#The_hypothetical_debate_is_over]]

I am opening this Incident request now , because the editor constantly present himself as "Academic" "an expert" etc. and he in not only misrepresenting citation he is fabricating information into them. i find it severely troublesome.

If you find this Incident case to be true, my practical suggestion is to put back the data in the two other articles

* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Snakebite&oldid=604598339

===The Real Issue Here===
*:Let's start with this IP editor's history. Admin [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] wanted to block the above IP editor for a wide range of Wikipedia policy and guideline violations. He almost entirely plagiarized the [[Inland taipan]] article. It wasn't "close paraphrasing", but outright plagiarism. Guess who figured that out? I did. Immediately afterwards, this IP editor began a full on assault on my credibility, my integrity, and I would even say he is somewhat obsessed with me due to a deep resentment and bitter feelings because I happened to discover his plagiarism, his complete disregard for any Wikipedia policies as evidenced by his continuous violations of said policies. He has attacked me personally, calling me a "charlatan" and accusing me of "fabricating data". This is a quote regarding this IP user and his recurrent issues with regard to Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Just the other day, he violated the 3RR rule several times in a single day. His problems are ongoing and aren't going to stop because it is not borne out of concern for any articles integrity or factuality, but his bitter resentment of me and his desire to destroy my work or antagonize me because he perceives me as a hostile person (projective identification) because I found out all the problems he had caused in the inland taipan article, so he is trying to do the same to the article in which I put in most, if not all the work in. That is what it really boils down to, folks. I am trying to be civil, I have even altered the black mamba article in order to compromise, but this has gone in vain as he continues his assault on my person and the article. I have listed the most known LD<sub>50</sub> values for the black mamba, which is in line with the [[WP:NPOV|neutrality]] policy (represents viewpoint fairly and without bias, giving due weight to each). I have done that by giving different examples of toxicity (values in the article are from Minton, Spawls & Branch, Ernst & Zug, Brown, and Australian Venom and Toxin Database). The IP user prefers to use only ''HIS'' preferences, but that is not appropriate for such an article.

Not to sound arrogant or patronizing, but this IP user (who is confirmed by an admin to use several IP addresses, and likely has an account on Wikipedia) is definitely an amateur because he shows a gross lack of the very basic concepts and knowledge of snake venom, venom variability, toxinology, venom composition (and the interactions between these components that can make a venom which, for example, tests as a 4 mg/kg (LD50) on mice, be particularly deadly to humans causing severe envenomation), scientific methodology, limitations to research studies, and other important scientific concepts. I happen to have studied herpetology, more specifically, ophiology at a university level. I'm also a Medical laboratory technologist. So this entire issue is due to one single issue which he seems to be obsessed with and that is '''LD<sub>50</sub> ratings of venomous snakes'''. This is what its about at the end. This should be of least concern to anyone who has a real interest in science, biology, and herpetology. Debates about which snake is more toxic should be left for kids, or those who lack real scientific curiousity for more pressing and important issues related to snakes and snake venoms. This is a non-issue. Why? Here's why:

*:Lists of top ten venomous snakes don't belong in ANY encyclopedia, including Wikipedia. These kinds of lists belong maybe in a children's book. Venom composition is not static. Even within a single individual, it will vary in quantity and relative proportions of components over time. Greater variability in components is seen between individuals of a species, greater still between species. Further, venom continues to evolve, often very rapidly, so there may be wide variations in venom composition and toxicity within a single species, over its geographic range. This is especially true for widely distributed species and may cause problems in antivenom effectiveness. Factors involved in the variation of venom and its toxicity include diet/habit variability, seasonal changes, geographical location, age-dependent variability, gender-dependent/sexual variability, altitude, and the list goes on. Then you've got the research methods used. This can be critical, as some snakes produce many venom components, but eject them sequentially, rather than as a uniform mixture. The immediate fate of the venom after collection is important, particularly in relation to environmental conditions that might denature certain components. The storage of the venom is also vital, and exposure to heat may cause damage to certain toxins. Prolonged storage in liquid form may damage others. Pooled venom may introduce many variabilities, because each pooled batch of venom will contain venom from different specimens, compounding both intra-individual and intra-specific variability. There are many potential variables in such research that may affect comparability and interpretation of results. The choice of test animal may be crucial, because each species may respond differently (including humans). The choice of route is also critical. The standard test of toxicity is the LD<sub>50</sub>. Mice are most commonly used. The LD<sub>50</sub> remains the most universal standard for determining and comparing toxicity of venoms. As an example, the rough scaled snake (''Tropidechis carinatus'') has a much less potent venom than the tiger snake (''Notechis scutatus''), on LD<sub>50</sub> testing in mice. Yet clinically, the two venoms are virtually identical in the type and severity of effects on envenomed humans. There are many examples just like this across all species. The black mamba is not the most venomous snake species in the world, but it untreated human moratality rates are 100% and produces death in the most rapid time. To compare, the many-banded krait has a more potent venom on mice, but doesn't produce the same devastating effects on humans the way the black mamba does. Many more examples are readily available. Mice aren't humans. Yes, they may give us an idea on toxicity, but they aren't the same as humans.--[[User:DendroNaja|<span style="background: #000000; font-family:Courier New; font-size: 10pt; color: White">Dendro†Naja</span>]][[User Talk:DendroNaja |<span style="font-family:Courier New; color: #000000;"><sup>Talk to me!</sup></span>]] 19:43, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:::I am glad he brought up the [[inland taipan]] article. that was his first attempt in deleting scientific consensus information in order to elevate his favorite snake - the black mamba.
:::What's more cynical, is he copied my style article writing in many places (sections, lead etc) in the black mamba, after complaining about my style.
:::He tried his best, even [[Talk:Inland_taipan#Murine_LD50_issue_and_the_.2230-45_minutes.22_from_bite_to_death|quoting a study]] showing that the black mamba venom was more toxic to monkeys then the inland taipans in a study. Not knowing that the inland taipan was discovered in australia only one year before the study publication and was not availabale to the scientific community. yet another "show of expertise" by him and misrepresenting citations. As usual only after tedious arguments he conceded to the fact , and [[Talk:Black_mamba#Unsubstantiated_information_in_article|erased that fact]] from the black mamba article.
:::I was a new editor to wikipedia when i edited the inland taipan article, and thought that citing pasages from sources with references doesn't conflict with copyright. it was a good faith mistake. But this was his way of gaming the system to kill that article which was in his way for his POV pushing in the black mamba article. Most of the information is back on the inland taipan article without making copyright violations, using multiple non conflicting scientific consensus references.
:::User:DendroNaja loves his original research POV to the point of deleting the mainstream published scientific consensus in other articles, and shamefully fabricating and misrepresenting his own citations.

:::Regarding the venom toxicity list. there were two lists originally in the snakebite article. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Snakebite&oldid=589136661#Cause
:::He had no problem with them not being "encyclopedic and for kids", he just killed one list that didn't list the black mamba, and he was itching to declare the black mamba "the fourth most venomous snake in the world" in his lead. So under the pretense of "more accurate citation is done via Saline with Bovine serum Albumin, and not saline alone".  he left the other list to stay.
:::The list he was pushing to stay was found out to be not representing the citation and had nothing to do with Bovine serum albomin (surprise surprise) "First of all the list posted in the article is not the list published in the book. This is the list in the book, you can verify it in google books (see the first 3)." quote [[Talk:Snakebite#Most_venomous_snakes_of_the_world_list_-_Ernst_and_Zug_.281996.29._Snakes_in_Question:_-_Totally_not_reliable|taken from the talk page]]
:::So a new list was made citing both modes from reliable sources (saline, and saline with Bovine serum albumin) https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Snakebite&oldid=604598339#Most_venomous which non of them cite the black mamba in their top venomous snakes (for good reason).
:::As usual when he gets caught with misrepresenting citations, he changes his strategy. now suddenly putting venom lists "are for kids". though the final expanded list is sourced from '''lists''' published in peer review articles and academia (references 56,57,58).
:::Hypocritically, at the time he used this "kids play" in the black mamba article "Based on extensive and most comprehensive toxinological study conducted the toxicities of snake venoms by Ernst & Zug et al (1996), the black mamba is the fourth-most-venomous snake species in the world" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_mamba&diff=606120034&oldid=605989489

:::Other editors have agreed and commented as well. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Black_mamba#GAR)
:::User:DendroNaja Modus operandi is this : He bombards with what looks like a very knowledgeable and scholarly text. Here a fine example from that section, responding to one of the editors:
:::{{quotation|Now to the toxicity/LD50 issue: the black mamba is the 4th most venomous snake species in the world based on the study by Ernst & Zug (1996). That is unquestionable. The toxicity ratings obtained from this study/experiment is considered to be the most important toxicity study on snake venom in the world. This is due to several factors: first, the data that was obtained was based on snake venom that was collected from hundreds of specimens from some species, while for other other species, venom was collected from thousands of specimens from all different regions of a species' geographic range (which was the case for the black mamba - 1,200+ specimens of wild caught black mambas from all localities had their venom extracted). Zug et al. also used Fraction V (bovine serum albumin). This method is known to produce the highest purity precipitate, usually in the range of 98-99%. This precipitate is the dried venom which is then used to determine toxicity. Basically, this means the most accurate toxicity rating is obtained due to the purity of the precipitate. The study conducted by Ernst & Zug was extensive, costly and the scientific methods used had been proven to produce toxicity ratings that were consistent and although variation was still observed (as expected, it was insignificant). They were meticulous and the study is considered to be nearly flawless within the herpetological community. All other methods of determining snake venom toxicity always result in wildly varying toxicities, which is/was never the case with the 1996 study. In addittion, venom is usually collected from only a handful of specimens from each species (usually such experiments will study the toxicity of a very limited number of snake species, unlike the 1996 study). Up until now, there has been no single study that has been as large in scale as the 1996 study.}}
::Except for the fact that Ernst & Zug listed the black mamba fourth on their list - '''the entire paragraph is completely fabricated. he literally made up EVERYTHING else regarding that list'''.
::It took me some time, but i found Ernst & Zug note regarding their venom list, in their own book. On the columb heading LD50 they have a small star.
::This star leads to their note regarding the list (page 120)  "also, the LD50 values are mixed data, derivd from different studies using different sites of venom injection (intermascular, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous)". http://books.google.co.il/books?ei=iidDU6TqKqKv4AT_wIDQBg&hl=iw&id=TuY5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Snakes+in+question%3A+the+Smithsonian+answer+book&focus=searchwithinvolume&nfpr=1&q=Subcutaneous
::Do you get it? Ernst & Zug simply collected info from other studies, and they mixed up all the data which makes it un-citable regarding mode of injection, and if it is Saline alone or saline + Bovine Serum Albumin. Ernt & Zug book "Snakes in Question:the Smithsonian answer Book" is a popular science book: "New titles for a popular audience from SP/SP included  Snakes in Question and Bats in Question, part of the Smithsonian  Answer Book series. These inviting, easy-to-read books, written  by Smithsonian experts, satisfy the curiosity of both adults and children." http://archive.org/stream/annalsofsmithson1997smit/annalsofsmithson1997smit_djvu.txt .

Both editors may have a bias. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Black_mamba&diff=600531759&oldid=600531460] is an exaggerated claim of consensus by IP79* for either edit to the lead [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_mamba&diff=600548232&oldid=600546942] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_mamba&diff=600262070&oldid=600084634], and this is the discussion of that section [[Talk:Black mamba#GAR]]. Some edits by IP79* seemed drastic causing alarm, but after examination many of the edits were agreed upon. Still, the specific edits to the lead, which were difficult to follow the changes, were not agreed upon, by the claim of consensus. I think both editors are capable of contributing, but the IP should be more diplomatic and introduce changes (as to the lead) gradually where people can readily distinguish it by looking at the diffs. - [[User:Sidelight12|Sidelight]][[Special:Contributions/Sidelight12|<span style="color:#008504">12</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Sidelight12|Talk]]</sup> 05:26, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

== Massive POV Pushing from user: Jyoti.mickey ==

[[User: Jyoti.mickey]] is keep pushing POV on article [[Abhinav Bharat]] and removing sourced materials from the article making it unblanced from a neutral point of view. Please, check this diff[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606899044&oldid=606896564] with the current revesion[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606906216&oldid=606904915] particularly he changed all my edits from the [[Abhinav_Bharat#Allegations_of_involvement_in_terrorist_activity|Allegations of involvement in terrorist activity]] which were sourced from reliable sources here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606902181&oldid=606902039] with this source[http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/abhinav-bharat-was--hijacked--by-hardliners-probe/380249/] and specially here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=next&oldid=606902181] where I tried to omit the weasel terms and put as per source but he reverted and added back the tags. He also removed  the word ''right-wing'' here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606895620&oldid=606890070] even without looking at the sources. Then also removed the category ''far-right politics in India'' while the very first sentence says it ''ultra-far-right'' from at least 2 references.  The article is not neutral after removing sourced contents like here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606903269&oldid=606902181] particularly sections like [[Abhinav_Bharat#Relationship_with_Sangh_Parivar_groups|Relationship with Sangh Parivar groups]], [[Abhinav_Bharat#History|History]] including the [[The Caravan (magazine)|Caravan magazine]] findings here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=prev&oldid=606903560]. He also removed the arrest of some of the leaders of the group and the misterious shut down of the group's website here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606904915&oldid=606904447] all of which were cited from sources with
no original research, anyone can check. [[User:Edmondhills|Edmondhills]] ([[User talk:Edmondhills|talk]]) 16:34, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

:: Yes, please check the diff [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606899044&oldid=606896564 295] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606906216&oldid=606904915 296]. I think my edit summary is descriptive and presents my stand clearly.
:: For [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606902181&oldid=606902039 297] the change was re-inserted by me within minutes. It is _present_ in the article much before you mentioned it here and in the article talk page, where I had mentioned the change in a separate section.
:: When you put right-wing the reference you mention was _not_ present, you added _new_ sources in a _subsequent_ edit after I mentioned in my edit summary that the references do not say so. The opening statement is "Abhinav Bharat is an ultra-right-wing Hindu extremist organization". Would you call that neutral when there was a much less charged lead earlier? Doesn't it contain weasel terms?
:: How is this article related to 'politics'? I asked same question in my edit summary.
:: Basically I think I put my edit summary quite clear each time. I object to you doing bulk over-write of the entire article from a very old copy and discarding all the intermediate edits with perfectly fine and descriptive edit summary. Why can't you do that? You can find a diff for each of the edit from one month back or so. I have absolutely no objection if you take the article to last good state and make your edits incrementally with descriptive edit summary instead of bulk over-write of entire article from much older copy. Here is the single edit where you bulk [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606799801&oldid=606799696 reverted]. It is not convenient nor possible for me to respond to all diffs you have pointed above, from my side it will boil down to the above argument and I am dead sure I give a descriptive enough edit summary each time to make my stand clear. The article talk page also stands proof I responded promptly and took to discussion any matter of dispute. [[User:Jyoti.mickey|Jyoti]] ([[User talk:Jyoti.mickey|talk]]) 04:54, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:::Interestingly, you removed the word ''right-wing'' as this wasn't cited[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606895620&oldid=606890070] then why did you remove text on [[Abhinav Bharat#History|History]] section instead tagged with a {{tl|cn}} tag[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=next&oldid=606904447]?[[User:Edmondhills|Edmondhills]] ([[User talk:Edmondhills|talk]]) 07:25, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:::: Do you understand that the opening sentence of the lead is highly biased? That is why. After bringing the discussion here you have made 9 more edits to the article, aren't we supposed to refrain from doing more edits to the same article before we complete discussion here? [[User:Jyoti.mickey|Jyoti]] ([[User talk:Jyoti.mickey|talk]]) 08:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::::: Please, explain what is biased in opening sentence which is properly sourced with references? You need to stop editing from your POV. I edited the article with only sourced material that is verifiable so I don't find any harm doing that.--[[User:Edmondhills|Edmondhills]] ([[User talk:Edmondhills|talk]]) 08:48, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:FWIW, the problem is not limited to the article mentioned by Edmondhills and thus this may be more than just a content dispute. There have been issues at [[Narendra Modi]], for example, involving this contributor's alleged POV and there are quite a few warnings on their talk page relating to it. I'm off out, though, so diffs will have to follow later. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 16:48, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:: [[User:Sitush]], I think we discussed this on the talk page of the article and reached a consensus about the edits on Narendra Modi page. We reached consensus on on all four edits in the article talk page discussion started by me, we retained two of my four edits. Do you not agree to this? [[User:Jyoti.mickey|Jyoti]] ([[User talk:Jyoti.mickey|talk]]) 02:11, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:: Here are the four talk page discussion with consensus reached within one day for three and withing three days on another.

:::Th issue is not whether the consensus reached or not the issue presented here that you are pushing POV not just in [[Abhinav Bharat]] but also in other articles.[[User:Edmondhills|Edmondhills]] ([[User talk:Edmondhills|talk]]) 07:25, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:::: What are you trying to convey that the talk page discussion above and the related edits demonstrate pov pushing? By what logic? Does every discussion implicitly convey a pov pushing. Sitush, I would prefer you to comment on this one. Do I not have the right to hold a different opinion and discuss it, did I edit the article even once after those discussion or caused any disruption? Did I not agree to your suggestion unconditionally that the article is in volatile state and lets leave it for now? And you also noted that you were not aware of the entire situation in the fourth discussion. Is this termed as pov pushing. [[User:Jyoti.mickey|Jyoti]] ([[User talk:Jyoti.mickey|talk]]) 08:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:I can't understand why this editor is removing referenced materials in the name of ''original research'' like this[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606902181&oldid=606902039] or even this[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606904915&oldid=606904447] and putting back dead links like here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606903560&oldid=606903269] where this dead link[[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/abhinav-bharat-was-hijacked-by-hardliners-probe/380249/] was replaced by this live link [http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/abhinav-bharat-was--hijacked--by-hardliners-probe/380249/] from the same source.

:: My main concern and motive for behaving the way I did is, this is the article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&oldid=605547248 a day back], you transformed it into [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&oldid=606896564 this] which is basically an old copy [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&oldid=603051266 here]here. Here is the single edit where you bulk [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606799801&oldid=606799696 reverted]. You ignored all previous edit summary and re-inserted from much older copy. Why would you revert entire sections, including section headers and loose all intermediate edits?
:: For the first diff you provided please check that the statement was reinserted immediately, it is present in the article much before you pointed it here. The second one, I have not mentioned original research in the comment. When you copy-pasted from a much older edit all intermediate edits are lost and I found it extremely annoying and tiresome to pick new contribution from it and re-instate them along with the changes lost or changes rejected with valid edit summaries before. The dead link also got in when I tried to restore to the last good state.
:: You inserted charged terms like 'dictator', I think [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abhinav_Bharat&diff=606799801&oldid=606799696 that] is pov pushing. [[User:Jyoti.mickey|Jyoti]] ([[User talk:Jyoti.mickey|talk]]) 02:11, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

You overwrote with an older copy. You are cross posting in ani as well as continuing to edit the article. Is it okay to do it in less than 24h of you having raised an objection in ani, can we not wait to reach a consensus? You have made 9 more edits and I do have several objections to it like 'dictator', the opening over-surcharged statement "Abhinav Bharat is an ultra-right-wing Hindu extremist organization", writing irrelevant stuff under sub-section 'history', adding the caravan story here as encyclopedic content and much more but you are tiring me with nonsensical arguments and raking up the same diff even when I have corrected it before you point out and also responding to you at every place you are mentioning it.

== User:Oglesruinsand Club América Soccer Academy‎ ==

[[User:Oglesruins]] keeps removing the redirect on [[Club América Soccer Academy]] (from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Club_Am%C3%A9rica_Soccer_Academy].  He has been warned twice, but continues on.  More recently, looks like he's taken to undoing edits I've made on other pages only in spite. [[User:LionMans Account|LionMans Account]] ([[User talk:LionMans Account|talk]]) 02:18, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:Nothing has changed since [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive837#User:Oglesruins]].  This editor is simply [[WP:NOTHERE|not here!!]] - "Little or no interest in working collaboratively" and seem to have a [[Wikipedia:Competence is required#Language difficulty| CiR native language]] problem as noted before. '''A ban is in-order''' - hard to change someone editing habits if they have no interest in talking to the community about the problems raised by editors. -- [[User:Moxy|Moxy]] ([[User talk:Moxy|talk]]) 05:30, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:As the editor that initiated the AfD on Club America Soccer Academy, I can't take any administrative action against Oglesruins, nor protect the page (as a redirect). If his only problem is at the Club America page, then proetcting the redirect is sufficient. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 07:48, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::Club America seems his worst problem.  However, since then, he insists on undoing edits I've made elsewhere, namely [[ List of developmental and minor sports leagues]], where he keeps adding in a local rec league and a fictitious league I've removed from there.  I guess he's hit 3RR there already though. [[User:LionMans Account|LionMans Account]] ([[User talk:LionMans Account|talk]]) 14:03, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Club America is far from his only problem. The main problem is that he never discusses on talk pages, and repeatedly engages in edit wars. He does read edit histories and responds to them, often with bravado. See his talk page for previous bans and extensive complaints going back several months. I've repeatedly tripped over him at [[Mexico]]. [[User:Tarlneustaedter|Tarl.Neustaedter]] ([[User talk:Tarlneustaedter|talk]]) 15:29, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*I've blocked him for one week for edit warring and reverted him on the Club America article.  I didn't protect as he is the only one that is trying to upend consensus and the block should be sufficient.  This is his third block.  If he comes back warring, I will personally indef block him, as he has had plenty of warnings.  This is all the generosity I can muster with this kind of warring.

== Histmerge needs undoing ==
{{archive top|1=Xezbeth has fixed it. [[User:ErikHaugen|ErikHaugen]] <small>([[User talk:ErikHaugen|talk]] &#124; [[Special:Contributions/ErikHaugen|contribs]])</small> 16:47, 6 May 2014 (UTC)}}
[[User:Master of Puppets]] "boldly" histmerged [[Valyrian language]] and [[Dothraki language]] into [[Languages of A Song of Ice and Fire]] (then [[Language in Game of Thrones]]) on 30 April. He was then told by 2 (now 3) different people to undo the histmerge [[Talk:Languages_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Merge|here]], but refused. (Apparently, BRD doesn't apply to this case because.) He's not been on since. Can one of you brilliant souls here see to it? — [[User talk:Lfdder|lfdder]] 02:58, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:He's now responded [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Master_of_Puppets&diff=607271784&oldid=607270224 on his talk page], but he's not actually said that he will be undoing it. — [[User talk:Lfdder|lfdder]] 03:11, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::Do you realize what you're asking for?  Articles should not be hist merged just to merge articles.  Only forks with no overlapping edits should be merged.  Splitting articles is very delicate, painful, and tedious.  No offense to MoP - but if he's screwed up then it's his mess to clean up.  At least, that's my feelings on the subject as unhelpful as they are.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 03:21, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

:I'll do it later when i'm not at work if nobody beats me to it. Every revision before April 5, 2013‎ belongs to [[Dothraki language]] so it shouldn't be too annoying to sort the rest out. &mdash;[[User:Xezbeth|Xezbeth]] ([[User talk:Xezbeth|talk]]) 07:23, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:Right, done. The histories should now be in their correct places at [[Languages of A Song of Ice and Fire]], [[Dothraki language]] and [[Valyrian languages]]. I did that quickly so if I've got a stray revision in the wrong place let me know and I'll fix it. &mdash;[[User:Xezbeth|Xezbeth]] ([[User talk:Xezbeth|talk]]) 08:54, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
