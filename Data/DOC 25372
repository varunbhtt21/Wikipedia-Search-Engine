An entrenched standoff between the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]] and pro-Russian separatists affiliated with the [[Donetsk People's Republic]] took place from 12 April until 5 July 2014. During the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|rising unrest in Ukraine]] in the aftermath of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], the city of [[Kramatorsk]] in [[Donetsk Oblast]] came under the control of the breakaway [[Donetsk People's Republic]] on 12 April. In an effort to retake the city, the Ukrainian government launched a counter-offensive against the separatist, who had taken up positions in the city. The DPR army units withdrew from city on 5 July, allowing Ukrainian forces to subsequently recapture the city, ending the standoff.<ref name="BBCkramawith"/>

The standoff began on 12 April, when a group of separatists from the [[Donbass People's Militia]] attempted to capture a police station. A shootout with police followed, eventually leading to the capture of the building by the separatists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/12/7022218/|script-title=uk:На Донбасі сепаратисти і міліція влаштували перестрілку|trans-title=In Kramatorsk separatists and police gunfight|work=Ukrainska Pravda|date=12 April 2014|accessdate=3 May 2014|language=uk}}</ref><ref name=reutersa12>{{cite news|agency=[[Reuters]] |date=13 April 2014 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/13/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA3A1B520140413 |title=Ukraine gives rebels deadline to disarm or face military operation |author2=Grove, Thomas |author1=Humphries, Connor |deadurl=no |archivedate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413130155/https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/13/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA3A1B520140413 |df=dmy }}</ref> After capturing the building, they tore the Ukrainian [[Coat of arms of Ukraine|coat of arms]] off the building, and raised the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic.<ref name=militaproof>{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/12/7022227/|script-title=uk:Приїжджі загарбники в Краматорську назвалися "народним ополченням" (Visiting invaders Kramatorske called themselves "people's militia"|work=Ukrainska Pravda|date=12 April 2014|accessdate=4 May 2014|language=uk}}</ref> The insurgents then issued an ultimatum stating that if the city's mayor and his subordinates did not swear allegiance to the People's Republic by Monday, they would "takeover the city council".

By 15 April, however, the Ukrainian [[First Yatsenyuk Government|transitional government]] had launched a counter-offensive against insurgents in Donetsk Oblast. The [[Ukrainian Ground Forces]] attacked the insurgent checkpoint at the airfield, and then regained control over the airfield itself. It was estimated that between four and eleven insurgents were killed in the attack.<ref name=11people>{{cite news|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/2014_04_15/Up-to-11-people-killed-in-Kramatorsk-airfield-battle-media-4043/ |title=Up to 11 people killed in Kramatorsk airfield battle |work=Voice of Russia |date=15 April 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503123454/http://voiceofrussia.com/2014_04_15/Up-to-11-people-killed-in-Kramatorsk-airfield-battle-media-4043/ |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=airfield>{{cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/turchynov-anti-terrorist-operation-has-begun-in-northern-donetsk-343563.html |title=Ukrainian troops in control of Donetsk Oblast's Kramatorsk airfield, Ukrainian deputy prime minister says several hundred Russian troops in Ukraine |work=Kyiv Post |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archivedate=3 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503234455/https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/turchynov-anti-terrorist-operation-has-begun-in-northern-donetsk-343563.html |df=dmy }}</ref> Insurgents made another attempt to capture the airfield on 16 April, but Ukrainian special forces that had been guarding the airfield since its original recapturing quickly drove them away, and took several prisoners.

Government forces focused primarily on Sloviansk for the next few days. However, on 25 April, a military helicopter at the Kramatorsk airfield exploded after its fuel tank was shot while it was taking off. Insurgents claimed responsibility for the shooting, and said that they had hit the helicopter with a [[rocket propelled grenade]] in an interview with Russian media.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Russian News & Information Agency |url=http://ria.ru/world/20140425/1005440872.html |script-title=ru:Ополченцы Краматорска уверяют, что они обстреляли вертолет из РПГ |trans-title=Militias in Kramatorsk claim that they fired at a helicopter with an RPG |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |language=ru |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815061458/http://ria.ru/world/20140425/1005440872.html |archivedate=15 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Dmitry Tymchuk]], a defence expert and director of the Centre of Military and Political Research in Kiev, told reporters that the [[Mi-8|Mi-8 helicopter]] pilot had managed to escape with minor injuries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukraine-officials-say-second-stage-of-anti-terrorist-operation-in-east-underway-345122.html |title=Ukraine officials say second stage of anti-terrorist operation under way in east as helicopter shot down (UPDATES, VIDEO) |work=Kyiv Post |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=Christopher J.
