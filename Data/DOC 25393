== [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Erbsmann Prize]] ==

Would like to reactive previous draft of the page - The Erbsmann prize is a major recognition within the medical imaging community, that we believe, merits having further information shared on a wikipedia page ( see links on google scholar on high impact scientific publications related to the IPMI meetings, from which the Erbsmann prize is awarded:  http://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=40&q=information+processing+medical+imaging&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5 )

The draft page was not polished due to time constraint - now is a good time to finalize a first version  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Herve.lombaert|Herve.lombaert]] ([[User talk:Herve.lombaert|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Herve.lombaert|contribs]]) 20:21, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:{{nd}} We allow wide latitude to what Wikipedia editors can do with their user pages, but so far you have very few contributions to the encyclopedia other than writing extensively about yourself. I also have concerns about the large number of family names you added to the infobox, because I'm fairly sure you didn't ask all of them if you could publicize their identities on a website. I can send you the deleted text via email if you wish, but you will have to re-create your user page as per [[WP:USERPAGE|our guidelines]]. Please pay close attention to the ''What may I not have in my user pages?'' section. [[WP:NOTSOCIALNETWORK]] is also applicable here. Finally, I deleted your request for deletion (the MfD you created) since that was the wrong venue to request ''undeletion''. <span style="color:red; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">§[[User:FreeRangeFrog|<span style="color:#00CA00">FreeRangeFrog</span>]]</span><sup>[[User talk:FreeRangeFrog|croak]]</sup> 21:58, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

<i></i>That's a very harsh assessment under the circumstances, James. My goal was to differentiate a number of companies operating under the same name, Neptune Society, in the same industry. As my article included information about 4 companies named Neptune Society--all competitors--I'm having trouble seeing how my article was seen as promotional. I'm certainly not promoting all 4 competitors in the same article. I don't see why the fact that I have little time to devote to wikipedia contributions should count against me.

== What Was That or Suddenly Lost Summer ==

*{{revisions|Suddenly Lost Summer}}
My guess is that the page was deleted for lack of any relevant information or details about the event.  However, a rare radio spot for it and a poster for it have been found, allowing the article to be populated with some hard information.  It was sponsored by Radio Station KSAN on January 31-February 1, 1976, it was "an acid-drenched flashback to the summer of love, featuring remembrances of those turned on days when all things were possible and little was probable; complete with interviews, un-released music, and horrifying shocks of recongnition."  It also featured eastern mysticism and the saying "Turn on, tune in, and drop out!" -[[Special:Contributions/50.136.141.191|50.136.141.191]] ([[User talk:50.136.141.191|talk]]) 01:24, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*<!-- Begin Template:UND -->[[File:X mark.svg|18px]] '''Not done''' - a deleted page with this name does not appear to exist.<!-- End Template:UND - dne   --> I can't see where a page by that name has ever existed on Wikipedia. I searched under various variations of the name and couldn't find anything. However the thing to remember is that a poster doesn't really show how this event was ''notable''. You'd have to show where the event received coverage in secondary and reliable sources. Anything released by the radio station (a radio spot by them or a poster) will not show notability, nor will posters sold through merchants. If it was deleted, it was probably due to notability rather than anyone questioning that it did or didn't happen.

::*They're referring to an event held/sponsored by a radio station (see [https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=573644856062181 this poster]) back in the 70s. I honestly have my doubts about its notability because there is little to nothing out there about it. No true mention in books, highbeam, or even basic hits beyond poster sales. The most I found was a picture of the poster [http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=Birth_of_Community_Rock_Radio:_A_brief_history_of_KMPX_and_KSAN-FM here], but we can't use it as a RS because the event itself isn't mentioned and besides, it's one of those "anyone can edit" sort of sites. At most the event could be mentioned on the radio station's article, although I'd like to have some sort of certainty as to which KSAN it is since there are multiple KSANs and the station numbers don't exactly match up with the ones listed on the poster (95). I'm pretty sure that it's [[KSAN (defunct)|this one]], though.

Please, consider reviving AdGear article - twice I have worked on this article about AdGear company and both times it was removed - It is quite a bit of work and will do my best to gather both information and relevant sources about the organization.

The page was deleted as I made a mistake in not preparing it in my sandbox first.

The Dead Mans Cove is about a group, not a formal club, of mostly men with the main purpose of fundraising and supporting charities. The charities include Oxfam, Kids Under Cover, Royal Children's Hospital ,Cottage By The Sea and RSPCA to name only a few. The group uses the DMC runners tag as a loose identifier of them rather than as their core business.
With the  charity organizations we support we register for events under the banner of DMC or Dead Mans Cover Runners but have no formal structure. 
If I could have the page back I will load it into the Sandbox and complete it rather than editing "live" and leaving an erroneous view of the group as a "sporting" club. The anonymity of the members in using nicknames is preserved.
I was preparing the section on getting involved and supporting our charity partners when the page was taken down. 
in hind sight I should of completed the planning, and editing prior to publishing.
