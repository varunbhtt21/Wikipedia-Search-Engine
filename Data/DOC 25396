The '''Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum''' ('''LKCNHM''') ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 李光前自然历史博物馆) is a museum of [[natural history]] at the Kent Ridge Campus of the [[National University of Singapore]]. Officially opened on 18 April 2015,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lee-kong-chian-natural/1792654.html|title = Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum now open|date = 19 April 2015|website = Channel NewsAsia|access-date = 8 March 2016}}</ref> it houses the Raffles Natural History Collection. 

The idea for a natural history collection was first mooted by Sir [[Stamford Raffles]], and the collection of [[Southeast Asia]]n biodiversity was begun in 1849 at the Raffles Museum (now the [[National Museum of Singapore]]). In 1972, the [[Government of Singapore]] removed the natural history collections from the National Museum and gave them to the Zoology Department of what was then the University of Singapore. They were housed in various temporary premises, including the [[Nanyang Technological University]] for seven years. Subsequently, they were returned to the NUS and housed in the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research. LKCNHM inherited the natural history collections from the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research.<ref name="LKCNHM">{{citation|title=About the Museum|url=http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/nus/index.php/lkcnhm/aboutlkcnhm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624133731/http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/nus/index.php/lkcnhm/aboutlkcnhm|archivedate=24 June 2015|publisher=Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum|date=3 August 2015}}; {{citation|author=Tommy Koh|authorlink=Tommy Koh|title=Star attractions at new natural history museum: Once like an unwanted orphan, Singapore's natural history collection now has a permanent home in a new museum|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/star-attractions-at-new-natural-history-museum|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823171234/http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/star-attractions-at-new-natural-history-museum|archivedate=23 August 2015|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=2 May 2015}}.</ref>
