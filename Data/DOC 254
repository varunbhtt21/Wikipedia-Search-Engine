Title : Kalevala (corvette)
Text : '''Kalevala''', a.k.a. "Calevala" (Russian: Калевала), was a propeller-operated corvette of the [[Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland|Finnish navy]].  The construction of it was completed in 1858 at [[Åbo Skeppswarf|Turku Old Shipyard]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]].  From 1860 to 1865, the corvette served in the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet of Russia]]. At the time, Finland was an [[Grand Duchy of Finland|autonomous grand duchy]] (1809-1917) within the [[Russian Empire]].

== Construction and launching of Kalevala ==
The corvette was designed by the ship designer Jörgensen, under the auspices of the Finnish Vice Admiral [[Johan Eberhard von Schantz]] (1802-1880), who was promoted to admiral in 1866.<ref name="Dagblad">{{citation | title = De finska skeppsvarfen | newspaper = Helsingfors Dagblad | date = 30 June 1865 | issue = 148 | pages = 2 | url = http://digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi/sanomalehti/binding/438424/articles/116415?language=en | accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref>  The construction of the vessel was funded by the [[Senate of Finland]].

== Kalevala in the Pacific Fleet of Russia ==
=== Kalevala in the Russian Far East ===
With the 1858 Peace Treaty of Aigun and the 1860 Peace Treaty of Peking, Russia extended its territories in the [[Far East]].  Unexpectedly, in 1860 Kalevala was pointed in the service of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet of Russia]], with new home port in [[Nikolayevsk-on-Amur]] in the [[Russian Far East]].  Baron Otto Carpelan remained the captain of Kalevala on the sail of the vessel from [[Kronstadt]] at the [[Baltic Sea]] to the vessel's new home port on the Russian coast of the [[Pacific Ocean]].  The long journey started from Kronstadt on October 18, 1860.<ref name="pgpb">[http://www.pgpb.ru/cd/primor/writers/kriv_text.htm Нa краю Восточной Руси – (К.М. Станюкович во Владивостоке)] (a fragment, "K. M. Stanyukovich in Vladivostok")</ref>  In addition to Kalevala, the squadron heading to the [[Far East]] consisted of two other corvettes, ''Bogatyr'' and ''Rynda'', as well as two clippers, Finnish-built ''Abrek'' (built in [[Pori]] in 1860) and its model vessel ''Gaidamak'', which had been obtained from England.

The voyage was headed by Rear Admiral Andrei Alexandrovitš Popov. According to at least one Russian source, Otto Carpelan continued as the captain of Kalevala beyond this voyage, in the duties assigned for the vessel in the service of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]].<ref>[http://militera.lib.ru/h/boevaya_letopis_flota/33.html Экспедиция русского флота к берегам Северной Америки (18 июля 1863–20 июля 1864)]</ref> According to another source, also Vladimir Davydov<ref name="pgpb" /> skippered Kalevala, and from 1863 also Fedor Želtuhin (Федор Николаевич Желтухин).<ref>[http://khasan-district.narod.ru/directory/person/zeltuhin.htm ЖЕЛТУХИН Федор Николаевич (1826-1898).] (in Russian).</ref>
In June, 1861, a year after the first Russian military camp had been established in [[Vladivostok]], on the Pacific coast of the [[Russian Far East]], the crew of Kalevala erected the first church of the future city.  The construction of the church was completed together with local soldiers from Vladivostok.<ref>[http://www.vladivostok.eparhia.ru/eparhia/synodal/ Владивосток начинался с храма.] (in Russian).</ref>
In 1863, the crew of Kalevala mapped the islands around [[Vladivostok]].  At that time, a bay in the area was named after Kalevala.  It is located in the Posjet Bay, which is a part of the [[Peter the Great Gulf]].<ref>[http://khasan-district.narod.ru/directory/geograf/kalevala_b.htm ''Kalevala'' - the bay.] (in Russian).</ref>

=== Finnish seamen and vessels in Russian America ===
[[Russian America]] was the name of Russian colonial possessions in [[North America]] from 1733 to 1867, that today is the [[U.S. State]] of [[Alaska]] and settlements in [[California]] (1) and [[Hawaii]] (3 - starting in 1817) (distant from the North American landmass in the Pacific Ocean and therefore more commonly associated with the other territories of [[Oceania]]). Formal incorporation of the possessions by Russia did not take place until the establishment of the [[Russian-American Company]] (RAC) in 1799.  [[Finland|Finnish]] Chief Managers ("governors") of [[Russian America]] included [[Arvid Adolf Etholén]] (a.k.a. Etolin) in 1840-1845 and [[Johan Hampus Furuhjelm]] in 1859-1864.<ref name="Etolin">[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/5411 Etholén, Arvid Adolf (1798 - 1876)] Chief Manager of [[Russian America]] in 1840-1845, rear admiral, explorer (in Finnish).</ref><ref name="Hampus">[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kenraalit/?gid=144 Johan Hampus Furuhjelm] Chief Manager of Russian America in 1859-1864, admiral, explorer (in Finnish).</ref>  A third Finn, Johan Joachim von Bartram, declined the offer for the five-year term between 1850 and 1855.<ref name="Maria - 11%" />  All three were high ranking Imperial naval officers.  Researcher Maria J. Enckell states the following about the Finns in the [[Russian-American Company]]:

:''"Russia relied heavily on Finnish seamen. These seamen manned Russian naval ships as well as its deep-sea-going vessels. Company records show that in the early 1800s these ships were crewed predominantly by merchant seamen from Finland. From 1840 onward the Company’s around-the-world ships were manned entirely by Finnish merchant skippers and crews.  Most Company ships stationed in Sitka and the Northern Pacific were likewise manned by Finnish skippers and Finnish crews."''<ref name="Maria - p. 108">[http://feefhs.org/journal/9/enckell.pdf ''Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800-1867.''] Author: Maria Jarlsdotter Enckell. Page 108.</ref>

:''"Significant too is that from the early 1800s the Finnish seamen sailing these ships had journeyed up and down the North and South American coasts.  Salt, used by the Company in preserving pelts, was obtained on islands in Baja California.  Fort Ross in Bodega Bay, just north of San Francisco, was a stop on that route until 1841 when the fort was sold to the “swindler” Johann Sutter, on whose land the first California Gold was found. Thus, all Finnish seamen plying these waters knew every nook and cranny on these shores.  Similarly they knew equally well the coast on the Asiatic side.  Returning to Finland on their mandatory around-the-world journeys, they spread the news of the riches they had seen."''

:''"San Francisco’s harbor records and the Russian Consular records display the names of many Finnish and Baltic Russian Alaska skippers busily plying the waters between San Francisco, Petropavlovsk, Nikolajefsk and Vladivostok." ... "Long before the turn of the century 11% of San Francisco’s seaman community were Finns. The commercial activities of these former Finnish Russian-American Company skippers and their men were impressive.  At least two are known to have become multimillionaires:  Gustaf Nybom (later Niebaum), the founder of Inglenook wineries, and [[Otto Wilhelm Lindholm]] of Vladivostok.  Their business ventures had interests spread across the Northern Pacific.  This activity continued until 1922 and the Soviet terror, when Vladivostok's numerous Finns and Manchurians were rounded up, marched to the central square and shot."''<ref name="Maria - 11%">[http://feefhs.org/journal/9/enckell.pdf ''"Long before the turn of the century 11% of San Francisco’s seaman community were Finns."''] Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800-1867. M.J. Enckell. Page 112.</ref>

In 1817-1818, [[Arvid Adolf Etholén]] skippered the [[Russian frigate Kamchatka]] from [[Kronstadt]] to the [[Alaska]]n port of [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], the capital of [[Russian America]], known as ''Novoarkhangelsk'' ("New [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]]") under Russian rule.  As a captain of several ships, Etholén then sailed from Sitka to [[California]], [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] and other areas, and in 1821-1823 he explored and mapped the utmost northwestern edges of the [[Pacific Rim]] of [[North America]], between [[Alaska]] and the [[Bering Strait]]. In 1824, Etholén skippered the Finnish-built<ref name="Baikal">[http://feefhs.org/journal/9/enckell.pdf ''The brig ”Baikal” was built in Helsinki (1847) and the corvette ”Varjag” in Oulu.''] Journal by Maria Enckell at Migration Institute.</ref> brig ''Baikal'' from [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] to [[California]], and the following year the frigate ''Kreiser'' from [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] to [[Kronstadt]].<ref name="Etolin" />  After having been pointed the Chief Manager ("governor") of [[Russian America]], Etholén skippered the Finnish-built<ref name="Nikolai I">[http://feefhs.org/journal/9/enckell.pdf ''In 1836–1839, the ships ”Nicolai I” and ”Naslednik Aleksandr” were built in Turku for the Russian American Company.''].</ref> vessel ''Nikolai I'' ("Nicolai") from [[Kronstadt]] to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] in 1939-1940.  On the same day with ''Nikolai I'', also the Russian ship ''Konstantin'' arrived in Sitka, under the command of Finnish Johan Joachim von Bartram (who later declined the opportunity to govern the [[Russian America]] from 1850 to 1855).<ref name="Etolin" />

In 1839, [[Sitka Lutheran Church]], the first [[Protestant]] congregation on the west coast of the Americas and the first [[Lutheran]] congregation on the entire [[Pacific Rim]] was founded in [[Sitka, Alaska]] by [[Finland|Finns]], and other Lutherans who worked for [[Russian-American Company]]. From the start, in 1840-1865, three consecutive Finnish pastors served this pastorate:  ''[[Uno Cygnaeus]]'' (1840-1845), ''Gabriel Plathán'' (1845-1852) and ''Georg Gustaf Winter'' (1852-1865). The Finns ''Aaron Sjöstrom'' and ''Otto Reinhold Rehn'' served as the parish organists/sextons during the same period.<ref name="Maria">[http://feefhs.org/journal/9/enckell.pdf ''Scandinavian Immigration to Russian Alaska, 1800-1867.''] Author: Maria Jarlsdotter Enckell.</ref>

In 1841, under the governorship of Russian America by Finnish [[Arvid Adolf Etholén]] (1840-1845) (promoted to rear admiral in 1847), the [[Russian America|Russian-American]] area of [[Fort Ross]] in [[Bodega Bay]], [[California]], was sold to [[John Sutter|Johann Sutter]].<ref name="Maria" /> On January 24, 1848, the first California gold was discovered on Sutter's land in [[Coloma, California]], leading to the [[California Gold Rush]], after news of this were spread abroad, mainly by the seamen serving for the Russian-American Company.

In 1850 and 1852, [[Johan Hampus Furuhjelm]] sailed to the [[U.S. West Coast]]. After he became the Chief Manager of [[Russian America]] (1858-1864), he put an end to the hostilities with the natives in Alaska. He also succeeded in abolishing the Alaskan ''Ice Treaty'' with [[San Francisco]].  According to a contract which had been signed, [[Russian America]] had to deliver a certain amount of ice to [[San Francisco]] at a fixed price.  A problem was caused by the product melting down on the way to the warmer climates. The ice contract became a very awkward deal for the Finnish-Russian colony. Furuhjelm arranged for a new contract to sell ice to San Francisco: 3'000 tons at $25.00 a ton.

The Finnish Chief Managers of Russian America Etholén and Furuhjelm helped pave way for the American Alaska purchase, and the Finnish Sea Captain [[Gustave Niebaum]] as the Consul of [[Russia]] in San Francisco played a critical role in the final striking of the deal that made [[Alaska]] a part of the [[United States of America]]  in 1867.<ref name="Etolin" /><ref name="Hampus" />  As a legacy of their accomplishment, their names can still today be found on the map in several places on the [[U.S. West Coast]]. [[Etolin Island]] was named after Etholén (a.k.a. Etolin) by the United States in the wake of the [[Alaska Purchase]] of 1867. There is also [[Etolin Strait]], as well as a cape, a point and a mountain named after Etholén.<ref name="Taru_Spiegel">[https://www.loc.gov/rr/european/FinnsAmer/finchro.html ''The Finns in America''],  Taru Spiegel, Reference Librarian.

:''"A military and civic subscription ball was given at Platt's Hall, on the evening of Friday, December 27, 1861, complimentary to the officers of the Russian steam corvette Calevala, by the citizens of San Francisco, as a token of the public appreciation of the friendly spirit manifested by the Emperor of all the Russia toward our federal government. All arrangements for this ball were confided to the members of the "City Guard" by a committee of the most prominent people. Lieutenant Wm. C. Little was the floor manager, assisted by four non-commissioned officers of the company. Captain Clark, chairman of the reception committee, was assisted by all the other members of the company, every one being in the full fancy uniform of the corps. The "press", in describing the affair, spoke thus of the "City Guard": "One of the most spirited and efficient of our local uniform militia companies, whose proverbial good taste was fully sustained in the admirable manner in which the ball was conducted."'' <ref name="City Guard" />

In 1863, a six-vessel Russian Imperial Navy squadron, a part of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]], sailed via [[Vladivostok]] to the West Coast of the United States, to help defend the waters there against a possible attack by the [[United Kingdom]] or [[France]], during the [[American Civil War]] (April 12, 1861 – May 10, 1865).<ref name="BLITZ">[http://feefhs.org/BLITZ/1863_1864.htm 1863-1864 Russian Fleet Expedition to North America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930184258/http://feefhs.org/blitz/1863_1864.htm |date=2008-09-30 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.fegi.ru/prim/flot/flot1_6.htm From the History of Russia's Pacific Fleet – Founding of Vladivostok]</ref><ref>[http://rusnavy.com/history/hrn9-e.htm Latter Half of the 19th Century – The Ironclads] – rusnavy.com</ref>  In addition to the Finnish-built corvette ''Kalevala'' now returning to the [[U.S. West Coast]], this squadron included three other corvettes, ''Bogatyr'', ''Rynda'' and ''Novik'' (Russian: "Новик"), and two Finnish-built clippers, the sister-ships ''Abrek'' (Russian: "Абрек") and ''Vsadnik'' (Russian: "Всадник"), both built in the southwestern Finnish town of [[Pori]] and launched in 1860.
