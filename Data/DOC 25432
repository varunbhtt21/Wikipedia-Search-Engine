'''Yanrey Station''', often referred to as '''Yanrey''', is a pastoral lease that operates as a [[sheep station]].

It is located about {{convert|93|km|mi|0}} south east of [[Exmouth, Western Australia|Exmouth]] and {{convert|110|km|mi|0}} south of [[Onslow, Western Australia|Onslow]] in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]].

Yanrey occupies an area of {{convert|2508|km2|sqmi|0}} and shares boundaries with [[Minderoo Station|Minderoo]], [[Koordarrie]], [[Giralia]], [[Nanutarra Station|Nanutarra]], [[Uaroo]] and [[Nyang Station]]s.<ref name=R1>{{cite web|url=http://archive.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/lwe/rpm/catman/62%20part%202.pdf|title=Station Reports|year=1980|accessdate=3 May 2014|publisher=[[Department of Agriculture and Food (Western Australia)|Department of Agriculture]]}}</ref> The station is made up of broad sandy plains with areas of alluvial clay plains. The Yannanie River flows north-south through the property with flood plains extending outward. The property is able to hold a maximum number of 47,000 sheep.<ref name=R1/>

The station was originally established by John and David Stewart. It was sold to [[Thomas Frederick de Pledge]] following the death of John Stewart. De Pledge was already familiar with the area having worked for the Stewarts as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]]<ref name=R2/> and for [[Alexander Forrest]] and [[Septimus Burt]] on neighbouring Minderoo Station for a period of seven years.<ref name=R3>{{cite web|url=http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/de-pledge-thomas-frederick-301|title=de Pledge, Thomas Frederick (1867â€“1954)|date=16 September 1954|accessdate=3 May 2014|work=Obituaries Australia|publisher=[[Australian National University]]}}</ref> De Pledge was appointed manager at Yanrey in 1897 and purchased the property in 1898 when it occupied an area of {{convert|270000|acre|ha|0}}.<ref name=R3/> Over the next three years de Pledge acquired the neighbouring properties of Yannangal, Yannaney and Globe Hill and incorporated them all into Yanrey giving it a total area of approximately {{convert|761000|acre|km2|0}}. He also worked to improve the flock so that Yanrey wool would always fetch high prices at market.<ref name=R3/> At one stage Yanrey was the third largest property in the Ashburton District with a size of {{convert|876892|acre|ha|0}}.<ref name=R2/>

In 1906 Yanrey was carrying a flock of approximately 30,000 sheep.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38818484 |title=Out Northern Ports |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth |date=8 December 1906 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> A cyclone in 1909 wreaked havoc at Yanrey with all of the windmills destroyed, miles of fencing lost and the country left under water.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26220265 |title=Weather in the Nor'-West.|newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=8 February 1909 |accessdate=3 May 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

By the 1920s both horses and camels as well as motor vehicles were used to transport the [[wool clip]] from stations in the area. Motor vehicles were unable to traverse roads used by stock in the wet, so between 1927 and 1930 a number of roads were gazette for motor vehicle use only. One of the roads was built to Yanrey.<ref name=R2/>

Alex Maitland stepped down as station manager in 1952 and was replaced with Ashley Paterson.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article76088165 |title=Onslow Notes. |newspaper=[[The Northern Times]] |location=Carnarvon, Western Australia |date=10 January 1952 |accessdate=4 May 2014 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Yanrey was stocked with 12,730 sheep and 1,210 cattle in 1979.<ref name=R1/>
