'''''Solidarity Breaks''''' is the second solo album of the Norwegian singer, songwriter and musician [[Jarle Bernhoft]] and the first one to be credited to his new adopted name '''Bern/hoft'''. Released on [[Universal Music]] on 31 January 2011, it entered at number 2 in its first week of release, then topped [[VG-lista]] the official Norwegian Albums Chart for six consecutive weeks in July and August 2011 (charts 27/2011 to 32/2011 inclusive) and came back to occupy the top of the chart for a seventh week in September in weekly chart 35/2011. The album also charted in Denmark<ref>[http://gaffa.dk/anmeldelse/50022 Gaffa.dk: Bernhoft Solidarity Breaks - Fan-fucking-tastic] {{da icon}}</ref> and in France.

Most instrumentation was by Bernhoft himself, but there were guest musicians on the album like [[Knut Reiersrud]] (harmonica), English musician [[Ed Harcourt]] (drums), [[Torstein Lofthus]] (keyboards), [[David Wallumr√∏d]] (bass) and Audun Erlien and Kwame Ogoo (vocals). Fred Ball produced the album, with [[Steve Fitzmaurice]] on the mixing. "Choices" was the main single release from the album that also included the immensely popular Bernhoft cover of [[Tears for Fears]] classic hit "[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]".
