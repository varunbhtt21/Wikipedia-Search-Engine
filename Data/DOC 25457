The '''Queanbeyan Nature Reserve''' is a [[state park|protected]] [[nature reserve]] that is located in the [[Southern Tablelands]] region of [[New South Wales]], in eastern [[Australia]]. The {{convert|67|ha|adj=on}} reserve is situated approximately {{convert|4|km}} west-south-west of the City of [[Queanbeyan]].<ref name=oehgetthere>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|title=Queanbeyan Nature Reserve: How to get there|accessdate=1 October 2014|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkGetThere.aspx?id=N0590|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref>

The low, undulating terrain of the reserve supports [[remnant natural area|remnants]] of two threatened ecological communities - Natural Temperate Grassland and grassy Box-Gum Woodland. A population of the threatened species Button wrinklewort ''[[Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides]]'' is present within the reserve, and the threatened species Golden Sun Moth ''Synemon plana'' has also been recorded.<ref name=oehnature>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|title=Queanbeyan Nature Reserve: Plants, animals and landscape|accessdate=1 October 2014|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkNature.aspx?id=N0590|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref>

The reserve is managed by the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service]].

== History ==

The Queanbeyan area is part of the traditional lands of the [[Ngunawal]] people. European settlement in the Queanbeyan area commenced in the 1820s and the township developed on the [[Queanbeyan River]], about {{convert|3|km}} from the current Queanbeyan Nature Reserve. The land now protected by the reserve was largely used for grazing sheep and cattle. Evidence of early settlement include a windbreak of large pines on the western boundary, dating to the early 1900s, and the site of a former dwelling and garden near the eastern boundary.<ref name=oehheritage>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|title=Queanbeyan Nature Reserve: Culture and history|accessdate=1 October 2014|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHeritage.aspx?id=N0590|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref>

== Biology and ecology ==

=== Ecological communities ===

==== Natural Temperate Grasslands ====

The Queanbeyan Nature Reserve protects remnant Natural Temperate Grassland, a community confined to the Southern Tablelands of NSW, within a region bounded by the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), {{NSWcity|Yass}}, {{NSWcity|Boorowa}}, the [[Abercrombie River]], {{NSWcity|Goulburn}}, the [[Great Escarpment, Australia|Great Eastern Escarpment]], the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] border and the eastern boundary of [[Kosciuszko National Park]]. In an intact state Natural Temperate Grassland is a generally treeless community dominated by a range of perennial grass species and a diversity of herbaceous species.<ref name="OEH13">{{cite web|work=Office of Environment & Heritage|date=23 September 2013|title=Natural Temperate Grassland of the Southern Tablelands of NSW and the Australian Capital Territory - profile|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedSpeciesApp/profile.aspx?id=20260|accessdate=|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref> The community occurs at altitudes between {{convert|560|and|1200|m}} in valleys influenced by cold air drainage and in broad plains.<ref name=doe/>

Since European settlement in the 1830s the distribution and condition of Natural Temperate Grassland has declined, initially due to extensive use for pastoral and agricultural activities and more recently as a result of a wide range of disturbances including grazing, application of fertilisers, introduction of exotic weed species, changed burning patterns, soil disturbance, changed drainage patterns, clearing for agriculture, plantation forestry, urban infrastructure and rural residential development.<ref name=doe>{{cite web|work=[[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of the Environment]] |title=Natural Temperate Grassland of the Southern Tablelands of NSW and the Australian Capital Territory|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/node/14548|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>  As a consequence, in 2000 Natural Temperate Grassland of the Southern Tablelands of NSW and the Australian Capital Territory was listed as Endangered under the ''Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999''.<ref name="OEH13"/> Throughout its range, only 3% of the Natural Temperate Grassland remains in high ecological integrity, relative to its pre-European settlement extent.<ref name="EnviroAct">{{cite book|work=Environment ACT|year=2006|title=National Recovery Plan for Natural Temperate Grassland of the Southern Tablelands (NSW and ACT): an Endangered Ecological Community|publisher=[[Government of the Australian Capital Territory]]|location=Canberra}}</ref>

Natural Temperate Grassland at Queanbeyan Nature Reserve occupies most of the larger, southern section but in the smaller, northern section occurs only as small patches. The remnant community at Queanbeyan Nature Reserve has been classified as Wallaby-grass - Tall Speargrass – Common Everlastings Tussock Grassland of the [[South Eastern Highlands]] [[bioregion]].<ref>{{cite book|work=Office of Environment & Heritage|date=2011|title=Plant Communities of the South Eastern Highlands and Australian Alps within the Murrumbidgee Catchment of New South Wales: Version 1.1. Technical Report. A Report to Catchment Action NSW|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate=}}</ref> The community includes grass species such as Wallaby Grasses ''[[Austrodanthonia]]'' spp., Red Grass ''[[Bothriochloa macra]]'', Tall Speargrass ''[[Austrostipa bigeniculata]]'', Kangaroo Grass ''[[Themeda australis]]'', and Poa Tussock ''[[Poa labillardierei]]'', and herbaceous species such as Hoary Sunray ''[[Leucochrysum albicans]] var. tricolor'', Blue Devil ''[[Eryngium ovinum]]'', Leafy Daisy ''[[Brachycome rigidula]]'', Tufted Bluebell ''[[Wahlenbergia communis]]'', and Lemon Beautyheads ''[[Calocephalus citreus]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Among weeds recorded are St John's Wort ''Hypericum perforatum'', Serrated Tussock ''Nassella trichotoma'', African Lovegrass ''Eragrostis curvula'', Phalaris ''Phalaris aquatica'', Cocksfoot ''Dactylis glomerata'', Sweet Briar ''Rosa rubiginosa'', Tree Lucerne ''Tagastaste'' sp., Paterson's curse ''Echium plantagineum'', Monterey Pine ''Pinus radiata'' and a variety of thistles.<ref name="Rowell"/><ref name=oehpest>{{cite web|work=Office of Environment & Heritage|date=2012|title=Queanbeyan Nature Reserve: Pest animals and weeds|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkPestsWeeds.aspx?id=N0590|accessdate=2 October 2014|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref>

=== Box-Gum Woodland ===

The Queanbeyan Nature Reserve protects remnant White Box Yellow Box Blakely's Red Gum Woodland, which is commonly referred to as Box-Gum Woodland. The distribution of this community within NSW is from the Queensland border to the Victorian border, occurring in the tablelands and western slopes. In an intact state, Box-Gum Woodland is characterised by the presence of White Box ''[[Eucalyptus albens]]'', Yellow Box ''[[E. melliodora]]'' and / or Blakely's Red Gum ''[[E. blakelyi]]'' occurring with a range of other species. The groundcover is characterised by native grasses and a high diversity of herbs, while understorey shrubs are generally sparse or absent, though they may be locally common.<ref name="2012a">{{cite web|work=Office of Environment & Heritage|date=2012|title=White Box Yellow Box Blakely’s Red Gum Woodland – profile|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10837|accessdate=|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref>

Since European settlement, Box-Gum Woodland has been drastically reduced in area and highly fragmented because of clearance for cropping and pasture improvement (NSW Scientific Committee, 2002) and the community had been reduced to less than 1% of its original extent.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas, V.|author2=Gellie, N.|author3=Harrison, T|date=2000|title=Forest ecosystem classification and mapping for the Southern CRA region|volume=Volume II Appendices|work=[[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service]]|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]}}</ref> As a consequence, in 2002 White Box Yellow Box Blakely's Red Gum Woodland was listed as Endangered under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. In 2009 the community was listed as Critically Endangered under the ''Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999''.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of the Environment]]|date=2014|title=White Box-Yellow Box-Blakely's Red Gum Grassy Woodland and Derived Native Grassland - SPRAT profile|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicshowcommunity.pl?id=43|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|accessdate= }}</ref>

Remnant Box-Gum Woodland at Queanbeyan Nature Reserve occupies most of the smaller, northern section but occurs only as small, isolated patches in the larger, southern section. The overstorey includes Yellow Box, Blakely's Red Gum and Apple Box Eucalyptus bridgesiana. The shrubby understorey includes Early Wattle ''Acacia genistifolia'', Hickory Wattle ''A. implexa'', Green Wattle ''A. mearnsii'' and Golden Wattle ''A. pycnantha'', and a number of other large shrubs such as Sweet Bursaria ''Bursaria spinosa'' subsp. ''lasiophylla'', Burgan ''Kunzea ericoides'' and Violet Kunzea ''Kunzea parvifolia''. Smaller shrubs include Native Cranberry ''Astroloma humifusum'', Daphne Heath ''Brachyloma daphnoides'', Peach Heath ''Lissanthe strigosa'' and Urn Heath ''Melichrus urceolatus''. The grassy groundcover is fairly open, with many native grasses and forbs. Several species of lilies, daisies and legumes are present along with at least fifteen species of native grasses including ''Austrodanthonia'' spp., ''Austrostipa'' spp., Red Grass ''Bothriochloa macra'', Tussock Grass ''Poa sieberiana'' and Kangaroo Grass ''Themeda australis''.<ref name="Rowell"/>

Significant weeds recorded include St John's Wort ''Hypericum perforatum'', Serrated Tussock ''Nassella trichotoma'', African Lovegrass ''Eragrostis curvula'' and Phalaris ''Phalaris aquatica''.<ref name="Rowell"/><ref name=oehpest/>

== Flora ==

=== Button wrinklewort ===

In 1999 it was reported that Queanbeyan Nature Reserve protected some 10,000 specimens of [[Button wrinklewort]]. however the present{{when|date=October 2014}} number is likely to be closer to 27,000.<ref name="2012c"/> Button wrinklewort is a multi-stemmed perennial forb which produces multiple flowering stems {{convert|15|to|30|cm}} high during spring and summer. Each flower-head is on an individual short stalk and consists of numerous very small clustered yellow flowers.<ref name="2012c"/> Populations of Button wrinklewort occur in south-east NSW and on the plains west of [[Melbourne]].<ref name="2012c"/> In the Southern Tablelands of NSW, populations of Button wrinklewort occur in Goulburn, the Canberra - Queanbeyan area and at {{NSWcity|Michelago}}. Evidence suggests that the species was formerly widespread within this range.<ref name="2012c"/>

Button wrinklewort usually inhabits Natural Temperate Grassland, Box-Gum Woodland and the ecotone between these two communities.<ref name=oehpest/><ref name="2012b">{{cite web|work=Office of Environment & Heritage|date=2012|title=Button Wrinklewort – profile|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedSpeciesApp/profile.aspx?id=10739|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate= }}</ref> Since European settlement habitat for the species has been lost, degraded or fragmented as a result of activities such as grazing, cropping, residential and other developments, invasion by weeds and changes to natural fire regimes. Only 18 extant natural populations are known in NSW, and five populations are likely to have become extinct since they were first recorded.<ref name="2012c"/> Remnant populations are now usually restricted to roadsides, travelling stock reserves, cemeteries railway easements and the occasional private landholding.<ref name=oehpest/> Within NSW, natural populations of Button wrinklewort are formally conserved within Queanbeyan Nature Reserve, Crace Grassland Reserve (part of the [[Canberra Nature Park]]) and the Red Hill Section of Canberra Nature Park.<ref name="2012c"/>

As a consequence, Button wrinklewort is listed as endangered under the ''Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995'' (NSW)  and as endangered under the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth).<ref name="2012c"/>

== Fauna ==

=== Golden Sun Moth ===

The Golden Sun Moth ''Synemon plana'' is a medium-sized, diurnal moth with a wingspan of between {{convert|31|mm}} for females and {{convert|34|mm}} for males.<ref name="2012d">{{cite web|work=Office of Environment & Heritage|date=2012|title=Golden Sun Moth – profile|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10791|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate= }}</ref> Populations of Golden Sun Moth in NSW are located in the area between Queanbeyan, Gunning, Young and Tumut. Historically the moth's distribution extended from {{NSWcity|Bathurst}} in central NSW through the NSW Southern Tablelands, through to central and western Victoria, to {{SAcity|Bordertown}} in eastern [[South Australia]].<ref name="2012d"/><ref name="NSW96">{{cite book|work=Scientific Committee|date=1996|title=Golden sun moth - Endangered species determination - final|location=Sydney|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate= }}</ref>

Golden Sun Moth occurs in Natural Temperate Grasslands and grassy Box-Gum Woodlands, where the groundcover is dominated by Wallaby Grasses ''Austrodanthonia'' spp.  The bare ground in inter-tussock spaces is considered to be an important micro-habitat for the species.<ref name="2012d"/><ref name="DEC2007">{{cite book|work=Department of Environment and Conservation NSW|date=2007|title=Draft NSW and National Recovery Plan for the Golden Sun Moth Synemon plana|location=Queanbeyan|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|accessdate= }}</ref>

Larvae feed exclusively on the roots of wallaby grasses and adult Golden Sun Moths, which do not feed, live for only one to for days.<ref name="2012d"/> The flight period usually lasts from six to eight weeks during November and December in the Queanbeyan region, and adult moths emerge continuously throughout this period. Males Golden Sun Moths fly only in bright sunshine during the warmest part of the day <ref name="2012d"/>

Female Golden Sun Moth have reduced hind wings and rarely fly, though males are capable of active and prolonged flight. Male Golden Sun Moths will not fly greater than 100m away from areas of suitable habitat, therefore populations separated by more than 200m can be considered effectively isolated. Golden Sun Moth populations which have gone extinct, or vacant patches of suitable habitat, are highly unlikely to be recolonised.<ref name="Clarke">{{cite journal|author1=Clarke, G.

<!-- This information seems massive overkill for a subject (Button Wrinklewort) that doesn't even have its own article == Management of Button Wrinklewort ==

In line with the general objectives for the management of nature reserves in New South Wales,<ref name="NPWS99"/> the establishment of Queanbeyan Nature Reserve provided protection for biodiversity from the broader identified threats of agriculture, grazing of domestic stock, urban, rural subdivision and infrastructure development.

The primary purpose of the establishment of the 2.24ha northern section of Queanbeyan Nature Reserve in 1989 was to preserve a population of Button Wrinklewort and its habitat, and the secondary objectives were to ‘protect a sample of grassy woodland and natural temperate grassland and manage the area in a regional context.’.<ref name="NPWS99"/> At the time, neither Box-Gum Woodland nor Natural Temperate Grassland were listed under the NSW Threatened Species Act 1995. The 1999 Queanbeyan Nature Reserve Plan of Management <ref name="NPWS99"/> was therefore focussed on the management of Button Wrinklewort within the northern section. Although NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service continues to actively manage the total reserve in accordance with the general and specific objectives for the reserve, the original Plan of Management has not been formally revised or updated in relation to the larger, southern section. However, a revised Plan of Management is in preparation.<ref>Smith, Maggie NSW National Parks Ranger 2014. personal comments
</ref>

Seven specific objectives for the management of Queanbeyan Nature Reserve were identified in the 1999 Plan of Management. Three of the objectives related directly to ‘on-ground’ management of biodiversity i.e. ensuring the survival and the expansion of the population of Button Wrinklewort within the reserve, protecting a remnant sample of Box-Gum Woodland, and re-establishing native plant species within weed-infested areas.<ref name="NPWS99"/>  A research-orientated objective was to encourage scientific inquiry into the biology, habitat and management requirements of the population of Button Wrinklewort. The remaining objectives were concerned with ensuring appropriate visitor use of the reserve, promoting community awareness of the existence and importance of threatened ecosystems and species in the local area, and encouraging formal protection of adjacent sites containing Button Wrinklewort or grassland values ‘within an enlarged and fragmented Queanbeyan Nature Reserve’.<ref name="NPWS99"/>

=== Survival and expansion of Button Wrinklewort ===

The first objective of the 1999 Plan of Management was to ensure the survival, and if practicable, the expansion of the population of Button Wrinklewort within Queanbeyan Nature Reserve.  This objective has been achieved on both counts. In 1999 is was reported that the reserve protected some 10,000 specimens of Button Wrinklewort <ref name="NPWS99"/> however by 2007 the number had increased to approximately 22,000.<ref name="Baines">Baines G 2007. Survey of New South Wales and ACT populations of Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides. (Unpublished Report).</ref> In the southern section of the reserve, a 1990 population of 450 plants had increased to approximately 5700 by 2012.<ref name="2012c"/><ref name="Baines"/>

The survival and expansion of the population of Button Wrinklewort within Queanbeyan Nature Reserve has been primarily attributed to three management actions i.e. the removal of grazing stock, the implementation of weed control, and thinning of eucalypt regeneration.<ref name="2012c"/>

The grazing of domestic stock is a recognized threat to Button Wrinklewort<ref name="NPWS99"/><ref name="2012c"/> and the removal of grazing stock was implemented in 1999 at the northern section of the reserve and in 2004 at the southern section. This management strategy was based on studies into the impacts of grazing on Button Wrinklewort.<ref name="Craigie">Craigie V 2006. Submission on the EPBC Nomination to delist Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides from the endangered category and list in the conservation dependant category. (Unpublished report to the Department of Environment and Heritage by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment).</ref>
On the basis of ‘existing knowledge’ that a Woodland overstorey could potentially shade out Button Wrinklewort, the 1999 Plan of Management included an objective to ensure that tree species on the northern section of the reserve would not regenerate to the extent that they effectively exclude light from the species. This has been addressed through selective control of the regeneration.<ref name="NPWS99"/> Management has continued to include judicial thinning of eucalypt seedling regeneration in the northern section of the reserve in order to maintain a grassy open-woodland habitat for Button Wrinklewort.<ref name="2012c"/> This management strategy was based on studies into the impacts of shading on Button Wrinklewort.<ref name="EnviroAct"/><ref name="Wittmark">Wittmark, B., Goodwin, C. and Kendall, P. 1984. An Ecological Study of the Rare Daisy ''Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides'' in the Canberra Area. Internal report, Environment Section, National Capital Development Commission.</ref>

As Button Wrinklewort tends to occupy areas where there is relatively less competition from herbaceous species,<ref name="2012b"/> invasion by weeds, especially dense exotic pasture grasses, can reduce areas of suitable habitat. NPWS has undertaken weed control, particularly of St. Johns Wort, Serrated Tussock and Sweet Briar in both sections of Queanbeyan Nature Reserve.  The continued expansion of the population in the northern section of this reserve has been aided by this work.<ref name="2012c"/> In 2001 OEH successfully removed an area of about 0.3ha of Phalaris and Cocksfoot dominated groundcover in the northern section of the reserve. This area was sown in 2002 with Kangaroo Grass in an effort to expand the area of suitable habitat for Button Wrinklewort and reduce the threat of weed invasion into existing habitat.<ref name="2012c"/> This management strategy was based on studies into the impacts of weeds on Button Wrinklewort.<ref name="Ross">Ross, C., & Macris, A. 2012.

=== Encouragement of scientific enquiry into Button Wrinklewort ===

The 1999 Plan of Management objective to ‘encourage scientific inquiry into the population of ''R. leptorrhynchoides'' with emphasis on its biology, habitat requirements, and management requirements’ <ref name="NPWS99"/> was aimed at building on existing research into the species which included reference to the Queanbeyan site. At that time research had already included an ecological study of the species,<ref name="Wittmark"/> and additional research had been undertaken into the breeding system, karyotype and variation within and between populations,<ref>Leeton, P., & Fripp, Y.

The 1999 Plan of Management noted that Button Wrinklewort occurred on two unprotected sites close to the reserve and therefore included the management objective to ‘encourage formal protection of adjacent sites containing ''R. leptorrhynchoides'' or grassland values within an enlarged and fragmented Queanbeyan Nature Reserve’.<ref name="NPWS99"/> This objective has been partially fulfilled, primarily through the 2004 addition of c. 64ha of land supporting remnant Natural Temperate Grassland, Box-Gum Woodland, Button Wrinklewort and habitat for Golden Sun Moth. However, adjoining land supporting similar biodiversity values to the west (within in the Australian Capital Territory) and on private property east of Lanyon Drive has yet to be formally protected. -->
