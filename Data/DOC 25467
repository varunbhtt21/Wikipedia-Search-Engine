Title : Haitian Gospel
Text : {{Music of Haiti}}
'''Haitian Gospel music''', began its roots in the rise of [[Christianity]], when it was first imported to the island by [[Spain]]'s [[Christopher Columbus]] in the 15th-century and again by the [[France|French]] during colonial years of [[Saint-Domingue]], as [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]s and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]s served as missionaries to continue the proliferation of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. The [[Baptists|Baptist]] trend that had grown in the [[United States]], had not yet reached [[Haiti]] until the western media was introduced, shaping Haitian Gospel music;  also known as '''''mizik levanjil''''' in [[Haitian Creole]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitianmusic.net/haitian-gospel-music/ |title=Haitian Gospel Music  |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

==Origins==
After the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1804, [[Protestantism]] was introduced to the country by Americans arriving in 1915 during the [[United States occupation of Haiti]]. Along with these Protestant ideas, came the Southern Baptist ideology, which gained popularity in Haiti. During this time, Americans also brought the big band jazz that led to Haitian [[mini-jazz]] (''mini-djaz'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitianmusic.net/haitian-gospel-music/ |title=Haitian Gospel Music  |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

==In the U.S.==
