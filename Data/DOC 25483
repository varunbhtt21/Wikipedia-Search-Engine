Greenhalgh was the subject of controversy in the first months of his appointment as the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime. He apologised after a colleague stated that he had patted her on the bottom, though she apparently did not make an official complaint, and he stated that he had no recollection of the alleged incident.<ref>Gardham, Duncan.
