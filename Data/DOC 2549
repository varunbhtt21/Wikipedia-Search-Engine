{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Haikyu!!'' characters}}
The following is a list of characters that appear in the volleyball manga and anime, ''[[Haikyu!!]]''.

==Main characters==

===Karasuno High School===
The word 'Karasu' in the school name "Karasuno" means 'crow'. The team was referred to as "Flightless Ravens" or "Fallen Crows", since they were formerly a strong team which even went to the nationals, but has been on the decline lately. Their team doesn't have any play style, instead, opting to be open and always trying out new styles to play.

:Hinata is a first-year student at Karasuno High School. He was initially a wing spiker in junior high school and is currently a middle blocker. His play style makes him an excellent decoy, and even though he wants to become the ace (since it is flashy), he learns the importance of a decoy in the team, and plays it excellently. He is generally upbeat, clumsy, and weak, however he is very athletic and has extraordinary jumping ability and amazing reflexes. He is able to play immensely well with the help of Kageyama. Although he is a beginner and has a small stature, he is determined to become a strong player and thus manages to grow rapidly through each match. Together with Kageyama, he forms the "weird duo", due to their unnaturally fast quick attack.

:Kageyama is a first-year student at Karasuno High School. He is currently a setter and was referred to as the "King of the Court" in junior high. While Kageyama exhibits prodigious talents as a player, he also has an arrogant demeanor and an inability to cooperate with teammates, instead opting to order them around, thus earning his nickname "King of the Court". Unable to stand his attitude, his middle school team mates opted to stop playing with him in the middle of a match, which end up as a huge blow to him. After enrolling in Karasuno High School and joining the volleyball club where he meets Hinata, his opinions start to change and he begins to understand the importance of teamwork in a team sport. He tends to hide his feelings thus having bad social skills and frequently calls Hinata a "dumbass". Together with Hinata, he forms the "weird duo", due to their unnaturally fast quick attack.

:Sawamura is the captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. He is a wing spiker, and very dependable at receiving. As the captain he's able to build a solid foundation of the team. He is kind, dependable, and doesn't get easily discouraged, but all of his teammates also fear annoying him because he turns alarmingly terrifying when angry. He also believes in his teammates, allowing them time to grow, even waiting for them to get over their fights and issues, instead of trying to push them forward before time.

:Sugawara is the vice captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. He used to be the main setter of the team, but since Kageyama's addition to the team he has spent lesser time as setter on the court, and instead has played as pinch server.

:Tanaka is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker. He is loud, fierce and abrasive, but respects his seniors and looks out for his juniors. While on the court, he displays amazing mental strength, even when he is continuously targeted by the opposite team. Unfortunately, his behavior and appearance makes girls scared of him, and often gets him into trouble with others, needing Sawamura to stop him. He and Nishinoya adore their manager Shimizu.

:Azumane is a third-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker in the volleyball club. He's considered to be the team's ace. Despite his large physique (which makes people believe that he's not really a high school student), spiking power and mature demeanor, he is very timid, and is often referred to as having a "glass heart".

:Nishinoya is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a libero. He is called "Karasuno's Guardian Deity" because of his excellent and amazing skills as a libero, having won the "Best Libero" award while he was still in middle school. He has a very energetic personality and is ridiculously strong-hearted. He does tend to get carried away because he has so much passion and intensity. He is also mentioned to be the backbone of the team because whenever he is on the court, he assures all of his teammates that even if they get blocked, he will be there to pass it up so they are able to spike as many times as they need to win the point. He is also extremely loud and motivational, and is one of the only people able to bring the team up in good spirits right before matches against the better teams in the prefecture. He's also the shortest player on the team. Like Tanaka, he adores Shimizu, in the episode he is introduced in, he mentions one of the main reasons he came to Karasuno in the first place was because he liked the girls' uniforms.

Prior to the main storyline, he was one of many students who dropped out of the volleyball team due to high standards and extreme practice sessions of Coach Ukai Sr..

:Tsukishima is a first-year student at Karasuno High School and a middle blocker. He looks down on Hinata at the beginning, stating that he should not rely on his jump. He often teases his teammates and also teases Kageyama by calling him "The King", which angers him to the core. Despite his negative attitude and flippant view on volleyball, Tsukishima is a very analytic and smart blocker, along with his great height, which gives the team a great advantage. Though he also has a stand-offish demeanor and seems to not care about his teammates, it is revealed that he loves volleyball, cares a lot for the sport, and has stayed friends with Yamaguchi not because he felt obliged to because he defended Yamaguchi from bullies in elementary school, but because genuinely cares for him and enjoys playing volleyball with him. Later in the story, it's revealed that he had an older brother that was in Karasuno's volleyball team. He is the tallest player on the team and is nicknamed "Tsukki" by Yamaguchi.

:Yamaguchi is a first year student at Karasuno High School and a middle blocker.

:A beautiful third year student and manager of the Karasuno High School volleyball club. Being a former athlete of the track club, she had to learn about volleyball all by herself when she joined as a manager. She has a strict and straight forward personality, but she is surprisingly shy when she gives words of encouragement to the entire team. When Yachi joins the team, she guides her very well to learn her responsibilities as a manager and also teaches her the technicalities of the game. She is friendlier to Yachi than anyone and also quite protective of her, when it comes to any boy trying to get near her. Nishinoya and Tanaka are her fans.

==Rival schools==

===Aoba Johsai High===
Determined to be a strong school, especially after the inclusion of Oikawa. Their play style focuses on strategies and quick on the spot decisions, making them very difficult to score against. Each player of Aoba Johsai has been said to have the ability to become an ace player.
;{{Nihongo|Tōru Oikawa|及川 徹|Oikawa Tōru}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]<ref name="haikyuucast4" />|[[Chris Patton]]<ref name=":0" />}}
:Oikawa is the setter and third-year captain of the Aoba Johsai High School volleyball club and is widely regarded as the ace setter, introduced as a main antagonist in manga and anime [[Haikyuu!!]]. He was also Kageyama's senior when they both attended Kitagawa Daiichi Middle School. He is called "The Great King" by Hinata.
:Despite his flirtatious nature and childishness, Oikawa is an excellent, well-rounded player and is extremely serious about volleyball. He's known to have a "disgusting personality" amongst both opponents and his own teammates because of his smug attitude. Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blasé exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weakness.
:He works extremely hard, as is evident by his vigorous practices and injuries caused by overworking in training before. His own teammates have pointed out his rigorous schedule. In addition, Oikawa spends time watching past games of his rivals, observing their movements ahead of time and strategizing how to defeat them. His intelligence and game sense are also unparalleled, as shown when he points out his opponents' weaknesses in a short period of time. He is also capable of rising his teammates' performance by passing them the perfect tosses, no matter their habits or his relationships towards them. 
:In his free time, he coaches his nephew and other children at Lil Tykes Volleyball Classroom. He and the third years as well as the entire team shares a very close bond. Despite being exasperated by Oikawa's antics, the team deeply respects him. He and Iwaizumi are childhood best friends and have played volleyball together for a long time. They are completely in sync with each other's thoughts both on and out of court. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and Tōru respectively) form  "一徹" meaning "obstinate" or "dauntless".

;{{Nihongo|Issei Matsukawa|松川 一静|Matsukawa Issei}} 
:{{voiced by|Isamu Yūsen|Paul Locklear<ref name=":0" />}}
:Matsukawa is one of the middle blockers and a third-year student. He is cool headed and although serious looking, Matsukawa is shown to sometimes carry a joking air, such as calling out his food orders in the middle of a match. He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Hanamaki. these two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion. He is almost always with Hanamaki. He enjoys Oikawa's endless jokes towards Iwaizumi, spectating their banter along with Hanamaki, or occasionally chiming in with their own teasing remarks.

;{{Nihongo|Takahiro Hanamaki|花巻 貴大|Hanamaki Takahiro}}
:{{voiced by|Tōru Sakurai|Jack Ivy<ref name=":0" />}}
:Hanamaki is a wing spiker and a third-year student. Hanamaki is usually calm and collected. He is observant and perceptive, able to read the game situation quite well, and doesn't talk much during games. Despite this, he does have a sense of humour, especially with the third years, and generally gets along pretty well with the other team members. He's seen to flash the peace sign when Oikawa complimented him. He shares a very close bond with the 3rd years, especially Matsukawa. These two are shown to be swapping jerseys in more than one occasion. He is almost always with Matsukawa.

;{{nihongo|Hajime Iwaizumi|岩泉 一|Iwaizumi Hajime}}
:{{voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino (voice actor)|Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|Benjamin McLaughlin<ref name=":0" />}}
:Iwaizumi is the ace and third-year vice-captain of the team, as well as one of the wing spikers and Oikawa's childhood friend and "pillar." Iwaizumi is a stubborn but reliable teammate, often filling in Oikawa's spot as a morale booster if needed. He acts supportively to all, including Tobio Kageyama, and calls Oikawa out for his childish antics. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him, but this does not change the fact that he cares immensely for him, as shown when he makes an effort to stop Oikawa from either working too hard or losing confidence. Iwaizumi's firm-yet-caring attitude has led some members of the Aobajōsai team to look up to and respect him. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and Tōru respectively) form  "一徹" meaning "obstinate" or "dauntless".

;{{nihongo|Shinji Watari|渡 親治|Watari Shinji}}
:{{voiced by|[[Arthur Lounsbery]]|Blake Jackson<ref name=":0" />}}
:Watari is a second-year student and the team's libero. He seems to enjoy being challenged, due to the fact that he smiled when Nishinoya used the same move as him when he set from the back row. It's shown that he can be very gentle and supportive when he tries to cheer up Kyōtani after he misses a point, regardless of Kyōtani's lack of proximity with the rest of the team. Before he became the libero, it was mentioned that he was actually a setter. However, it's unknown if he has ever played as a setter in Aobajōsai High.

;{{nihongo|Shigeru Yahaba|矢巾 秀|Yahaba Shigeru}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kengo Kawanishi]]|Jeremy Gee<ref name=":0" />}}
:Yahaba is a second-year and a setter. He is a show off by nature. He doesn't like Kyotani, since he had stopped coming to practice, but was still chosen as a regular. He is the only person in the team who scolds Kyotani to his face, asking him to play for the team.

;{{nihongo|Yūtarō Kindaichi|金田一 勇太郎|Kindaichi Yūtarō}}
:{{voiced by|[[Makoto Furukawa]]|[[David Matranga]]<ref name=":0" />}}
:Kindaichi is a first-year and a middle blocker. He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is also known as "Turnip Head." Being the one who raised his voice against Kageyama during middle school, he feels both guilty and rivalry towards him. He keeps questioning Hinata about Kageyama's welfare, though, when he meets Kageyama, he only challenges him.

;{{nihongo|Akira Kunimi|国見 英|Kunimi Akira}}
:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Tamaru]]|[[Mark Laskowski|Mark X. Laskowski]]<ref name=":0" />}}
:Kunimi is a first-year and one of the wing spikers. He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is also known as "Curtain Hair." He has a lazy personality, due to which he usually tends to be lax and not play to his utmost strength. Kageyama didn't like this, and used to shout at him to play with his full strength at middle school, whereas Oikawa does the opposite. By conserving his strength throughout the game by being lax, he starts playing with full power during the later half of the games, when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him reliable.

;{{nihongo|Kentarō Kyōtani|京谷 賢太郎|Kyōtani Kentarō}}
:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]|Michael Wronski<ref name="Season 2 Dub">{{cite web|title=HAIKYU!! SEASON 2 OFFICIAL ENGLISH DUB CAST|url=http://www.sentaifilmworks.com/news/haikyu-season-2-official-english-dub-cast|website=Sentai Filmworks|accessdate=March 22, 2018|date=March 22, 2018}}</ref>}}
:Kyōtani is a second-year wing spiker, nicknamed "Mad Dog" by Oikawa. His play style is reckless, since he likes hitting the ball with everything he's got, without looking at whether he might be blocked. This also makes him a double edged sword. His personality is rough, since he displays absolutely no team work, and doesn't even care about respecting his seniors, reprimanding them when anything is off. He stopped coming to practice because of this, but then returns after the first tournament, thinking that the third years might have retired by them. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player. His middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he was in it. He also has great body control and great dexterity, being able to spike with either hand.
:Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, having been beaten by him in various games, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. Eventually, he starts becoming one with the team.

===Nekoma High===
The word 'neko' means 'cat' in Japanese. Thus, when there used to be rivalry between Nekoma and Karasuno, it was often referred to as the "Battle by the Garbage Dump" or "Cat Vs. Crow". Their team basically builds its play with strong receivers, never letting the ball drop and strategies developed by its smart setter.

He is called as 'scheming captain', as he is great with strategy, and also likes to tease people. Very different from his childhood friend Kenma who is very serious and silent, Kuroo is quite playful and also sly. He is deemed to be talented middle blocker by coach Ukai Jr. During practice matches, he gives a lot of tips and advice to Tsukishima (particularly) about blocking, as he wants to fulfill his coach's dream of battling it out with Karasuno at the Nationals.

:Yamamoto is a second-year student at Nekoma and a wing spiker for the volleyball team. Like Tanaka, he has a tendency to lash out, but also has bad luck when it comes to girls.

:Kenma is a second-year student at Nekoma High and a setter for the volleyball team. He is an introvert, choosing to play video games instead of playing outside and doesn't interact well with people. But he is very skilled at volleyball, since he comes up with excellent strategies after observing the opposite team. He is childhood friends with Kuroo. He also became good friends with Hinata after meeting by coincidence when the both of them happened to get lost. Their encounter had taken place before they'd met officially for a practice game between their schools. He is considered the 'backbone', 'brain', and 'heart' for the Nekoma team, and all of his teammates are very protective of him and admire him greatly. It is shown that he texts Hinata often, revealing that even though they have opposite personalities, they are still good friends with each other.

:Inuoka is a first-year at Nekoma and a middle blocker. Like Hinata, he has an excitable and positive personality. He is the first player who was able to stop Hinata and Kageyama's weird quick strike fully.

He becomes good friends with Hinata, even though they were playing as rivals.

;{{nihongo|Kenji Futakuchi|二口 堅二|Futakuchi Kenji}}
:{{voiced by|[[Masatomo Nakazawa]]|Mark Ivy<ref name=":0" />}}
:Futakuchi is a second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker. He becomes the captain once Moniwa retires. He and Kamasaki always argue and don't get along. Since he was pretty laid back before he became captain, taking care of their new hyped up setter, Koganegawa reminds him of how he used to cause problems for his seniors. He is usually seen together with Aone, while taking breaks in between matches, and also at school, being the same class. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match.

;{{nihongo|Takanobu Aone|青根 高伸|Aone Takanobu}}
:{{voiced by|Hiroki Matsukawa|Mike Haimoto<ref name=":0" />}}
:Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He has a scary face, but is actually very kind. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team, as soon as he met them. He establishes a bond with Hinata after he loses 2-0 against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama and later also advises Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat.

:Koganegawa is the first-year setter who becomes regular after the third-years are retired from the tournament. Even though he is exceptionally tall for a setter, which is his primary strength, he is very green in setting, as seen when he sets a ball to Futakuchi with a 'frigging' high angle, and also when he sets the ball towards Aone, the ball ends up caught by their coach instead. He has an extremely energetic personality and believes that a player should give everything they have in a game. He, too, later ends up being friends with Hinata.

:Bokuto is a third year student at Fukurodani Academy, and is the captain and wing spiker of its volleyball team. He is called 'simple-minded' by his teammates and is easily flattered by praise, as shown by Hinata and his teammates. He especially like praise from Akaashi, and has begged him for it. In spite of this, he is a very talented volleyball player, being one of the top 5 aces in the country. He causes trouble for his team with his extreme mood swings, but also forms their main strength, as he isn't bothered by how string the opposite team is. Takeda also notes that Bokuto is a "weird" player who can lift up the ambition and spirit of both his teammates and rivals.

===Shiratorizawa Academy===
The word 'Shiratori' in the school name "Shiratorizawa" means 'swan'. They have been the undefeated champions in the prefecture. Their play style centers around the powerful "left cannon", i.e., around the ace wing spiker. Coach Ukai Jr. has commented that the Shiratori team's power is more of an addition of each player's strength, as compared to other teams' multiplication, since each player only plays to his own skills.

:{{voiced by|[[Subaru Kimura]]}}<ref name="Shiratorizawa"/>
:Tendō is a third year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a middle blocker for the volleyball team. He is known as the 'Guess Monster' as his blocking style is guess blocking, which involves guessing which spiker the opposite team's setter will pass the ball to, and also where the spiker will hit the ball. His guesses are known to be either 120% or 0%, since if they are right, he will block them for sure, but if they are wrong, there is no way he can stop them.
