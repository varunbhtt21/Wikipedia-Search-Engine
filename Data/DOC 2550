'''Luca Lazar''' or '''Luka Lasareishvili''' ({{lang-ka|ლუკა ლასარეიშვილი}}) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n artist. He was born on 14 November 1957 in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (former [[Soviet Union]]). He studied at the [[Tbilisi State Academy of Arts|Tbilisi State Art Academy]] from 1976 to 1982 from which he graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts degree. Since 1982 he has been working as an independent, professional artist and participated in numerous solo- and group exhibitions in galleries and museums. He has worked in a variety of media: painting, installations, object and video art. From 1985 until 1988 Lazar lived and worked in [[Moscow]], Russia. He then moved on to [[Paris]], France. The following year, 1989, Lazar spent in [[Kassel]], Germany as an artist-in-residence with the [[Fridericianum|Museum Fridericianum]]. From 1990 until 2003 Lazar lived and worked in [[Cologne]], Germany. During his time in Germany, sweeping changes were taking place in his native region that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the declaration of independence of Georgia and was followed by armed conflicts and civil war in his country of origin. As Lazar was unable to return, he stayed on in Germany, where he eventually received citizenship. From 1997 until 2005 he held a position as lecturer at the [http://www.eka-trier.de/index.html European Academy of Fine Arts] in [[Trier]], Germany. In 2003 Lazar relocated to [[New York City]], United States, where he has continued his artistic career.

By the late 1990s Lazar started to concentrate mainly on geometrical art, which was followed by [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimal abstract]] explorations, resulting in a series titled "The White Curtain" and a series titled "One-liners". From this point onward Lazar started to develop his own signature style, based on minimal abstract art, [[geometric art]], [[Op art|optical art]] and containing important undertones of [[Expressionism|expressionist art]], which resulted in works that are unlike any existing art direction or style. These works provide a sensation of continuous flowing movement in space, hence their title "[http://www.24saati.ge/weekend/story/27097-moving-stills-anu-portreti-modzrav-kadrebshi Moving Stills]"

The underlying principle of the works of "Moving Stills" has been described as:

''“controlled energy, raw powers created through and at the same time restricted by spatial structures and the arrangement of interlocking lines. Using a reduced vocabulary of minimalist forms, the untitled individual works in this series provide the suggestion of energetic movement within a motionless, frozen setting. The works are not informed by any kind of anticipation of what the viewer may or may not see in them, but rather are to be understood by making the actual attempt of leaving the ways of perception behind that we are so accustomed to, in order to be “felt” quite intuitively in an act of self-communication.”'' (source Marcel Krenz, art critic, in Catalogue “Luca Lazar: Moving Stills” Gallery Schüppenhauer Köln,  {{ISBN|3-926226-59-5}})
