*'''ALT1''' ... that it was wrongly said that [[Frank Crocker]] killed himself after building the pub now called '''[[Crocker's Folly]]''' in the wrong place?" [[User:Philafrenzy|Philafrenzy]] ([[User talk:Philafrenzy|talk]]) 21:30, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks. I think I prefer your ALT1. [[User:Edwardx|Edwardx]] ([[User talk:Edwardx|talk]]) 21:52, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] for ALT1 - it's simple and to the point. Date, length and hook are fine. Article is well-referenced, neutral, and doesn't appear to have any close paraphrasing. QPQ done. GTG. [[User:97198|97198]] ([[User talk:97198|talk]]) 12:05, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
