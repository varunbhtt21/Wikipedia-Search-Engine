The '''Bar Council of India''' is a [[statutory body]] that regulates and represents the Indian bar. It was created by Parliament under the Advocates Act, 1961. It prescribes standards of [[professional conduct]], [[etiquette]] and exercises disciplinary jurisdiction over the bar. It also sets standards for [[legal education]] and grants recognition to universities whose degree in law will serve as a qualification for students to enroll themselves as advocates upon graduation.<ref name=aboutBCI>{{cite web|title=About the Bar Council of India|url=http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/about-the-bar-council-of-india/|publisher=Bar Council of India|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

== Lawyers Collective v. Bar Council of India and Others ==
This case arose because of the petition filed against the foreign law firms who had obtained permission from the RBI to set up liaison offices, the ultimate question framed by the Court was whether the ‘practice of law’ included litigious and non-litigious work. The question therefore expanded beyond the scope of permissibility of such law firms practising in India.

Even in the absence of this judgement, there was never any doubt that a foreign law firm cannot carry on any revenue-generating activities in India. By stating that liaison offices of such firms carry on non-litigious practice, the Court does seem to have indulged in a degree of conjecture. This has in turn led to the conclusion that even a liaison office is involved in the same nature of work as an Indian law firm that carries on non-litigious practice, necessitating a discussion on the meaning of the expression ‘practice of law’ as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2010_3/gitanjali-shankar-and-amba-uttara-kak.pdf|title = LITIGATION VERSUS NON-LITIGATION: ‘PRACTICE OF LAW’ UNDER THE ADVOCATES ACT|author1 = Shankar, Gitanjali |author2 = Amba Uttara Kak|date = October 1, 2010|journal = NUJS Law Review|access-date = January 3, 2015}}</ref>
