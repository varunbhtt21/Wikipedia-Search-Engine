He changes his mind, however, and in an altercation with Rudolph Kluck (Schenck) strikes that gentleman down, loads him into a passing cab, and changes clothes with him. With the money he found on Kluck, he goes to the United States, taking on the name David Carson, and while passing through Madison Square accosts an out of work jockey sitting on a bench. The latter gives him a tip on the races and they become fast friends. Carson also plunges into [[Wall Street]] and [[Cornering the market|corners the market]] in cotton. He saves Doris Bancroft (Clarke) from drowning and falls in love with her. Kluck again crosses his path and Carson gives him some tips on the stock market to atone for robbing him in London. Kluck has an affair with Russian writer Madame Marinoff (Astor) and asks Carson to shield him and secure a packet of letters that the Russian holds. Doris misinterprets Carson's interest in the Russian, but there is a happy ending when she learns the truth.
