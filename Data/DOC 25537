::The issue with Alt 1 is being discussed at [[Talk:The Convention Conundrum#Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting: references]]. Any input would be appreciated - the conversation hasn't had a response in a couple of weeks. I am happy with both hooks, but would probably prefer Alt 1. [[User:Bilorv|'''Bilorv''']] [[User talk:Bilorv|(talk)]]  16:54, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

I strongly prefer the original hook anyway. Is there any reason not to proceed with that version? It appears it has already passed Cat's review. [[User:Maury Markowitz|Maury Markowitz]] ([[User talk:Maury Markowitz|talk]]) 12:48, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
:I've fixed the issue with Alt 1 now but if you "strongly prefer" the original then I see no reason not to go forward with that one. [[User:Bilorv|'''Bilorv''']] [[User talk:Bilorv|(talk)]]  14:11, 29 May 2014 (UTC)
::I'm a little uncomfortable with the sentence as it stands, and certainly with the barelink refs. If you're going to rely on the episodes, then it would be best to wikilink the episode titles to the articles, and use a properly formatted citation. - [[User:SchroCat|SchroCat]] ([[User talk:SchroCat|talk]]) 12:07, 30 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Okay, how about now? I've formatted it as a note and put refs inside the note. In any case, the original hook seemed like the one we were going to use. [[User:Bilorv|'''Bilorv''']] [[User talk:Bilorv|(talk)]]  13:53, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] Good to go, especially with the main hook. - [[User:SchroCat|SchroCat]] ([[User talk:SchroCat|talk]]) 14:02, 30 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
