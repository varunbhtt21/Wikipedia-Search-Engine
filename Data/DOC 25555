Title : History of rail transport in Indonesia
Text : {{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}
The first '''railway''' lines in [[Indonesia]] were constructed during the [[Indo people#Dutch East Indies (1800 - 1949)|Dutch colonial rule]]. After independence in 1945, many lines were abandoned. The current national rail operator, [[Kereta Api Indonesia|PT Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero)]], was founded on 28 September 1945.

==Pre-independence era==

===First railway line===

Indonesia ([[Dutch East Indies]]) is the second country in Asia to establish a rail transport, after India; China and Japan were next to follow.<ref name="kompas-ambarawa">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=142 Tahun Stasiun Ambarawa - Wisata Sejarah Kereta Api Indonesia |work=heritage.kereta-api.co.id, PT Kereta Api Indonesia |publisher=Kompas |location= |id= |pages= |page=12 |date=23 May 2015 |language=Indonesian |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> On 7 June 1864, Governor General [[Ludolph Anne Jan Wilt Sloet van de Beele|Baron Sloet van den Beele]] initiated the first railway line in Indonesia on Kemijen village, [[Semarang]], Central Java.<ref name="kompas-ambarawa"/> It began operations on 10 August 1867 in Central Java and connected the first built Semarang station to Tanggung for 25 kilometers.<ref name="kompas-ambarawa"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wartakota.tribunnews.com/2014/03/01/dimanakah-stasiun-kereta-api-pertama-di-indonesia-ini-jawabannya |title=Dimanakah Stasiun Kereta Api Pertama di Indonesia?

This line was operated by a private company, '''''Nederlands-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij''''' (NIS: Netherlands East Indies Railway Company) and used the {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}} gauge. Later construction by both private and state railway companies used the {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} gauge.

The liberal Dutch government of the era was then reluctant to build its own railway, preferring to give a free rein to [[private enterprise]]s. However, private railways could not provide the expected return of investment (even NIS required some financial assistance from the government), and the Dutch Ministry of Colonies finally approved a state railway system, the '''''Staatsspoorwegen''''' (State Railway), extending from Buitenzorg (now [[Bogor]]) in the west, to [[Surabaya]] in the east. Construction began from both ends, the first line (from Surabaya) being opened on 16 May 1878, and both cities were connected by 1894.

By the 1920s, the system in Java had reached its greatest extent, with most towns and cities connected by rail, with branches and tramways connecting sugar plantations to factories.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s put laid to plans of constructing railway lines in [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], connecting the lines in Sumatra and electrification of the lines in Java.

After the Dutch state started railway construction, private enterprises did not completely get out of the picture, and at least 15 light railway companies operated in Java. These companies operated as  "steam tram companies", but despite the name, were better described as regional secondary lines.

===Java===

As befits a colonial enterprise, most railway lines in Indonesia had a dual purpose: economic and strategic. In fact, a condition for the financial assistance for the NIS was that the company build a railway line to [[Ambarawa]], which had an important fort named [[William I of the Netherlands|Willem I]] for the Dutch king. The first state railway line was built through the mountains on the southern part of Java, instead of the flat regions on the north, for a similar strategic reason. The state railway in Java connected [[Anyer]] on the western coast of the island, to [[Banyuwangi]] on the eastern coast.

===Sumatra===

In [[Sumatra]], railways were first used for military purposes, with a railway line connecting [[Banda Aceh]] and its port of [[Ulèëlheuë|Uleelhee]] in 1876. This railway, the '''''Atjeh Staats Spoorwegen''''' (ASS), first built to a {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge which was later [[gauge conversion|regauged]] to {{RailGauge|750mm|lk=on}} and extended south. This line was only transferred to the Ministry of Colonies from the Ministry of War on 1 January 1916, following the relative [[Peace|pacification]] of Aceh.

The Western Sumatra's state railway in the Minangkabau area, the '''''Staatsspoorwegen ter Sumatra's Westkust''''' (SSS) transported coal from inland mines to the port at Padang and was built between 1891 and 1894

The Southern Sumatra's state railway, the '''''Staatsspoorwegen op Zuid-Sumatra''''' (ZSS), was completed in the 1930s. It served a fertile plantation area and an important coal mine.

Another important private railway line was the '''[[Deli Spoorweg Maatschappij]]''''' (Deli Railway Company). This line served regions producing rubber and tobacco in Deli.

===Sulawesi===
Between July 1922 and 1930, a {{convert|47|km|mi}}-long railway line operated in South [[Sulawesi]]. This line was to be extended to North Sulawesi, as part of a massive project of railway construction in [[Borneo]] and Sulawesi, connection of separate railway systems in Sumatra and [[Railway electrification|electrification]] of the main lines in Java. The [[Great Depression]] of 1929 put paid to these plans.

===Japanese occupation===
During the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Japanese]] occupation between 1942 and 1945, the different railway lines in Java were managed as one entity. The Sumatra systems, being under the administration of [[Imperial Japanese Navy|a different branch of the Japanese armed forces]], remained separate.

The occupiers also converted the ({{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}} lines in Java into {{RailGauge|1067mm}}, thereby resolving the [[dual gauge]] issue. This was not an actual "problem" as there was not much transfer of materials between the systems, and much of the {{RailGauge|1435mm|disp=1}} system had been fitted with a third rail by 1940, creating a mixed-gauge railway. Many locomotives were seized and transported to [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Burma]] and elsewhere.

==Independence era==
During the war for independence between 1945 and 1949, [[freedom fighter]]s took over the railways, creating the first direct predecessor to today's PT Kereta Api, the '''Djawatan Kereta Api Repoeblik Indonesia''' (Railway Bureau of the Republic of Indonesia), on 28 September 1945. This date, not the 1867 one, is regarded as the birth date of Indonesian railways and commemorated as Railway Day every year, due to political ground.

On the other hand, the Dutch created its own combined railway system to manage the lines located on its [[Military occupation|occupied]] territory, the '''''Verenigd Spoorwegbedrijf''''' (Combined Railways). By the time of Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence, the VS had most railway lines under its management, though not all were in operation.

With Indonesia's full independence in 1949, the separate systems (except the Deli Railway) were combined into the '''Djawatan Kereta Api'''. Non-state railway systems in Java retained their paper existence until 1958, when all railway lines in Indonesia were [[nationalization|nationalized]], including the Deli Railway, thereby creating the '''Perusahaan Negara Kereta Api''' (PNKA: State Railway Corporation) in 1963.<ref>1963 Indonesian Government's Regulation No. 22</ref> On 15 September 1971 the name of PNKA was changed to '''''Perusahaan Jawatan Kereta Api''''' ('''PJKA''', the Indonesian Railway Systems).<ref>1971 Indonesian Government's Regulation No. 61</ref> Later then, on 2 January 1991, PJKA was changed its name and status as '''''Perusahaan Umum Kereta Api''''' ('''Perumka''', the Indonesian Railways Public Company),<ref>1990 Indonesian Government's Regulation No. 57</ref> and since 1 June 1999, this company was changed to a [[limited company]], '''''PT Kereta Api (Persero)''''' ('''PT KA''').<ref>1998 Indonesian Government's Regulation No. 19, 1999 President's Decree No. 39, and Imas Fatimah's Notarial Document</ref> On May 2010, the name of "PT KA" was changed to '''''PT Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero)''''' ('''PT KAI''', The Indonesian Railways Company) till present.<ref>2010 The Indonesian Railways Directors' Decree No. 16/OT.203/KA 2010</ref> <!--- THIS IS A CORRECT DATE, DON'T CHANGE IT! -->

The headquarters of the state railway system, since Dutch colonial days, had been located in [[Bandung]], West Java. Private railway companies were headquartered elsewhere, in [[Semarang]], [[Tegal (city)|Tegal]], [[Surabaya]] and [[Medan]].
