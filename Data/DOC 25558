Title : Texas transfer
Text : {{refimprove|date=December 2018}}
'''Texas transfer''', or simply '''Texas''', is a [[bidding convention]] in [[contract bridge]]. Originated independently by David Carter of St. Louis and Olle Willner of Sweden,<ref name ="OEB7325">{{OEB|7|325}}</ref> and used in response to a notrump opening when holding a six-card or longer major suit, game-going points and no interest in slam, its objective is to make the notrump opener the declarer in a game contract in the major suit.

After a notrump opening, responder bids the suit below<ref>In bridge, the suits are ranked with spades the highest, hearts next, then diamonds and clubs as lowest.</ref> his major at the four-level, i.e. if he holds hearts, he bids 4{{diamonds}} and if he holds spades, he bids 4{{hearts}}.  Opener is obliged to bid the next available major suit, i.e. after a 4{{diamonds}} bid by responder, he bids 4{{hearts}} and after a 4{{hearts}} response, he bids 4{{spades}} setting the contract.

In the variant known as ''South African Texas'', responses of 4{{clubs}} and 4{{diamonds}} are used as transfers to hearts and spades respectively.

The standard defense to the Texas Transfer: double is one-suited and lead-directing, 4NT is for the minors, four of responderâ€™s suit is a [[Michaels cuebid]]. A delayed double after opener accepts the transfer is a three-suited takeout.<ref name = OEB7325/>

Both Texas and South African Texas transfers may also be used as opening pre-emptive bids. A 4{{clubs}} and 4{{diamonds}} can show a slightly different hand type (usually stronger) compared to a direct 4{{hearts}} or 4{{spades}} opening.
