*'''Keep''' I don't see the problem here.  It's a real album by a notable artist.  Additionally it's a large page full of sources by an artist who also has a large article with plenty of sources.  This applies to many of the albums nominated below too.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[User talk:Xania|<sup>talk</sup>]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Xania<sup>WB talk</sup>]] 21:48, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
** '''Comment''' Yes, it's a real album by a notable artist. Did you read WP:NALBUMS? It states, "that an album is an officially released recording by a notable musician or ensemble is not by itself reason for a standalone article." It's not a large page at all actually. It's quite short. It's also not full of sources, it only has three. One source is nothing more than a track listing of everything that Diante do Trono has released. One is a self-published source by the band. The third does not discuss the album, it discusses "gospel music" sales in Brazil.

** '''Comment''' The obsession with quoting policies (see MAD) is what's wrong with Wikipedia.  Discussions should take place about the worth of the article and not just an incomprehensible stream of policy links.  Yes, I did read WP:NALBUMS but it was very long and tedious like most similar pages.  I stopped paying attention after ''Failing to satisfy the notability guidelines is not a criterion for speedy deletion'' because that just says it all.  If you want something deleted argue your point rather than policies.  Do you guys not realise why people get pissed off with Wikipedia so much.  Just how long are you going to keep this AfD open?  Maybe until someone comes along to vote delete and post a list of policies which it might violate.  Yawn.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[User talk:Xania|<sup>talk</sup>]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Xania<sup>WB talk</sup>]] 16:11, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
** Discussions related to keeping or deleting an article are judged on whether they are policy-based. Feel free to make any other arguments you want, they will carry as much weight as those based on policy.
