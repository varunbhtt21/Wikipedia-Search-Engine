{{Politics of the British Virgin Islands}}
Since the restoration of democracy in the British Virgin Islands in 1950, only a comparatively small number of persons have
been elected to political office.  Although elections are held approximately every three or four years, the small size of the legislative body<ref>In the first [[1950 British Virgin Islands general election|general election in 1950]] only four members were elected; this was steadily increased until [[1995 British Virgin Islands general election|in 1995]] it grew to 13, which is the size it is presently.</ref> and the tendency to return incumbent politicians<ref>For example, [[Lavity Stoutt]] won the 1st District in 11 consecutive elections.  [[Ralph O'Neal]] won the 7th/9th District in 10 consecutive elections.  The 3rd District has been won by [[Julian Fraser]], his brother Earl, or his cousin Oliver Cills, every year since 1971.  In five consecutive elections from 1979 to 1995 just under half the legislature was ever-present: Stoutt, O'Neal, [[Omar Hodge]] and Oliver Cills.</ref> has resulted in a relatively small aggregate number.

Prior to the [[1967 British Virgin Islands general election|1967 general election]] legislators were elected on a non-party basis. However, many persons who were elected in those early elections later went on to form, or stand for, [[List of political parties in the British Virgin Islands|political parties]].

In addition to politicians who were elected by popular mandate, various other political positions are filled by appointment. These include:
* The [[Governor of the British Virgin Islands]]
* The [[Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands]]
* The [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|Speaker of the House of Assembly of the
British Virgin Islands]]
* Prior to 1967, certain members of the Legislative Council (as the House of Assembly was formerly named) were appointed rather than elected.

==List of elected politicians==
A total of 64 people have been elected to serve in the Legislature of the British Virgin Islands; 56 were men, and eight were women.  Of those 64, just over half (33) have only served a single term or less.

| [[Ralph T. O'Neal]] <ref>In terms of time spent in the legislature, Ralph O'Neal is the longest serving politician in British Virgin Islands history, having served in the House of Assembly and Legislative Council for 39 years, 280 days.  Although Lavity Stoutt has won more election victories than O'Neal, Stoutt served a shorter period in the Legislature because (a) he only served a small part of his 11th and final term prior to his death, and (b) during the early part of Stoutt's career, political terms were only 3 years and not 4.</ref>
