The restaurant features her specialty dishes along with Chef Suzette Montinola, the granddaughter of Dr. Alejandro Roces Legarda and Doña Ramona, who is also the one who manages the establishment.<ref name="Margaux Salcedo PDI">{{cite news|last=Salcedo|first=Margaux|title=Home away from home|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/141135/home-away-from-home|accessdate=May 3, 2014|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=December 7, 2013}}</ref>
