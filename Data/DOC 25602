'''[[Ethiopia]]''' issued '''[[revenue stamp]]s''' from when it was an independent empire onwards.<ref name="doig"/>

==Revenue==
Ethiopia's first revenues were issued in 1930. The earliest issue consisted of four stamps printed by [[Waterlow and Sons]], with a [[Lion of Judah]] in the centre. This issue exists either with a background design of ornamental scallops or with a plain background.

The [[Ethiopian Empire]] fell to Italy at the end of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] in 1936. During the Italian occupation, various revenue stamps inscribed ''Africa Italiana'', ''Africa Orientale Italiana'' ([[Italian East Africa]]) or ''Colonie Italiane'' were used in Ethiopia, as well as in [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. The cities of [[Addis Ababa]], [[Dire Dawa|Dire Daua]] and [[Gondar]] also issued municipal revenue issues.

In the ensuing period, postage stamps were initially overprinted for fiscal use, and later a new set similar to the 1930 issue was printed. The stamps still depicted the Lion of Judah. Between 1948 and 1964, these were issued several times, denominated in [[Maria Theresa thaler|Maria Theresa Dollars]] or [[Ethiopian birr]].

After the Derg came to power during the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], revenue stamps were issued in a similar design to the imperial issues but with different coats of arms and inscriptions. These exist for the [[Derg|Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia]], the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] and the [[Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]].

The emblems which appeared on Ethiopian revenue stamps are as follows:

The Chamber of Commerce of [[Addis Abeba]] had its own revenues from 1949 to 1969. When Eritrea was part of Ethiopia, it still had [[Revenue stamps of Eritrea#Part of Ethiopia (1952 to 1991)|separate revenues]] until the 1960s.
