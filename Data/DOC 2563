Fails [[WP:PORNBIO]] as the  Gay Erotic Video Awards is not a "well-known and significant industry award". An internet search reveals no indication that this individual passes [[WP:GNG]] [[User:Finnegas|Finnegas]] ([[User talk:Finnegas|talk]]) 21:22, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - The subject here may have won an award for "Best Bottom", which, as far as I can tell, does not appear to be a major or "significant" award at the [[Gay_Erotic_Video_Awards#Gay_Erotic_Video_Awards|Gay Erotic Video Awards]]. Whether or not the Gay Erotic Video Awards are a "well-known industry award" is unknown to me. [[User:Guy1890|Guy1890]] ([[User talk:Guy1890|talk]]) 19:22, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
