==Programs==

'''Night Care Center (NCC) Program'''

The NCC was conceptualized for the first time worldwide in 1986 at the [[Kamathipura]] red light area in Mumbai. It provides a safe place for women in prostitution to protect their children from the dangers of the red light district during the night. The NCC; functioning out of the Kamathipura, [[Falkland Road]] and [[Vashi]] provides a package of services on a 24-7 basis such as shelter, nutrition, healthcare, education, recreation, and so on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afternoondc.in/feature/prerna-burning-bright-for-kids-of-the-night/article_6013|title=Prerana's Night Care Center}}</ref>  

'''Educational Support Program'''

Prerana instituted the first comprehensive Educational Support Program (ESP) in India for children from red light areas. The ESP works with children and addresses their needs in education as well as personal and professional development. The ESP provides complementary and remedial education, extra-curricular activities, life skills education, and personal development inputs. The ESP also sponsors older children for vocational training programs. Prerana runs 3 ESPs in the Mumbai red light districts of Kamathipura and Falkland Road and Vashi Turbhe in [[Navi Mumbai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/221040.pdf|title=Prerana's ESP}}</ref>

'''Institutional Placement Program (IPP)'''

When the mother of a child approaches Prerana with a request to de-link the child from the red light area, and place him or her into a healthy environment, Prerana supports the mother to consider the option of shifting the child to a place that can provide long term residential care and development. Prerana selects the institutions, pays follow-up visits to the institutions which involve the [[Child Welfare Committee]], and provides initiatives for support like mother’s meetings, counseling and group homes. The system ensures that children are given access to residential institutional care until they can return to a safe environment or until they turn 18 years of age. Currently, the IPP has impacted over 1200 children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kamonohashi-project.net/english/img/Dasra-HT-Kamo%20Research%20Report%20Zero%20Traffick.pdf|title=Prerana's IPP}}</ref>

Prerana has been successful in influencing Indian policy making at various levels. The organization was instrumental in persuading the government to integrate a child trafficking policy into the country's 1998 National Plan. Following a public interest litigation filed in 2010 on the rehabilitation of sex workers, one of Prerana's founders, [[Priti Patkar]], was appointed onto a Supreme Court panel to recommend possible amendments to the [[Prostitution in India#Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act - ITPA|Immoral Traffic Prevention Act of 1956.]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Legalizing-prostitution-Lets-put-a-pin-in-it/articleshow/45009389.cms|title=Legalizing prostitution?
