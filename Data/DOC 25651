== Review ==
This album is a heavy and melodic revelation from the new band Grand General consisting of some very prolific musicians from the Norwegian prog, jazz, rock scene. They started out as Kenneth Kapstad Group giving some gigs with this impressive lineup and is out with a more fitting name for their debut album. With the much gifted violinist Ola Kvernberg, who was awarded Jazz [[Spellemannprisen]], the Norwegian Grammy, for his album ''Liarbird'' (2011). The lines to the Mahavishnu Orchestra is obvious, when trying to place Grand General in a musical perspective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/grand-general-grand-general-rune-grammofon-review-by-john-kelman.php#.U2SzKYF_uSo |title=Grand General: Grand General (2013)  |work=Musical review |first=John |last=Kelman |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2014-05-03 |publisher=[[All About Jazz]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.runegrammofon.com/artists/grand-general/rcd-2139-grand-general-grand-general-cd |title=Ola Kvernberg – Liarbird Review |author=Ingvill Bagøien |date=2011-09-25 |accessdate=2012-10-30 |publisher=Radiorevolt.no}}</ref>
