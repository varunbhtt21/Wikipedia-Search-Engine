==Updates==
Due to the precision used in the automatic calculation of the currently projected population, a rounding error occurs in the output and this needs to be compensated for periodically in order to reduce this error, or else the error will compound over time. This is most easily achieved by using the figures presented at the official population clock at 00:00 UTC on any day.

This template is used in a number of articles and these need to be checked and corrected as shown in the following table to ensure consistency:

For consistency, it is recommended that the following edit summary be used when updating articles:
::''Australian population estimate has been updated based on current data at official population clock to compensate for rounding error''
