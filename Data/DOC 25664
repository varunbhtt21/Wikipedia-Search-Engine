'''EVolution''' is a research project funded by the European Commission under The [http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm 7th Framework Programme] in the [http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/pdf/european-green-cars-initiative-ppp_en.pdf Green Cars initiative]. It started 1 October 2012 with a duration of 4 years. The objective of the project is to develop new materials which will significantly reduce the weight of the new generation of hybrid- and electrical vehicles.

Advanced materials are used to enable the development of novel super-lightweight hybrid components complying with safety standards and recycling constraints, and enable the design leading to a weight reduction of 40% over that achieved using the current state of the art in the SuperLIGHT-CAR project. The EVolution goal is to demonstrate the sustainable production of a 600&nbsp;kg weight FEV by the end of 2015. The base for the industrial demonstrator is the [[Pininfarina Nido|NIDO]] from [[Pininfarina]]. To this end EVolution addresses the whole vehicle by prototyping, assembling, and disassembling, the most representative components made from raw polymers and aluminum alloys commonly used in the automotive industry, to ensure compliance with EC Directive 2000/53/EC ‘End-of life vehicle’ which imposes stringent requirements on the disposal and recycling of motor vehicles. The project is coordinated by Professor, PhD [[Jesper deClaville Christiansen]] and the technical coordination by Pininfarina.
