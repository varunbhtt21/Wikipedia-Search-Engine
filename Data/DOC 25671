'''Goffers Knoll''' is a prominent knoll on the Hertfordshire-Cambridgeshire border in the east of England, to the east of the town of [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] and south of [[Melbourn]]. It is formed from a spur of the chalk uplands to the west which go on to form the [[Chiltern Hills]]. The knoll, standing some 60m above sea level is clearly visible from the [[A505 road]] which runs to the south.

Hidden within the [[copse]] of trees which surmounts the knoll is a [[bowl barrow]] which dates from the [[bronze age]] and is reported to be substantially intact. It is a [[scheduled ancient monument]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1011715 |desc=Bowl barrow on Goffers Knoll|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The barrow is 21m in diameter and stands some 1.5m in height above ground level. In the absence of trees, the barrow would be a prominent landmark overlooking the ancient [[Icknield Way|Icknield way]] (the current route of the A505) and the low-lying land towards [[Duxford]] and [[Cambridge]]. Excavcations of the barrow were carried out by [[Richard Neville, 4th Baron Braybrooke|RC Neville]] in the mid 19th Century<ref>{{cite book |last= Neville |first=R.
