==History==
The first Catholic community in [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]] was organized by [[Friar|Fray]] Pedro Bautista (later canonized as [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan|San Pedro de Bautista]]) as a ''[[Chapel of ease|visita]]'' of [[Paete, Laguna|Paete]] in 1588. It was separated from Paete in 1676.<ref name=":2">{{harvnb|National Historical Institute|1993|p=88}}</ref>  [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Father]] Francisco de Barajas, a priest from [[Santa Ana Church (Manila)|Santa Ana de Sapa Church]] in [[Manila]], was named as the first parish priest in May 12, 1676.<ref name="Huerta157">{{harvnb|Huerta|1865|p=157}}</ref> The first church was constructed of bamboo, [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]] and other light materials, by volunteers under the patronage of [[Peter of Alcantara]].<ref name=":2" />

In 1684, the government, through Governor General Gabriel Curuscalegui, approved the collection of a tribute for five years for the sole purpose of constructing a stone church.<ref name="Huerta158">{{harvnb|Huerta|1865|p=158}}</ref> The foundation was laid in 1732 during the term of Father Fernando Haro, but it burned down in 1739.<ref name="Huerta158" /> It was begun again, and the construction of the church finished in 1767 with the addition of a tower in 1777.<ref name=":2" /> The image of Our Lady of Turumba was unveiled in 1788.<ref name=":2" /> In 1840, Father Joaquin de Coria repaired the church, but because of a fire in 1851 which ravaged most of the town, Father Juan de Llanera fixed the damages to the church the following year.<ref name="Huerta158" /> Father Juan de Dios de Villayos rebuilt the church roof and bell tower after it was damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and the church was rebuilt again in 1883 by Father Paulino Camba.<ref name=":2" /> Damaged by the earthquake of 1937, it was repaired again by Father Federico Diaz Pines with the help of the Confederation of United Catholics (''Kapisanang Unidad Catolica'').<ref name=":2" /> During [[World War II]], the church suffered damage and was later renovated. A major repair was done from 1980 to 1984, when a story of the bell tower was rebuilt and the ceiling was renovated under the Parish Council of the Laity.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url = http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?subcat=13&i=24|title = Falling for Turumba|accessdate = 3 May 2014|publisher = The National Commission for Culture and the Arts|last = Alba|first = Reinerio|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140503152433/http://ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?subcat=13&i=24|archivedate = 3 May 2014|df = }}</ref>
