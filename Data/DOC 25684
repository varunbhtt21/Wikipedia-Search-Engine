The '''Gaiety Theater''' is a stand-alone art deco cinema house located at [[M.H. del Pilar Street]] in the [[Ermita]] district of the city of [[Manila]]. It was designed by [[Juan Nakpil]], [[National Artist of the Philippines]] for Architecture, in 1935.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.lougopal.com/manila/?p=808|title = Malate â€“ Ermita District: Part 1|date = |accessdate = |website = Manila Nostalgia|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The construction of these early theaters in the [[Manila|City of Manila]] provided the venue for early forms of entertainment like bodabil, a local adaptation of [[vaudeville]], with most eventually converting to movie theaters with the growth and popularity of [[Philippine cinema]] in the metropolis.

==History==
The Gaiety Theater was first owned by Harry Brown, the American producer of ''[[La vida de Jose Rizal]]'', the first feature film produced in the Philippines.<ref name="pelikula">{{cite book | url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:9000/rpc/cat/finders/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v8/v2.pdf | title=Pelikula: an essay on the Philippine film, 1897-1960 | publisher=Sentrong Pangkultura ng Pilipinas | author=Sotto, Agustin | year=1992}}</ref> It was known for showing art films patronized by expats and old Spanish families. During the [[Second World War]], its operation was stopped until Karl Nathan obtained permission from the Japanese authorities to reopen it, which at the time was owned by a prominent Filipino family with whom Nathan had struck an agreement, provided he could get the Japanese permit. Tickets to this theater during the Japanese occupation were cheap as compared to other movie houses in downtown Manila.<ref>Frank Ephraim, Escape to Manila: From Nazi Tyranny to Japanese Terror, University of Illinois Press. 2008 p 113 {{ISBN|0252075269}}</ref><ref>Dero Pedero: [http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/183400/do-you-remember-berg%C2%92s-banlon-and-coco-banana Do you remember Berg's, Banlon and Coco Banana?]</ref> The theater was also used as a place of worship by the [[Cosmopolitan Church|Jesus is Lord Cosmopolitan Church]].<ref>Jonathan Patadlas: [http://thecosmopolitanchurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SNews-March-24-2013.pdf Heritage Tour and Reunion Part 1 - A Trip Down History Lane.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503184844/http://thecosmopolitanchurch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SNews-March-24-2013.pdf |date=2014-05-03 }} Jesus is Lord Cosmopolitan Church, Volume 17, Issue 1 of 24 March 2013, page 3.</ref>

==Present==
Until it was demolished in 2016 several families acting as caretakers of the old cinema were living inside. According to them, there were efforts to resurrect the Gaiety Theater in the 1990s but it failed. As of 2014, the theater was closed and the building remained in a dilapidated state. The roof of the building collapsed years ago leaving the cinema house open to all weather elements contributing to its fast deterioration.
