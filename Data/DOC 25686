The '''Small Basilica of Philippopolis''' ({{lang-bg|Малка базилика на Филипопол}}, ''Malka bazilika na Filipopol'') is one of [[Plovdiv]]'s most distinctive landmarks. The basilica is located on Maria Louisa Blvd in the central part of [[Bulgaria]]'s second-largest city. The ruins of the early Christian church were found during construction works in the area in 1988. The three-nave basilica is an example of the exceptional skill of mosaic builders in ancient Philippopolis.

== The basilica ==
The [[basilica]] was built in the second half of the 5th century AD and contained rich architectural decoration including a marble colonnade between the [[nave]]s, a marble altar screen, a [[pulpit]], and a ''synthronon'' in the altar [[apse]]. The total length of the building is 20&nbsp;m and its width is 13&nbsp;m. Originally, it was built as a three-nave basilica with one apse and a [[narthex]]. The floors are covered with colorful [[Roman mosaic]]s with geometrical motifs. A small chapel is built against the south end of the basilica and a [[baptistery]] is attached to the northern part of the building. The total length of the church is 20&nbsp;m and its width is 13&nbsp;m. The baptistery has a square plan, and contains a cruciform baptizing pool and polychromatic mosaics. Deers, pigeons, and other Christian symbols were depicted on them.
