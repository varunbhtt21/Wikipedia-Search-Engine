Beginning April 27, 2017, Elite Airways begins its first international service, flying between [[Orlando Melbourne International Airport]] and [[South Bimini Airport]] in [[The Bahamas]].

Beginning September 28, 2017, Elite Airways began doing business as [[Cal Jet Elite]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://av-info.faa.gov/detail.asp?DSGN_CODE=19EA&OPER_FAR=121&OPER_NAME=ELITE+AIRWAYS+LLC |title = Federal Aviation Administration - Airline Certificate Information - Detail View}}</ref> and flew between [[McClellan-Palomar Airport]] in [[Carlsbad, CA]] and [[McCarran International Airport]] in [[Las Vegas, NV]].

It is unclear if Elite Airways intends to maintain the Cal Jet route; as of June 20, it is not possible to book flights on their website.<ref>https://www.caljetelite.com/find-flights</ref>

In 2018 the airline refocused its scheduled operations on the core Newark & Portland to Florida flights and has since added flights from Florida to [[Asheville, North Carolina]] and [[Traverse City, Michigan]].

{{As of|August 2016}}, the airline operates a fleet of one [[Bombardier CRJ100]] and five [[Bombardier CRJ200]] aircraft both fitted with 50 passenger seats and five [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ700]] aircraft fitted with 70 seats.<ref>[http://pwm.eliteairways.net/non-stop-online/ Non-stop Flights], ''Elite Airways'', Retrieved 2014-04-24</ref>
