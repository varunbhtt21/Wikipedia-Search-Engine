After completing his studies he got a job as a teacher at the [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium (Berlin)|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium]] in Berlin.

The [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870&ndash;1871 made the military-logistic Taubert return to the teaching profession. In 1877, he became a senior teacher at the ''Königliche Lehrerinnen-Seminar,'' and nine years later he was promoted to Intendantur-Rat, a military administrative authority, at the Royal Theater. In addition to his day job he developed an extensive literary work over the years, which attracted considerable attention from the public and literary criticism. His final resting place is at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedhöfe vor dem Halleschen Tor|de}} in Berlin.
