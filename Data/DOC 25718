Houston is within the [[Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States]].

As of 2004, there were three [[Coptic Orthodox]] churches in Houston: St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church<!--It isn't named by the source, but the Coptic Church in Bellaire *is* St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church--> in [[Bellaire, Texas|Bellaire]], the St. Mary and Archangel Michael Church in northwest [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], and the Archangel Raphael Coptic Orthodox Church in [[Clear Lake City]]. The St. Mary and Archangel Michael church began church services on July 25, 2004, had 200 families in August of that year, and had a cost of $2.5 million.<ref name=Varanewhome>Vara, Richard.

In the late 1960s there were far fewer Coptic families. Every month, a priest from [[Los Angeles]] flew to Houston and started a mass in a borrowed Orthodox church or in a private house.<ref name=Varanewhome/> From 1968 to 2006 over 600 Copt families moved to Houston. Due to [[Persecution of Copts|sectarian strife against Copts within Egypt]], by 2006 the membership of Copt churches in Houston was growing.<ref name=KatzGregory/>

In 2006 Gregory Katz of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' stated that partly because many Copt church leaders are accustomed to anti-Copt attitudes in Egypt, those who come to Houston are not accustomed to speaking freely about their religious beliefs and therefore "do not mingle easily with the rest of the large Christian community in the Houston area".<ref name=KatzGregory/>

After the [[2011 Alexandria bombing]], Houston Coptic churches cancelled their [[Coptic Christmas#Date of Christmas|Coptic Christmas]] services.<ref>Shellnutt, Kate.

Houston's [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] church is the Debre Selam Medhanealem Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church ({{lang-am|ደብረ ሰላም መድኃኔዓለም የኢትዮጵያ ኦርቶዶክስ ተዋሕዶ ቤተ ክርስቲያን}} ''Debre Selam MedhaneAlem YeItyopphya Ortodoks Tewahedo Bete Kristiyan''; the name approximately means "Sanctuary of Peace and the Savior") in [[Fondren Southwest]].<ref name=VaraEthiop>Vara, Richard.

Prior to the construction of the church, those of the Ethiopian Orthodox faith worshiped at Coptic Orthodox churches. Mesfin Genanaw, a [[Houston Community College]] teacher who was one of the individuals who assisted with the building of the church, stated that in 1992 20 Ethiopian women who were attending a Coptic church planned the establishment of an Ethiopian church. In 1993 the group purchased a {{convert|2.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} site and a tent, and conducted church services in a tent. After fundraisers were held, in 1995 construction of the permanent church started, and the church later obtained an additional {{convert|5|acre|ha}} of land. Genanaw stated in a 2003 ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' article that there are an estimated 5,000 Ethiopians in Greater Houston.<ref name=VaraEthiop/>

===Russian===
As of 2010 St. Jonah Orthodox Church, located in an [[unincorporated area]] in [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] with a [[Spring, Texas|Spring]] address, is the sole Anglophone Russian Orthodox church in the Houston area. The church began holding services in 1998. John Whiteford was the deacon and provided lay services. In 2001 Whiteford was ordained as an Orthodox priest and he became a reverend. Whiteford estimated that the church purchased its current property in 2006 and he stated that in order to purchase the construction of the new building, the church paid in cash. The ceremony to celebrate the completion of its current building was scheduled for Saturday and Sunday October 23–24, 2010. As of 2010 about 90 people attend this church.<ref name=MeeksRussian>Meeks, Flori.
