The '''San Salvador del Mundo Church''' is the parish church of [[Caraga, Davao Oriental]]. The town was established in 1861 making it one of the oldest towns in the province of Davao Oriental. When the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] took charge of the spiritual administration of the town in 1871 from the [[Augustinian Recollects]], a stone and wooden church was built in 1877 to serve as mission station of Spanish Missionaries in propagating Christianity in the eastern side of Mindanao. When it was completed in 1884, the church was dedicated to San Salvador del Mundo (Christ, the Saviour of the World).

== Location ==
San Salvador del Mundo Church is built on promontory facing the [[Pacific Ocean]] situated in Caraga’s Poblacion.

== Features ==

The San Salvador del Mundo Church is designed as a fortress church mainly made of limestone blocks,  corals and wood. The church’s main door has inscription that bears a symbol of Christ which dates the structure's foundation in 1884. The interior has undergone much renovation since the church's centenary in 1996. Traces of the dilapidated [[reredos|retablo]]s and old roofing can no longer be seen except for the remnants of [[Pterocarpus indicus|narra]] hardwood posts and lateral walls which are still intact.

The Church houses several interesting artifacts that date back during its early years in the Spanish colonial era. Its stunning features include two centuries-old giant seashells that serve as holy water font for churchgoers. There is also the [[baptismal font]], which was used during the Spanish era and is now kept at the Holy Door of San Salvador del Mundo Parish.

Other church features found at the church are the Church Bell that dates back to 1802; an antique statue of [[Isidore the Laborer|San Isidro Labrador]], the town’s patron saint, can still be seen in the altar; the centuries-old Baptismal registry which is still intact; and several antique parish records and archives which are all intact and safely kept and preserved inside a cabinet in one of the rooms of the church.

== Declaration as a National Historical Site ==

On July 16, 2012, in time of its parochial feast day, San Salvador del Mundo Church was declared a national historical site by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] (NHCP).<ref name=Declaration>{{cite news|last=Lapeña|first=Carmela G.|title=128-year-old church in Mati diocese declared national historical site|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/267539/lifestyle/artandculture/128-year-old-church-in-mati-diocese-declared-national-historical-site|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=GMA News Online|date=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

According to NHCP Executive Director Ludovico Badoy, the church is not only significant for the province of Davao Oriental but for the whole country, as San Salvador del Mundo is where Christianity began in the eastern part of the Philippines.<ref name=Declaration />

== Typhoon Pablo ==

On the morning of December 4, 2012, the 128-year San Salvador del Mundo Church held its ground against [[Typhoon Bopha|Typhoon Pablo (Bopha)]]. The monstrous typhoon flattened communities and plantations and left 1,000 dead, 800 missing and tens of thousands homeless. Miraculously, Caraga Church was spared.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lacorte|first=Germelina|title=Ancient stone church survives Typhoon ‘Pablo’|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/336167/128-year-old-church-stands-the-test-of-typhoon-pablo|accessdate=3 May 2014|newspaper=Inquirer|date=January 7, 2013}}</ref>
