The '''Broadcasting House''' or '''House of Radio''' or ({{lang-el|Ραδιομέγαρο}}, ''Radiomegaro'') is an office and broadcasting installation building in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It was constructed in 1968–69, during the [[Regime of the Colonels|military dictatorship]] for the housing of EIRT (National Radio Television Foundation), later renamed to [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ERT). It is one of the many examples of [[brutalist architecture]] in public buildings in [[Athens]].

On June 11, 2013 with the closure of ERT the redundant workers, occupied the building, which became the scene of large-scale demonstrations on the same day, on 11 September and 7 November.<ref>http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/666233/sullalitirio-gsee-adedy-tin-tetarti-sto-radiomegaro-tis-ert</ref><ref>http://www.theinsider.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=31506:kalesma-gia-syllalitirio-sto-radiomegaro-stis-1600-stasi-ergasias-kirykse-i-esiea&catid=3:society&Itemid=41</ref> On 7 November the riot police invaded, occupied and evacuated the building, evicting the workers.

On April 13, 2014, the old ERT sign was removed from the building in preparation for the installation of ERT's successor, [[New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television]]
[[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]]. On September 20, 2014, the new [[New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television|NERIT]] sign, was installed. ERT was restored in 2015.
