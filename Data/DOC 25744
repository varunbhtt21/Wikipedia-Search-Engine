The '''Saint John of Sahagun Parish Church''', locally known as the '''Candon Church''', is a church situated in the city of [[Candon]], [[Ilocos Sur]], [[Philippines]].  Constructed with an [[Earthquake Baroque]] design, the church is maintained and is still being used up to present. The church's four-storey octagonal [[bell tower]] has an alternating open and blind [[aperture]]s, a [[balustrade]] and is topped by a {{lang|it|[[campanile]]}} (bell tower).

==History==
In 1591, the [[Augustinian]]s accepted Candon as a house while Father Pedro Bravo, OSA initiated building one of the early churches in 1695. It was severely damaged in the 1707 [[earthquake]] that struck the country, but was rebuilt under the supervision of Father Jose Carbonel, OSA until 1710, and Father Diego del Castillo, OSA until 1713.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Layug|first1=Benjamin|title=A tourist guide to notable Philippine Churches.|date=2007|publisher=New Day Publication|location=Quezon City}}</ref>

==Features==
One of the highlights of this church are the two painting on canvas almost {{convert|150|ft|m}} long, representing the [[Rosary-based prayers|20 Mysteries of the Holy Rosary]]. It is said to be the longest religious painting in the Philippines. Father Vincente Avila, his cousin Mel Andino (an arts teacher), and Andino's student Redentor Castillo were the brains and hands behind the paintings, and was unveiled December 2007.
