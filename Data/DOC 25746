*'''Keep''' - The subject is a high school, and high schools [[WP:SCHOOLOUTCOMES|are very rarely deleted at AfD]] unless they are a hoax. A [https://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22Yiling+Senior+High+School%22&num=50 cursory Google search] indicates that the school exists. Note that this title is the English name of the school--the Chinese name, 夷陵中学, returns [https://www.google.com/search?as_eq=wikipedia&q=%22%E5%A4%B7%E9%99%B5%E4%B8%AD%E5%AD%A6%22&num=50 more sources] that verify its existence and satisfy [[WP:GNG]]. We should avoid [[WP:SYSTEMIC|systemic bias]] when dealing with these articles. High schools are a significant part of their respective communities and will usually produce the notability--regardless of where they are in the world. That's the rationale behind the common outcome.
