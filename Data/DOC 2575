This marked the first time Simmons had allowed a home run since May 18, 2012, his senior year in college.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Joe|title=Simmons' impressive homerless streak snapped|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140720&content_id=85389678&notebook_id=85409210&vkey=notebook_atl&c_id=atl|accessdate=July 21, 2014|publisher=MLB.com|date=July 20, 2014}}</ref> Simmons was enjoying a successful ride in the Braves bullpen until he landed on the disabled list on July 29 with shoulder soreness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-rookie-shae-simmons-on-dl-with-sore-shoulde/ngqkj/ |title=Braves rookie Shae Simmons on DL with sore shoulder |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |first=David |last=O'Brien |date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> In his first 20 appearances, he had a 0.96 ERA with 19 strikeouts and 6 walks. Simmons told reporters he "held off" telling the Braves about the tightness, thinking it wasn't "too serious". On August 20, he was temporarily shut down following an unsuccessful rehab assignment with Triple-A [[Gwinnett Braves|Gwinnett]], and he didn't return to the mound the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.braves.mlb.com/news/article/93261330/braves-reliever-shae-simmons-likely-done-for-rest-of-season |title=Reliever Simmons likely done for rest of season |publisher=MLB.com |first=Mark |last=Bowman |date=September 5, 2014}}</ref> Despite the abrupt end to his season, he impressed in a mere 21.2 innings, going 1-2 with a 2.91 ERA and 23 strikeouts to only 11 walks.

Expected to enter the season competing for the primary setup role to closer [[Craig Kimbrel]], Simmons received unfortunate news when an MRI revealed a tear to his [[Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint|UCL]] in his throwing elbow, causing him to miss the entire 2015 season. On February 12, 2015, Simmons underwent successful [[Tommy John surgery]], performed by [[James Andrews (physician)|Dr. James Andrews]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-reliever-simmons-has-elbow-surgery/nj9c7/ |title=Braves reliever Simmons has elbow surgery |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |first=David |last=O'Brien |date=February 12, 2015}}</ref> He began pitching again in May 2016, but recovery was slow, as he was affected by other minor injuries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pace|first1=Cody|title=Simmons to pitch in GCL rehab game|url=http://m.braves.mlb.com/news/article/190510432/shae-simmons-to-pitch-in-gcl-rehab-game/|accessdate=July 20, 2016|date=July 19, 2016}}</ref> The Braves recalled Simmons on August 30.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bowman|first1=Mark|title=Reliever Simmons makes it back to Majors|url=http://m.braves.mlb.com/news/article/198553028/shae-simmons-makes-it-back-to-mlb-with-braves/|accessdate=August 30, 2016|publisher=MLB.com|date=August 30, 2016}}</ref>

===Seattle Mariners===
On January 11, 2017, Simmons was traded, along with [[Mallex Smith]], to the [[Seattle Mariners]] in exchange for minor-league pitchers [[Luiz Gohara]] and [[Thomas Burrows]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mariners.mlb.com/news/article/213299828/mariners-acquire-mallex-smith-shae-simmons/|title=Mariners acquire Smith, Simmons from Braves|work=MLB.com|date=January 11, 2017|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}</ref>

===Chicago Cubs===
