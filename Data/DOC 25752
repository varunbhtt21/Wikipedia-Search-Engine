==Origin==

When Dr. Jose Rizal was deported to [[Dapitan]] in [[Mindanao]] from 1892-1896 by the Spanish government, aside from spending some time in teaching the town folks, he also engaged in medical practice through which he was able to cure the eye ailment of Calixto Carreon.The story said that Calixto offered Dr. Rizal the 40-hectare land as a way to repay him. On the other hand, Dr. Rizal accepted Calixto's offer with an additional payment of two-hundred pesos. In order to keep the farm under proper management, Dr. Rizal designated one of his sisters, Trinidad, to look after the farm. After several years, Trinidad passed the farm's management to Fernando Eguía, one of Dr. Rizal's students.A marker was installed in the area by the [[National Historical Institute]] (NHI) which states that Trinidad sold the land to Crisostomo Eguía Sr., son of Fernando. It was agreed right there and then after the sale that the land would still be registered under the name of Dr. Rizal. Other siblings of Dr. Rizal also witnessed such agreement.

At present days, the farm is under the care of the children of Crisostomo Eguia Sr. On a positive note, Director Mary June Bugante of the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Region 9]] said her office is constantly in touch with Eguia Family to encourage them to transform the farm into a duly recognized tourist destination.

==Tourism==

The farm with the span of 40 hectares continues to attract visitors which are usually composed of group of students and 
tourists both coming from local and foreign places. However, at present there are no establishments built yet that would 
accommodate those visitors who wish to spend a couple of days within the area. Nevertheless, the Department of Tourism Region 9 is exerting more efforts on its desire to promote the heritage sites which Dr. Jose Rizal left in the historic lands of Zamboanga del Norte.
