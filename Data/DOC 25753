==Biography==
Saleh Fouzan was born in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] in February 1956. As an immigrant working in [[Egypt]] from 1986 until 1997, he had produced 34 feature films through his company Shamel Media Production & Distribution.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fouzan|first=Saleh|title=Saleh Fouzan|url=http://sabq.org/st4fde/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521130723/http://sabq.org/st4fde|archivedate=2014-05-21|df=}}</ref>

While in [[Egypt]], Fouzan expanded to [[Saudi Arabia]] through a partnership with his Highness Prince Turki bin Mohamed. Headquartered in [[Riyadh]], the firm was the sole distributor of several Egyptian, American and Indian Films in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Between 1996 and 1997, Mr. Fouzan studied the dramatic structures of script and scenario writing in [[Belgium]] under the supervision of director and writer Mahmoud Ben Mahmoud. He then went on to co-produce the Belgian French-Tunisian picture, " Qoael Al Roumman", working as interim assistant director.
Devoted to his studies, Mr. Fouzan moved to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] where he lived for the next 4 years and served as a guest lecturer at many universities around the country between 2007 and 2009. He has been awarded 30 [[Arab]] and International awards for his contribution to the film industry. Most notably, he was awarded the  "North Support of the South Award"  by the French film center, recognizing his skills as a screenplay writer. In addition, he has been the recipient of the Civilian Medal of Honor of [[Nantes]], [[France]] in 2000.
Saleh brings an innovative and unique style to each production and sees limited resources as no barrier to creative and effective production. In 1998, he incorporated Fouzan Films, a media production house in an attempt to create the “first” Saudi film. The film titled “The Year of Mercy” (Seenen Al Rahma) hasn't been active for production since the year 2000.
