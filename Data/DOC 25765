== Background ==

Ringo Sheena released her debut single "[[Kōfukuron]]" in May 1998, followed by "[[Kabukichō no Joō]]" in September. Her third in January 1999, "[[Koko de Kiss Shite.]]," became a hit, being certified platinum for 200,000 copies shipped to stores by the [[RIAJ]].<ref name="RIAJ-apr1999">{{cite journal |title=GOLD ALBUM 他認定作品 1999年2月度 |trans-title=Gold Albums, and other certified works.

A small section of the song was first released on the "[[Kabukichō no Joō]]" single, on the track {{nihongo|"Jitsuroku (Shinjuku nite)"|実録 －新宿にて－||"Actual Recording (In Shinjuku)"}} , which featured a clip of Sheena busking in Tokyo, performing a medley of "Marunouchi Sadistic" and "Kabukichō no Joō."

== Writing and production ==
{{Listen |filename=Ringo Sheena - Marunouchi Sadistic.ogg|title="Marunouchi Sadistic"|description=Ringo Sheena mentions many places on the [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] and guitar paraphernalia in the song. This wordplay was praised by critics.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The song was first recorded in an English language demo called "A New Way to Fly," which was recorded while Sheena was home-staying in [[London]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The lyrics talk somebody who has just moved to Tokyo for work, and the title references the [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]], one of the major train lines in central Tokyo, as well as several neighbourhoods reached on the line, such as [[Ochanomizu]] and [[Ginza]]. The song also mentions many guitar-related words, such as the [[Rickenbacker 620]] model guitar, [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall amplifiers]], a [[Pro Co RAT]] pedal amplifier and [[Gretsch]] guitars. [[Blankey Jet City]] vocalist Kenichi "Benji" Asai is mentioned in the lyric, {{nihongo|"If then Benji, hit me with the Gretsch"|そしたらベンジー、あたしをグレッチで殴って|Soshitara Benjī, atashi o gurecchi de butte}}<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:椎名林檎 丸の内サディスティック |url=http://j-lyric.net/artist/a00450a/l000c59.html |publisher=J-Lyric |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> The 2008 English lyrics similarly keep the references to places in Tokyo and to guitar paraphernalia, but further mentions [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=丸の内サディスティック (Expo Ver.) 椎名林檎 |url=http://music.goo.ne.jp/lyric/LYRUTND79832/index.html |publisher=Goo |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503154430/http://music.goo.ne.jp/lyric/LYRUTND79832/index.html |archivedate=May 3, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

A special band called {{nihongo|Zekkyō Solfeggio|絶叫ソルフェージュ|Scream Solfeggio}} was created to record the song, composed of Sheena, producer [[Seiji Kameda]] and drummer Noriyasu Kawamura. The bulk of the other songs recorded for ''Muzai Moratorium'' were performed by the bands [[List of bands associated with Ringo Sheena#Momoiro Spanner|Momoiro Spanner]] and [[List of bands associated with Ringo Sheena#Zetsurin Hectopascal|Zetsurin Hectopascal]], which both featured Sheena, Kameda and Kawamura as members, including other musicians.<ref name="muzai">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Muzai Moratorium]] |others=[[Ringo Sheena]] |year=1999 |language=Japanese |publisher=Toshiba EMI |location=Tokyo, Japan}}</ref>

For Sheena's 10th anniversary concerts, ''[[Ringo Expo 08]]'', a rearranged bilingual version called "Marunouchi Sadistic (Expo Ver.)" was featured as exiting music after the concert. This version was released as a bonus track on her album ''[[Sanmon Gossip]]'' (2009).<ref name="RingoExpo08Credits">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Ringo Expo 08]] |others=[[Ringo Sheena]] |year=2009 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[EMI Music Japan]] |location=Tokyo, Japan}}</ref><ref name="SanmonGossipCredits">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Sanmon Gossip]] |others=[[Ringo Sheena]] |year=2009 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[EMI Music Japan]] |location=Tokyo, Japan}}</ref>

== Live performances ==

"Marunouchi Sadistic" is one of the most consistently performed songs in Sheena's career. It was performed at her early live concerts: at ''NHK Live Beat'' (1999), her ''Senkō Ecstasy'' tour (1999), her ''Jisaku Jien Namaensōkai'' concerts (1999), ''Kōkotsu Gokuhi Ensōkai'' (1999) and her ''Manabiya Ecstasy'' tour.<ref>{{cite web |title=椎名林檎 NHK LIVE BEAT イチオシ祭り |url=http://www.livefans.jp/events/4835 |publisher=Live Fans |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:椎名林檎 先行エクスタシー |url=http://www.livefans.jp/events/4839 |publisher=Live Fans |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:椎名林檎 自作自演生演奏会 |url=http://www.livefans.jp/events/4837 |publisher=Live Fans |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:椎名林檎 恍惚極秘演奏会 |url=http://www.livefans.jp/events/4834 |publisher=Live Fans |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:椎名林檎 学舎エクスタシー |url=http://www.livefans.jp/events/293 |publisher=Live Fans |language=Japanese |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> Performances can be seen on her live DVDs ''[[Gekokujyo Xstasy]]'' (2000), ''[[Electric Mole]]'' (2003), and ''Tōtaikai'' (2014). The version performed at ''Tōtaikai'' was titled with the symbol ㋚ (pronounced "Maru Sa," the first syllables of the two words that make up the title).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/237797/products/cinema/1062141/1/ | script-title=ja:党大会　平成二十五年神山町大会 |publisher=Oricon | language=Japanese | accessdate=April 10, 2014}}</ref> The symbol is a pun, as it features a [[katakana]] "sa" surrounded by a circle (''maru'' in Japanese).

From 2004 to 2012, Ringo Sheena's main musical unit was the band [[Tokyo Jihen]]. While the band mostly performed their own music, several songs from Sheena's solo career were performed. "Marunouchi Sadistic" was performed at almost every Tokyo Jihen concert, and became the most performed song by the band.<ref name="Chinplay">{{cite web | title=東京事変Live History 映像作品 DVD／Blu-ray『珍プレー好プレー』 | url=http://www.kronekodow.com/gaiko/chinplay.html | work=Kronekodow |date=July 20, 2012 | accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> Live performances can be found on the band's DVDs ''Dynamite Out'' (2004), ''Just Can't Help It.''
