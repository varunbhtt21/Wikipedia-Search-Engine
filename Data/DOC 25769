'''Alma Wagen''' (1878 â€“ December 7, 1967) was an American [[mountain guide]] on [[Mount Rainier]]. She was the first female guide employed by [[Mount Rainier National Park]].

==Biography==
Wagen was born in 1878 and raised on her grandparents' farm in [[Mankato, Minnesota]]. She began climbing at a young age but, in the absence of any mountains in her area, she climbed windmills and became known locally as "the windmill climber".<ref name=guides>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountaineers.org/nwmj/04/041_Guides.html|title=Pretty Girls & Windmills|year=2004|work=Northwest Mountaineering Journal|first=Jason D.|last=Martin|accessdate=May 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001085155/http://www.mountaineers.org/nwmj/04/041_Guides.html|archive-date=2012-10-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> After graduating from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1903, she moved to [[Tacoma, Washington]].<ref name=guides/> She worked at [[Stadium High School]] as a mathematics teacher and in her spare time she climbed extensively in the [[North Cascades]] and [[Olympic Mountains]].<ref name=tpl>{{cite web|url=http://mtn.tpl.lib.wa.us/climbs/climbing/people/wagen.asp|title=Alma Wagen|publisher=[[Tacoma Public Library]]|year=2002|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

Wagen became an official member of [[The Mountaineers (club)|The Mountaineers]] in 1913.<ref name=tpl/> In 1914, she traveled to [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] where she "found [her] life's work right in the National Parks" and climbed [[Mount Rainier]] for the first time in 1915.<ref name=guides/> She spent the summer of 1916 hiking in [[Yellowstone National Park]] and in 1917 she climbed [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]], [[Mount St. Helens]] and [[Mount Hood]] with the Mountaineers.<ref name=tpl/> When the United States joined [[World War I]], this created a shortage of [[mountain guide]]s, and Wagen joined the [[National Park Service]] as a guide in 1918.<ref name=guides/> She was the first female guide to work in [[Mount Rainier National Park]].<ref name=tpl/> The bulk of her work as a guide consisted of leading tourists on hikes to nearby glaciers, but she occasionally assisted in leading parties to the mountain's summit, which she was said to have done "like a master".<ref>{{cite book|page=350|title=The Challenge of Rainier: A Record of the Explorations and Ascents, Triumphs and Tragedies on One of North America's Greatest Mountains|last=Molenaar|first=Dee|publisher=[[The Mountaineers Books]]|year=2011}}</ref> Joseph Hazard, Rainier's chief climbing guide at the time, referred to Wagen as "one of the best guides in the employ of the company". She worked in [[Yosemite National Park]] briefly in 1922 before returning to Rainier.<ref name=guides/>

Wagen retired after marrying Horace J. Whitacre in Tacoma. She moved to [[Claremont, California]] after Whitacre's death in 1950 and lived there until her death in 1967.<ref name=tpl/>
