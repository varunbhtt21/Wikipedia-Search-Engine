Andrew Hamilton of [[Allmusic]] compared the production work of Bobby Massey and Michael Burton, stating that "Massey's sides were the most interesting" Hamilton also further stated: "He knew how to record them, Burton saddled them with a tinny, kiddie sound, and a couple of his productions/compositions are far too strident for ears."<ref name="album-review"/> He also noted the cover of [[Sam Cooke]]'s "[[You Send Me]]," "Bound," "I Remember You," and "Dad I Love Her" as "album highlights."<ref name="album-review"/>
