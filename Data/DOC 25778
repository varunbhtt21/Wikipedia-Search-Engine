Text : {{italictitle}}
'''''African American Communication: Exploring Identity and Culture''''' is a 2003 book by [[Michael Hecht]], [[Ronald L. Jackson II]] and [[Sidney A. Ribeau]].

==Overview==
The book seeks to demonstrate why and how communication in interpersonal interactions between [[African Americans]] differs from that between [[European Americans]]. The authors argue that African-American identity, [[communicative competence]], language style and relationship formation and maintenance are strategies adopted in order to navigate a dominant European power structure than inhibits cultural authenticity and access to power.<ref name=mcilwain/> The authors' intent is to establish a starting point for research into the communication styles of African Americans and other cultural groups.<ref name=greene/> The major questions the authors seek to address involve the differences in communicative experiences that are unique to African Americans, how African Americans self-define culturally, and how African Americans perceive [[intercultural communication]].<ref name=fears/> The book concludes by presenting ideas and recommendations for future scholarship, including the necessity of a non-[[Eurocentric]] perspective on African-American identities.<ref name=greene/>

==Critical reception==
Writing in the ''Southern Communication Journal'', [[Charlton McIlwain|Charlton D. McIlwain]] criticized the book for failing to engage with disputes over the validity of racial differences in a [[postmodern]] world and for failing to explain the motivation behind the work or how it would add to understandings of intercultural communication or African Americans' communicative experiences. However, he also noted that the book "does include some discussion of a fairly vast amount of literature", and that it had the "potential to instigate debate over the [[ontology]] of human difference."<ref name=mcilwain>{{cite journal|title=Review of Michael L.

Fears in ''Mass Communication and Society'' wrote that "the authors do accomplish their goal of presenting a [[cultural analysis]] of African American communication" and that "the book, replete with information from diverse bodies of literature, is really a reader or guide that can be used by researchers seeking to better understand [[African American culture]] and communication styles, patterns, and even some basic history of African peoples in the United States."<ref name=fears>{{cite journal|title=Review of Michael L.

Arrington also described the original edition as "groundbreaking in
its interactional approach and its subject matter".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jls.sagepub.com/content/24/1/93.full.pdf+html|title=Review of Lisa J.
