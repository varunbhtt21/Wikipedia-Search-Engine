I fail to see why this is being nominated for deletion now after existing for four years, the page is in accordance with [[WP:NTRAN]]. Also I find your message strange "Non notable bus crap." considering your profile says "My Interests on Wikipedia are: Buses..."

:::My point about how many years the page has existed was that if it did violate the criteria for an article on [[Wikipedia]] (which it doesn't) then it would have been deleted already. And it has existed even longer than that on the [[Wilts & Dorset]] page it was moved to it's own page so someone clearly though it had encyclopedic value.

I dont know about the rules of wikipedia but i have always found this a useful and interesting page especially considering there is no complete route list anywhere else now. Also maby a bit ot but the page was up to date yesterday why has it gone back to how it was before?

*'''Delete''', '''Transwiki to Wikia''', or otherwise remove from Wikipedia. This is an omnishambles of a nomination but the policy Wikipedia is not a travel guide does apply here, as does "[[WP:NOTDIR|Wikipedia is not a directory]]" on the same policy page. Various routes have been to AfD but there's no real strategy as to which are taken to AfD and which we retain. Because of the pendulum swing from editors voting keep and delete there was an RFC at the village pump which equally could not draw a single consensus for keeping or deleting but advised that each list should be nominated individually. This article is unsourced, it's only likely to ever be sourced to primary sources (either 1st party the bus company, or 3rd party the local authority) it's unlikely that any secondary sources will be found to establish either the individual routes or the list of routes as notable and meeting the GNG. Just remember all the rules, and be prepared to kill all the bus route articles :) [[User:Timothyhouse1|Timothyhouse1]] ([[User talk:Timothyhouse1|talk]]) 13:46, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

There's absolutely no reason why this article should be deleted [[WP:NTRAN]] states "Transportation services, and associated items, are notable if they have been discussed in multiple, independent sources" and "Intercity bus services providing regularly scheduled, fixed-route services on multiple routes between two or more major cities or regions are likely to be notable"  [[WP:WikiProject_Buses/Bus_route_list_guide]] states "Generally, if the bus routes in an area descended from streetcars, a list is appropriate, and if the system did not exist at all until the 1990s, it is probably not. In between those extremes, use your own judgment." The subjects are discussed frequently in (not reputable)independent sources and press. [[User:Mainline421|Mainline421]] ([[User talk:Mainline421|talk]]) 16:35, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:*Wikipedia:WikiProject Buses/Bus route list guide is tagged "This page is currently inactive and is retained for historical reference. Either the page is no longer relevant or consensus on its purpose has become unclear." It is worthless. It is unlikely that this particular set of routes will be widely discussed in reliable secondary sources outside of the immediate area, as is needed to meet the [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline]].
*''' Keep''' We have many, many, articles of this type, and they are standard features. WP incorporates many of the features of an atlas. even to local detail. What we do ''not'' do is make articles on the individual routes. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 16:59, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Most of them have actually been deleted now by strong consensus. We have Wikivoyage to cover travel related topics and there is no reason to keep this type of unstable and constantly changing material which is only of local or specialist interest and as a guide.--[[User:Charlesdrakew|Charles]] ([[User talk:Charlesdrakew|talk]]) 17:40, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Weak Delete'''.  My gut feeling (although I can't point to any policy to back this up) is that individual bus lines are not notable, both because of their ubiquitousness and because the routes are so ephemeral.  I looked up a few local bus services that I'm familiar with ([[Bee-Line Bus System]], [[Rockland Coaches]], [[New Jersey Transit Bus Operations]], [[MTA Regional Bus Operations]]).  The trend seems to be that routes are mentioned in the main article, but not a distinct article about them.  On the other hand, trains do seem to get articles about individual routes ([[Vermonter]], and all of [[Template:Amtrak_routes]]).  Are train routes inherently more notable than bus routes, or do the train geeks just have a stronger lobby than the bus geeks?  -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 12:29, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Some of each perhaps. Rail tracks are fixed in steel rather than just following general roads and are not subject to frequent changes like bus routes. There are also a lot more local bus routes of no interest outside their immediate area.--[[User:Charlesdrakew|Charles]] ([[User talk:Charlesdrakew|talk]]) 22:57, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as almost none of the content is based on secondary sources. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 22:45, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''strong delete''' [[WP:NOT]] a bus directory. COmpany may be notable, and a high level overview of areas covered may be appropriate in the parent article, but listing every route is insane. [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 17:30, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
