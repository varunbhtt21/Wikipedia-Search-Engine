The 2014–15 season was [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]'s third consecutive season in the [[Football League Championship]] following their relegation from the [[Premier League]] in 2012.

It covers the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015.

== Pre-season ==
On 19 May, four pre-season friendly games were announced, beginning against [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] on 18 July and finishing against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 30 July, with games against [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] also being played, all away from home. A pre-season tour of [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] was announced on 22 May, which would take in games against [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]], [[FC Vestsjælland|Vestsjælland]] and [[Mjällby AIF|Mjällby]]. A final game against [[Vitesse Arnhem]], the first at the renamed [[Macron Stadium]], was added, which would take place on 3 August.

On 30 June, the [[Reebok]] Stadium officially changed its name to the [[Macron Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stadium officially becomes Macron Stadium|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/stadium-officially-becomes-macron-stadium-30.6.14-1707786.aspx|website=www.bwfc.co.uk|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> Later that week, the club confirmed that [[Stuart Holden]] would remain with the club for the forthcoming season on a non-contract basis as he continued to regain his fitness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stuart Holden to return to Bolton Wanderers|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/stuart-holden-to-return-to-bolton-wanderers-3.7.14-1714727.aspx|website=www.bwfc.co.uk|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>

Bolton's opening game of pre-season ended in a draw, with former Bolton striker [[Johan Elmander]] giving Brøndby the lead. [[Jermaine Beckford]] missed a penalty for Bolton, before [[Craig Davies (footballer)|Craig Davies]] levelled, also from the spot. [[Robert Hall (footballer)|Robert Hall]] was sent off late in the game for a rash challenge. In a game where manager [[Dougie Freedman]] fielded two different outfield teams either side of half-time, [[The Gambia|Gambian]] trialist [[Modou Barrow]] made an appearance from the bench, being brought on for academy player [[Georg Iliev]]. Wanderers then travelled to [[FC Vestsjælland|Vestsjælland]] where they picked up their first win of the pre-season, winning 1-0 courtesy of a first half goal from [[Liam Feeney]]. Wanderers' final game on their tour came at [[Mjällby AIF|Mjällby]]. Bolton raced into the lead, with Jermaine Beckford and Robert Hall both scoring to make it 2-0 after seven minutes. [[Mjällby AIF|Mjällby]] responded well, however, with first half goals from [[Mattias Håkansson]], [[Kristian Haynes]] and Kwame Bonsu, handing Bolton their first loss of pre-season.

Bolton's first game after coming home from the tour of Denmark and Sweden was away to non-league outfit [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]]. The home side opened the scoring in the first half through [[Chris Holroyd]] but Bolton equalised through young substitute [[Zach Clough]] nine minutes from time. They followed this up with a comfortable win against [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]], with [[Neil Danns]] and young substitute [[Conor Wilkinson]] getting the goals. The following game was away to [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], which finished in a 1-1 draw. [[Jay Spearing]] scored his first goal of pre-season to put Wanderers ahead, but [[Eliot Richards]] equalised for the home side. Wanderers penultimate game of pre-season came away to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], where they got off to a good start, with [[Matt Mills]] heading home his first goal of pre-season. [[Jermaine Beckford]] doubled Bolton's tally from over 30 yards. [[Tom Pope]] pulled a goal back for the home side late on, but Bolton held on for the win.

On 26 July, the club confirmed that [[Jay Spearing]] would be the club captain for the forthcoming season, following the departure of [[Zat Knight]]. [[Matt Mills]], meanwhile, was appointed as the club's vice-captain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jay Spearing officially announced as new club captain|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/jay-spearing-officially-announced-as-new-club-captain-26.7.14-1783426.aspx|website=www.bwfc.co.uk|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C.|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref>

In their final game of pre-season, the home friendly against [[Vitesse Arnhem]], Bolton fell behind to a [[Marko Vejinović]] free-kick and could not muster a response, losing the first fixture at their renamed stadium.

=== Bolton XI ===
On 20 May, Bolton announced their annual pre-season fixture against [[Chorley F.C.|Chorley]] in the Harold Taylor Memorial Trophy would take place on 26 July. This announcement was followed by a Bolton XI's finalised pre-season schedule with games against [[Bamber Bridge F.C.|Bamber Bridge]], [[Hyde F.C.|Hyde]], [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]], [[A.F.C. Fylde|Fylde]] and [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] also taking place. After the announcement of the fixtures, Melbourne Heart were purchased by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Melbourne Heart taken over by Manchester City-led consortium|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25854631|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> and were rebranded as Melbourne City, while also signing [[Damien Duff]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Damien Duff makes Melbourne City move|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27776082|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> and [[David Villa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=David Villa to play for Melbourne before New York MLS move|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27710040|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>

[[Conor Wilkinson]] opened the scoring in the Bolton XI's first game against [[Bamber Bridge F.C.|Bamber Bridge]], with Stuart Vasey equalising for the hosts. The following game against [[Hyde F.C.]] was postponed due to bad weather. They then hosted [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]], where, despite scoring an early goal through Conor Wilkinson, they lost 5-1, with Kisnorbo, Williams, Brown, Dugandzic and [[Aaron Mooy]], formerly of Wanderers, all scoring for the visitors. They then went to [[Chorley F.C.|Chorley]] where Wilkinson again scored the opening goal, but Chorley won the game with goals from Harry Winter and [[Tom Smyth]]. Danny Lloyd scored the only goal of Bolton XI's penultimate game of pre-season, as Bolton lost 1-0 to [[A.F.C. Fylde]], but in their final pre-season game, Bolton XI got their first win of pre-season as they beat [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] 1-0 courtesy of [[Chris Lester]]'s first half goal. During pre-season ex-[[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] defender [[Liam Fontaine]] was on trial for the club,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Marc Iles|title=Wanderers to make a decision on ex-Bristol City defender Liam Fontaine on Monday|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/11383432.Wanderers_to_make_a_decision_on_ex_Bristol_City_defender_Liam_Fontaine_on_Monday/?ref=rss|website=www.theboltonnews.co.uk|publisher=The Bolton News|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> playing in matches against [[A.F.C. Fylde|Fylde]] and [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]]. On 6 August it was revealed that Fontaine had discontinued training with the club at the start of that week, after plans for a behind-closed-doors friendly against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] were shelved.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Marc Iles|title=Former Bristol City man Liam Fontaine leaves Bolton Wanderers after trial period|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/wanderers/wanderersnews/11392366._/?ref=mac|website=www.theboltonnews.co.uk|publisher=The Bolton News|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>

==Championship==
{{main|2014–15 Football League Championship}}
The fixtures for the [[2014–15 Football League Championship]] season were released on 18 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/championship/fixtures |title=Championship Fixtures|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2014-06-18 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref>

===August===
Bolton began their third consecutive season in the second tier away at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 9 August. Wanderers conceded three goals without reply; [[Troy Deeney]], [[Matěj Vydra]] and [[Fernando Forestieri]] scoring the goals for the Hornets. Their first league fixture at the newly renamed Macron Stadium was against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] a week later. All four goals of the 2-2 draw came in the first half; [[Joe Mason (footballer, born 1991)|Joe Mason]] first headed in a [[Jay Spearing]] free-kick before [[Britt Assombalonga]] equalised for Forest. [[David Wheater]] put Bolton back in front but [[Captain (association football)|captain]] Jay Spearing brought down Assombalonga in the box, who picked himself up to draw Forest level again. Against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Craig Davies (footballer)|Craig Davies]] put Bolton in front with a penalty in the 27th minute after being brought down by [[Seb Hines]]. [[David Wheater]] was then adjudged to have handled in the box just before half-time - leading to [[Grant Leadbitter]] equalising for Boro, again from the spot. [[Kike (footballer, born November 1989)|Kike]] scored a late winner to give Middlesbrough their first win away at Bolton since 1987. Away to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], Bolton lost 2-1 and 1-0, respectively, to leave them winless after five games. Bolton took the lead against Brighton, [[Matt Mills]] opening the scoring but goals from [[Craig Mackail-Smith]] and [[João Carlos Teixeira|João Teixeira]] gave Brighton the points. Former Bolton loanee [[Stephen Warnock]] scored the only goal for Leeds, consigning them to defeat once again. [[Craig Davies (footballer)|Craig Davies]] was named player of the month for August, scoring two goals from the penalty spot.<ref>http://www.bwfc.co.uk/news/article/craig-davies-wins-clubs-player-of-the-month-award-for-august-5.9.14-1899344.aspx</ref>

===September===
Bolton started September against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], the result being a goalless draw. This brought an end to their three match losing streak but meant they still hadn't won a league game this season, extending their winless start to the season to six games. Bolton ended their next game on the right side of a five-goal thriller. [[Anthony Wordsworth]] put [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]] in front in the first half but [[Joe Mason (footballer, born 1991)|Joe Mason]] scored two to bring Bolton ahead with ten minutes remaining on the clock. Two minutes later, [[Jordan Bowery]] equalised for the Millers but Mason scored his first career hat-trick and the club's first since [[Fredi Bobic]] put in three against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 2002, to hand Bolton their first win of the new season. They couldn't follow this up with a second, however, and lost by a solitary goal at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]]; [[Nouha Dicko]] scoring the goal for the hosts. Against [[Steve McLaren|Steve McLaren's]] [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], Bolton conceded a goal either side of half-time to send them back into the relegation zone. The loss sparked mass protests from the crowd during the game, with fans chanting for both manager [[Dougie Freedman]] and chairman [[Phil Gartside]] to leave their posts.<ref>{{cite web|title=FULL TIME: Wanderers 0 Derby County 2|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/wanderers/bolton_wanderers/11500562.FULL_TIME__Wanderers_0_Derby_County_2/?ref=mac|website=www.theboltonnews.co.uk|publisher=The Bolton News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>

===October===
A few days later, on the first of the month, Bolton conceded four goals without reply as they fell to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Craven Cottage]], one of two teams that were below them in the table.

Lennon's first game came against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]], against whom he had made his [[Football League]] debut as a player for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. [[Matt Mills]] headed in from a corner to give Bolton a lead they managed to hang on to despite [[Craig Davies (footballer)|Craig Davies]] missing a penalty while striker [[Lee Novak]] was in goal, having replaced the sent off [[Darren Randolph]]. Following this, Neil Lennon was sent to the stands as he had left his technical area too many times throughout the match. This was Bolton's second win of the season, and lifted them off the bottom of the table, to be replaced by [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. At [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton]] scored either side of half-time to go 2-0 up, before [[Dean Moxey]] scored his first for the club to make the score 2-1 just a few minutes later, but the team couldn't score an equaliser, giving Lennon his first taste of defeat as Bolton manager.

===November===
Neil Lennon clinched his second straight home win against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], scoring three with no reply against the Bluebirds. [[Liam Feeney]] slid to connect with [[Lee Chung-yong|Lee Chung-yong's]] arrowed cross from the right for his first of the season just nine minutes in before doubling his tally on 36 minutes when [[Darren Pratley]] found him with a cross to the back post. [[Matt Mills]] sealed the win with 14 minutes remaining to become Bolton's joint-top scorer in all competitions alongside [[Joe Mason (footballer, born 1991)|Joe Mason]]. Against local rivals [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], Bolton scored three goals for the third home game in a row. [[Max Clayton]] scored his first for the club after latching on to [[Lee Chung-yong|Lee Chung-yong's]] through ball before [[Craig Davies (footballer)|Craig Davies]] headed in from [[Liam Feeney|Liam Feeney's]] looped cross to make it two. Six minutes later, Chung-yong added to his earlier assist with a goal from the penalty spot; [[Leon Barnett]] having been adjudged to have brought down [[Matt Mills]] in the box.

[[Eiður Guðjohnsen]] made his second début in the match, 14 years after his last appearance against the same opponents, in May 2000. Bolton would make it three clean sheets in a row the following week, defeating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at [[The Den]] from a [[Darren Pratley]] goal in the second half. On [[Boxing Day]] Bolton faced local rivals [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at the [[Macron Stadium|Macron]], playing in front of a home crowd of over 20,000 for the first time in nearly three years. [[Joshua King (footballer)|Josh King]] scored for Blackburn, before 37-year-old [[Emile Heskey]] scored on his debut after coming off the bench, the assist coming from fellow 37-year-old [[Eiður Guðjohnsen]]. [[Darren Pratley]] scored his second goal in as many games four minutes later, giving Bolton the bragging rights over their rivals.

===January===

Bolton pulled two back by scoring twice in two minutes through [[Liam Trotter]] and [[Matt Mills]] but it wasn't enough as Rotherham ran out 4-2 winners. Bolton finished January at home against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. [[Nouha Dicko]] scored in the third minute to give Wolves the lead but 20 minutes later, [[Zach Clough]], on his league début, scored twice within two minutes - his third goal for the club in only his second appearance - to give Bolton the lead.

Debutant [[Zach Clough]] scored the only goal of the game, with Bolton being the first team in three years to knock Wigan out in normal time.

The game ended goalless, Bolton earning themselves a replay at the [[Macron Stadium]] two weeks later.

== Transfers ==

=== Summer ===
Bolton's first move of the transfer window was confirmed on 28 April 2014, with loanee [[Neil Danns]] signing a pre-contract which would see him move to the club on a one-year deal once his existing contract with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] expired on 30 June.

On 5 May 2014, it was announced that four senior players would not have their contracts renewed. Club captain [[Zat Knight]], [[Chris Eagles]], [[Tyrone Mears]] and Jay Lynch were all released. On the same day the club confirmed that academy players Sam Bailey, Saul Hamer, Jordan Hendrie, James Kelly, Elliot Newby and Guillermo Torres would not have their contracts extended.

On 12 May, Bolton confirmed that another loanee from the previous season would be joining the club following the expiring of his current contract in the summer. Following Neil Danns' example, [[Liam Trotter]] would join the club on 1 July, signing a three-year deal, leaving [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] after four years of service. On 19 May, Bolton confirmed that [[Liam Feeney]], another ex-loanee, would be following Trotter from Millwall after signing a two-year deal, having been at Millwall for three years. On 21 May, Bolton signed their fourth former loanee in a row, with [[Andy Robinson (footballer born 1992)|Andy Robinson]] of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] joining on a one-year deal. However, on 19 July the club confirmed the player had left as he had failed to settle in the area. Bolton's fifth signing of the summer was confirmed as former [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] defender [[Dorian Dervite]], who signed a three-year deal, joining from [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Bolton continued their summer signing spree by announcing on 12 June that [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] youth goalkeeper Ross Fitzsimons would officially become a Trotter on 1 July, with the 'keeper signing a two-year contract.

On 1 July, as well as confirming the arrivals of the six previously announced signings, Bolton revealed that [[André Moritz]] and [[Arran Lee-Barrett]] would leave the club following the expiration of their contracts. Both had been discussing the option of a contract extension.<ref name="Bolton Wanderers: Andre Moritz and Arran Lee-Barrett leave club"/>

The following day, on 2 July, Bolton announced the signing of [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] left-back [[Dean Moxey]], with whom Freedman had previously worked during his time with the Eagles. Two days later, striker [[Marvin Sordell]] left Bolton to join near neighbours [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the [[Premier League]], rejoining his former manager at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Sean Dyche]]. Defender [[Alex Baptiste]], recently arrested on suspicion of [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]],<ref>{{cite web|author1=Miranda Newey|title=Bolton Wanderers star Alex Baptiste arrested after alleged attack on man who touched his wife's bottom|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/wanderers/wanderersnews/11327089.Bolton_Wanderers_star_arrested_after_alleged_attack_on_man_who_touched_his_wife_s_bottom/?ref=mac|website=www.theboltonnews.co.uk|publisher=The Bolton News|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> was loaned to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 11 July.

A fifth former loanee, [[Kevin McNaughton]], joined the club on 16 July, signing on for another loan spell. On 19 July, [[Andy Robinson (footballer born 1992)|Andy Robinson]], who had only joined the club at the beginning of the month, had his contract cancelled with homesickness being cited as the reason.

Shortly after, experienced utility man [[Andrew Hughes (footballer, born 1978)|Andy Hughes]] joined the club as a professional development coach, while also be registered as a member of the playing staff. [[Keith Andrews (footballer)|Keith Andrews]] then joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on loan on 24 July, before Bolton signed young defender Quade Taylor on a free from Crystal Palace and [[Joe Riley (footballer, born 1991)|Joe Riley]] joined [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on loan until January, both on 28 July. Young defender [[Cian Bolger]] left the club on 5 August, joining [[Phil Brown (footballer, born 1959)|Phil Brown's]] [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].

Former [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]] man [[Joe Mason (footballer, born 1991)|Joe Mason]] rejoined the club on 11 August, signing on for another loan spell until the end of the [[2014-15 in English football|2014-15 season]] from [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], with whom he had recently agreed a new contract. The first released Bolton player to join a new club was 'keeper Jay Lynch, who joined [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] on non-contract terms on 8 August, although he later joined [[Salford City F.C.|Salford City]].

Bolton's first signing of the emergency loan window was to loan [[Owen Garvan]] from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] until December. Two days later [[Conor Wilkinson]] joined [[Football League One|League One]] team [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on loan for a month. Right-back [[Hayden White (footballer)|Hayden White]] was also sent out on loan, joining [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] for a month. Coming the other way, [[Max Clayton]] joined after compensation was agreed with his former club [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]]. Clayton had trained with Bolton earlier in the summer following his turning down of a contract extension from the Railwaymen. The BBC reported a figure of £300,000 could be given to Crewe. A day later, [[Paddy Kenny]] released by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] following rumours [[Massimo Cellino]] had dropped him because he considers the 'keeper's birth date to be unlucky.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paddy Kenny 'dropped by Massimo Cellino because of birth date'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28153659|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref> The Irishman signed for Bolton on a short-term deal to cover for the absent [[Ádám Bogdán]], who had been injured while in training.
