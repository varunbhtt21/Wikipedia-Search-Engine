== Plot ==
[[File:Payday.ogv|thumb|The Film]]
The short opens somewhere in the [[Middle East]]. Snafu spends his payday by walking through a local [[bazaar]]. Technical Fairy 1st Class operates his own stand, allowing Snafu to invest in his future. He presents a poster with an ideal future for Snafu: a suburban house, a streamlined car, a gorgeous wife, a baby in a stroller, and a doghouse on a well-manicured lawn. Snafu is ready to hand over his money. But a devil appear and lures him into a souvenir shop.<ref name="Shull"/> As Snafu spends his money, the image on the poster changes. The streamlined car is replaced progressively to a [[Ford Model T]], to a horse and [[carriage]], to a [[bicycle]], and finally into a pair of [[roller skates]].<ref name="Shull"/>

The setting changes into the [[Caribbean]]. Snafu wears a [[pith helmet]] and fondles a wad of cash. Its another payday. Technical Fairy appears to him with a bank-book. Within it written: "no dollars, no sense". Snafu is once again led astray, into a local bar. The smoke from the bar turns into a cocktail shaker. The image from the poster changes again.<ref name="Shull"/>

The setting changes into the [[Arctic]], where Snafu purchases a [[totem pole]] from an [[Eskimo]]. Technical Fairy operates a "Last Chance" booth. Snafu chooses to enter a [[Quonset hut]] and risk his money in a game of [[craps]]. As he keeps losing, the image on the poster changes. The suburban house disintegrates into a [[flophouse]], the stork repossesses the baby, and the wife packs a suitcase and leaves. Snafu exits the hut wearing a cardboard box. He has lost his clothes.<ref name="Shull"/>

He finds a single coin and runs naked to gamble it away. In the remains of Snafu's house, a phone rings. A mouse picks it up and informs the caller that Snafu does not live here anymore.<ref name="Shull"/>

== Analysis ==
The scene at the bazaar includes stalls operated by the Sheik and the Son of the Sheik. These are references to the films ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'' (1921) ''[[The Son of the Sheik]]'' (1926), both featuring [[Rudolph Valentino]] in the eponymous role.<ref name="Shull"/>
