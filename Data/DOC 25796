Text : The '''government<ref>Until the 20th century, we said and we always wrote "te" Trois-Rivières, in the plural form. At the time of French rule (1608-1763),

At the time of the [[New France]], the colony was divided into five individual governments: one in [[Quebec (city)|Quebec]], the Trois-Rivières, one in [[Montreal]], one in [[Newfoundland]] and one in [[Acadia]].

== History ==

It does not seem to act promulgating the creation of the three governments of [[Canada]] under the [[French regime]] (1608-1763). In this, the model here is similar to that of [[France]]. At that time, the valley of the St. Lawrence were three population centres: [[Quebec (city)|Québec]] (from 1608), [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]] (from 1634) and [[Montreal]] (from 1642). It then became necessary to create three governments. In [[Trois-Rivières]], the first captain to hold the title of governor [[Francis Champflour]] in 1643. Thus appeared the three governments of [[New France]].<ref>Many authors reiterate that the three governments were created in 1663. They existed long before 1663 as the governor of [[Trois-Rivières]] in 1648 became a member of the Council of Quebec, established in 1647 and on which sat the governors of [[Quebec]] and [[Montreal]]. See René Beaudoin, "The Origins of the regional capital", in René Beaudoin (eds.), ''Meet Trois-Rivières, 375 years of history and culture'', [[Trois-Rivières]], art Éditions Le Sabord 2009, pages 73-74 ({{ISBN|978-2-922685-67-1}})</ref>

At its inception in 1643, the Government of [[Trois-Rivières]] had only one permanent establishment, the position of [[Trois-Rivières]]. Manors had been granted around (Hertel fief in 1633, Godefroy fief in 1633, lordship [[Jesuits]] in 1634<ref>The city of [[Trois-Rivières]] has many fiefs and lands censive. See Daniel Robert, "Born in [[Trois-Rivières]]" trifluvian ''Heritage'', annual Bulletin of history conservation Society and animation heritage [[Trois-Rivières]], Number 7, June 1997, pp. 6-11 (ISSN 1187-2713). See also René Beaudoin " one of the most beautiful places in the country," in René Beaudoin (eds.), ''Meet [[Trois-Rivières]], 375 years of history and culture'', [[Trois-Rivières]], the art Publishing port 2009, pages 75-85 ({{ISBN|978-2-922685-67-1}})</ref> [[lordship of La Madeleine]] in 1636, Godefroy de Lintot fief in 1637 Dutort lordship in 1637, [[lordship of Batiscan]] in 1639), while others were projected (fief de l'Arbre à-la-Croix in 1644, [[Marsolet fief]] in 1644). Despite several attempts, no one lived in these lordships because of the Iroquois threat, it was not until 1665 with the arrival of [[Carignan-Sallières]]. The stand of the Government of Trois-Rivières will begin on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River from [[Trois-Rivières]] down to the east, probably for the sole reason that the rest of the country was in a flood zone. [[Trois-Rivières]] is the first occupied, followed by [[Cap-de-la-Madeleine]] little after 1640, the [[Champlain, Quebec|Champlain]] from 1664 or 1665, the [[Batiscan, Quebec|Batiscan]] to 1666 and [[Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade]] from 1667.

In 1648, the governor of [[Trois-Rivières]] became a member of the [[Council of Quebec]], created the previous year. In 1651, the Government of [[Trois-Rivières]] has a [[Seneschal]] (court).

The government of [[Trois-Rivières]] was maintained by the British during the military regime (1760-1764), with the difference that during this period, each government is autonomous and was not submitted to the Quebec Governor. Each government resorted to a currency of a different course, required a passport for entry and exit. The two boundaries separating the three governments were a crossing equipped with a garrison: one in [[Joliette, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-la-Joliette]], between the Governments of [[Québec]] and [[Trois-Rivières]], and the other [[Maskinongé, Quebec|Maskinongé]], between governments of [[Trois-Rivières]] and [[Montreal]].<ref>[[Marcel Trudel]], ''History of New France, volume 10, the military regime and the disappearance of [[New France]], 1759-1764'', [[Montreal]], Fides, 1999, p. 37 ({{ISBN|2-7621-2062-4}}).</ref>

The government of [[Trois-Rivières]] was abolished on {{date|10|August|1764}} when the British replaced the three governments by two districts, one in [[Quebec]] and [[Montreal]]. The [[Saint-Maurice River]] marked the division between the two districts.

== Territory ==

The government of [[Trois-Rivières]] extended from [[Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade]] to [[Maskinongé, Quebec|Maskinongé]] on the north shore of the [[St. Lawrence River]], and [[Saint-Pierre-les-Becquets, Quebec|Saint-Pierre-les-Becquets]] to [[Yamaska, Quebec|Yamaska]] on the south shore. It was the closest of the three government contracts.

In the north, it extended vaguely to land the [[Hudson Bay]], and south to the [[New England]].<ref>[[Marcel Trudel]], ''The Military Regime in the government of [[Trois-Rivières]] 1760-1764'', [[Trois-Rivières]], Éditions du Bien Public, 1952, p. 3-5 (Regional History Collection, no. 8)</ref>

These limits have not been set at the creation of the government in 1643. The size of government has extended until the area of [[Trois-Rivières]] government meeting that the [[Government of Quebec]] and the [[Government of Montreal]].

Its territory corresponds to the current regions of the [[Mauricie]] and [[Centre-du-Québec]]. It also included the eastern part of the region of [[Townships]].
