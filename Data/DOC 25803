'''Blooming Grove''', also known as the Mandeville-Rogers House, is a historic [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|plantation house]] located near [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], [[Florence County, South Carolina]].  It was originally constructed about 1790, with a two-story addition built between 1800 and 1820. It is an [[I-house]] form dwelling, with an [[Neoclassical architecture|Early Classical Revival]] two-story [[portico]]. Also on the property is a contributing brick-lined well.
