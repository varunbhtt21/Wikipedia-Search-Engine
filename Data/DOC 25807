'''Raeburn Open Space''', locally known as '''''Berrylands Nature Reserve''''', is a 5-hectare [[Local Nature Reserve]] and [[Site of Nature Conservation Interest|Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation]], Grade 1, in [[Berrylands]] in the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]] in London, England. It is owned and managed by [[Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council|Kingston Council]].<ref name=LNR>{{cite web|url= http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=RAEBURN&ID=355|title= Raeburn Open Space|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England| date = 6 March 2013 |accessdate= 3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=lnrIndex&query=REF_CODE%3D%271009091%27|title=Map of Raeburn Open Space|series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England| accessdate= 3 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=GIGL>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigl.org.uk/online/site-Details.aspx?sID=KiBII01&sType=sinc|title=Raeburn Open Space|publisher=Greenspace Information for Greater London|year=2013|accessdate= 3 May 2014}}</ref> but is mainly maintained by local community volunteers. Officially declared a nature reserve in 1992, little was done to manage it as a nature reserve until 2017 when a community initiative began.

The site is a linear park along the Tolworth Brook (also known as the Surbiton Stream), a tributary of the [[Hogsmill River]], which is the life blood of the nature reserve. It has areas of mown grass, unmanaged grassland, scrub and woods, together with ancient hedgerows which have a variety of native plants. Birds include jays, stock doves, great spotted woodpeckers and kingfishers, and there are invertebrates such as the [[ringlet]] butterfly.<ref name=GIGL/>

The park adjoins the former [[Surbiton Lagoon]], now Berrylands Park, to the south.<ref name=LGO>{{cite web|url=http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.asp?ID=KIN005|title=Berrylands Park|publisher=London Parks and Gardens Trust|accessdate= 3 May 2014}}</ref> [[Rose Walk]] is to the north and [[Elmbridge Open Space]] to the east. There are four main access points: off Elmbridge Avenue, from either end of Stirling Walk off Grand Avenue and Raeburn Avenue, and from Meldone Close.

In 2017, the [[Environment_Trust_for_Richmond_upon_Thames|Environment Trust]] successfully bid for a grant from [[Thames Water]] which was to restore and enhance the nature reserve over three years.<ref>[http://www.surreycomet.co.uk/news/15521556.Neglected_nature_reserve_in_Kingston_getting___168_000_revamp/ Neglected nature reserve The Raeburn Open Space in Berrylands in Kingston getting £168,000 revamp from The Environment Trust]</ref> This project has been a great success and has attracted lots of locals to support the nature reserve.  Work completed has included removing sections of concrete channelling from the stream sides and base, naturalising it instead, building a new wooden bridge to create a trail on the far side of the stream linking to the old concrete bridge, digging a new wildlife pond, clearing lots of invasive plants, regular litter picking and other general conservation work.

==Friends of Berrylands Nature Reserve==
In September 2018, as a continuation of the community support built up during the restoration project, the "Friends of Berrylands Nature Reserve" community group was formed with the aim “to improve Berrylands Nature Reserve for the benefit of both wildlife and the local community, and where possible support other local green spaces.”

This group now coordinates conservation activity and other community events at the site, and helps to look after both the nature reserve and other local green spaces.
