'''Prodan Rupar''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Продан Рупар}}, 1815–1875) was one of the most prominent leaders of the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)]]. Experience from the previous [[Herzegovina Uprising (1852–62)]] helped him to successfully lead the later uprising.

==Life==

===Preparation for the uprising ===

The rebel leaders in [[Herzegovina]], Prodan Rupar, Petar Radović, Jovan Gutić, Simon Zečević, Ilija Stevanović and Trivko Grubačić had meetings in the months of August and September 1874, during which they planned the uprising. They made decisions regarding the preparation of arms, places of refuge for people, and future support for the [[Principality of Montenegro]]. 

The preparations were finished by spring 1875. The group entered negotiations with Montenegrin Grand Duke [[Nikola I Petrović|Nikola Petrović]] in October. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] heard of the negotiations and tried to arrest the ringleaders, who fled into Montenegro in the winter of 1874. The [[Great Powers]] intervened in 1875 and asked the [[Sublime Porte]] for [[pardon]]s and [[amnesty]] for the ringleaders. This prompted the [[Great Eastern Crisis]].
