This action has been forced on us by savage cuts to jobs that have reduced London Underground to an under-staffed death trap at a time of heightened security and safety alert."<ref name=":0" />

==Public opinion==
In two separate polls, the [[Evening Standard]] found that a large majority of Londoners were in favour of making it more difficult for Tube workers to strike. In the first poll in 2013, 59% agreed that it was too easy for them to go on strike and 14% disagreed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/londoners-call-for-tube-strikes-to-be-outlawed-in-exclusive-poll-8572776.html |title=Londoners call for Tube strikes to be outlawed in exclusive poll}}</ref> In the second poll in 2014, 56% were in favour of banning Tube strikes unless 50% of eligible union members voted in favour of a strike.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/londoners-back-tube-strike-rule-change-poll-reveals-9355049.html |title=Londoners back Tube strike rule change, poll reveals}}</ref> A poll for [[LBC]] radio found that 65% of people in London did not support the current tube strikes and 16% said they supported them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/londoners-oppose-tube-strikes-30049 |title=Londoners oppose Tube strikes |access-date=16 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307200533/http://www.lbc.co.uk/londoners-oppose-tube-strikes-30049# |archive-date=7 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Amongst the general population, 46% said the August 2015 strikes were unjustified whereas 19% said they were justified according to a YouGov poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/07/night-working-london-tube-strike-alzheimers/ |title=London Tube Strike}}</ref>

==Legislation==
The government has proposed to raise the strike threshold so that a strike can only take place if there is a 50% turnout and, in the case of core public services (Health, Education, Transport & Fire Services), if 40% of eligible workers are in favour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32870930 |title=Strike changes: what do they mean? | work=BBC News | date=2015-05-27}}</ref> This change would make it more difficult for Tube workers to go on strike.
