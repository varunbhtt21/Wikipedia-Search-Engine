Alongside the likes of [[Freak Force]] this article should be deleted it has no reliable third person sources to demonstrate its notability. [[User:Dwanyewest|Dwanyewest]] ([[User talk:Dwanyewest|talk]]) 12:35, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[List of Spawn villains]]. I don't think there's anything worth merging over: no sources, no out-of-universe information, and improper format which treats the stories of the comic as if they were real world events. Anything merged over would have to be so extensively rewritten that it wouldn't be worth the trouble.--[[User:NukeofEarl|NukeofEarl]] ([[User talk:NukeofEarl|talk]]) 13:18, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[List of Spawn villains]]. I'll second the opinion that there is nothing of value to be merged. [[User:BlisterD|BlisterD]] ([[User talk:BlisterD|talk]]) 16:56, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
