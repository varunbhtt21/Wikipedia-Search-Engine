==Biography==
He was a follower of either [[Antonio Solario]] or [[Vittore Crivelli]], although he was also strongly influenced by the Early Renaissance school of Umbria, including [[Perugino]], [[Giovanni Santi]] and [[Timoteo Viti]]. Presutti is reported to have completed a ''Glory of Mary Magdalen'' (1523), started by Viti, for the [[Cathedral of Gubbio]]. He painted an altarpiece of ''Comunione degli Apostoli'' (circa 1538–1546) in [[San Domenico, Gubbio|San Domenico]] in [[Gubbio]]. An ''Immaculate Conception'' at [[Cagli]] is attributed to Presutti.<ref>Exhibition Catalogue for ''Alla Mensa del Signore'', (Ancona, 2011), by Gerardo de Simone.</ref>
