Title : List of schools in Thailand
Text : [[School]]s in [[Thailand]] provide [[basic education]], which covers pre-primary, primary and secondary education. Though most schools provide [[formal education]] following the National Curriculum, certain specialised schools may provide [[non-formal education]]. Most [[state school]]s operate under the auspices of the [[Office of the Basic Education Commission]] (OBEC), local governments, or universities, while private schools operate under the oversight of the Office of the Private Education Commission.

There are 37,175 schools in Thailand providing general education as of the 2011 academic year. These include 31,286 schools under the OBEC, 1,726 operated by local governments, 57 university demonstration schools, 414 Phrapariyatidhamma (Buddhist) schools and 3,679 private schools.{{efn|Others include eleven sports schools, one autonomous private organisation and one under the Ministry of Defence.}}<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bureau of Information and Communication Technology, OPS, MOE|title=Educational Statistics in Brief 2011|publisher=Ministry of Education|pages=28â€“29|url=http://www.mis.moe.go.th/mis-th/images/news-2555/260555/EIS/stat54/html/T001.html|accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref> This list covers notable schools providing general education in the primary and secondary levels, listed by province.
