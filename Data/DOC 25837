* '''Delete'''  This upcoming film has generated no coverage. The author's user page tells us it is in pre-production, and paragraph 3 of [[WP:NFF]] is not met. Further, the [[User:Brickproduction1815|article's author]] has a [[WP:CORPNAME|username issue]], and his User page itself imitates an article. Userfy back to author if requested, but ONLY if his username issue is addressed and he is made aware of [[WP:COI]]. Send him to [[WP:PRIMER]].

* '''Delete''' Fails [[WP:NFF]] by a wide margin. --[[User:Finngall|<font color="green"><b>Finngall</b></font>]] [[User Talk:Finngall|<font color="#D4A017"><sup>talk</sup></font>]] 16:32, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Not notable and [[WP:NFF]]. [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 00:09, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Zero coverage in reliable sources. Only hits I could find are to the film's website (actually a Blogspot blog) and to an independent film movie database. No prejudice against recreation if it gets reliable coverage in the future.
