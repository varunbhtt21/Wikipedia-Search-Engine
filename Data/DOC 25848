==Summary==
Wade writes about racial differences in economic success between whites, blacks, East Asians and offers the argument that racial differences come from genetic differences amplified by culture. In the first part of the book, Wade provides an account of [[human genetics]] research. In the second part of his book, Wade proposes that regional differences in evolution of social behavior explain many differences among different human societies around the world.<ref name="Orr2014" />

==Reception==

Hard evidence for Wade’s thesis is nearly nonexistent. Odder still, Wade concedes as much at the start of ''A Troublesome Inheritance'': 'Readers should be fully aware that in chapters 6 through 10 they are leaving the world of hard science and entering into a much more speculative arena at the interface of history, economics and human evolution.' |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/american-anthropological-association/review-of-a-troublesome-i_b_5316217.html |title=Review of A Troublesome Inheritance |first=Jonathan |last=Marks |authorlink=Jonathan M.

To his credit, he refutes certain racist notions associated with the idea of genetic determinism, and he speaks against social Darwinism and similar concepts. But if that verbiage were excised, his book would fit comfortably in the early to mid-20th century literature on race and human variation. ''A Troublesome Inheritance'' is itself troubling, not for its politics but for its science. Its arguments are only mildly amended versions of arguments discarded decades ago by those who methodically and systematically study human behavioral variation across cultures. |ref=harv}}</ref> [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[H. Allen Orr]] wrote in his review in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that "Wade's survey of human [[population genomics]] is lively and generally serviceable. It is not, however, without error. He exaggerates, for example, the percentage of the human genome that shows evidence of recent natural selection."<ref name="Orr2014">{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H.

Orr further comments that:<blockquote>Wade also thinks that "evolutionary differences between societies on the various continents may underlie major and otherwise imperfectly explained turning points in history such as the rise of the West and the decline of the Islamic world and China." Here, and especially in his treatment of why the industrial revolution flourished in England, his book leans heavily on [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'' (2007).<ref name="Orr2014" /> </blockquote>
Orr criticizes Wade for failing to provide sufficient evidence for his claims, though according to Orr, Wade concedes that evidence for his thesis is "nearly nonexistent."<ref name="Orr2014" />

The book has not been well received by much of the scientific community, including many of the scientists upon whose work the book was based. On 8 August 2014, ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' published an [[open letter]] signed by over 139 faculty members in [[population genetics]] and evolutionary biology. The letter read:
<blockquote>As discussed by Dobbs and many others, Wade juxtaposes an incomplete and inaccurate account of our research on human genetic differences with speculation that recent natural selection has led to worldwide differences in I.Q. test results, political institutions and economic development. We reject Wade's implication that our findings substantiate his guesswork. They do not.</blockquote><blockquote>We are in full agreement that there is no support from the field of population genetics for Wade's conjectures.<ref name="nytimesDobbs" /><ref name="GeneticistsLetter" /></blockquote>
Mark Jobling, one of the signatories to the letter, subsequently wrote an opinion piece in the peer-reviewed journal ''Investigative Genetics'' explaining why the book had "aroused the ire of this dusty community of academics".<ref>Jobling M (September 2014). [http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/5/1/14 Trouble at the Races]. ''Investigative Genetics'' 2014; 5:14. doi:10.1186/2041-2223-5-14.</ref>

The book was further criticized in a series of five reviews by [[Agustín Fuentes]], [[Jonathan M. Marks]], Jennifer Raff, Charles C. Roseman and Laura R. Stein which were published together in the scientific journal ''[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]]''.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/ ''Human Biology''] 2014; 86 (3).</ref> The publishers made all the reviews accessible on [[open access]] in order to facilitate discussions on the subject.<ref>[http://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/news-events/news/detail/human-biology-reviews-troublesome-inheritance Human Biology reviews "A Troublesome Inheritance"]. Wayne State University Press News, 27 April 2015.</ref>

The libertarian conservative [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], coauthor of ''[[The Bell Curve]]'', wrote a more favorable review in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303380004579521482247869874 |title=Book Review: A Troublesome Inheritance by Nicholas Wade |first=Charles |last=Murray |authorlink=Charles Murray (political scientist) |date=2 May 2014 |access-date=3 May 2014 |quote=Its proper reception would mean enduring fame as the book that marked a turning point in social scientists' willingness to explore the way the world really works. But there is a depressing alternative: that social scientists will continue to predict planetary movements using Ptolemaic equations, as it were, and that their refusal to come to grips with "A Troublesome Inheritance" will be seen a century from now as proof of this era's intellectual corruption.}}</ref> Murray wrote:<blockquote> The discoveries Mr. Wade reports, that genetic variation clusters along racial and ethnic lines and that extensive evolution has continued ever since the exodus from Africa, are based on the genotype, and no one has any scientific reason to doubt their validity. And yet, as of 2014, true believers in the orthodoxy still dominate the social science departments of the nation's universities. I expect that their resistance to "A Troublesome Inheritance" will be fanatical, because accepting its account will be seen, correctly, as a cataclysmic surrender on some core premises of political correctness.</blockquote>

== Response ==
In an open letter to the ''New York Times'', the book was denounced by over 139 professors of biology and genetics.<ref name="nytimesDobbs"/><ref name="GeneticistsLetter"/> In reply to the open letter published in ''The New York Times Book Review'', Wade wrote, "This letter is driven by politics, not science. I am confident that most of the signatories have not read my book and are responding to a slanted summary devised by the organizers." Wade added that he had asked the letter's authors (Graham Coop and Michael Eisen) for a list of errors so that he could correct future editions of the book.<ref>[http://blogs.nature.com/news/files/2014/08/Response-to-NYT-letter.pdf nature.com, August 2014]</ref> On 19 August 2014, [[Stanford University]] Professor [[Marcus Feldman]], one of the signatories to the letter, critiqued Wade's book, linking the book's controversial intellectual heritage to the claims of [[Arthur Jensen]], [[Richard Herrnstein]], and Charles Murray.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://stanfordcehg.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/echoes-of-the-past-hereditarianism-and-a-troublesome-inheritance/ |title= Echoes of the Past: Hereditarianism and A Troublesome Inheritance |first=Marcus |last=Feldman |publisher=Stanford CEHG |date=19 August 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref>
