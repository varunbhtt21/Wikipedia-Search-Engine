A poor article with no third person sources to assert notability. [[User:Dwanyewest|Dwanyewest]] ([[User talk:Dwanyewest|talk]]) 12:55, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[List of Spawn characters]]. No sources have been provided at all, much less independent sources. If someone wants to create a properly sourced article later, they will be able to find this version in the article history if they need it as a reference. --[[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] [[User talk:Metropolitan90|(talk)]] 15:25, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[List of Spawn characters]]. Unsourced, with no claim to notability. (Very poorly written, too; the "Publication history" section consists entirely of fictitious information.)--[[User:NukeofEarl|NukeofEarl]] ([[User talk:NukeofEarl|talk]]) 13:13, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
