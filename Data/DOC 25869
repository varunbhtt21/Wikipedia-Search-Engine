Nweke served as chief executive of the board of trustees of Nigerians in Diaspora in Europe (NIDO Europe) from 2004 to 2006 and as general secretary from 2007 to 2009, and was elected chairman in 2011. Collaborating with Global Diaspora in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Africa, Nweke was responsible for a structure with chapters in 18 European countries representing a Nigerian emigrant community (the "Diaspora") of around 6 million, its objective to support the national development of Nigeria. Nweke played a leading role<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nidoeurope.org/|title=SAVE THE WORLD|publisher=nidoeurope.org}}</ref> in researching and managing the Nigerian Diaspora input in the 2005 National Political Reforms Conference (NPRC) in Nigeria. He carried out research on the concept of "Out-of-Country Voting" and submitted a briefing to the Nigerian Senate on the subject, culminating in a vote in favor of writing the concept into law. In 2018 he was shortlisted for consideration by President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] for the position of director-general of the new Nigerian Diaspora Commission according to [https://www.theafricancourier.de/europe/nigerian-born-councillor-sworn-into-office-for-a-third-term-in-belgian-city/ African Courier Magazine Germany]

As chairman, Nweke focused on trade and investment and the engendering of sustainable strategic management processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proshareng.com/news/15675.html|title=Collins Nweke Signals First Diaspora National Development Strategy|author=Awoyemi Femi|publisher=proshareng.com}}</ref> He led a Trade Mission involving 45 Diaspora and 13 investment projects to the State of Osun, Nigeria in August 2012. However, Nweke's efforts to reform the Memorandum and Articles of Association of NIDO Europe at a Summit in Zurich, Switzerland, were thwarted. At the conclusion of his two-year term of office in November 2013, he disbanded the seven-man Board of Trustees <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erhZBdl0Gfs|title=NIDO-AGM 2013- ROTTERDAM|work=YouTube}}</ref> and declined to remain in office.

===Consultancy and advocacy===
Nweke was advisor to the Government of Nigeria on the role of the Diaspora in national development<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nidoeurope.org|title=SAVE THE WORLD|publisher=nidoeurope.org}}</ref> and consults for a number of public and private sector entities. Working with Peter Tichansky of [[Business Council for International Understanding]] (BCIU) and Nigeria Diplomatic Missions, he assisted in international public relations for Nigeria for the democratic Government of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]. He is a member of the Presidential Strategic Planning Committee on Nigeria Vision 2020. He worked as lead consultant for the African Diaspora Investment Forum in London, originated by [[NEPAD]] (New Partnership for Africa's Development), and for the [[Commonwealth Business Council]].

Nweke also worked with [[Ann Pettifor]] of Advocacy International UK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advocacyinternational.co.uk/?post_type=ai_team|title=Team - Advocacy International|publisher=advocacyinternational.co.uk}}</ref> in lobbying for debt cancellation for African countries. In this capacity he facilitated meetings of Africa Parliamentary Committees in the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and USA with African political leaders. He was co-founder with Prince Francis Abutoh (King Franky) of the Global Change for Africa Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/u/2/113660164714365572033/posts|title=Collins Nweke - Google+|publisher=plus.google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/nieuwe-awards-eren-inzet-voor-economische-verandering-van-afrika/article-normal-75433.html%20|title=Nieuwe awards eren inzet voor economische verandering van Afrika|author=Bron: Belga|publisher=knack.be}}</ref> He is founder and chief executive of Global Village Consult, brand-owners of Nigeria Human Capital, in collaboration with the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria. Following terror attacks in Nigeria by religious extremist group Boko Haram and political tensions as a result of the postponement of Nigeria's general elections Nweke organized a 'Peace March for Nigeria' on 28 February 2015 at Ostend City Hall and marching to the [[Nelson Mandela Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://businessdayonline.com/2015/02/nigerians-for-peace/#.VPXMPvnF-Sp|title=Nigerians for peace|work=businessdayonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-oostende/vredesmars-voor-nigeria-a2236660/|title=Vredesmars voor Nigeria|work=hln.be}}</ref> Before then, in the Council Sitting of 23 January 2015 of Ostend City Council, Nweke had demanded the inclusion of victims of terrorist attack in Baga, Nigeria in the one-minute silence slated to take place for the victims of the [[Charlie Hebdo]] attack in Paris. He motivated his request by arguing that African terrorist attack victims<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oostende.be/product.aspx?id=16766|title=Videoverslag Gemeenteraad - 15 01 23|work=oostende.be}}</ref> should receive equal condemnation as European victims. The minute silence was allowed after the debate

==Political career==

===City Advisory board for Ethnic Minorities===
Collins Nweke fought for the creation of the Ostend City Municipal Advisory Board for Ethnic Minorities in the late 1990s. He went on to be elected the founding chairman of the advisory board but resigned after about a year, frustrated at the lack of opportunity provided by the municipal authority and the civil service for him to carry out his functions. He heightened his agitation as floor member, maintaining that the council was not yet ready for a chairman of ethnic minority background. He called for more transparency, good governance and efficiency in the running of the advisory board. In the October 2004 edition of City Magazine, page 12, "De Grote Klok"<ref>http://www.oostende.be/file_uploads/585.pdf</ref> Nweke clarified his position on the functioning of the City Advisory board for Ethnic Minorities. The African Ripple Magazine <ref>{{cite web|url=http://africanripples.com/collins-nweke-becomes-ambassador-integration-and-diversity-nigeria-news/|title=Collins Nweke Becomes Ambassador Integration And Diversity|publisher=}}</ref> reported that on 4 June 2016, Collins Nweke was honoured with the Award of "Ambassador of Integration and Diversity" and handed a Charter to that effect by Mayor Hilde Claes at a ceremony in Hasselt, Belgium.

===City councillor===
[[File:Collins Nweke - Bart Tommelein.JPG|thumb|After swearing-in as Ostend City Councillor, Collins being congratulated by the council chairman, [[Bart Tommelein]], January 2013]]
He participated in the Ostend City Council Election of 2006. He was appointed Green Party Ostend point-man on social policy for the legislative period 2006–2012 and serving as councillor for social affairs, Public Centre for Social Welfare (OCMW) in the last two years of that legislature, becoming the first person born outside Belgium to occupy such political office in the province of West Flanders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=1635bfap|title=Collins Nweke is eerste buitenlands OCMW-raadslid|author=(dji)|work=Het Nieuwsblad}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nigerianewsday.com/world/1280-nigerian-makes-history-in-belgium|title=Nigerian Makes History In Belgium|author=Joseph1|publisher=nigerianewsday.com|access-date=26 December 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141226234035/http://nigerianewsday.com/world/1280-nigerian-makes-history-in-belgium|archive-date=26 December 2014|dead-url=yes}}</ref> Xpats.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xpats.com/nigerian-councillor-sworn|title=Nigerian councillor sworn in|publisher=xpats.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diasporacommittee.com/index.php/component/content/article/1-homepagenews/105-nigerian-sworn-in-as-councillor-for-second-term-of-office-in-belgium|title=Nigerian Sworn In As Councillor For Second Term Of Office In Belgium|author=Administrator|publisher=diasporacommittee.com|access-date=26 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227204236/http://www.diasporacommittee.com/index.php/component/content/article/1-homepagenews/105-nigerian-sworn-in-as-councillor-for-second-term-of-office-in-belgium|archive-date=27 December 2014|dead-url=yes}}</ref> Invited by [[Wouter De Vriendt]] Collins Nweke was not a member of any political party at the time, but he was appointed the party reference person for Social Policy in the legislative period 2006–2012, serving also as councillor for Social Welfare at the council's Public Center for social welfare.<ref name="oostende.be">{{cite web|url=http://www.oostende.be/sociaal%20huis|title=Sociaal Huis|publisher=oostende.be}}</ref>

He was elected by direct vote in 2012 into the city council. His portfolio includes the economy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citcom.be/oostende/raad-24-januari-2014/|title=Stad Oostende  –  Raad 24 januari 2014|publisher=citcom.be}}</ref> social policy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kw.knack.be/west-vlaanderen/nieuws/algemeen/morgen-nog-pediatrie-op-campus-henri-serruys/article-4000012696626.htm|title=Morgen nog pediatrie op campus Henri Serruys?|work=KW.be - Nieuws uit West-Vlaanderen}}</ref> international development and equality policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20130828_00712082|title=Klacht over bushalte zonder opstap en luifel|author=dji|work=Het Nieuwsblad}}</ref>

Following his election as councillor, he had to resign his membership of the Ostend City Municipal Advisory Board for Ethnic Minorities but continued his activism as opposition politician with ethnic minority affairs under his portfolio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blefo_20130514_002|title=Geen quota voor etnisch-culturele minderheden|author=Edwin Fontaine|work=Het Nieuwsblad}}</ref>

In the Dutch-language book ''{{Interlanguage link multi|De Keizer van Oostende|de}}'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Van den Eyden|first1=Wim|last2=Pauwels|first2=Muc|title=De Keizer van Oostende|publisher=Van Halewyck}}</ref> Nweke was credited with bringing about a spirited opposition and debate in the Council for Social Affairs which did not exist before his time. Due to being a lone opposition voice, the book argued, the issues he raised seemed to be largely ignored.

====Preferential treatment for children of councillors====
In the Council Session of 7 December 2011, Collins Nweke initiated a campaign to end the practice of preferential treatment for children of councillors in the allocation of places for student jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collinsnweke.be/tussenkomst_de_raadzitting_van_7_december_2011_over_studentenjob|title=Tussenkomst in de raadzitting van 7 december 2011 over studentenjob|publisher=collinsnweke.be}}</ref> Nweke continued to mount a strong opposition to the practice, arguing in Council that it was unjustified for his own two teenage sons to be employed by Council simply because their father happened to be a councillor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Groen Oostende - Collins Nweke stelt toekenning...|url=https://www.facebook.com/groenoostende/posts/249087678539485|work=De Zeewacht|publisher=facebook.com|date=15 June 2012}}</ref>

====''Economisch Huis Oostende'' controversy====
Early in 2014, Nweke expressed concern about the efficiency of the State Owned Enterprise (SOE), ''Economisch Huis Oostende'' (House of the Economy Ostend)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oostendewerkt.be|title=Economisch Huis Oostende|publisher=oostendewerkt.be}}</ref> in delivering its corporate goals despite considerable resources which the council had invested in it. He however declared that he was ready to give a fair chance to the new Alderman, Niko Geldhof, to inject some impetus into the firm. In the summer of 2014 Nweke commended the development on social media. However, before the monthly Council debate session of August 2014, Nweke raised questions about substantial losses the firm had recorded in the preceding years, and stated that his party would not approve further funding for the firm until a clear recovery plan was tendered to Council. Opposition party, [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) accused Collins of a flip-flop. Collins justified his approach in public statements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=blefo_01236639|title=Groen-raadslid slaat en zalft Economisch Huis|author=Edwin Fontaine|work=Het Nieuwsblad}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kw.knack.be/west-vlaanderen/nieuws/algemeen/politiek/groen-verzet-zich-tegen-subsidie-voor-economisch-huis-in-oostende/article-4000729398295.htm|title=Groen verzet zich tegen subsidie voor Economisch Huis in Oostende|author=Redactie  KW|work=KW.be - Nieuws uit West-Vlaanderen}}</ref>

====''Ostend Citizen List OK'' controversy====
A breakaway local political party OK, led by the former chairman of [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) Hendrik Wallijn in an interview in a national daily De Standaard of 20 September 2018 <ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180919_03762522}}</ref> disclosed that unable to gather sufficient signatures to have their party registered for participation in the municipal election of 14 October 2018, outgoing Councillor Collins Nweke had come to their rescue by accepting to sign the relevant acts. Considering the Right-Wing roots of the new party, some of Collins Nweke's party colleagues and many Left-Wing supporters could not understand the rationale behind his decision. In a public statement issued on 24 September 2018, Collins Nweke admitted that he is no ideological bedfellow of the new party but that it is not about him. As a democrat he believes that the participation of the new party in the election is a deepening of the local democracy, a new choice for the citizens.

====Ferry services====
On 24 October 2014, Collins was the only councillor out of 41 who joined a consortium of civil society organisations for a trip to [[Ramsgate]] and [[Canterbury]] (United Kingdom) agitating for the resumption of ferry services between Ostend and England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kw.knack.be/west-vlaanderen/nieuws/algemeen/verkeer-en-mobiliteit/actievoerders-steken-het-kanaal-over-om-te-ijveren-voor-een-nieuwe-ferryverbinding-tussen-oostende-en-engeland/article-4000783258456.htm?nb-handled=true&M_BT=2805991681146|title=Actievoerders steken het Kanaal over om te ijveren voor een nieuwe ferryverbinding tussen Oostende en Engeland|author=Redactie  KW|work=KW.be - Nieuws uit West-Vlaanderen}}</ref> In a statement on social media after the trip, he questioned the source of economic optimism of the City of Ramsgate and wondered why the mayor of Ostend was pessimistic about business prospects for the city.

===2014 campaign for Member of the European Parliament===
After a successful [[primary election]] and selection as candidate,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groen.be/node/4166/candidate|title=Collins Nweke|publisher=groen.be}}</ref> Collins Nweke began his campaign<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaFIxXLWcDg|title=Sema Talk Show April 25 2014 - Collins NWEKE|work=YouTube}}</ref> as Green Party candidate for Member European Parliament in February 2014 for the election of 25 May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nigeriacamera.net/first-of-its-kind-as-nigeria-born-collins-nweke-is-contesting-in-eu-paliament-election-under-the-green-party-in-belgium/|title=First of its kind as Nigeria born Collins Nweke is contesting in EU Parliament Election Under the green party in Belgium - Nigeria Camera|work=Nigeria Camera|access-date=9 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109070453/http://nigeriacamera.net/first-of-its-kind-as-nigeria-born-collins-nweke-is-contesting-in-eu-paliament-election-under-the-green-party-in-belgium/|archive-date=9 January 2015|dead-url=yes}}</ref> The focus of his campaign was on Poverty & Social Exclusion, Social Economy, Employment (special employment measures and policies), Internationalization, Energy Poverty, Solidarity Mechanisms, Africa Trade Relations and Effective human capital management. Nweke was not elected, winning 11,803 votes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://verkiezingen2014.belgium.be/en/eur/preferred/preferred_EUL12025_1000014.html|title=Elections 2014 - European Parliament - Preference votes Dutch Electoral College-|publisher=verkiezingen2014.belgium.be}}</ref> although his Green Party colleague, the incumbent member, [[Bart Staes]], was re-elected. On 10 November 2014 Collins Nweke convened and inaugurated<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbRitMPFEQQ|title=Sema Talk Show - Talking with Collins NWEKE|work=YouTube}}</ref> the Africa Social Policy Reform Summit at the European Parliament, hosted by Bart Staes.
