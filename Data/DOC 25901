==Life Sketch==
P. K. Narayanan Nambiar was born in Killikurissimangalam, in Palakkad, Kerala famous [[koodiyattom]] maestro [[Mani Madhava Chakiar]] and Kochampilli Kunjimalu Nangiaramma, a known Nangiarkoothu artist in 1927. He did his early schooling in [[gurukula]] system in Killikkurissimangalam under the tutelage of his father. Later, he started learning koodiyattom from his father and gurus like Kochampilli Raman Nambiar and Meledath Govindan Nambiar<ref name="mykerala">{{cite web|url=http://www.mykerala.net/mizhavu/NarayananNambiar.html|author=Prem Manasvi|publisher=mykerala.net|title=Mizhavu Guru P.K. Narayanan Nambiar|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> and mastered the art of playing ''mizhavu''.

Nambiar's debut was at the Kottakkal Kovilakam Siva temple in [[Malappuram]] in 1948 at the age of 21. He started his career as a Kutiyattam actor in 1954 at Lakkidi Kunjan Memorial Library where he played [[Arjuna]] in ''Subradhananjayam'', which was the first time the art of Koodiyattom was performed outside the four walls of a temple. Nambiar, was the first person outside the caste of ''Chakiar'' to perform as an actor in Koodiyattom. In 1966, he joined [[Kerala Kalamandalam]], as the [[Guru]] of mizhavu. Known mizhavu performers such as Easwaran Unni, V.K.K. Hariharan and Edanadu Unnikrishnan Nambiar were his students in Kalamandalm.<ref name="thehindu">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/masterly-movements-and-strokes/article2050728.ece|publisher=thehindu.com|title=Masterly movements and strokes - The Hindu|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>

Nambiar is married to Santha Nangiaramma, a performer in her younger days. He has two sons and two daughters, all of them are known artists. His daughter, Vasanthi Narayanan is an exponent of both Koodiyattom and Nangiarkoothu and performs as a member of the gurukulam while the second daughter, Dr. P.K. Jayanthi is a Sanskrit scholar with specialisation in koodiyattom serving at the Sanskrit University. Both the sons, Unnikrishnan Nambiar and Harish Nambiar are well-known [[mizhavu]], [[koothu]] and [[pathakam]] artists. In fact Harish is the only non-Chakyar to perform the intricate ''Mantrankam''.<ref name="thehindu"/>

Narayanan Nambiar is credited with evolving a scheme for imparting systematic training on the mizhavu during his time at kalamandalam where he served until his retirement in 1988. He developed a unique form of [[jugalbandi]] involving mizhavu and [[edakka]], another percussion instrument called ''Mizhavu Thayambaka''. He is also admired for his efforts and contributions in reviving [[Nangiar Koothu]], the female aspect of Koodiyattam, which is a female solo performance.<ref name="keralatourism">{{cite web|url=https://www.keralatourism.org/leadinglights/guru-panivada-tilaka-p-k-narayanan-nambiar/2|publisher=keralatourism.org|title=Guru Panivada Tilaka P.

Nambiar authored several ''Attaprakarams'' (Stage Manuals) for Koodiiyattom such as the staging of ''Kaliyaankam'', the performance manual of which was composed over 400 years ago. He also initiated a new dance form in the play called ''Hallisakam''. He is also noted for his contribution in the form of the reworked version of ''Matha Vilasom Prahasanam'', a 400-year-old Koodiyattom play which was re-constructed and choreographed to give a new style of presentation.

Nambiar presently runs a school of arts, ''Padmashri Madhava Chakyar Gurukulam'' which is considered a seat of learning for Koodiyattom by [[Lalit Kala Akademi]].<ref name="kutiyattam">{{cite web|url=http://www.kutiyattam.com/index-3.html|publisher=kutiyattam.com|title=index-3|accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>
