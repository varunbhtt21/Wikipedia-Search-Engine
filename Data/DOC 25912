=== ''EastEnders'' ===
On 19 March 2014, it was announced that a popular [[BBC]] soap opera, ''[[EastEnders]],'' had cast Hammond in the role of disabled market trader [[Donna Yates]].  The character of Donna was not originally going to be written into ''EastEnders'' as a disabled character, but Hammond impressed bosses at her audition, and was awarded the part.  Donna is the second disabled regular in the soap, after [[Adam Best (EastEnders)|Adam Best]] ([[David Proud]]) who left the show in 2010.<ref name="EastEnders casting">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a558646/eastenders-adds-new-disabled-character-played-by-lisa-hammond.html#~pqOdVg0kEW0Vw3|title=EastEnders adds new disabled character|date=19 March 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  Speaking of her casting, Hammond said: "I'm really excited to join the cast of ''EastEnders''. It's a great opportunity to be a part of such a big and popular show. Donna is a bit of a handful but they're always the most fun characters to play! It feels good to be bad!"<ref name="EastEnders casting"/> Donna's storylines have included: her fierce attitude, which often runs her into arguments; the introduction of her family; and a relationship with [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]). Lisa decided to quit the soap in 2018 to pursue other roles. Her last appearance in ''EastEnders'' was on 20 July 2018, when Donna was seen leaving in the back of a black cab.

== Personal life ==
Hammond has grown up with a restricted growth condition.<ref name="Abuse">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a673082/eastenders-star-lisa-hammond-ive-been-shouted-at-over-my-wheelchair.html|title=EastEnders star on disability abuse|date=11 October 2015|publisher=}}</ref>  She revealed in October 2015 that she has received abuse from strangers in the street because of her disability.  She spoke about how her wheelchair use received backlash from the public.  "The main image of wheelchair users is that of paralysis. So when I get out of my chair to do a scene on my feet, people don't like it.  If I'm feeling good and want to walk in that scene, I will.  But if I can't or pain levels are bad then I'll use my chair.  I've been shouted at.  I've had people say, 'Oi, why are you in a chair when you were walking on ''EastEnders'' last night?'"<ref name="Abuse"/>  Hammond also revealed how she had received criticism like this before joining ''EastEnders'' and that she can struggle with this backlash.  "People always think I'm this feisty girl and I can hold my own but in those moments you just don't think of anything to say.  It's shock and disbelief.  I have to laugh it off."<ref name="Abuse"/>

On 7 September 2017, she participated in the documentary series [[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|''Who Do You Think You Are?'']] and discovered that her maternal side originally came from Wales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lisa Hammond - Who Do You Think You Are |url=https://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/featuredarticles/2017/who-do-you-think-you-are/lisa-hammond-636/|year=2017}}</ref>
