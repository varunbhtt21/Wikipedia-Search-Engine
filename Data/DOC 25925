The '''Aduana Building''', also known as the '''Intendencia''', was a Spanish colonial structure in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] that housed several government offices through the years.  It is located in front of the [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|BPI Intramuros]] (formerly the site of the old Santo Domingo Church) at [[Plaza España]], Soriano (Aduana) Ave. corner Muralla St. in [[Intramuros]].

== Architecture ==
This two-storey governmental structure follows a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] tradition, with an emphasized horizontality and symmetrical form, particularly on the design of its [[façade]].<ref name=":2" /> The central bay had three arched entrances and two principal staircases built around the two atriums.<ref name=":0" /> The rectangular fenestration on the upper most story were decorated with rustication. The window-like portals opening out to small balconies were framed with [[pilaster]]s topped with ornate [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] and were adorned with elaborate geometrical grillework. Similar ornate grillework also decorated the main entryways in the building.<ref name=":2" />

== History ==
The Aduana, or Custom House, was built in Intramuros to attract merchants to remain within its walls rather than outside of it.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Aduana|url=http://intramuros2007.wordpress.com/2007/02/18/aduana/|website=Intramuros|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref> Records show that in 1822, a Spanish [[engineer]] Tomás Cortes took charge of the project and began its construction in 1823. Despite objections due to insufficient space for warehousing and its distance from the port, the construction continued until its completion in 1829.<ref name=":0" /> However, in 1863 the Aduana suffered damages from an earthquake, which led to its demolition in 1872.<ref name=":1">Torres, Jose Victor Z. 2005. ''Ciudad Murada: A Walk Through Historic Intramuros.'' Manila: Intramuros Administration and Vibal Publishing House. {{ISBN|971072276X}} </ref> Reconstruction of the building was later awarded to Luis Perez Yap-Sionjue, which began in 1874 and was completed in 1876. The rebuilding of the structure was still based from the original design of Cortes<ref name=":2">"[http://burjdubai91.wix.com/retrospektura#!__the-aduana The Aduana Intendencia]". ''Retrospektura.'' Accessed on 03 May 2014.</ref> but it has now housed the Custom Offices, the Civil Administration Office (''Intendencia General de Hacienda''), the Treasury, and the [[Manila Mint|Mint House]] (''Casa de Moneda'').<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> When the Customs transferred, the offices of the Mint House and Treasury remained in the building and was renamed as Intendencia.<ref name=":2" />

During [[World War II]], the building once again suffered damages; first by the Japanese bombings in 1941 and later on by the American and Filipino military artillery during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]] of 1945.<ref name=":1" /> It was repaired after the war and functioned as the Offices of the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]], the National Treasury and eventually the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]].<ref name=":0" /> Its eventual abandonment was in 1979 when the building was ravaged by fire.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

In 1997, the [[National Archives of the Philippines|National Archives]] acquired the building to serve as their future office. Restoration efforts have already commenced as to date.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ignacio |first1=Teresita |title=National Archives of the Philippines |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=2&i=181 |publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts |accessdate=1 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101114803/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=2&i=181 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Villaon|first1=Augusto|title=What being ‘endangered’ means for Intramuros|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/49845/what-being-%E2%80%98endangered%E2%80%99-means-for-intramuros|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>
