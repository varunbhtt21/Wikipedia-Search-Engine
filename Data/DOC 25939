;Tiebreakers
The teams were ranked according to [[Points (association football)|points]] (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If tied on points, tiebreakers would be applied in the following order:<ref name="regulations"/>
#Number of points obtained in games between the teams concerned;
#[[Goal difference]] in games between the teams concerned;
#Goals scored in games between the teams concerned;
#If, after applying criteria 1 to 3 to several teams, two teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the two teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 7 apply;
#Goal difference in all games;
#Goals scored in all games;
#Drawing of lots.

All times were local, [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] ([[UTC±00:00|UTC±0]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cafonline.com/Portals/0/Updated%20Fixtures.pdf|title=Fixtures of the Final Tournament of the 2nd U23 Africa Cup of Nations, Senegal 2015|publisher=CAF}}</ref>
