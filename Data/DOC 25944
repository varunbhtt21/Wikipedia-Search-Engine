'''German submarine ''U-621''''' was a [[German Type VIIC submarine|Type VIIC]] [[U-boat]] built for [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' for service during [[World War II]].
She was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 1 July 1941 by [[Blohm & Voss]] in [[Hamburg]] as yard number 597, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 19 March 1942 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 7 May 1942 under ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' Horst Schünemann.

==Design==
[[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|German Type VIIC submarines]] were preceded by the shorter [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIB|Type VIIB submarines]]. ''U-621'' had a displacement of {{convert|769|t|LT}} when at the surface and {{convert|871|t|LT}} while submerged.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} She had a total length of {{convert|67.10|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[pressure hull]] length of {{convert|50.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.20|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|9.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a [[draught (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|4.74|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The submarine was powered by two [[Germaniawerft]] F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder [[supercharged]] [[diesel engine]]s producing a total of {{convert|2800 to 3200|PS|kW shp|-1}} for use while surfaced, two [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] GG UB 720/8 [[Motor–generator|double-acting electric motors]] producing a total of {{convert|750|PS|kW shp}} for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two {{convert|1.23|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[propeller]]s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to {{convert|230|m}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of {{convert|17.7|kn}} and a maximum submerged speed of {{convert|7.6|kn}}.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}} When submerged, the boat could operate for {{convert|80|nmi}} at {{convert|4|kn}}; when surfaced, she could travel {{convert|8500|nmi}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. ''U-621'' was fitted with five {{convert|53.3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen [[torpedo]]es, one [[8.8 cm SK C/35 naval gun|{{convert|8.8|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} SK C/35 naval gun]], 220 rounds, and a [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a [[Ship's company|complement]] of between forty-four and sixty.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=43-46}}

==Service history==
The boat's service began on 7 May 1942 for training as part of the [[8th U-boat Flotilla]]. After training was completed she transferred to the [[9th U-boat Flotilla|9th flotilla]] on 1 October 1942 for active service.

In ten patrols she sank four merchant ships for a total of {{GRT|20,159|disp=long}}, plus one auxiliary warship. She also damaged two more ships.

===Wolfpacks===
She took part in eleven [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]], namely,
*Panther (10–16 October 1942)
*Puma (16–29 October 1942)
*Raufbold (11–18 December 1942)
*Hartherz (3–7 February 1943)
*Ritter (11–26 February 1943)
*Burggraf (4–5 March 1942)
*[[Wolfpack Raubgraf|Raubgraf]] (7–15 March 1943)
*Amsel 1 (3–6 May 1943)
*Elbe (7–10 May 1943)
*Elbe 2 (10–14 May 1943)
*Mosel (19–24 May 1943)

===Fate===
She was sunk by a depth charges dropped by three Royal Canadian Navy destroyers, {{HMCS|Ottawa|H31|6}}, {{HMCS|Kootenay|H75|6}} and {{HMCS|Chaudiere|H99|6}} on 18 August 1944 near [[La Rochelle]] at position {{coord|45|52|N|02|36|W|display=inline, title}}.
