The '''[[pole vault]] at the [[Summer Olympics]]''' is grouped among the four [[track and field]] jumping events held at the [[multi-sport event]]. The men's pole vault has been present on the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]] since the first [[Summer Olympics in 1896]]. The women's event is one of the latest additions to the programme, first being contested at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] – along with the addition of the [[hammer throw]], this brought the women's field event programme to parity with the men's.

The [[List of Olympic records in athletics|Olympic records]] for the event are {{T&Fcalc|6.03}} for men, set by [[Thiago Braz da Silva]] in 2016, and {{T&Fcalc|5.05}} for women, set by [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] in 2008. Isinbayeva's 2008 mark was a [[Women's pole vault world record progression|world record]] at the time and her 2004 victory in {{T&Fcalc|4.91}} had been the first women's world record in the pole vault to be set at the Olympics. In spite of its longer history, the men's Olympic event has only seen two world record marks – a clearance of {{T&Fcalc|4.09}} by [[Frank Foss (athlete)|Frank Foss]] at the [[1920 Antwerp Olympics]] and  [[Władysław Kozakiewicz]]'s vault of {{T&Fcalc|5.78}} to win at the [[1980 Moscow Olympics]].<ref name=iaaf>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134819/http://www.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/15/63/20090706014834_httppostedfile_p345-688_11303.pdf 12th IAAF World Championships In Athletics: IAAF Statistics Handbook Berlin 2009] (pgs. 546, 645).

[[William Hoyt (athlete)|William Hoyt]] was the first Olympic champion in 1896 and [[Stacy Dragila]] became the first female Olympic pole vault champion over 100 years later in 2000. Thiago Braz da Silva and [[Ekaterini Stefanidi]] are the reigning Olympic champions from 2016. Yelena Isinbayeva and [[Bob Richards]] are the only two athletes to win two Olympic pole vault titles, and also the only two athletes to win more than two Olympic medals in the discipline. The [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] is by far the most successful nation in the event, having won 21 gold medals and 49 medals in total. [[France at the Olympics|France]] is the next most successful with three gold medallists.

==Intercalated Games==
The [[1906 Intercalated Games]] were held in [[Athens]] and at the time were officially recognised as part of the [[Olympic Games]] series, with the intention being to hold a games in Greece in two-year intervals between the internationally held Olympics. However, this plan never came to fruition and the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) later decided not to recognise these games as part of the official Olympic series. Some sports historians continue to treat the results of these games as part of the Olympic canon.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1906/ 1906 Athina Summer Games]. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 26 January 2014.</ref>

Continuing its presence since the first Olympics, a men's pole vault event was contested at the 1906 Games. France's [[Fernand Gonder]] entered as the world record holder and delivered by winning in an Olympic record-equalling mark.<ref name=1906PV>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1906/ATH/mens-pole-vault.html Athletics at the 1906 Athina Summer Games: Men's Pole Vault]. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 3 May 2014.</ref> The runner-up, [[Bruno Söderström]] of Sweden, also won a [[javelin throw]] medal that year.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/so/bruno-soderstrom-1.html Bruno Söderström].

==Non-canonical Olympic events==
In addition to the main [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics – Men's pole vault|1900 Olympic men's pole vault]], a [[Handicapping|handicap]] competition was held four days later. The joint fourth-place finishers in the main event took the top two spots, with [[Jakab Kauser]] posting a mark of 3.45&nbsp;m with a handicap of 45&nbsp;cm, and [[Eric Lemming]] coming second with his result of 3.40&nbsp;m with a 30&nbsp;cm handicap. [[Meredith Colket]], the silver medallist in the main event registered 3.20&nbsp;m with a handicap of 15&nbsp;cm.<ref name=GBROG>[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/ogm.htm Handicap Olympic Athletics Events]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 18 April 2014.</ref><ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/ATH/mens-pole-vault-handicap.html Athletics at the 1900 Paris Summer Games: Men's Pole Vault, Handicap]. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 5 May 2014.</ref> Two further non-handicap "scratch" competitions were held that are no longer considered canon Olympic events: the American champion [[Bascom Johnson]] won an event on 16 July,<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/ATH/mens-special-scratch-pole-vault-1.html Athletics at the 1900 Paris Summer Games: Men's Special Scratch Pole Vault #1]. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 5 May 2014.</ref> then three days later [[Daniel Horton (athlete)|Daniel Horton]] (a triple jump competitor) defeated [[Charles Dvorak]] in a consolation event – both had missed the final proper as it was held on the [[Sabbath]]. Dvorak went on to win the Olympic pole vault gold in 1904.<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/ATH/mens-special-scratch-pole-vault-2.html Athletics at the 1900 Paris Summer Games: Men's Special Scratch Pole Vault #2].

The handicap event returned at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. [[LeRoy Samse]], the runner-up in the main [[Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – Men's pole vault|Olympic pole vault]], won with 3.58&nbsp;m and a handicap of one inch. [[Walter Dray]], sixth in the Olympic event, came second with 3.58&nbsp;m and a ten-inch handicap, while Olympic fifth placer [[Claude Allen (athlete)|Claude Allen]] recorded 3.55&nbsp;m off a seven-inch handicap.<ref name=GBROG/>

These events are no longer considered part of the official Olympic history of the pole vault or the athletics programme in general. Consequently, medals from these competitions have not been assigned to nations on the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|all-time medal tables]].<ref name=GBROG/>
