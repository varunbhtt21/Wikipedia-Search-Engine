Title : Poetry Association of Scotland
Text : '''The Poetry Association of Scotland''' (or '''PAS'''), formerly known as the '''Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse''', is a public, membership-based literary society founded in 1924 principally by [[John Masefield]] (along with other figures such as [[Marion Angus]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In its present form, the Association, which is a [[registered charity]], runs an annual series of monthly [[poetry reading]]s featuring invited poets from both Scottish and international circuits, as well as regular talks on poetry-related topics by distinguished speakers, including its biennial [[Hugh MacDiarmid Lecture]]. The Association's events in recent years have generally, though not exclusively, been held in the [[Scottish Poetry Library]] in [[Edinburgh]].

Although a single-tier organisation today, in past decades the Association had multiple area branches throughout [[Scotland]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}
