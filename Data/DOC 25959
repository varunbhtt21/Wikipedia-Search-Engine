'''Herr Magnus og bjærgtrolden''' ('Sir Magnus and the Mountain Troll') is a Danish [[ballad]] (''[[The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad]]'' A 59, ''Proposal of supernatural woman rejected''; ''[[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser]]'' 48).

It is attested in the nineteenth-century [[Denmark]] in only two versions, with three attestations, each of eight or nine stanzas. It is also found in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] ([[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader|SMB]] 26).

==Summary==

A supernatural maiden (a [[mermaid]] in Norway and sometimes Sweden, or a female mountain being in other Swedish versions and in Denmark) tries to woo Sir Magnus by offering generous gifts. Magnus, however, rejects her; and in the Danish versions, he chops her into small pieces with his sword.<ref>''The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad: A Descriptive Catalogue'', ed. by Bengt R.
