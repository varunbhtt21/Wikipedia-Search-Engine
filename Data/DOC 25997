==Lyrics and music==
According to King, she did not consciously attempt to write "Beautiful" but it came to her spontaneously.<ref name=king>{{cite book|title=A Natural Woman: A Memoir|author=[[Carole King|King, C.]]|pages=415–416|year=2012|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn= 1455512613}}</ref>  It stemmed from her realization while riding the [[New York City Subway]] that the way she perceived others reflected how she herself felt.<ref name=king/>  She has also stated that because it came to her spontaneously, she initially didn't realize some of the professional details of the song, such as the lack of [[rhyme]] in the [[refrain]], which if she was writing the song consciously she would have included.<ref name=king/>

''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' critic [[Jon Landau]] describes "Beautiful" as an "uptempo song."<ref name=rs>{{cite web|title=Tapestry|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/tapestry-19710429|date=April 29, 1971|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2014-05-03|author=[[Jon Landau|Landau, J.]]}}</ref>  The lyrics reflect themes present throughout the ''Tapestry'' album, such as the importance of self-esteem and positive outlook.<ref name=words>{{cite book|title=The Words and Music of Carole King|author=Perone, J.E.|pages=35–36, 40|year=2006|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0275990273}}</ref>  Within the song, beauty is defined not as an attractive outward appearance but as inner beauty.<ref name=words/>  In the verses of the song, the singer sings about the unhappy people she sees around her.<ref name=words/>  The message is emphasized by setting the verses in a [[minor key]] and to a straightforward [[rhythm]] and singing at a relatively low [[pitch (music)|pitch]].<ref name=rs/><ref name=words/>  The refrain, describes the need for optimism and self-esteem in order to be successful, and is reinforced by being set in a [[major key]] and to a [[syncopated]] rhythm and at a higher pitch.<ref name=rs/><ref name=words/>

Instrumentation for "Beautiful" includes King playing piano and [[synthesizer]], Charles Larkey on [[bass guitar]], Joel O'Brien on drums and [[Danny Kortchmar]] on [[conga drum]]s.<ref name=words/>  Author James Perone praises the song as "great sleeper track" but criticizes the use of the synthesizer, which although not prominent he believes sounds synthetic, detracting from the song's emphasis on being real.<ref name=words/>  ''[[Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' critic Mark Coleman states that King's performance "rescues 'Beautiful' from the sentimental deep end."<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|author=Coleman, M.|editor1=DeCurtis, A. |editor2=Henke, J. |editor3=George-Warren, H. |page=160|year=1992|publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers|edition=3rd|isbn=0679737294}}</ref>
