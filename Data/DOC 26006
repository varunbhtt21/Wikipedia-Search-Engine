== History ==

=== Avery Normal Institute, 1865–1954 ===

Founded in 1865, the Avery Normal Institute was the first accredited secondary school for African Americans in Charleston, South Carolina. Established by the New York-based [[American Missionary Association]] (AMA), the school was initially named the Tappan School in honor of New York abolitionist [[Lewis Tappan]], a founding member of the American Missionary Association. It was soon renamed the Saxton School after Union General [[Rufus B. Saxton]], an assistant commissioner of the [[Freedmen’s Bureau]]. At that time, the school was temporarily located in several buildings appropriated by the federal government in Charleston during Reconstruction. Northern white missionaries and members of Charleston’s antebellum free Black community, such as brothers Thomas and [[Francis Cardozo]], staffed the school. Thomas W. Cardozo (1865–1866) was the school’s first principal, and Francis was the second (1866–1868). Francis Cardozo campaigned to construct a permanent building for the school, and he persuaded the AMA’s traveling secretary, E. P. Smith, to seek $10,000 from the late Reverend Charles Avery’s estate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With additional aid from the Freedmen’s Bureau, the new school building was dedicated on May 7, 1868 and named the Avery Normal Institute.<ref name="auto" />
Cardozo quickly expanded the school’s mission beyond primary and secondary education to include teacher training. Prior to 1919, a citywide ordinance in Charleston prohibited African Americans from teaching in all but one of the city’s Black public schools. For this reason, many Avery graduates, such as [[Septima Clark]], taught in one-room schoolhouses all over South Carolina, especially in the rural areas of the Lowcountry region surrounding Charleston.<ref>Charron, Katharine(2009). ''Freedom's Teacher: The Life of Septima Clark'', The University of North Carolina Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8078-7222-2}}</ref> Subsequent Avery principals, such as Morrison A. Holmes, continued the school’s tradition of teacher training and classical education, though the instructors were white missionaries rather than local African Americans like the Cardozo brothers.<ref name="auto" /><ref>Powers, Bernard.(1994). ''Black Charlestonians: A Social History, 1822–1885'', Fayetteville, Arkansas: The University of Arkansas Press.</ref>
Avery Principal Benjamin Cox (1915–1936) and his wife, Jeanette Keeble Cox, revitalized the school through adding new facilities, new courses to the curriculum, and instituting a variety of cultural improvements such as theatrical plays and musical performances. Cox was the first Black principal at Avery since Cardozo. In 1917, Avery helped establish the city’s branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). The first Charleston NAACP president was noted artist Edwin Harleston (who graduated from Avery in 1900). Subsequent Avery Principals Frank DeCosta (1936–1940) and L. Howard Bennett (1941–1943) moved the school in a more progressive direction.<ref name="auto" />
Principal John F. Potts presided over Avery’s transition to a public school in 1947. Coinciding with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the county school board closed the Avery Normal Institute and merged its students and faculty with [[Burke High School (South Carolina)|Burke High School]] in 1954, citing financial reasons.

The Avery Normal Institute prepared its students for professional careers and leadership roles. Avery students and teachers were often active in the state’s [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 60s, even after the school closed. For example, Avery graduates who became prominent civil rights activists included [[Cecelia Cabaniss Saunders]],<ref>Harlan Green and Jessica Lancia, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23057377 "The Holloway Scrapbook: The Legacy of a Charleston Family"] ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'' 111(1/2)(January/April 2010): 5-33.</ref> [[Septima Clark]], J. Andrew Simmons, [[John McCray]], John H. Wrighten, Jr., Arthur J. Clement, Jr., and J. Arthur Brown.<ref name="auto" />

=== Avery Institute for Afro-American History and Culture ===

After 1954, Dr. John Palmer purchased the Avery buildings and operated Palmer Business College on the site for more than two decades, when the school moved to another downtown location. In 1978, a group of Avery graduates (known as “Averyites”) and friends of Avery organized The Avery Institute of Afro-American History and Culture. Their purpose was to obtain the former Avery Normal School buildings and establish an archives and museum dedicated to preserving African-American history and culture in the South Carolina Lowcountry. The Avery Institute’s first president was the Honorable Lucille S. Whipper, a former member of the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] from [[Charleston County]].

To obtain institutional support and fulfill its long-term goals, the organization chose to become affiliated with the College of Charleston. The two groups jointly sought and obtained a federal planning grant in 1981 to organize programs and explore future options. Out of the planning grant came the concept of a research center as a cooperative project of the Avery Institute of Afro-American History and Culture and the College of Charleston. The College of Charleston was subsequently deeded the 123 and 125 Bull Street properties to establish the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture.<ref name="auto2" /><ref name="auto1" />

=== The Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, 1985–present ===

In 1985, The Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture was established as part of the academic program of the College of Charleston. Despite delays caused by [[Hurricane Hugo]] (September 21, 1989), the grand opening of the building took place on October 6, 1990. Today the Avery Institute is a separate nonprofit organization that provides support to the Avery Research Center’s museum, education, and public history outreach programs and operations, as well as assisting the Avery Research Center in acquiring archival collections.

== Museum and Historic Site ==

The Avery Research Center is a small museum with several galleries that showcase permanent and changing exhibitions. Each year, the Avery Research Center staff develops exhibitions from its archival materials, art, and rare manuscript collections.

== Archival Collections ==

The Avery Research Center’s Archival Collections hold over six thousand primary and secondary sources, including approximately two hundred manuscript collections, varying in size from a few items to over fifty linear feet. The collections also contain over five thousand printed items, ranging from standard texts, rare books, and pamphlets to dissertations and journals; over four thousand photographs; and hundreds of reels of microfilm, VHS tapes, clipping files, and audio and video recordings in digital formats. There are also dozens of artifact collections encompassing a range of materials relevant to slavery, material culture from West Africa, and even a sweetgrass basket collection.

Processed manuscript collections and other catalogued items can be searched via the College of Charleston’s Addlestone Library‘s online catalogue.<ref>College of Charleston Libraries. http://www.cofc.edu/library/, Accessed on 3 May 2014.</ref> The Avery Research Center’s website also features an online finding aid.<ref>Avery Research Center Archival Collections. http://avery.cofc.edu/archives/collection_list.php, Accessed on 3 May 2014.</ref> Selected digitally archived materials are also available online through the [[Lowcountry Digital Library]].<ref>Lowcountry Digital Library: Avery Collections. http://lcdl.library.cofc.edu/content/avery-research-center, Accessed on 3 May 2014.</ref> Numerous digitized archival materials from Avery are also featured in online exhibitions with the Lowcountry Digital History Initiative.<ref>Lowcountry Digital History Initiative. http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu , Accessed on 3 May 2014.</ref>

== Public Programming and Educational Outreach ==

Events and programs at the Avery Research Center range from public lectures, workshops, film screenings, performances, annual conferences, symposia, and exhibition openings, to private group events, meetings, and presentations. Avery Research Center staff may organize and sponsor these events, or they may be arranged by an outside organization at the College of Charleston or elsewhere. Events organized by the Avery Research Center staff typically focus on topics relevant to Avery Research Center’s mission of promoting education and dialogue about African-American history, culture, and contemporary issues in the Lowcountry and/or in the wider African diaspora. Event spaces in the Avery Research Center building include the McKinley Washington Auditorium, as well as various other exhibition galleries and classrooms. Avery Research Center staff members regularly update the Programs calendar with upcoming events.<ref>Avery Research Center: Programs http://avery.cofc.edu/programs/, Accessed on 3 May 2014.</ref>
The Avery Research Center staff conducts education programs on and offsite that highlight individuals, social movements, and historical events relevant to the South Carolina Lowcountry African-American history and culture through primary and secondary sources from the Avery Research Center’s archives.
