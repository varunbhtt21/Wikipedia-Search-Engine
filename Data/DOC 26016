'''Wicked Strong''' (foaled April 28, 2011 in Kentucky) is an American [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse. He established himself as a contender for the [[2014 Kentucky Derby]] with a win in the [[Wood Memorial Stakes]]. He finished fourth in both the Kentucky Derby and the [[Belmont Stakes]] before winning the [[Jim Dandy Stakes]].

==Background==
Wicked Strong is a bay colt with a white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|star]] bred in Kentucky by William F. Lynn. He is one of the best horses sired by [[Hard Spun]], who finished second in the [[2007 Kentucky Derby]] before winning the [[King's Bishop Stakes]]. Hard Spun's other progeny includes [[CCA Oaks]] and [[Alabama Stakes]] winner [[Questing (horse)|Questing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?horse_id=671451&popup=1 |title=Hard Spun Stud Record |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref> His dam, Moyne Abbey was a half sister to the Grade III winner Gulch Approval and a descendent of the influential broodmare Lisette, making her a distant relative of [[Snow Chief]], [[Al Bahathri]] and [[Haafhd]].<ref name="bloodlines1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family9e.htm |title=Thoroughbred Bloodlines - Maid Of Masham - Family 9-e |publisher=Bloodlines.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>

Originally named Moyne Spun, the colt was sent to the [[yearling (horse)|yearling]] sale at Keeneland in September 2012. He was bought for $375,000 by Centennial Farms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/sales/results/individual_home.sd?tab=&st=8&l=&i=1&ob=ln&od=ASC&page=1&fv=131072&df=2012-09-10&dt=2012-09-13&venue_id=6&hn=&s=&a=&sin=&dn=Moyne+Abbey&sdn=&vn=&b=&mip=&map=&lm=#individualResultsTabs=catalogue_6 |title=Keeneland September Yearlings 2012 |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref> a group from [[Boston]] who renamed their purchase "Wicked Strong".

==Racing career==

===2013: two-year-old season===
Wicked Strong made his racecourse debut in a six-furlong [[maiden race|maiden special weight]] at [[Belmont Park]] on September 21. Ridden by [[Edgar Prado]], he started slowly but made steady progress and finished second, five and a half [[horse length|lengths]] behind winner Manhattan Johnnie. In the following month, he was moved up in distance for a one-mile maiden at the same track. Prado moved the colt up to dispute the lead on the outside with five sixteenths of a mile left to run. Wicked Strong gained the advantage after a brief struggle with Endowment Manager and recorded his first success, winning by two lengths from Cool Samurai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=BEL&dt=10/26/2013&ctry=USA&race=5 |title=Maiden Special Weight result |publisher=equibase |date=26 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref> Wicked Strong was moved up in class for his final start of the year, the [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] [[Remsen Stakes]] at Aqueduct on November 30 in which [[Rajiv Maragh]] took over from Prado. He started awkwardly but finished well to take third, beaten a nose and half a length by [[Honor Code (horse)|Honor Code]] and [[Cairo Prince]] despite tossing his head and shying away from his rider's [[riding crop|stick]] in the straight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=AQU&dt=11/30/2013&ctry=USA&race=9 |title=Remsen Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=November 30, 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>

===2014: three-year-old season===
Wicked Strong began his second season with two runs at [[Gulfstream Park]]. In January, he started the [[Fractional odds|4.3/1]] third favorite for the Grade II [[Holy Bull Stakes]] but was never in contention and was eased down in the closing stages by his rider [[Javier Castellano]] to finish ninth of the eleven runners behind Cairo Prince. [[Jose Lezcano]] became the fourth jockey to ride the colt when he was dropped in class to contest an allowance race on February 22. He appeared outpaced in the early stages but passed tiring rivals in the straight and finished fourth of the ten runners behind Constitution. In April, Wicked Strong was moved north for the Grade I Wood Memorial Stakes at Aqueduct, a major trial race for the Kentucky Derby. The betting market was dominated by the unbeaten colts Social Inclusion and Samraat, and Wicked Strong, ridden by Maragh, started at 9.2/1. The colt settled on the inside before switching out and turning into the straight in fourth place. He overtook Social Inclusion inside the final furlong and drew away to win "readily" by three and a half lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=599654&r_date=2014-04-05&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Wood Memorial result |publisher=[[Racing Post]] |date=April 5, 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>

In the [[2014 Kentucky Derby]], Wicked Strong, the 6.5/1 second favorite, drew number 20 post position, on the far outside of the field. Jerkens admitted that the draw was disadvantageous and commented that "[[H. Allen Jerkens|my dad]] was bummed about it" but also said that "at least he won't have anybody from the outside banging him in there".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/05/03/trainer-jimmy-jerkens-has-wicked-strong-contention/FcCCQi1j10a5whk7EBW8vN/story.html |title=Trainer Jimmy Jerkens has Wicked Strong in contention |author=John Powers |publisher=Boston Globe |date=May 3, 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref> After stumbling on leaving the [[starting stalls|gate]] Wicked Strong was forced five wide on the first turn and was towards the back of the field for most of the way. He was in tenth place with a quarter mile left to run but made steady progress to finish fourth behind [[California Chrome]], Commanding Curve and Danza.

Wicked Strong's connections opted to bypass the [[Preakness Stakes]] and reappeared in the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 7 when he was one of ten colts attempting to prevent California Chrome from winning the Triple Crown. Starting the 5.3/1 second favorite he raced in mid-division before turning into the straight in sixth. He made steady progress on the wide outside in the closing stages but never looked likely to win, eventually dead-heating with California Chrome for fourth, two lengths behind the winner [[Tonalist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/BEL060714USA11.pdf |title=Belmont Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=June 7, 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref>

On July 26, Wicked Strong started second favorite behind Tonalist in the [[Jim Dandy Stakes]] over nine furlongs at [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Equipped with [[Blinkers (horse tack)|blinkers]] for the first time he raced much closer to the lead than usual, went to the front approaching the final turn and won by two and a quarter lengths from Tonalist. After the race, Jerkens said "I don't think [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] worked any better than this horse does in the morning. I know the talent's there. It's just getting him to put it all together."<ref>{{cite web|last=Shinar |first=Jack |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/86396/wicked-strong-gets-redemption-in-jim-dandy |title=Wicked Strong Gets Redemption in Jim Dandy |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=2014-07-27}}</ref>  In the [[Travers Stakes]] on August 23, he started joint-second-favourite with Tonalist behind the [[Haskell Invitational Stakes]] winner [[Bayern (horse)|Bayern]]. He stalked the pace set by Bayern and took the lead at the one mile pole, but though he again defeated Tonalist, he was nipped at the wire in a photo finish by stablemate V.E. Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/SAR082314USA12.pdf |title=Travers Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=August 23, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref> After becoming the first trainer since [[Nick Zito]] to send out a 1-2 in the race, Jerkens commented "I just feel bad for Wicked Strong; that's the only thing, he ran so hard."<ref>{{cite web|last=Novak |first=Claire |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/86939/travers-upset-v-e-day-over-wicked-strong |title=Travers Upset: V. E. Day Over Wicked Strong |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date=August 23, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>

On September 27 Wicked Strong faced Tonalist, V.E. Day and the leading older horse Moreno in the Jockey Club Gold Cup over ten furlongs at Belmont. He was travelling well just behind the leaders when he was cut off by Moreno approaching the final turn, clipped heels, and unseated his jockey Rajiv Maragh.  Maragh suffered a broken arm in the fall, but the horse appeared to come out of the race without injury; Moreno finished fourth, but was disqualified due to interference and placed last.

===2015: four-year-old season===
Wicked Strong made his 2015 debut in the [[Gulfstream Park Handicap]] in March and finished fourth behind [[Honor Code]]. He finished third behind Effinex in the [[Excelsior Stakes]] at Aqueduct in April, and then finished fifth of the ten runners, again behind Honor Code, in the [[Metropolitan Handicap]] in June. He finished second in the Forbidden Apple Stakes, fourth in the [[Whitney Handicap]], third in the [[Woodward Stakes]], and second in the Jockey Club Gold Cup.

He made the final start of his career in the 2015 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile, running fourth to [[Liam's Map]].

== Retirement and Stud Career ==
Before his start in the 2015 [[Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile]], it was announced that [[Spendthrift Farm]] had acquired Wicked Strong's breeding rights, and that he would retire at the end of the year to assume stallion duties at the farm beginning in 2016.

Wicked Strong was bred to 190 mares in his first book, second only to [[American Pharoah]] among first year stallions. His first foal, a colt out of mare Circle My Name (by Ophidian), was born on New Year's Day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/218978/first-foal-a-colt-for-wicked-strong|title=First Foal a Colt for Wicked Strong|work=BloodHorse.com|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}</ref>

Wicked Strong's 2017 stud fee is set at $10,000.
