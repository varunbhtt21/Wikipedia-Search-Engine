The two ships have been said to offer "... clubby scale, [and a] sense of privacy and exclusivity ...", but with lodgings not as luxurious as those of [[Seabourn Cruise Line|Seabourn]] or [[Silversea Cruises|Silversea]] vessels.  Each is equipped with a [[watersports]] marina that can be lowered for activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]], [[snorkelling]], [[kayaking]], [[windsurfing]], and [[waterskiing]].<ref name="ta 2014-05-03"/>  Both ships are stocked with complimentary equipment for waterborne activities, including wave runners, glass-bottom kayaks, Laser sailboats, a banana boat, water skis, snorkeling gear and standup paddleboards. Also available are mountain bikes for use ashore.<ref name="usat 2014-03-06"/>
