==Narrative==
The first part of ''That Which That Orphan Saw'' starts with dream of [[Abdul-Muttalib]] in which he is ordered to dig the [[Zamzam Well]]. He finds the place to dig near [[Mecca]] which he about heard in his dream. The [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]] are against digging the well and ask Abdul-Muttalib not to do this. Finally they agree to visit a priest and accept his judgement. The priest lives outside of Mecca. Some of the Quraysh head towards the place of the priest along with Abdul-Muttalib. They miss the way and come across a difficult situation so that they let Abdul-Muttalib dig the well. Abdul-Muttalib finds a treasure while digging the well. The Quraysh tribe believe that the treasure belongs to all of them and so they decide to equitably share each part of the treasure. The 8th reprinting was published in May 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iqna.ir/fa/news/1464356 |title=ترجمه عربی جلد دوم "آنک آن یتیم نظر کرده" امسال به پایان می‌رسد |author=|date= |website=iqna.ir |language=Persian|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>

Another notable point in this part of the book is the importance of having sons from the viewpoint of the families; and that Abdul-Muttalib wished to have many sons in order to protect himself from the invasions. When, after years his dream comes true he decides to sacrifice one of his sons based on his covenant with God. His dearest son, [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Abdullah]] is chosen by chance to be sacrificed. When he tries to sacrifice his son they prohibit him and advise him to visit a priestess, as a neutral person, and accept her judgement.

The priestess tells them to choose the sacrifice between Abdullah and certain number of [[camel]]s by chance and increase the number of the camels by ten if Abdullah is chosen firstly. "Repeat this up to the time the camels are chosen", the priestess says. Abdul-Muttalib acts on the recommendation of the priestess and finally kills 300 camels and Abdullah survives.
Abdullah marries a woman and she gives birth to a son. He moves towards [[Syria (region)|Sham]] and becomes sick near [[Medina|Yathrib]] and passes away in Yathrib. Consequently, Mohammad is born without a father.
The promised prophet of the [[apocalypse]] is mentioned in different parts of the book.
