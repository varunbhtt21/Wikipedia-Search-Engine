==Plot==
The season follows the story of [[surgery|surgical]] [[residency (medicine)|residents]], [[fellowship (medicine)|fellows]], and [[attending physician|attendings]] as they experience the difficulties of the competitive careers they have chosen. It is set in the surgical wing of the fictional Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, located in [[Seattle, Washington]]. 

The doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial must get used to the fact that Dr. [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) is now in Switzerland, but they find it difficult to like her new replacement, Dr. [[Maggie Pierce (Grey's Anatomy)|Maggie Pierce]] ([[Kelly McCreary]]). She tries making friends with the doctors, but the one she’s really interested in learning more about is her half-sister, Dr. [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]).  Upon hearing Maggie's news, Meredith doesn’t believe her. Trying to prove her wrong, Meredith pores over her mother’s journals to see if there might have been any evidence of truth. What she finds is that the pieces fit, and that she and Maggie are in fact half-sisters. Not too keen on the fact that she has a sister whom she didn’t know about until now, Dr. [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) uses his love for his big family to draw Meredith and Maggie together.

Dr. [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) and Dr. [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]) talk about having another baby, but Arizona develops an interest in a fetal surgery fellowship. The fellowship is with Dr. Nicole Herman ([[Geena Davis]]), one of the only female fetal surgeons in the world. It’s soon revealed that the reason Dr. Herman wanted Arizona to learn from her is that she has an inoperable tumor. The tumor is growing, and the prognosis is not good. In due time, the tumor would kill her. Trying to learn as much as she can in such little time, Callie and Arizona grow apart. They try to save their marriage by going to marriage counseling, but it doesn’t work and they end up calling it quits. 

Dr. [[Amelia Shepherd]] ([[Caterina Scorsone]]) has moved in with Derek and Meredith, and is quickly learning the ropes at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. She finds out about Dr. Herman’s supposedly inoperable tumor, and she thinks that she can save her. She spends hours trying to learn every single detail of the tumor. Once she thinks she has it figured out and every step of the surgery planned, she gives a lecture. During the lecture, her colleagues question her motives and wonder why her brother, the famous Dr. Derek Shepherd, isn’t coming back from Washington, D.C. to help her. She assures them she knows what she’s doing and that she doesn’t need her brother’s help. Dr. Herman’s tumor quickly advances as she neglects to continue chemotherapy, so Amelia is forced to perform the surgery sooner than she’d like. Now that Dr. Herman’s vision has become impaired, she must act quickly. Amelia is able to save her life, but not her vision. Dr. Herman is rendered blind and must go away to a blind school. 

Dr. [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]) and Dr. [[Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]) enjoy the exciting ride of preparing for their baby’s arrival, but differences in opinions on how to raise their child create tension that proves to be more than they can handle. April wishes to raise their baby in a Christian home, but Jackson isn’t a believer and thinks it’s silly. During one of the ultrasounds, [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], a lethal birth defect, is detected. Of course, the news breaks their hearts, but April wishes to carry the baby to full-term believing that abortion is a sin. Jackson wishes to abort knowing that if they carry to full-term, it will only be that much more devastating when their baby dies. They end up having a boy, named Samuel, who dies moments after birth.

Meredith must deal with the absence of her husband after he begins to work in Washington, D.C. She doesn’t understand why he wants to leave, but she knows that she doesn’t want to be the reason keeping him from doing what his heart desires. Months go by without him there, which allows her to focus more on her work. She’s able to accrue a successful surgery streak, but when she calls to share her success with Derek, a strange woman answers his phone. Not knowing who it is, she begins to worry that he might be cheating on her. Derek shows up at her house, unannounced, to explain. He tells Meredith that he loves her and that he can’t live without her. He says that he’s only going back to Washington, D.C. once more to tell them he’s quitting and moving back to Seattle. However, on his way to the airport, he’s severely injured in a car crash. He’s rushed to a hospital, but they aren’t trauma certified. Derek is eventually declared brain-dead after the neurosurgeon arrives too late. Not able to feel at home without her husband, Meredith takes off leaving only a note that she and her kids are safe. A year passes, and no one has heard from her. It turns out that she was pregnant with her third child, and she didn’t know how to cope with losing her husband and being pregnant. Had it not been for her emergency trip to the hospital to give birth, Dr. [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) would have never known where to find her. He ends up bringing them all back to Seattle, but Meredith is still not able to move on. She asks Alex if she and the kids can move back into her old house, which is where Alex and his girlfriend, Dr. Jo Wilson ([[Camilla Luddington]]) are currently residing. Jo doesn’t like the idea of them all sharing a place, so she buys a fixer-upper for only the two of them. 

Dr. [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) and Dr. Catherine Avery ([[Debbie Allen]]) continue their on-again, off-again relationship. With differing opinions on how to be in a relationship, how to run the hospital, and who should be in charge, the two call off their wedding. However, Meredith intervenes and tells them that they are both lucky to still be alive and to cherish the fact that they can still talk to each other. Dr. Webber and Avery work out their differences and decide to get married after all. With her son as her maid of honor, the two tie the knot in the hospital’s chapel. Their reception is held at Derek and Meredith house, where Meredith says she’s glad this will be her last memory of the place before she moves back into her old house; Derek always wanted his home to be filled with loud, happy people.

Despite signing on for two more years after the tenth season, Patrick Dempsey decided that the eleventh season would be his last.

For the 2014-15 TV season, ABC programmed its entire Thursday [[primetime]] lineup with Shondaland dramas ''Grey's Anatomy'', ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' and ''How To Get Away With Murder'', then branded the night as "Thank God It's Thursday" (or "TGIT").<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abrams|first1=Natalie|title=See how ABC is promoting Shonda Rhimes' Thursday takeover|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/08/21/tgit-greys-scandal-murder-video-abc/|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=28 September 2014|date=21 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006091026/http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/08/21/tgit-greys-scandal-murder-video-abc/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}</ref> This echoes ABC's former [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] branding of its Friday night family sitcoms and even [[NBC]]'s [[Must See TV]] promotion of formidable Thursday night television hits in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland|first=Melanie|title=On TV: Thursday night throwdown|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/On-TV-Thursday-night-throwdown-1215085.php|website=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=September 28, 2014|date=September 20, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085416/http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/tv/article/On-TV-Thursday-night-throwdown-1215085.php|archivedate=October 6, 2014|df=}}</ref>

The remaining fall schedule for ABC was announced on October 30, 2014, where it was announced that ''Grey's Anatomy'' would be split into two batches.

Not even a week after the Season 10 finale episode aired, the ''Grey's Anatomy'' team of writers began collaborating on ideas for Season 11 storylines. [[Shonda Rhimes]] tweeted that they were hard at work in the writing room, but would have the month of June off before coming back in full swing to write actual episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/greys-anatomy/articles/2014-05-23-writers-already-working-season-11|title=Grey's Anatomy Writers Already Working on Season 11|last=Clarendon|first=Dan|date=May 14, 2014|accessdate=May 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527054555/http://www.wetpaint.com/greys-anatomy/articles/2014-05-23-writers-already-working-season-11|archivedate=May 27, 2014|df=}}</ref> After the 4th of July weekend, Rhimes tweeted that the writers' room was once again buzzing, as the team had returned from vacation to start writing new episodes for Season 11.

===Writing===
During an interview, [[Shonda Rhimes]] stated that "Season 11 is really a Meredith-centric season. She lost her ‘person’, her half-sister has shown up, her husband is chafing to go someplace else..." She went on to reveal that she's been wanting to do the "familial grenade" storyline for a long time, and at the end of Season 10, she knew it was the time to do it. Rhimes also claimed that Season 11 will pick up right where Season 10 left us, so there won't be much that the audience won't see.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/07/15/greys-anatomy-season-11-spoilers-theme-time-jump-meredith/|title=Grey's Anatomy Scoop: Shonda Rhimes Teases Season 11 Time Jump, Theme — 'It's a [Spoiler]-Centric Season'|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|last2=Webb Mitovich|first2=Matt|date=June 16, 2014|accessdate=June 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717181640/http://tvline.com/2014/07/15/greys-anatomy-season-11-spoilers-theme-time-jump-meredith/|archivedate=July 17, 2014|df=}}</ref> In another interview, Rhimes revealed that she and the writers were thinking about doing flashback periods to the younger days of Dr. [[Ellis Grey]] and Dr. [[Richard Webber]]. [[Sarah Drew]]'s character Dr. April Kepner became pregnant at the end of the tenth season, which coincided with Drew's real-life pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/greys-anatomy/articles/2014-07-30-sarah-drew-congratulate-baby-news|title=Grey’s Anatomy: Sarah Drew’s Co-Stars Congratulate Her on Her Baby News|last=Pomarico|first=Nicole|date=July 30, 2014|accessdate=July 30, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052324/http://www.wetpaint.com/greys-anatomy/articles/2014-07-30-sarah-drew-congratulate-baby-news|archivedate=August 8, 2014|df=}}</ref>

|ShortSummary    = On his way to the airport, Derek witnesses a car crash, leading him to try and help. He manages to help a girl with an exposed abdomen and a boy who has suffered a massive head trauma. Derek manages to alert help from the smoke of the car explosion. Just as Derek is about to drive away, he is hit by a semi-truck, and is rushed to the ER at the closest hospital. He is unable to speak as the doctors examine him, with him subconsciously telling the doctors to order a head CT. However, Derek is rushed into surgery, but by the time the doctors discover his blown pupil, the neurosurgeon arrives too late and Derek is declared brain-dead. After several hours, Meredith signs the papers to turn off life-support. She confronts one of the doctors, Penny, and advises her to learn from her mistake. Right before the nurse turns off the life-support, Meredith remembers her life with Derek and tells him she will be fine, and Derek takes his final breath.

===Critical response===
The first half of the season opened to critical acclaim with many calling it the best season in the past few years, the second half however, garnered mixed reviews. With Season 11 being the first in ''Grey's Anatomy'' history to be without [[Cristina Yang]], ''[[TV.com]]'' wrote, "So, the question I had heading into ''Grey's Anatomy'''s Season 11 premiere was just how much Cristina's absence would be felt. And at the end, I have to say-while the lack of Yang was definitely noticeable, I think the show will be just fine with out her."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/greys-anatomy/community/post/greys-anatomy-season-11-episode-1-i-must-have-lost-it-on-the-wind-review-141169739574/|title=Grey's Anatomy Season 11 Premiere Review: Sister Act|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419033441/http://www.tv.com/shows/greys-anatomy/community/post/greys-anatomy-season-11-episode-1-i-must-have-lost-it-on-the-wind-review-141169739574/|archivedate=2015-04-19|df=}}</ref>

Perhaps the biggest storyline of Season 11 was the death of Derek Shepherd. After his last episode, ''[[How to Save a Life (Grey's Anatomy)|How to Save a Life]]'' premiered, many fans were outraged with [[Shonda Rhimes]] for how the episode was written and vowed to never watch the show again. Samantha Highfill of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote: "Of all the ways he could’ve gone—dying while saving that family in a shocking but heroic moment, or dying at Grey Sloan and getting a chance to say goodbye to everyone—this felt cheap. And quite frankly, it felt a little rude to the man himself. He was called McDreamy for a reason, and he deserved better than this."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/24/greys-anatomy-did-derek-get-proper-send|title=Grey's Anatomy poll: Did Derek get a proper send-off?|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 24, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082928/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/24/greys-anatomy-did-derek-get-proper-send|archivedate=May 18, 2015|df=}}</ref> Citing the storylines of Derek's death, Callie and Arizona splitting up, and April and Jackson losing their baby, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Season 11 is one of the most depressing seasons of ''Grey's Anatomy''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-11-ways-season-792406|title='Grey's Anatomy': 11 Ways Season 11 Has Been Its Most Depressing Yet|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=May 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082259/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-11-ways-season-792406|archivedate=May 18, 2015|df=}}</ref>

[[File:Ellen Pompeo LF.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Ellen Pompeo]] garnered critical acclaim more so towards the latter half of the season for her portrayal of [[Meredith Grey]].]]

Despite all that, the season garnered positive reviews. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, "It's nice to see Grey's pull back on the throttle on its soap opera tendencies (and I hate using that word as pejorative) and aim for drama that feels a bit more grounded."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/recap/greys-anatomy-season-11-episode-8|title=Grey's Anatomy recap: 'Risk'|author=|date=|website=ew.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127120900/http://www.ew.com/recap/greys-anatomy-season-11-episode-8/|archivedate=27 November 2017|df=}}</ref> ''TV Fanatic'' gave a hugely positive review stating, "The acting remains stellar, the drama is mixed with just the right amount of humor and darn it if I'm not now wrapped up in the future of MerDer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/09/greys-anatomy-season-11-episode-1-review-all-in-the-family/|title=Grey's Anatomy Season 11 Episode 1 Review: It's All Relative|author=|date=25 September 2014|website=tvfanatic.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130015737/https://www.tvfanatic.com/2014/09/greys-anatomy-season-11-episode-1-review-all-in-the-family/|archivedate=30 November 2017|df=}}</ref> ''TV Equals'' stated that, "This season certainly had its strong points, the sad loss of Jackson and April’s son was a tearjerker in all the right ways.

''[[BuddyTV]]'' gave the finale a positive review, "''[[You're My Home (Grey's Anatomy)|You're My Home]]'', proved to be so bright and shiny. This is an episode that nearly could have served as a series finale, though we know that is not the case. Indeed, a few characters notwithstanding, most of our beloved surgeons are in a shockingly good place as season eleven draws to a close." adding, "I was very impressed tonight as Meredith, who can be very selfish but - in fairness - has suffered great personal loss in the death of Derek, stepped up to the plate on behalf of others.  When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to [[Ellen Pompeo]] for her fine work.

[[Ellen Pompeo]] garnered huge praise towards the later half of the season for her portrayal of [[Meredith Grey]]. Rick Porter of ''[[Zap2it]]'' lauded Pompeo's performance in ''[[How to Save a Life (Grey's Anatomy)|How to Save a Life]]'', may not be the ideal [[Emmy Award|Emmy-submission]] episode for [[Ellen Pompeo]], considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it.

She didn't play a prominent part until late in the hour, but she had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes, from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/04/23/greys-anatomy-kills-off-major-character/26243761/|title=Review: 'Grey's Anatomy's' accidental death|author=|date=|website=USAToday|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108014337/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/04/23/greys-anatomy-kills-off-major-character/26243761/|archivedate=8 November 2016|df=}}</ref> Reviewing the episode "[[She's Leaving Home (Grey's Anatomy)|She's Leaving Home]]", Matt Carter commended on the show's "shocking" longevity and that it "is still in a position where it makes sense."
