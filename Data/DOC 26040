The '''Priene Inscription''' is a dedicatory inscription by [[Alexander the Great]] that was discovered at the Temple of [[Athena Polias]], in the city of [[Priene]] in [[Asia Minor]] (modern [[Turkey]]) in the nineteenth century. It now forms an important part of the [[British Museum]]'s [[Ancient Greek]] [[epigraphic]] collection and provides a direct link to one of the most famous persons in ancient history.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/d/dedication_by_alexander.aspx British Museum Highlights]</ref>
This inscription (circa 330 BC) about the dedication of a temple by Alexander to Athena Polias, which has been held at the British Museum in London, should not be confused with the [[Priene calendar inscription]] (circa 9 BC) also found at Priene in Turkey, which is about Augustus Caesar, and about redefining the calendar around the birthdate of Augustus Caesar.<ref>The Priene Inscription: Or Calendar Inscription of Priene, available [masseiana.org/priene.htm online]</ref>

==Discovery==
The inscription was found in the precincts of the temple in 1868-9 by the architect [[Richard Popplewell Pullan|Richard Pullan]], who at the time was leading an archeological exploration of [[Priene]] on behalf of the [[Society of Dilettanti]]. The dedicatory inscription was found at the end of one of the temple's walls, together with records of the Prienean Civic Codes. Pullan brought back inscriptions, sculptures and architectural remains from the site to [[England]], where they were immediately deposited in the national collection.

==Background==
[[Alexander the Great]]'s army crossed the [[Hellespont]] in 334 BC and defeated the Persian army at the [[Battle of the Granicus]]; he then proceeded along the [[Ionia]]n coast, touring cities and expelling Persian garrisons as he did so. At Priene he generously supported the completion of the temple of [[Athena]], which is recorded for posterity on this large marble block.

==Description==
The marble wall block is inscribed on both sides in the [[ancient Greek]] language. Part of the inscription records the gift of funds provided by Alexander to build the temple. Another part refers to a resolution of land disputes between different neighbouring kingdoms following the expulsion of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Alexander+the+Great+Priene British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>
