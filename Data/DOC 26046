No evidence of notability per [[WP:People]] [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 15:05, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - This article could have been [[WP:STICKYPROD]]ed, since it is a BLP with no sources. The articles is written promotionally and is completely unsourced. Appears to be a case of [[WP:TOOSOON]], as her career is only a few years long, involved only in a few local radio shows. Fails [[WP:BIO]].

*'''Delete'''.  No evidence of notability yet. —[[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]] ([[User talk:Psychonaut|talk]]) 16:20, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
