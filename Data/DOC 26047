:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Article is new, long enough and within policy, "dup detector" found no close paraphrasing, citings are inline. Hook (I prefer hook #1 because "began windmill climbing" is misleading. She used to climb windmills before she became a NP guide.) is short enough and interesting. Ref #1 cites the hook fact "the first female guide employed by Mount Rainier NP" more accurately. Pls recheck. QPQ review done.Good to go. --[[User talk:CeeGee|CeeGee]] 16:08, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
