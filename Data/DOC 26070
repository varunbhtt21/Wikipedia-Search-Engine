So I woke up one morning just singing 'Don’t nobody kiss it like you baby,' and I was just singing it all day long. [...] Later that night, I went to the studio and just put it all down, then forgot about it.<ref name = "vibeinterview">{{cite web|last=Fresh|first=Mikey|date=May 8, 2014|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/interview-pop-wansel-writing-and-producing-ushers-good-kisser-single|title=Interview: Pop Wansel On Writing And Producing Usher's 'Good Kisser' Single|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=[[Spin Media]]|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref>}}
Pop later went to a Los Angeles studio to show the song to Mark Pitts, who later gave it to Usher for him to perform. Usher made some lyrical changes to the song, including the change of the word "suck" to "kiss" in order to make the song less "X-rated".<ref name = "vibeinterview"/>

"Good Kisser" is an uptempo "stripped-back soul-funk" [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song that has a "sensuous, sturdy bassline", "salsa drums", a "dusty vinyl pops", '"[[Rich Harrison]]-recalling" "cowbell-heavy percussion", "jazzy keyboards", "handclaps" and Usher's "loose vocal delivery".<ref name = "RollingStone"/><ref name = "LAtimes">{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Mikael|date=May 5, 2014|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-usher-good-kisser-single-20140505,0,3474343.story#axzz30sexNc5P|title=Usher gets lipstick on his leg in new single 'Good Kisser'|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name = "COS">{{cite web|last=Coplan|first=Chris|date=May 5, 2014|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/05/listen-ushers-new-song-good-kisser/|title=Listen: Usher’s new song "Good Kisser"|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name = "Daily Beast">{{cite web|last=Kameir|first=Rawlya|date=May 14, 2014|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/14/why-u-still-love-usher-this-generation-s-most-enduring-pop-star.html|title=Why U Still Love Usher, Baby|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]]|accessdate=May 16, 2014}}</ref> According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Ryan Reed, the lyrics consist of "praising one particular set of lips", "setting the scene with lots of specific imagery".<ref name = "RollingStone"/> ''[[Consequence of Sound]]''{{'}}s "Good Kisser" described the lyrics as a mix between "[19]60s pop innocence and slightly naughtier, early ’90s R&B fare a la Bell Biv DeVoe".<ref name = "COS"/> There are also "awesome innuendos and racy metaphors" in the song as well.<ref name = "Vibe">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-usher-good-kisser|title=New Music: Usher 'Good Kisser'|date=May 5, 2014|work=Vibe|publisher=Spin Media|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}</ref> [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'s Carl Williott suggested the song wasn't about kissing, but rather an ode to [[oral sex]].<ref name = "Idolator">{{cite web|last=Williott|first=Carl|date=May 5, 2014|url=http://www.idolator.com/7517008/usher-good-kisser|title=Usher’s "Good Kisser" Is Not About Kissing: Hear The Ode To Oral Sex|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref> In addition, in the song Usher states that he has "lipstick on his leg".<ref name="4music">{{cite episode|series=This Week's Fresh Music Top 20|network=[[4Music]]|airdate=25 June 2014}}</ref>
