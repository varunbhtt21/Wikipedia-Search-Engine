'''Barbara Shinn-Cunningham''' (born 1964) is Director of the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [https://www.cmu.edu/ni/ Neuroscience Institute]<ref>{{cite web |author=Carnegie Mellon University |title=Barbara Shinn-Cunningham To Lead Carnegie Mellon's New Neuroscience Institute - News - Carnegie Mellon University |url=https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2018/february/neuroscience-institute.html |website=www.cmu.edu |accessdate=31 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and a [[Professor]] of [[Psychology]], [[Electrical and Computer Engineering]], and [[Biomedical Engineering]]. Prior to moving to Carnegie Mellon, where she runs the [https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/shinn/ Laboratory in Multisensory Neuroscience], she was a Professor of [[Biomedical Engineering]] at [[Boston University]] (BU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/bme/people/primary/shinncunningham/ |title=Barbara G.

She worked at [[Bell Communications Research]], [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], and Sensimetrics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sens.com/ |title=Sensimetrics Corporation |publisher=Sens.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> before joining the faculty at BU. She is an auditory neuroscientist best known for her work on [[attention]] and the [[cocktail party problem]], [[sound localization]], and the effects of [[room acoustics]] and [[reverberation]] on [[hearing]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Barbara Shinn-Cunningham |url=http://www.bu.edu/experts/profiles/barbara-g-shinn-cunningham/ |title=Barbara G.

Her lab uses a range of techniques to understand [[neural coding]] and [[perception]], including [[psychoacoustics]], cortical [[electroencephalography]] and [[magnetoencephalography]], brainstem [[frequency following response]]s, and computational modeling. She also collaborates with researchers conducting [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[neurophysiology]]. She is particularly interested in 'hidden hearing loss', the trouble people with otherwise normal hearing have in decoding overlapping conversations.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berdik|first1=Chris|title=Tuning In|url=http://www.bu.edu/research/articles/barbara-shinn-cunningham-hidden-hearing-loss/|accessdate=24 October 2016|work=Boston University Research|publisher=Boston University|date=September 29, 2016}}</ref>
