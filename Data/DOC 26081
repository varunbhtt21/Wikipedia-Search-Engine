'''Thomas "Tom" Goodisson''' (1782–1840) was a four times [[Epsom Derby]] winning British jockey. He was the son of [[Dick Goodisson]], the jockey who won the first three runnings of [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]].{{sfn|Mortimer|Onslow|Willett|1978|p=243}}

Goodisson was only 12 years old when he had his first race ride, on the [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]]-owned Cub at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]].<ref name=Jockeypedia/> At that age, he was an incredibly lightweight jockey. In 1795, he weighed only 4 [[stone (unit)|stone]] 1 [[pound (mass)|pound]] when he won a famous 500 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] [[match race]] between the [[William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry's]] horse, Pecker, and Benington on the Beacon Course at Newmarket.{{sfn|Mortimer|Onslow|Willett|1978|p=243}}<ref name=Jockeypedia/>

On 18 May 1809, Goodisson lined up in the [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] on board [[Pope (horse)|Pope]] against nine other horses. From the start, the [[John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland's]] colt Salvator took the lead and was the frontrunner until [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Tattenham Corner]] when Mr. Wilson's chestnut colt [[Wizard (horse)|Wizard]] took the lead. Wizard held his position until "within a few strides of the winning-post" when Goodisson "made one serve for all" and took the win from Wizard by a neck.<ref name=SM0906/> It was said afterwards that Goodisson "rode his horse with great skill and judgement" and "gave great satisfaction to all present."<ref name=SM0906/> 
 
A few years later, in 1813, he won his first [[Epsom Oaks|Oaks]] riding a [[filly (horse)|filly]] called [[Music (horse)|Music]]. That same year he went on to complete the Derby/Oaks double, winning the Derby on the black [[colt (horse)|colt]], [[Smolensko (horse)|Smolensko]], one of only two black horses to have won the Derby.<ref name=EpsomMediaGuide/> As payment for winning the Derby, the horse's owner, [[Sir Charles Bunbury, 6th Baronet|Sir Charles Bunbury]] gave Goodisson a ten-pound note. He insisted that he would have given the jockey more had his [[bookmaker]], a man called Brograve, cut his own throat rather than paying out his losses.<ref name=Jockeypedia/>

Goodison would go on to repeat the Oaks/Derby double in 1815 for another of his retainers, the [[George Henry FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], on [[Minuet (horse)|Minuet]] and [[Whisker (horse)|Whisker]] respectively. Besides Bunbury and Grafton, his principle patron was the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for whom he won the 1822 Derby on [[Moses (horse)|Moses]].{{sfn|Mortimer|Onslow|Willett|1978|p=243}} He won more big races for the Duke of York than almost any other jockey.<ref name=Jockeypedia/>

After retiring, Goodisson became a [[horse breeder|breeder]] of horses. He died at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in 1840.<ref name=Jockeypedia/>
