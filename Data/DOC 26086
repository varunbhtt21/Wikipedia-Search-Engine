This is a list of songs that have peaked at number-one on the ''[[Radio & Records]]'' singles chart. It was created in 1973, and monitored the most popular singles in terms of popular radio play that were based on and/or compiled from a panel consisting of Top 40/CHR stations in the United States (and Canada during the ''Radio & Records'' years from 1973 to 1994) that served as reporters.

Following the August 4, 2006 issue, ''Radio & Records'' was absorbed by competitor ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' (and relaunched as ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' with the August 11, 2006 issue using the Nielsen BDS charts). After that date, the number-one singles come from [[Mediabase]], which supplied ''Radio & Records'' with its chart data.
