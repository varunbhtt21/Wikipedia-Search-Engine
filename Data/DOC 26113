==Results==
In April 2014, Four Oaks Bank settled with the Department of Justice for engaging in the types of activities that Operation Choke Point is intended to stop. According to the complaint (dated January 8, 2014): "As of today, approximately 97 percent of TPPP-TX's merchants for which Four Oaks Bank permits debits to consumers' accounts are Internet payday lenders. A payday loan typically is a short-term, high interest loan that is not secured (made without collateral) and that has a repayment date coinciding with or close to the borrower's next payday. Most payday loans are for $250 to $700. Annualized interest rates for Internet payday loans frequently range from 400 percent to 1,800 percent or more{{snd}} far in excess of most states' usury laws."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calreinvest.wordpress.com/2014/07/09/why-we-need-operation-choke-point-to-stop-illegal-online-payday-lenders/|title=California Reinvestment Coalition: WHY WE NEED OPERATION CHOKE POINT TO STOP ILLEGAL ONLINE PAYDAY LENDERS|work=California Reinvestment Coalition|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref>

On April 17, 2014, [[Kevin Wack]] of the ''[[American Banker]]'' reported that [[Fifth Third Bank]] and [[Capital One]] had terminated their accounts with payday lenders amid alleged increased scrutiny by federal regulators. Wack notes that "in a recent submission to a congressional committee, the [[Financial Service Centers of America]], a trade group that represents check cashers and payday lenders, listed several banks that it says have terminated their relationships with at least one of its member companies in recent months. Besides Capital One and Fifth Third, banks on the list include Bank of America, PNC Financial Services Group, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp."<ref name="KevinWack">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/179_73/fifth-third-capital-one-cut-off-payday-lenders-1066918-1.html#sthash.9Xg8nf3x.dpuf/|title=Fifth Third, Capital One Cut Off Payday Lenders|first1=Kevin|last1=Wack|date=April 16, 2014|work=[[American Banker]]|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref>

The Financial Service Centers of America (a trade group that represents payday lenders and other consumer businesses) recently commissioned a survey of its members about bank discontinuance. The survey, conducted by [[Deloitte]] Financial Advisory Services, found that "14 of the 61 banking relationships reported by survey participants have been terminated since November 2013."<ref name="KevinWack" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/21/pf/bank-payday-loans/|title=Big banks to stop offering payday-like loans|first1=Blake|last1=Ellis|date=January 21, 2014|work=[[CNNMoney]]|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref>

On March 10, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a civil and criminal settlement with CommerceWest Bank, located in Irvine, California for its role in facilitating a third party processor's millions of dollars worth of unauthorized debits from consumer bank accounts. From the Dept. of Justice press release: "These merchants included a fraudulent telemarketing company and a company that charged hundreds of thousands of victims for a payday loan referral fee they had never authorized.... CommerceWest also received complaints and inquiries from other banks, which expressed their belief that V Internet's transactions were fraudulent.... Even in the face of these explicit warnings from other banks, CommerceWest did not terminate V Internet or file a Suspicious Activity Report, an alert banks are required to file with the government indicating the presence of suspicious illegal activity."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://calreinvest.wordpress.com/2015/03/11/department-of-justice-civil-and-criminal-complaint-against-commerce-west-bank/|title=Department of Justice Civil and Criminal Complaint Against Commerce West Bank|work=California Reinvestment Coalition}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/commercewest-bank-admits-bank-secrecy-act-violation-and-reaches-49-million-settlement-justice|title=Department of Justice press release announcing settlement with CommerceWest Bank|date=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

==Reaction==
"...Various other federal agencies..."{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} also comply with this.  Frank Keating of the American Bankers Association complained that Choke Point "is asking banks to identify customers" who are "simply doing something government officials don't like. Banks then 'choke off' those customers' access to financial services, shutting down their accounts."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304810904579511911684102106|title=Justice Puts Banks in a Choke Hold|date=April 24, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|first1=Frank|last1=Keating}}</ref>

In August 2014, U.S. Representative [[Blaine Luetkemeyer]] introduced a bill that would limit law enforcement's ability to restrict access to the banking system as a response against Operation Choke Point.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Zach |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/27/house-republicans-money-laundering_n_5717877.html |title=House Republicans Are Trying To Make Money Laundering A Lot Easier |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827143130/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/27/house-republicans-money-laundering_n_5717877.html |archivedate=August 27, 2014 |accessdate=August 27, 2014 }}</ref>

On April 8, 2014, the [[House Financial Services Committee]] held a hearing with the general counsels of the federal banking agencies regarding, among other things, Operation Choke Point. Committee members from both parties argued that Operation Choke Point is hurting lawful non-bank financial service providers by pressuring to eliminate access to the banking system and, in turn, the businesses unable to offer services to constituents. The FDIC's [[Richard Osterman]] repeatedly asserted that Operation Choke Point is a Justice Department operation and the FDIC's participation is limited to providing information and guidance upon request. Mr. Osterman also asserted that the FDIC is not attempting to prohibit banks from offering products or services to non-bank financial service providers operating within the law. Similarly, [[Amy Friend]], of the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), stated that the OCC wants to ensure that banks conduct "due diligence and implement appropriate controls," but that the OCC is not prohibiting banks from offering services to lawful businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cfpbmonitor.com/2014/04/21/house-committee-on-financial-services-concerned-with-decreased-consumer-choice/|title=House Committee on Financial Services Concerned with Decreased Consumer Choice|publisher=CFPB Monitor|date=April 21, 2014|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=374904|title=Hearing entitled "Who's in Your Wallet:  Examining How Washington Red Tape Impairs Economic Freedom"|publisher=House Committee on Financial Services|date= April 18, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Critics of the operation accuse it of bypassing due process; the government is pressuring the financial industry to cut off the companies' access to banking services including access to capital, without first having shown that the targeted companies are violating the law.<ref>{{cite news|title='High risk' label from feds puts gun sellers in banks' crosshairs, hurts business|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/18/targeted-gun-sellers-say-high-risk-label-from-feds/?page=all|accessdate=May 22, 2014|first1=Kelly|last1=Riddell|date=May 18, 2014|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/justice-dept-inquiry-takes-aim-at-banks-business-with-payday-lenders/|title=Justice Department Inquiry Takes Aim at Banks' Business With Payday Lenders|last=Silver-Greenberg|first=Jessica|date=January 26, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/16/operation-choke-point-the-battle-over-financial-data-between-the-government-and-banks/|title=Operation Choke Point: The battle over financial data between the government and banks|last=Douglas|first=Danielle|date=April 16, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/sisum11/managing.html|title=Managing Risks in Third-Party Payment Processor Relationships|publisher=[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]|website=Fdic.gov|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cfsaa.com/news/operation-chokepoint/unsealed-government-documents-prove-federal-coverup-in-operation-chokepoint|title=Community Financial Services Association of America: Unsealed Government Documents Prove Federal Coverup in Operation Chokepoint|date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> Critics also say that "it's a thinly veiled ideological attack on industries the Obama administration doesn't like, such as gun sellers and coal producers."<ref name=Raasch-11-14/>

On May 29, 2014, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform published a highly critical staff report that concluded:<ref name=Oversight-may-29-14-p11>{{cite web|last1=Issa|first1=Darrell|title=The Department of Justice's "Operation Choke Point":  Illegally Choking Off Legitimate Businesses?|url=http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Staff-Report-Operation-Choke-Point1.pdf|website=Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=November 26, 2014|format=pdf|date=May 29, 2014|page=11}}</ref>

{{pullquote|Forceful prosecution of those who defraud American consumers is both responsible and  admirable. However, Department of Justice initiatives to combat mass-market consumer fraud  must be legitimate exercises of the Department's legal authorities, and must be executed in a manner that does not unfairly harm legitimate merchants and individuals.

Operation Choke Point fails both these requirements. The Department's radical reinterpretation of what constitutes an actionable violation under § 951 of FIRREA fundamentally distorts Congress' intent in enacting the law, and inappropriately demands that bankers act as the moral arbiters and policemen of the commercial world. In light of the Department's obligation to act within the bounds of the law, and its avowed commitment not to "discourage or inhibit" the lawful conduct of honest merchants, it is necessary to disavow and dismantle Operation Choke Point.}}

On November 21, 2014, [[William Isaac]], the former Chairman of the FDIC from 1981 to 1985, wrote a scathing opinion piece in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' entitled "Don't Like an Industry? Send a Message to Its Bankers: With Operation Choke Point, the Justice Department's targets have included vendors of firearms and fireworks" stating that he believed that the agency acted in bad faith.<ref name=Isaac-11-21>{{cite news|last1=Isaac|first1=William|title=Don't Like an Industry?

None of these claims is true.}}</ref>

On March 24, 2015, a hearing was held before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the [[House Financial Services Committee]]. Subcommittee chair [[Sean P. Duffy]] said at the outset, "I fear that activists at the DOJ and the FDIC are abusing their power and authority and are going after legal businesses and, in effect, they are weaponizing government to meet their ideological beliefs."<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo60185 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Role in Operation Choke Point: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, One Hundred Fourteenth Congress, First Session, March 24, 2015]</ref>

==Federal investigations==
The FDIC and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) have launched investigations into the operation.<ref name=Raasch-11-14>{{cite news|last1=Raasch|first1=Chuck|title=Luetkemeyer says feds to investigate 'Operation Choke Point'|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/luetkemeyer-says-feds-to-investigate-operation-choke-point/article_92390dd9-3d35-5818-8ec1-71ea9f85b5c4.html|accessdate=November 22, 2014|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

The FDIC's inspector general, Fred Gibson, said he would review the conduct of agency personnel to find if the "actions and policies of the FDIC were consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policy," as well as the regulator's mission.<ref name=Zibel-11-14>{{cite news|last1=Zibel|first1=Alan|title=U.S. to Probe Abuse-of-Power Claims in Financial Fraud Crackdown|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-probe-abuse-of-power-claims-in-two-fraud-investigations-1416005227|accessdate=November 22, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>  Gibson said he would investigate allegations that FDIC General Counsel Richard Osterman provided [[false testimony]] to Congress earlier this year when discussing his organization's activities.<ref name=Zibel-11-14/> Osterman was testifying to the House of Representatives member when he rejected assertions that the FDIC wanted to cut off legitimate businesses' use of the financial system.<ref name=Zibel-11-14/>

==Conclusion==
On January 29, 2015, the FDIC issued a Financial Institution Letter that states "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a Financial Institution Letter today encouraging supervised institutions to take a risk-based approach in assessing individual customer relationships, rather than declining to provide banking services to entire categories of customers without regard to the risks presented by an individual customer or the financial institution's ability to manage the risk."<ref name=Zywicki0129/>

On August 17, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice, under the Trump Administration, announced that the Obama Administration's Operation Choke Point would officially end, stating that it was hurting legitimate businesses instead of preventing fraud as intended.<ref name=":0" />
