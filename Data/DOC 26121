'''Roseville Plantation''' is a historic home located near [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], [[Florence County, South Carolina]].  It was built about 1885 and renovated about 1910.  It is a two-story, lateral gabled, weatherboard-clad residence.  The building consists partly of mortise and tenoned hand-hewn and peeled log construction.  It was built on the foundations of the original plantation house built about 1835.  The house at Roseville Plantation is at the end of a tree lined dirt driveway and set at the center of a broad sparsely landscaped lawn, resting upon a brick pier foundation which has recently been enclosed at its perimeter with stuccoed concrete block.  It features a broad, one-story, hip roofed wraparound [[veranda]].<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | author = Anita Curl| title =Roseville Plantation | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = March 1997| url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/florence/S10817721014/S10817721014.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 5 July 2012}}</ref><ref name = scdah>{{Cite web | title =Roseville Plantation, Florence County (3636 Williston Rd.
