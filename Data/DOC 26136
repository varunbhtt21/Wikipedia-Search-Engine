'''Cheshire Calhoun''' is Professor of Philosophy at [[Arizona State University]] and research professor at the Center for the Philosophy of Freedom at the [[University of Arizona]].

Calhoun argues for same-sex marriage—and against the United States' [[Defense of Marriage Act]]—on the basis that equal access to the institution of marriage for homosexual and heterosexual people is the only way to guarantee equal citizenship and societal worth for lesbian and gay people.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Halwani | first1 = Raja. | title = Philosophy of love, sex, and marriage : an introduction | date = 2010 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-415-99351-7 | pages = 297–300}}</ref>
