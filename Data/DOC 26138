'''Joseph Oscar "Joe" Rogers Jr.''' (October 8, 1921 – April 6, 1999), was an American [[lawyer]] from [[Manning, South Carolina|Manning]], [[South Carolina]], who served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] from 1955 to 1966, when he switched allegiance to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Rogers was the first serious Republican [[governor of South Carolina|gubernatorial]] [[Candidate|nominee]] in South Carolina in ninety years, but he was handily defeated in the 1966 [[general election]] by the incumbent Democrat [[Robert E. McNair]].

==Background==

Rogers was born in [[Mullins, South Carolina|Mullins]] in [[Marion County, South Carolina|Marion County]] in eastern South Carolina, the son of the senior Joseph Oscar Rogers and the former Lila McDonald. The family moved to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], where he graduated in 1938 from the former Charleston High School and enrolled thereafter at the [[College of Charleston]]. With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Rogers left college to serve in the [[United States Army]]. A [[staff sergeant]], he was stationed in the 758th Engineer Company, Seventh Army, the [[North African Theater of Operations]], including [[Morocco]], [[Algiers]], and [[Tunisia]], and then in [[European Theater of Operations|southern France]]. After the war, he completed his undergraduate education at [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]] in Charleston and then in 1950 earned his law degree from the [[University of South Carolina School of Law]] in the capital city of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.sc.edu/memory/2000/rogersjo_jr.shtml|title=Joseph Oscar Rogers Jr.|publisher=law.sc.edu|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=rogerspapers/>

Rogers and his wife, the former Kathleen Brown of [[Hemingway, South Carolina|Hemingway]] in [[Williamsburg County, South Carolina|Williamsburg County]] in eastern South Carolina, married in 1949 and had three children, Pamela Rogers Melton, Joseph Oscar Rogers, III, an architect in Columbia, and the Reverend Timothy Julian Rogers. An active member of the [[United Methodist Church]], Rogers served the congregation in Manning as Sunday school teacher, chairman of the administrative board, and lay delegate to the annual conference in 1968.<ref name=bio/>

Rogers was a member of the [[Masonic lodge]], [[Rotary International]], the [[American Legion]], and a director of the Bank of Clarendon in Manning.<ref name=rogerspapers/>

==Political career==

Rogers established with Charlton Durant his law practice in Manning in [[Clarendon County, South Carolina|Clarendon County]], from which he served for six two-year terms in the state House. He was the vice-chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and served as well on the Education and Public Works committees. On three occasions, he was a member of the Conference Committee on the State Budget. Rogers also served as vice chairman of the South Carolina School Committee, often called the Gressette Committee, named for long-term legislator [[Marion Gressette]]. The fifteen-member committee was appointed by the governor to seek legal means to avoid forced racial [[Segregation in the United States|integration]] of public schools. Marion Gressette said in retrospect in 1984 that the "real accomplishment" of the committee was the "prevention of violence such as occurred in some other [[American South|Southern]] states." Rogers was also a member of the Reapportionment Study Committee and the House–Senate [[conference committee]] on reapportionment of the [[South Carolina State Senate]].<ref name=rogerspapers/>

When the state government proposed to move its Alcoholic Rehabilitation Center to the Vocational Rehabilitation Department to qualify for federal funds, Rogers led a floor fight that stopped the transfer. Rogers told ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'' in Columbia that such a move was contrary to ethical principles.<ref>''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'', September 25, 1966</ref>

Rogers did not seek reelection to the state House in 1966. On March 7, he announced that he was joining the Republican Party, and later that month he was chosen in convention as the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] nominee to oppose Governor McNair in the general election. Rogers's [[Political platform|platform]] stressed local control of [[State school|public schools]] and resistance to federal encroachment into the affairs of state government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.sc.edu/scpc/rogers.html|title=Joseph O. Rogers Jr. (1921–1999)|publisher=library.sc.edu|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> Rogers explained his philosophy regarding federal orders to [[Segregation in the United States|desegregate]] public schools:

<blockquote>We oppose them [federal orders] on both grounds that they are an unwarranted and unwise invasion by the federal government of the education[al] function of the state and that they injure education by making education secondary in its own field. ... It is my opinion and conviction that we should move voluntarily in separate columns toward a common goal, I believe that the expression and hopes and dreams of both races are better realized through this voluntarily social agreement.<ref name=rogerspapers/></blockquote>

Rogers also described his political philosophy as "close to Senator [[Strom Thurmond|Thurmond]]'s and has been for many years."<ref name=mcnairpapers/>

Many harsh campaign accusations were hurled between Republicans and Democrats. McNair, a supporter of the national party, had succeeded to the governorship in 1965, upon the death of [[U.S. Senator]] [[Olin D. Johnston]]. At the time, Governor [[Donald S. Russell]] resigned, and McNair moved from [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]] to governor. Under a prior agreement, McNair appointed Russell to fill Johnston's seat until a [[special election]] could be held in 1966. At a press conference Rogers described the unusual circumstances of McNair's rise to the governorship as "arranging a double promotion" in collusion with Russell. According to an article in ''The State'' newspaper, McNair responded by saying that hed "no apologies to anyone" for appointing Russell to the U.S. Senate. He advised Rogers and the GOP state chairman "to take a lesson in constitutional government."<ref name=mcnairpapers>{{cite web|url=http://library.sc.edu/scpc/exhibits/mcnair/McNair.pdf|title=Robert E. McNair Papers|publisher=library.sc.edu|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

In the gubernatorial contest, Rogers polled 184,088 votes, compared to 255,854 for McNair.<ref name=mcnairpapers/> In addition to the gubernatorial race, voters filled both of the U.S. Senate seats, the two remaining years of Johnston's term and a full six-year term for former Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond, who was elected for the first time in 1966 as a Republican. Former Governor [[Ernest Hollings]] unseated Donald Russell in the 1966 Democratic primary and then narrowly won the former Johnston seat over the Republican [[South Carolina State Senate|State Senator]] [[Marshall Parker]], a former Democrat from [[Seneca, South Carolina|Seneca]], who had been an intrparty opponent of McNair in 1962 in the race for lieutenant governor.<ref name=mcnairpapers/>

Rogers was a delegate to the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], [[Florida]], which nominated the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]-[[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] ticket. Thereafter, he was the successful Nixon campaign manager in South Carolina in the race against [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]], who was backed by Governor McNair.<ref name=rogerspapers/><ref>In the 1972 campaign, the Nixon-Agnew ticket was managed in South Carolina by [[James M. Henderson]], an advertising executive from [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], who had been the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor on [[Albert Watson (South Carolina)|Albert Watson]]'s 1970 ticket.</ref>

From August 11, 1969, to December 18, 1970, Rogers served under appointment of [[U.S. President]] Richard Nixon as the [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the District of South Carolina]]. His nomination was supported by most of the newspapers in South Carolina but actively opposed by the [[NAACP]], Soon Senator Thurmond recommended to President Nixon that Rogers be appointed to a federal judgeship, but the nomination stalled, and an angry Rogers resigned as U.S. attorney and withdrew from further consideration for the judgeship. He blamed the inaction on the Nixon administration that he and Thurmond had helped to bring to power. Thereafter, Rogers resumed his legal practice in Manning<ref name=rogerspapers>{{cite web|url=http://library.sc.edu/scpc/Rogers.pdf|title=Joseph O. Rogers Jr. Papers|publisher=library.sc.edu|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> until his retirement in 1990. On numerous occasions into the 1990s, he was a Special Circuit Court Judge. A member of the Clarendon County Development Board, Rogers was named "Economic Ambassador" for Clarendon County in 1993.<ref name=rogerspapers/>

Rogers died at the age of seventy-seven. His papers from 1942 until his death in 1999 are in the South Carolina Political Collections of the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name=rogerspapers/> The Joseph O. Rogers Jr. Scholarship at the University of South Carolina School of Law bears his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.sc.edu/awards_day/2014/rogers_recommendation.php|title=Joseph O. Rogers Jr. Scholarship|publisher=law.sc.edu|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

Rogers was awarded the [[Order of the Palmetto]] by later Republican Governors [[James B. Edwards]] and [[David Beasley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess113_1999-2000/bills/3917.htm|title=A Concurrent Resolution of Sympathy to Family of Representative Joseph Rogers Jr.|publisher=scstatehouse.gov|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>
