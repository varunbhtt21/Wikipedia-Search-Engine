The '''Allied Quality Assurance Publications (AQAP)''' are standards for quality assurance systems that have been developed by [[NATO]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/stanags/current/4107eed08a8.pdf |title=Stanag 4107 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.difesa.it/SGD-DNA/STAFF/DT/NAVARM/Pagine/AQAP.aspx  |title=Link to current AQAP publications |accessdate=2015-06-02}}</ref>

The aim of the AQAP agreement is to define standards for Quality Assurance of defence products. These standards are an integral part of contracts awarded in the military field involving NATO member countries. AQAP documents are therefore important to contractors and companies wanting to bid for such contracts.

The AQAP system is described in [[STANAG]] 4107 issued by the [[NATO Standardization Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nso.nato.int/nso/ |title=Nato Standardization Office homepage |accessdate=2015-06-02}}</ref> There are currently two main types of AQAP documents; Contractual Type which are written as a Technical Specification intended for contractual use; and Guidance Type which provide general guidance.
