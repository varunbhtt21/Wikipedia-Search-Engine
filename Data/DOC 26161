Title : 1976 Falkland Islands general election
Text : {{Politics of the Falkland Islands}}
The '''Falkland Islands general election of 1976''' was held in 1976 to elect members to the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]]. Four out of the ten Councillors were elected through [[universal suffrage]], two from [[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley]] and one each from [[East Falkland (constituency)|East Falkland]] and [[West Falkland (constituency)|West Falkland]]. The election was delayed twice, first in November 1975 when the dissolution of the Legislative Council was postponed by ten weeks to 31 January 1976<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1975 |title=The Falkland Islands (Legislative Council) (Amendment) Order 1975 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1975/1706/pdfs/uksi_19751706_en.pdf |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}</ref> and then again in January 1976 when it was postponed to 28 February 1976.<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1976 |title=The Falkland Islands (Legislative Council) (Amendment) Order 1976 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1976/52/pdfs/uksi_19760052_en.pdf |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}</ref> This was done in the hope that the election would be held under the proposed [[constitution of the Falkland Islands|new constitution]] and to allow the [[Falkland Islanders]] opportunity to study the report of the Select Committee before the election took place. In reality, the new constitution did not come into force until the following year, with the first election under the new constitution taking place in [[1977 Falkland Islands general election|October 1977]], just 15 months after the last election.
