The '''Central Warwickshire Youth Football League''' or also known as ''Central Warwickshire League'' (abbreviated to ''C.W.Y.F.L''), are a minor / youth League who are affiliated members of the [[Birmingham County Football Association]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Birmingham County F.A League Contacts|url=http://www.birminghamfa.com/leagues/league-contacts|publisher=Birmingham County F.A}}</ref>
The Central Warwickshire League hosts a number of football clubs from Under 7's to Under 18's who are formed within the County of Warwickshire. The league is also recognized under the Warwickshire County Football Affiliation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Warwickshire F.A minor leagues|url=http://warwickshirefa.com/leagues/minorleagues/|publisher=Warwickshire FA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504175014/http://warwickshirefa.com/leagues/minorleagues/|archivedate=2014-05-04|df=}}</ref>

== History ==

The Central Warwickshire League was founded back in 1969 by the Founder Members: Ken Brownhill, Wally Hedgley and Paul Hyde. With the league originally consisting of nine football clubs: Claverdon, Balsall Hornets, Hockley Heath, Earlswood, Widney Athletic, Barston, Bearley United,Chadwick End and Rowington.<ref name="detail">{{cite web|title=CWYFL league details|url=https://www.ourkidssports.com/Leagues/profile/id/51|publisher=ourkidsport.com|accessdate=2010}}</ref>

The Central Warwickshire set-up over the years has become more efficient which is a complete contrast to the early days when the meeting room, peopled by local football managers, was a symbol of parochial worthiness, and a centre for exchange of opinions, reactionary and otherwise, towards the formation of a Boy's league.<ref name="CWYFLhist">{{cite web|title=CWYFL 1974/75 Hand Book|url=http://www.cwyfl.org.uk/1_47_History.html|publisher=CWYFL|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

The Senior representative record was indeed enviable as they only lost one game in the season, and that set-back was in the 1969-70 season.  It was Ken Brownhill who refused to be swayed from his selection of players, and thereby providing followers of the league with an era of big match, workmanlike soccer produced with collective zeal and determination and numerous glimpses of individual talent of a high order.

Divisional cup competitions were introduced as well as Supplementary Medals competitions to ensure interest throughout seasons and the annual 'Solihull News' Cup Final, which was played at Damson Lane, Elmdon, (through the generosity of [[Birmingham City F.C.]]) always attracts big crowds.

The introduction of better teams into the 'Friendly' Warwickshire league forced officials was to become more efficient.  Affiliation with the [[Birmingham County Football Association]] and the enlistment of Mr. Rich Jones in 1971 to join the original league committee of Ken Brownhill, Wally Hedgley and Paul Hyde meant that with the aforementioned individual acting as custodian of the hitherto experimental Nursery League, a much closer unison between members became more evident as rules were formed and enforced.<ref name="CWYFLhist" />

Efficiency became a priority as the league became stronger. Resentment simmered below the surface when rural teams struggled to match the skills of more 'polished' outsiders.  But the newcomers provided the spur to urge the 'Sunday get-together teams' into an eventual motivated opposition.

Widney Athletic and Bearley United were recruited to the ranks and standards improved. Shirley Saturn were another powerful side, but the meteoric rise of Astwood Bank and Elmdon Colts in recent years was not predictable.  The conjunction of men and players with undeniable talent was far from fortuitous.  The precedents established by these teams challenged complacency and by stimulating envy, encouraged a revision of attitudes elsewhere.  Hence the general improvement of standards throughout the C.W.Y.& B.L. <small>(Central Warwickshire Youth and Boys League)</small> as clubs sought to beat the 'unbeatables'.<ref name="CWYFLhist" />

Mr.Colin Moscrop became a member of the committee in 1974 who was in charge of the referees for Nursery and Minor matches, with his experience this paved the way for his new post as ''Match and Referees Secretary'' for all three sections this campaign.
The 1974-75 Season.<ref name=season1974>{{cite web|title=CWYFL 1974/75 season archive|url=http://www.cwyfl.org.uk/1_54_1974-1975.html|publisher=CWYFL}}</ref> saw the introduction of the Minor League with the League growing to 31 teams.<ref name="season1974" /> Mr. Brian Holtom made an excellent secretary of this division and the clubs concerned co-operated one hundred per-cent to provide a smoothly run and incident free season. Woodbank boys proved worthy champions & set a very high standard.<ref name="CWYFLhist" /><ref name="season1974" /> The league also had an Under 16s representative side who managed to get victories against the Stratford-upon-Avon League and Notts Elizabethen League whilst drawing 4-4 against the Birmingham Boys League.<ref name=season1974 />

1978 saw the start of the "Gordon Beard era<ref>{{cite web|title=Gordon Beard History|url=http://cwyfl.org.uk/1_71_Gordon-Beard.html|publisher=CWYfL|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>" and the famous Olton Ravens, Gordon went on to join the league committee in 1983 as a league secretary. As league secretary, Gordon immediately set about the expansion of the league. In his first season there were 83 teams that formed the Central Warwickshire League. By the 1988-89 season there were 183 teams, an increase of 100teams within 10 years, a figure Gordon was proud and eager to boast about.
Within Olton Ravens, Gordon was known affectionately to all as "The Gaffer". He was an inspiration to many. A man of compassion. Where his lads were concerned, he disciplined the unruly. he protected and gave strength to the weak and comforted the lonely. He had a strict code of ethics within the club but had a heart of gold. Many former Ravens will tell you of the annual trips to the [[Isle of Wight]] that they looked forward to and trips to [[Wales]] and [[Jersey]], all paid for by Gordon. He ensured his Olton Ravens were ambassadors of junior football wherever they went.
Sadly Gordon died in 1988 but left behind him a club that now graces the Central Warwickshire League. A respected club with enormous tradition. A club where its players are proud to wear the gold and black stripes.

2007 saw Wally Hedgley take up the President role within the league. The league saw the first Under 18's division formed in the 2008-09 season with Kings Norton winning the Premier Division.<ref>{{cite web|title=CWYFL0809|url=http://cwyfl.org.uk/1_62_2008-2009.html|publisher=CWYFL}}</ref> One year later saw the introduction of the Presidents Cup for the Under 18's, again Kings Norton dominating the age group by winning both the League and Cup competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=CWYFL0910|url=http://cwyfl.org.uk/1_63_2009-2010.html|publisher=CWYFL}}</ref>

By the 2009-10 season the Central Warwickshire Youth League had approximately 167 [[football clubs]] with over 600 [[team]]s which were made up of small sided teams and 11-a-side.<ref name="detail" />
