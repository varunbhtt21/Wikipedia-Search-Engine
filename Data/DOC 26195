'''SS ''Djemnah''''' was a French [[cargo-passenger ship]], launched in 1875, that was sunk in the Mediterranean by the German submarine [[SM UB-105|''UB-105'']] during the [[World War I|First World War]].

== The ship ==
The ''Djemnah'' was built in [[La Ciotat]] in 1875 for the shipping company [[Messageries Maritimes]].

Displacing 5,400 tonnes, the ship was 125 metres long, with a beam of 12.1 metres. Her top speed was 14 knots. The ship could carry 1385 passengers (83 in First Class, 42 in Second, 60 in Third and 1,200 below decks).
The ship was used as a line ship to the Far East and to the Southern Indian Ocean.

On 6 July 1918, the ship left from [[Marseilles]] for [[Madagascar]], with a crew of 153, 601 passengers and 530 tons of cargo. On 14 July the ship was 69 nautical miles north from the Libyan coast when she was torpedoed at 21.32 by the German submarine [[SM UB-105|''UB-105'']] under command of [[Wilhelm Marschall]]. The ship sank in two minutes, taking with her 436 people, including the captain. 110 survivors were picked up by the trawler ''Presidency'' and 218 by the British escort [[HMS Mallow (1915)|HMS ''Mallow'']].
