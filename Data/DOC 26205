The '''Dârjiu fortified church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica fortificată din Dârjiu}}; {{lang-hu|Székelyderzsi erődtemplom}}) is a [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian]] [[fortified church]] in [[Dârjiu]] (''Székelyderzs''), [[Harghita County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]]. It was built by the [[Székelys|Székely]] [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] community at a time when the area belonged to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Initially [[Roman Catholic]], it became Unitarian following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The church is noted for its interior frescoes, and together with the surrounding village, forms part of the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

==Description==

===Church and fortifications===
First built in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 14th&ndash;15th centuries,<ref name="ghinea">Dan Ghinea, ''Enciclopedia geografică a României'', p.516. Editura Enciclopedică, Bucharest, 2000. {{ISBN|978-97345-014-8-9}}</ref> the church was transformed into a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] one in the latter part of the 15th century. The semi-cylindrical [[Rib vault|rib-vault]]ed arches, which reach into the [[nave]] and the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], date to the first half of the 16th century. The vaults are supported by [[corbel]]s that in the choir have carved decorations: a pelican with chicks, the sun, the moon, masks and a symmetrical [[plowshare]]. The [[buttress]]es date to the same period and are linked by a corbel and little arches that support the [[battlement]].<ref name="com">{{ro icon}} [http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/darjiu___dersch/31/ Dârjiu/Dersch] at biserici-fortificate.com</ref> The church is 28 metres long, 7 metres wide and 20 metres high; the slate roof is from 1760.<ref name="jn"/>

The fortifications, erected in 1400,<ref name="ghinea"/> reached their final form around 1530. The 5 m high walls form a square; their [[bastion]]s are at an oblique angle and jut out from the walls at all four corners. A similar bastion is found in the middle of the western wall.<ref name="com"/> The fortifications' oldest and most visible element, the tower, is to the south of the church. The [[gate tower]] retains its original form, with openings for firing guns that can be closed with wooden shutters. Modifications in 1788 included the creation of storage spaces for the villagers.<ref name="jn"/>

===Frescoes and recognition===

The church's interior features a partly destroyed but valuable series of mural paintings.<ref name="com"/> These Gothic, [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian Renaissance]]-influenced works were executed in 1419 by Paul of [[Ung County|Ung]]; the most detailed is a ''[[Conversion of Paul the Apostle]]'' that includes the artist's portrait. There and in ''The Pursuit of the [[Cumans|Cuman]]'', part of a [[Saint Ladislaus legend]] group, Paul managed to integrate the subject into the composition's other elements.<ref>[[Ion Ţurcanu]], ''Istoria românilor: Cu o privire mai largă asupra culture'', p.155-56. Editura Istros, Brăila, 2007, {{ISBN|973-18-7102-0}}</ref> Other subjects he painted were the ''[[Ten thousand martyrs|Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand]]'' and several saint-bishops.<ref name="dragut"/> Beneath his portrait, in [[Gothic minuscule]], he wrote a love declaration in Latin: "This work did master Paul, son of Stephen of Ung, paint and prepare, AD 1419; he wrote this inscription while keeping in mind a beautiful girl".<ref name="jn">{{ro icon}} [http://jurnalul.ro/vechiul-site/old-site/arhiva-jurnalul/arhiva-jurnalul/atemporalul-satului-sasesc-la-saschiz-si-darjiu-284878.html "Atemporalul satului săsesc la Saschiz și Dârjiu"], ''Jurnalul Național'', January 18, 2007</ref><ref name="dragut"/> The damage to the frescoes occurred when the arches were built and later, in the 17th century, when a [[pulpit]] was installed.<ref name="dragut">[[Vasile Drăguț]], ''Arta gotică în România'', p.228-30. Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 1979</ref>

In 1999, Dârjiu, together with five other places, was added to the already-listed [[Biertan]] to form the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165 "World Heritage Committee Inscribes 48 New Sites on Heritage List"] at the UNESCO site</ref> Additionally, the church is listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by Romania's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], with the fortifications being listed as a separate entry.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_HR.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Harghita]</ref>
