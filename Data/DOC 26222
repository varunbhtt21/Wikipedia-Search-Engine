:* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] This article is new enough and long enough. The hook fact has an inline citation to 3 sources, all of them in Turkish. I checked them to the extent that they were about Yalçın Granit and viewed certain passages with Google translate but did not manage to actually find the hook fact so I accept it in good faith. I made no attempt to look for close paraphrasing issues. [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 12:46, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::: @[[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] Thanks so much for your efforts and approval as well. For clarification, I list below some Google translations relating to the hook fact even they are hard to understand or incorrect English. --[[User talk:CeeGee|CeeGee]] 14:37, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
