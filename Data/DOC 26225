'''Michael Fitzpatrick''' (born 1950) is a British [[general practitioner]] (GP) and medical author from [[London, UK]]. Fitzpatrick is known for writing several books and newspaper articles about [[controversies in autism]], from his perspective as someone who is both a GP and the parent of a son with autism. His book ''Defeating Autism: A Dangerous Delusion'' (2008) describes his views on the rising popularity of "biomedical" treatments for autism, as well as the [[MMR vaccine controversy]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grinker|first=R.

Michael Fitzpatrick.|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=7 September 2009|volume=38|issue=5|pages=1415–1417|doi=10.1093/ije/dyp242}}</ref> 

Fitzpatrick's books have also focused on the [[pseudoscientific]] treatments for autism, such as [[Mark Geier]]'s use of [[chelation therapy]] and [[Lupron]] as autism treatments, which Fitzpatrick has criticized as "dehumanising and dangerous."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/12/medicalresearch-autism|title=Toxic treatments for autistic children|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=3 May 2014|author=Fitzpatrick, Michael}}</ref> He also condemned the use of [[secretin]] as an autism treatment in his 2004 book ''MMR and Autism: What Parents Need to Know'', in which he wrote that "the secretin bubble burst" when a [[randomized controlled trial]] found that it was ineffective. In an interview with ''The Guardian'', he proposed that special diets are appealing to parents of children with autism because so little is known about the cause or possible treatments for autism, "And then someone else comes along and says your doctor's useless, that they know what caused it, and that you can do something about it".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/06/what-happened-man-mmr-panic|title=Andrew Wakefield: autism inc|work=The Guardian|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=3 May 2014|last=Hannaford|first=Alex}}</ref>

Fitzpatrick has criticized ''[[Neurotribes]]'' for generalizing autistic people, noting that most low-functioning autistics need supervised living and experience challenging behavior.<ref name="Neurotribes">{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Michael|title=Why we should be cautious about celebrating autism|url=https://www.spiked-online.com/2015/10/02/why-we-should-be-cautious-about-celebrating-autism/|website=spiked|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=September 25, 2015}}</ref>  He also was skeptical that Naoki Higashida, a nonverbal autistic individual, wrote the book "The Reason I Jump" because of the "scant explanation" of the process Higashida's mother used for helping him write using the character grid and expressed concern that the book "reinforces more myths than it challenges".<ref name="spiked">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/autistic_children_are_not_the_spiritual_saviours_of_mankind/13950|title=No, autistic children are not the spiritual saviours of mankind|first=Michael|last=Fitzpatrick|date=23 August 2013|work=Spiked online|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}</ref>
