This is content that was forked from [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]], and also substantially recreates articles that were deleted, like [[Kharkov People's Republic]].

*'''Strong Keep''' -  these things keep popping up. They might not indivivually be notable, but it is notably that secessionist states keep being proclaimed. --[[User:Bellerophon5685|Bellerophon5685]] ([[User talk:Bellerophon5685|talk]]) 17:06, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::Yes, it is. That's why we've written all about it in [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]]. Hence why this is merely a fork! [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 17:10, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete/Merge''' per WP:Fork [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 20:23, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge.''' [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] currently lacks a list of states that have declared independence. This list ought to be moved into the main article so that it can be easily accessed by those who may be interested in it. --[[User:William Case Morris|William Case Morris]] ([[User talk:William Case Morris|talk]]) 20:36, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Merge.''' I think it's a good idea if this article is merged. -Arbutus the tree  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Arbutus the tree|contribs]]) 22:11, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*I wouldn't be opposed to such a merger, however, some rewriting would have to be done. [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 23:20, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

Okay, but what sorta editing would need to be done? --[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 23:57, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

::Copyediting, and the alignment of reference names and citations templates with those in the main article. [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 00:03, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - Helpful list, maybe merge in the future when the declarations have settled down?

::The declarations have 'settled down'. The Kharkiv one failed after a few hours, and the Odessa one was a hoax. Donetsk is the only one that has any clout, though Luhansk also has a nominal existence.

*'''Keep or Merge''' - This list is somewhat reliable, and it tells people which states are currently and not currently independent. Recently, there have been protests in Odessa and the police headquarters are under attack, maybe if they get in there a people's republic could be declared, but they just released the pirsoners inside so things are calming down.--[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 14:37, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' and Merge. This information should be portrayed in one way or another, but it should definitely not have its own article. Seems to me someone has an agenda out to destroy Ukraine. <span style="display:inline-block;padding:0 .5em;line-height:1.25em;border:1px solid #CAD4E7; font-family:'Lucida Grande'; -moz-border-radius: 3px; -webkit-border-radius: 3px; border-radius: 3px; background:#ECEEF5;">[[User talk:DDima|§]] [[User:DDima|DDima]]</span> 17:27, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''', I have changed my mind. Maybe it's best if this article is moved with 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine so people who want to read it can just scroll down and look at the  page.—[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 17:54, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::{{Ping|Arbutus the tree}} Since you are the author of the article, would you consent to an early closing as 'Merge'? I'd be happy to help with the merger.

*Yes, I would like to consent to an early closing as Merge. Thanks for offering your help with the merge.--[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 18:27, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*I've merged the content to [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]], and cleaned it up. Don't be afraid to speak up if you are opposed. I've withdraw my deletion request.
