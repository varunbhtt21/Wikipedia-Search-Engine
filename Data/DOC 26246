==Response==
According to ''Boxing Insider'', "Seriously, the guy had one fight – just one fight – to his name when he got a crack at the WBO Featherweight title. It was unheard of. It was beyond unheard of. In fact, it was literally a first." thus the attempt still being a record of its own.<ref name="Ins"/>

Many boxing magazines mentioned that the referee allowed Salido to deliver an inordinate number of low blows. Salido was also criticized for failing to make weight and some sources stipulated that he did so intentionally, as well as coming back much heavier than Lomachenko on the fight night.

"He was fighting a full welterweight, getting hit in the balls all night, in only his second pro bout, and he still almost came back to win." - Machine Levine, Punch Lines Podcast

Lomachenko is being regarded as one of the best amateur fighters of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/10525683/vasyl-lomachenko-closes-world-title-just-second-pro-fight|title=Vasyl Lomachenko closes in on world title in just second pro fight |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>

== Referee Laurence Cole ==
The referee of the fight, Laurence Cole, was roundly criticized by many boxing media-outlets for his perceived failure to properly conduct the match:

*''[[ESPN]]'' wrote, "Cole warned him only once and did not seem too concerned" regarding low blows.<ref name="ESPN"/>
*In an interview with ''The Ring Magazine'', Laurence admitted that his performance in the fight "might not have been his 'A-game." and they noted "Cole came under fire for appearing to allow Salido to land an inordinate amount of low blows."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/323283-laurence-cole |title=Referee Laurence Cole discusses Orlando Salido-Vasyl Lomachenko - Ring TV |publisher=Ringtv.craveonline.com |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>
*''Boxing Insider'' wrote, "Of course Salido didn't exactly win the fight fair and square. The guy was about as dirty as they come on Saturday. He hit low and hit low consistently. Referee Laurence Cole didn't seem to notice, or to much care, so Salido whacked Lomachenko below the beltline throughout the entire bout..."<ref name="Ins">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxinginsider.com/columns/vasyl-lomachenko-star-isnt-born/ |title=Vasyl Lomachenko: A Star Isn't Born |publisher=BoxingInsider.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>
*''Boxing.com'' wrote, "Few referees have turned in a performance as bad as that which Laurence Cole blessed us with Saturday night in, inevitably, San Antonio, Texas" and "astonishingly bad performance" in its article. They have claimed that the referee Laurence Cole failed to enforce rules on clinching, pushing and blows below the belt. The site has also mentioned: "not only should this ridiculous excuse for a referee be sacked forthwith but the role of his father plays in allegedly consistently obtaining for him some of the biggest fights in Texas in his role with the Texan commission needs to be investigated."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/laurence_cole_is_an_idiot.html |title=Laurence Cole Is an Idiot |publisher=Boxing.com |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>
*''[[Yahoo! Sports]]'' wrote that the fight was "poorly officiated by referee Laurence Cole, who missed numerous fouls and seemed to let anything go."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/boxing/vasyl-lomachenko-lack-professional-experience-showed-remains-blue-033314295--box.html |title=What Vasyl Lomachenko's letdown Saturday means for his future |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |date=March 2, 2014}}</ref>
*''Bad Left Hook'' wrote, "Maligned Texas referee Laurence Cole's performance was roundly and rightly criticized for missing a metric ton of Salido's low blows, which landed on the thighs and hips mainly. And that mattered."<ref name="Left">{{cite web|url=http://www.badlefthook.com/2014/3/2/5463492/learning-curve-vasyl-lomachenko-proves-quality-in-first-pro-loss |title=Learning Curve: Vasyl Lomachenko proves quality in first pro loss |publisher=Bad Left Hook |date= |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>
*''The Sweet Science'' wrote, "Holding and hitting, hitting on the break, low blows galore... Salido was aided by ref Laurence Cole who left his glasses at home."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles-frontpage/18096-sneaky-vet-salido-wins-sd-over-lomachenko-in-texas |title=Sneaky Vet Salido Wins SD Over Lomachenko in Texas |publisher=Thesweetscience.com |date=2014-03-01 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}</ref>

This was the latest in many controversies surrounding Cole, whose father Dickie Cole is the long time boxing commissioner of Texas.

== Weight issues ==

Salido, 33, of Mexico, failed to make weight and was stripped of his belt at the weigh-in. He was 128¼ pounds, well over the 126-pound limit.<ref name="ESPN"/> And he weighed 11 pounds more than Lomachenko at the start of the contest.<ref name="Left" />

''Boxing Insider'', "Salido showed up heavy for the fight. Really heavy. One hundred forty-seven pounds heavy."<ref name="Ins"/>

''Bad Left Hook'': "A few things worked against him [Lomachenko]. Orlando Salido not making the fight's weight limit of 126 pounds and then rehydrating up to 147, compared to Lomachenko's 136."<ref name="Left" />
