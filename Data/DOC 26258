Title : 1977 Falkland Islands general election
Text : {{Politics of the Falkland Islands}}
The '''Falkland Islands general election of 1977''' was held on Thursday 6 October 1977 to elect members to the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]]. Six Councillors were elected through [[universal suffrage]], one from each constituency.

The election took place just over a year after [[1976 Falkland Islands general election|the last]] so that the changes to the Legislative Council under the [[constitution of the Falkland Islands|new constitution]] could be implemented. The new constitution, which came into force under ''Falkland Islands (Legislative Council) (Amendment) Order 1977'',<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1977 |title=The Falkland Islands (Legislative Council) (Amendment) Order 1977 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1977/423/contents/made |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}</ref> abolished the remaining appointed members Councillors and increased the number of elected Councillors to six. The constitution also created three new constituencies ([[Camp (constituency)|Camp]], [[East Stanley (constituency)|East Stanley]] and [[West Stanley (constituency)|West Stanley]]) to add to the existing three ([[Stanley (constituency)|Stanley]], [[East Falkland (constituency)|East Falkland]], [[West Falkland (constituency)|West Falkland]]).
