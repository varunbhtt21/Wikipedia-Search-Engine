'''''The Righteous & the Butterfly''''' is the seventh studio album by [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Mushroomhead]]. It was released on May 13, 2014. It is the band's first studio album since 2003's [[XIII (Mushroomhead album)|XIII]] to feature [[Jason Popson|Jason "J Mann" Popson]] on vocals, and the last to feature [[Jeffrey Hatrix]] and [[Waylon Reavis]] on vocals and [[Tom Schmitz]] on keyboards. It is also their first album without [[Jack Kilcoyne]] on bass since the [[Mushroomhead (album)|self-titled album]], and [[Dave Felton]] on guitar since [[M3 (album)|M3]], as well as the first album to feature Ryan Farrell on bass and Robbie Godsey on percussion, the only to feature Tommy Church on guitar.

[[Jeffrey Hatrix|Jeffrey "Nothing" Hatrix]] said about the members' departure: "We also parted ways with a couple of members who didn't share in the founding members’ vision of what Mushroomhead was always meant to be. Pig and Gravy both saw our future in a far different way".<ref name="MRH-int 2014"> [http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/mushroomhead Interview with Jeffrey Nothing], by Grande-Rock.com retrieved on August 31, 2014.</ref>

The album title is a dedication to original guitarist [[John Sekula|John "JJ Righteous" Sekula]] and drummer [[Steve Felton|Steve "Skinny" Felton]]'s former wife Vanessa Solowiow, both of whom had died in 2010 and 2013 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ketler|first1=Geoff|title=Cleveland Rocks!: Geoff Ketler's Exclusive Interview With Steve "Skinny" Felton Of MUSHROOMHEAD|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=11181|website=KNAK.COM|accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref>

==Album information==
In September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page. It was said by Mushroomhead frontman Jeffrey Nothing that former [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and current Painface vocalist Anders Colsefni is in the works to do a recording together in their upcoming studio sessions. The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album.

The album is the first and only to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Felton described it as "very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it's going to go. For the old school fans there's a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nataliezworld.com/2013/04/mushroomheads-skinny-talks-nothing-but.html |title=Mushroomhead's Skinny Talks Nothing But the New, New, New! |publisher=Nataliez World |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>  The album was revealed to come out around early 2014.
