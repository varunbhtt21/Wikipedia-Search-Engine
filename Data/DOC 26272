Title : Pop Plinn
Text : '''''Pop-Plinn''''' is a traditional air of a [[Breton dance]] transformed into [[pop music]] by [[Alan Stivell]]. The "Dañs Plinn" is a fast and physical dance where the dancer makes two small jumps by holding the arm of his neighbors.

Alan Stivell dreamed for a long time about a footbridge between these two worlds, the [[folk rock]] [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] music and the [[Music of Brittany|Breton]]-[[Celtic music]]. Thus he gives rise to the [[Celtic rock]].<ref>{{fr}} various, ''Bretagne est musique : Le point sur 50 ans de renouveau'', Institut culturel de Bretagne, 2006, p. 66</ref>

The release of the single in late 1971 and early 1972 causes an electroshock. For the first time, the world discovers the electric guitar playing the [[Music of Brittany|Breton traditional music]] arranged in a pop way and the Breton auditor becomes aware that its music can be modern and appreciated by the others. This composition is programmed in radio and even used for a jingle of a broadcast of ''[[Europe 1]]'' radio.<ref>{{fr}} Bourdelas  L., ''Alan Stivell'', 2012, p. 88</ref>

The record contrasts with the almost simultaneous release of his instrumental album in the classic Celtic accents, the ''[[Renaissance of the Celtic Harp]]''. By reaching a broad audience, after the passage of the artist in the mythical Parisian [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] [[music hall]] on February 28, 1972, ''Pop Plinn'' upsets preconceived ideas, with an important distribution in France.<ref>{{fr}} Brekilien  Yann, ''Alan Stivell ou le folk celtique'', 1973, p. 46</ref> The talent of guitarists [[Dan ar Braz]] expresses himself in his solos, playing the music theme, but the music reminder also the folk music using traditional instruments ([[celtic harp|harp]], [[Bombard (music)|bombard]], percussion).<ref>{{fr}} A. Stivell, J. Erwan and M. Legras, ''Racines interdites'', p. 124</ref>
