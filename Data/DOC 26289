Welcome to the May 2014 edition of the ''Bugle''!

As always, this issue's [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/News/May 2014/Articles|article news section]] includes a wrap-up of new Featured and A-Class content; while no pictures and relatively few articles were promoted to Featured status last month, eight articles achieved A-Class.  In our regular [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/News/May 2014/Book reviews|book review section]], Nick-D looks at a "collective biography" of the first Australian soldiers to die at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] on [[Anzac Day|25 April 1915]].

This month also sees a welcome return of our [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/News/May 2014/Op-ed|op-ed section]], featuring [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]'s thoughts on developing and maintaining Featured Articles involving [[Yugoslavia]] in World War II.  Don't forget that the ''Bugle''{{'}}s editors are always on the look out for op-eds to run in future editions, so anyone with something to be published is warmly encouraged to post their submission at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Coordinators/Newsroom|the Newsroom]], or to contact Ian or Nick.

Lastly, we've recently farewelled [[User:Cdtew|Cdtew]], who has had to retire from Wikipedia and a MilHist coordinator role owing to work commitments. We thank him for his contributions to the smooth running of the project, and for his excellent work on American Revolutionary War articles, which included several FAs.

Your editors, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) and [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]])
