Welcome to the June 2014 edition of the ''Bugle''!

Following discussions kicked off by [[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]] in October 2013, the coordinators last month agreed a series of awards to represent the next step beyond our long-standing [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Awards/ACM|A-Class Medal]] set. This is the '''A-Class Cross''', and you can read about it at the MilHist awards page [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Awards/ACC|here]]. The recent discussion that led to codifying the design and qualifications for the award can be found [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Coordinators#A Class Cross (ACC)|here]]. Thanks to all who took part in those discussions, and in particular to [[User:Noclador|Noclador]], who produced the award designs.

As if to highlight the relevance of considering the next stage in MilHist awards, all of the A-Class Medals awarded last month went to our current trio of recipients of the ACM with Diamonds, the highest A-Class Medal level and therefore the last before moving into contention for the new A-Class Cross.

Continuing the awards theme, we congratulate [[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] on receiving his second [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Military_history/Awards#WikiChevrons_with_Oak_Leaves|''WikiChevrons with Oak Leaves'']].

Twenty-two examples of MilHist-related content reached A-Class or Featured status last month, and you can find them in our regular [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/News/June 2014/Articles|article news section]].  In our [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/News/June 2014/Book reviews|book review section]], [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] looks at an account of life aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77)|USS ''George H.W. Bush'']] and [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] reviews a book on the role food played in World War II.

Don't forget that the ''Bugle''{{'}}s editors are always on the look out for op-eds and book reviews to run in future editions, so anyone with something to be published is warmly encouraged to post their submission at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Coordinators/Newsroom|the Newsroom]], or to contact Ian or Nick.

Your editors, [[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]] ([[User talk:Ian Rose|talk]]) and [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]])
