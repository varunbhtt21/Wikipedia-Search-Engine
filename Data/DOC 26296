; [[Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians]] ([[User:Dudley Miles|Dudley Miles]]) : As the ruler of Mercia, Æthelred was an ally of [[Alfred the Great]] in the war against the Vikings at the end of the ninth century. Nominator Dudley Miles took the article through GAN, ACR and FAC in quick succession from March to May.
; [[Audie Murphy]] ([[User:Maile66|Maile]]) : Murphy is probably the best-known American soldier of World War II, and was awarded every U.S. military award for valor available from the U.S. Army, including the [[Medal of Honor]]. Having passed through PR, GAN and ACR, this has become Maile's first successful FA-Class nomination, and is the cornerstone of a series of articles on Murphy that he hopes to take to Featured Topic status.
; [[Empress Matilda]] ([[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]]) : In his nomination statement, Hchc2009 described Matilda as "one of the few female war-time leaders of the medieval period" and noted that she was characterised as being "of the stock of tyrants". The article underwent GAN and ACR before achieving Featured status.
;[[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF]] ([[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]]) : This article traces the surprisingly convoluted history of the Royal Australian Air Force's main pilot training unit for most of the period between 1921 and 1993. Ian developed the article to GA in 2011, and was able to expand the article to A/FA-standard after finding some key references in [[National Archives of Australia]] files.
;[[Oliver Bosbyshell]] ([[User:Wehwalt|Wehwalt]]} : Bosbyshell was Superintendent of the [[United States Mint]] at Philadelphia from 1889 to 1894. He was also a soldier and claimed to have been the first man in the [[Union Army]] to be wounded by enemy action in the American Civil War.
;[[Russian battleship Poltava (1894)]] ([[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel]] and [[User:Buggie111|Buggie]]) : ''Poltava'' had an unconventional career. She was captured by Japan in 1905 and sold back to Russia in 1916. The next year her crew sided with the [[Bolshevik]]s, but the battleship was captured by British forces in 1918. She was recaptured by the Bolsheviks in 1920 but saw no further service. Buggie111 had initially developed the article to GA status, and Sturmvogel took the lead developing it to A/FA-Class.
; [[SMS Emden (1908)]] ([[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]]) : ''Emden'' was a German [[light cruiser]] that enjoyed a spectacularly successful, but short, career as a raider in the Indian Ocean during World War I. Parsecboy took the article through GAN and ACR before nominating for FAC, with the aim -- now realised -- of attaining Featured status in time for the 100th anniversary of the ship's destruction at the hands of {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} during the [[Battle of Cocos]] on 9 November 1914.
;[[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] ([[User:Gwillhickers|Gwillhickers]]) : This article on a Polish national hero who also fought in the American Revolutionary War has very much been a collaborative effort over time. Between its GAN early last year and its recent successful FAC, both nominated by Gwillickers, it went through ACR and a first, unsuccessful, FAC nomination under the guiding hand of Piotrus.

;[[Axis order of battle for the invasion of Yugoslavia]] ([[User:Peacemaker67|Peacemaker67]]) : This article lists all the major Axis units involved in the April 1941 [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]]. Peacemaker developed it to FL status after the [[Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia]] was promoted to a FL in November 2013.

{{WPMILHIST Newsletter section header 2|New A-Class articles}}
[[File:Two Avro Ansons (L9162 and N4876) "piggyback" in a paddock near Brocklesby 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The two aircraft involved in the [[1940 Brocklesby mid-air collision]] after landing safely, having collided in mid-air and locked together]]

; [[1940 Brocklesby mid-air collision]] ([[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]]) : Continuing Ian's interest in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], this article covers what's probably the most unusual accident to befall any of the service's aircraft. All four of the airmen involved survived the accident, though sadly not all survived the war.
; [[Andrea Doria-class battleship]] ([[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] and [[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]]) : This collaboration between two of the most prolific A-Class article writers describes the characteristics and careers of a class of two Italian [[dreadnought]] battleships. The ships entered service during World War I, saw a small amount of combat in World War II and soldiered on in the Italian Navy until 1953.
; [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles]] ([[User:EnigmaMcmxc|EnigmaMcmxc]]) : This article describes the controversial "War Guilt Clause" of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Intended mainly as a legal basis to compel Germany to pay reparations, the clause was resented by the German public. EnigmaMcmxc submitted the article for an A-Class Review following an unsuccessful Featured Article nomination.
; [[Death on the Rock]] ([[User:HJ Mitchell|HJ Mitchell]]) : Another article on a controversial topic, this article covers a documentary on the [[Operation Flavius]] killing of IRA personnel in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988. The documentary was criticised by the British Government and tabloid media, and may have contributed to its broadcaster losing its franchise and the abolition of the British Government agency which declined a request from the Government to postpone its screening.
; [[George Kistiakowsky]] ([[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]]) : "Inventor of the edible explosive" (in Hawkeye's words in the nomination statement), Kistiakowsky was a Harvard physical chemistry professor who participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] and later served as President Eisenhower's Science Advisor. He developed the explosive during World War II "in response to a special request for an explosive that could be smuggled through Japanese checkpoints by Chinese guerrillas".
; [[Hans Philipp]] ([[User:MisterBee1966|MisterBee]]) : Another ''Luftwaffe'' ace in MisterBee's long-running series of quality articles, Philipp was credited with destroying 206 enemy aircraft, mainly Soviet, before he was shot down over Western Europe and killed when his parachute failed to open.
; [[HMS Indefatigable (R10)]] ([[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]]) : This addition to Sturmvogel's series of articles on British capital ships focuses on one of two [[Implacable-class aircraft carrier|''Implacable''-class aircraft carriers]] modified to carry more aircraft at the expense of reduced armour. Only completed in 1944, ''Indefatigable'' and her aircraft took part in several attacks on the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] before being transferred to the Pacific, where they served out the war.
; [[House of Lancaster]] ([[User:Norfolkbigfish|Norfolkbigfish]]) : The House of Lancaster produced three English kings: [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. As noted in the article's lead, "to historians' chagrin their propaganda, and that of their [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] successors, means that it is Shakespeare's{{mdash}}dramatized, imperfect, part fictional{{mdash}}history plays rather medievalist scholarly research that has the greater influence on modern perceptions of the dynasty". This is nominator Norfolkbigfish's first A-Class article, and we congratulate him!
; [[List of cruisers of Germany]] ([[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]]) : This is the top-level article for what nominator Parsecboy aims to make the largest Good Topic on Wikipedia, with 121 articles. It represents the fulfillment of 5 years of work beginning with [[SMS Fürst Bismarck (1897)|SMS ''Fürst Bismarck'']] in 2009.
; [[Mahan-class destroyer]] ([[User:Pendright|Pendright]]) : The ''Mahan''-class comprised 18 US Navy destroyers commissioned in 1936–37, all of which saw action in World War II. Congratulations to nominator Pendright on this, his first A-Class article!
; [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF]] ([[User:Ian Rose|Ian Rose]]) : Another of Ian's articles on Royal Australian Air Force units, this focuses on the RAAF's "Fighting First", active for most of the 98 years since its formation during World War I. In his nomination statement, Ian acknowledged contributions over the previous year or so by editors AustralianRupert, Nigel Ish and Nick-D, as well as GA reviewer Sturmvogel 66.
; [[SMS Scharnhorst]] ([[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]]) : Continuing his series on German cruisers, Parsecboy hopes to see this article appearing on Wikipedia's Main Page on a major centenary—her loss at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] on 8 December 1914. Having created it back in 2009, Parsecboy recently expanded the article with new sources prior to nominating it at ACR.
