'''George Henry Howard Paul''' (18 November 1830 – 9 December 1905)  (known on stage as '''Howard Paul''') was an American writer, playwright, comic actor and [[actor-manager|theatrical manager]] who made his name and spent most of his career in the United Kingdom. In 1854 he married the British singer and actress [[Mrs Howard Paul|Isabella Hill]], and the two appeared together in Britain and the United States as Mr and Mrs Howard Paul for more than two decades, in comic pieces written by Paul.  The couple separated around 1877, after he began an affair with the actress [[Letty Lind]]. After that affair ended, Paul continued to write through the 1880s and acted as a theatre manager in Britain.

In 1858 the couple also appeared in Paul's ''Patchwork'', described as "a clatter of fun, frolic, song, and impersonation."<ref name=DNB>Knight, John Joseph.

==Letty Lind and later years==
A protégée was the actress and dancer [[Letty Lind]] who toured with the Pauls from about the age of ten.<ref name=Buchanan>[http://www.robertbuchanan.co.uk/html/lind.html Information from the Buchanan site]</ref>  The Pauls billed her as "La Petite Letitia".  Howard Paul became Lind's lover and fathered two illegitimate children by her: a girl who died in infancy (1878) and a son (Henry Horace Howard Paul Rudge (1880–1969), a tobacco merchant). Mrs Paul left her husband about 1877, in view of the affair, but continued to perform under the name Mrs Howard Paul; she died in 1879.<ref>Cruickshank, Graeme. "The Life and Loves of Letty Lind" in ''The Gaiety'', Issue 22, Summer 2007 p. 5</ref> In 1881, Lind left Paul's company.  It is not clear exactly when their relationship ended, but Paul married Florence Kate Arthur (1867–1941) in London in 1889.<ref>Cruickshank, p. 9</ref> On the required documentation he described himself as "a widower".<ref name=Banns/><ref>[http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/2056/32515_1831109387_0075-00194/97794?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.co.uk%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fdb%3dSurreyMarriage%26h%3d97794%26ti%3d5538%26indiv%3dtry%26gss%3dpt%26ssrc%3dpt_t7639870_p-1060825493_kpidz0q3d-1060825493z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&ssrc=pt_t7639870_p-1060825493_kpidz0q3d-1060825493z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&backlabel=ReturnRecord London and Surrey, England, Marriage Bonds and Allegations, 1597&ndash;1921 for Henry Howard Paul (1889) [[Ancestry.com]] &ndash; pay to view]</ref>

In his later years Paul rarely appeared in public, acting by now as a theatre manager in Britain and returning to journalism and writing. Besides the works mentioned above, he also wrote the books ''The Young Chemist or Pastimes for Youth'' (London, 1851);  ''The Book of American Songs, with Notes, Biographical and Critical'' (1857);  ''Patchwork Embroidered with Art, Whim, and Fancy'' (1859); ''Howard Paul's Funny Stories'' (1882); ''Clever Things said by Children'' (1886), and ''Funny Stories that will make You Laugh out Loud'' (1888).<ref name=Encyc/>
