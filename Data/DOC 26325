'''Florence Downtown Historic District''' is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] located at [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], [[Florence County, South Carolina]].  The district encompasses 24 contributing buildings in the [[central business district]] of Florence.  The district's buildings were built between about 1890 and 1940. Most buildings are two-story brick buildings with embellished cornices. Many are characterized by flat rooflines, decorative brick moldings, and vertical pilasters. While all the properties have been modified to include modern storefronts, the upper facades are largely intact and retain their integrity.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web |author =Kendra Cobbs| title = Florence Downtown Historic District | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = May 2008| url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/florence/S10817721023/S10817721023.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 20 October 2012}}</ref><ref name = scdah>{{Cite web | title = Florence Downtown Historic District, Florence County| work = National Register Properties in South Carolina | publisher = South Carolina Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/florence/S10817721023/index.htm | accessdate = 20 October 2012}} and [http://www.palmettohistory.org/hpdistricts/florence-downtownHD.htm accompanying map]</ref>
