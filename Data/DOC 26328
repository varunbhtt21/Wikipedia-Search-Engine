*'''Support''', as co-nominator. I did the formatting and setup, and {{u|Wadewitz}} helped out greatly with filling out the portal with appropriate selections -- not to mention contributing lots of great quality content. I wish she could see it today. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 17:16, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

;Review by Sven Manguard
I appreciate that this is dedicated to a deceased Wikipedian, but I am still going to do a proper review:

* Selected biographies:
** Why are there only 12? Is that all the FA/GA class ones we have? 
** Some of them are significantly longer than others. I'm not saying that they all have to be the same size down to the line, but we shouldn't have a few that are half the size of all the others. 
* Selected articles:
** See point two in selected biographies, above. 
* Selected pictures:
** If you're going to have selected pictures on the large side column, you should be able to free up additional size for horizontally aligned images without having to worry about it going out of the box. Please make the horizontally aligned images larger.
** Image 21 has nothing to do with children's literature, nor does it link to anything related to children's literature. Image 17 has been put up for deletion on Commons. Please replace 17 and either replace or scrap 21. 
** See the selected pictures section of [[Portal:Literature]], there may be some additional Featured Pictures class images there you can use. Alternatively, [[:File:The Velveteen Rabbit pg 1.jpg]] is nice looking even at small sizes. 
* Delink all of the dates (month and year) in [[Portal:Children's literature/Selected anniversaries]] please.
*Selected quote: 
** I would remove the images from the Selected quote section, as they cause messy formatting issues. Look at the Three Blind Mice and The Tyger entries, for example.
** Why is the author bolded, rather than the work? In [[Portal:Literature]], I used a different formatting that left neither bold, which I feel may be ideal, and also linked to the Wikisource of the work, rather than all to their literature page. 

This will be passable eventually, but still needs work. [[User:Sven Manguard|<font color="207004">'''<big>S</big>ven&nbsp;<big>M</big>anguard'''</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Sven Manguard|<small><font color="F0A804">'''Wha?'''</font></small>]] 14:27, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:Okay, thank you, {{u|Sven Manguard}}, I shall get on addressing above. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 00:21, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::{{u|Sven Manguard}}, to my pleasant surprise it looks like a lot of the above has already been helpfully addressed by {{u|Lotje}} before I could even get to it myself! :) Perhaps you could have another look? &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:24, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
