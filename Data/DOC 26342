== Early years ==
Barry Waldrep (Son of James & Barbara Waldrep) grew up in Randolph County Alabama.  James was a professional auto mechanic, and a part-time bluegrass musician.  Barbara worked in the manufacturing industry.  The family vacations were most every weekend as they performed on the southeastern bluegrass festival circuit.

Barry graduated from Randolph County High School - Wedowee, Alabama in 1982.  After a short term at Jacksonville State University, he moved to Auburn, Alabama to start classes at Auburn University, but started a band instead.  With several day jobs in the middle of all the club shows, he decided to make music a full-time job in 1988.  His first stint at being a full-time musician started with a 3-month house gig at a beach club in Panama City Beach, Florida.  Barry Was used to performing on the bluegrass festival circuit with his fathers band where people attended events to hear the music.  The club owner in Panama City, wanted a band to make people dance and drink, so the summer gig only lasted a week.  Determined to succeed, Waldrep hit all the clubs and landed another gig.  The band quickly revamped the set list, and made it through the summer.

The next 5 years were filled with road side honky tonks & college bar gigs with various bands until 1993 when he started Rollin' In The Hay.
