These are items from 10-14 years ago: 2000, 2001, 2003. Did they develop that HIV vaccine they got the $19 million for? Are they noted for that? What vaccines are they noted for?  There is nothing here that makes this company notable as a developer of vaccines. These news articles are all based on the company's press releases and the grand jury probe of theft at the company. They moved to Pennsylvania. they severed ties with another company. That's not real [[WP:Notability]]. [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 21:29, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

Hi, I created the page, and am new to Wikipedia. Im just learning the process, and found this discussion just now (I had mistakenly thought conversation should occur on user talk pages and the article talk page). If you regard the [[Companies in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index]], you will see many companies in simliar situation. It seems some are tagged for notability, some arent. But I think this tag for deletion is unique to the Novavax article (unless others have been created and deleted). Its possible to consider that a determination on this company's page would have implications to the other pages. Thanks for the discussion, I didnt know people were looking at this. Regards.[[User:January2009|January2009]] ([[User talk:January2009|talk]]) 22:01, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:Hi January. Unfortunately, I think you'll find that the argument that this page may be being treated differently than other pages doesn't carry a lot of weight in deletion discussions. What matters, more than anything, is whether this particular company is notable pursuant to Wikipedia guidelines for notability (see [[WP:CORP]] and [[WP:GNG]]). —/[[User:Mendaliv|'''M'''<small>endaliv</small>]]/<sup><small>[[User talk:Mendaliv|2¢]]</small></sup>/<sub><small>[[Special:Contributions/Mendaliv|Δ's]]</small></sub>/ 18:33, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::You keep missing the point which is that this company is not notable for vaccine development. All the article could say at this point, using the sources you've shown, is that it had issues with theft, it severed ties from another company, and it hasn't been in the news since 2003. There's nothing notable there to justify a Wikipedia article. The one thing it should be notable for, vaccines, it isn't notable for. This could explain the reason the sources are 10-14 years old.

:::I'm not addressing your "point" because it's not a valid argument. From [[WP:CORP]]:<blockquote>An organization is generally considered notable if it has been the subject of significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources.<br />[...]<br />"Notability" is not synonymous with "fame" or "importance." No matter how "important" editors may personally believe an organization to be, it should not have a stand-alone article in Wikipedia unless reliable sources independent of the organization have discussed it.<br />[...]<br />However, smaller organizations and their products can be notable, just as individuals can be notable. Arbitrary standards should not be used to create a bias favoring larger organizations or their products.</blockquote>Further down, in [[WP:LISTED]]:<blockquote>[S]ufficient independent sources almost always exist for [listed] companies, so that notability can be established using the primary criterion discussed above. Examples of such sources include independent press coverage, analyst reports, and profiles by companies such as Hoover's (a commercial source). Accordingly, article authors should make sure to seek out such coverage and add references to such articles to properly establish notability.</blockquote>The criterion you propose here—namely that a corporation need have "importance" in connection with its primary products—is not only novel, it goes against how [[WP:N]] has been applied for a very long time. Furthermore, given your claim that no significant coverage existed at the beginning of this discussion and refusal to discuss your attempt to search for such coverage in any detail, followed by my providing evidence of significant coverage, suggests that you are likely also incorrect about there being no significant coverage of its products either. —/[[User:Mendaliv|'''M'''<small>endaliv</small>]]/<sup><small>[[User talk:Mendaliv|2¢]]</small></sup>/<sub><small>[[Special:Contributions/Mendaliv|Δ's]]</small></sub>/ 19:46, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::By the way, there's a Hoover's in-depth profile on Novavax. Given [[WP:LISTED]] explicitly endorses Hoover's profiles as an example of a source that can be used to satisfy the primary criterion. Here's the non-paywalled version: http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.Novavax_Inc.22005264f77eb563.html. The full version is ''much'' longer.

I think the additions of citations to recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine regarding the company's pandemic flu vaccine should be enough to settle the notability issue.  NEJM is the worlds foremost medical journal and publication in it speaks volumes.  Additionally, Novavax was just discussed in Wired magazine regarding the MERS outbreak, for which a citation was also added.[[User:XerxesImmortal|XerxesImmortal]] ([[User talk:XerxesImmortal|talk]]) 18:07, 7 May 2014 (UTC) <small>— [[User:XerxesImmortal|XerxesImmortal]] ([[User talk:XerxesImmortal|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/XerxesImmortal|contribs]]) has made [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|few or no other edits]] outside this topic. </small>

Between NEJM and Journal of Virology (Spanish Flu Vaccine)articles it is hard to argue non-notability. Both are reliable sources and both found company notable.

*'''Weak keep''' - the Hoovers source seems okay and the bits and pieces listed above probably tip it over the edge.

*'''Another Note to closing admin :)''' There doesn't seem a real consensus to keep or delete. Please relist the AfD when it expires here. The sources being used here are being represented as if they are scientific, peer-reviewed studies of Novavax research, which they are not. Rather, they are simply public relations releases in multiple publications, some of which are very old. Even The New England Journal of Medicine source is not a research article but simply a letter to the editor from Novavax. There really isn't anything here that shows the company is [[WP:notable|notable]]. As you can see, there are two SPA's here, as well. One hasn't edited anything but Novavax.

::They have Wired magazine and Hoovers, for the business side. But those sources can't support any scientific claims as they are not scientific peer-reviewed journals. If the company claimed it had just invented an HIV/AIDS vaccine, I would go to the literature for verification, and not Wired mag or Wall Street Journal. Also, there's still the question of notability. The problem is, this company claims to be working on these vaccines, but no scientific peer reviewed results are out there. It currently is relying on primary articles and Novavax's website, which we don't use per [[WP:RS]] in general, and [[WP:MEDRS]] specifically. If we keep it, it needs a rewrite with those primary sources eliminated, including the Novavax website, etc. It will be a stub, which is fine. Lots of articles are stubs. But I still don't see the [[WP:notability|notability]]. This is like a company claiming to make fabulous toasters, but the toasters aren't on sale anywhere. I would easily change to keep if someone would show me where they've actually come up with a vaccine, and had those vaccines approved by the FDA and the research scrutinized in a scientific peer-reviewed journal article.
