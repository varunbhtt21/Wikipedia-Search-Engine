Title : Wikipedia:Meetup/Wikipedia APA/2014
Text : [[File:Wikimedia DC Asian Pacific American 2014 editathon 11.JPG|thumb|On 10 May 2014, Wikimedia DC held the Asian Pacific American 2014 edit-o-thon to increase the awareness of articles about Asian Americans.]]
'''The [[Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center]] was proud to host the first "Wikipedia APA," an editathon for cultural presence, in May 2014.''' Main public announcement [http://smithsonianapa.org/project/wiki here].

For the September 2015 second year's series, see [[Wikipedia:Meetup/Wikipedia APA]].

We’re thrilled to invite you to Wikipedia APA, an editing event for improving and increasing the presence of cultural, historic, and artistic information on Wikipedia pertaining to Asian Pacific American (APA) experiences. The first Wikipedia editathon dedicated to APA content, this project will occur as physical events on '''May 10, 2014''' in New York City, Washington DC, and Los Angeles, as well as by proxy, with participants taking part from all throughout the world.

While there is a respectable amount of information currently in the encyclopedia for commonly-known APA topics such as the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], the [[Japanese American Internment]], and the [[Model minority|Model Minority Myth]], less information exists online about communities and experiences that have been historically marginalized.  As presence on resources like Wikipedia becomes not only a tool for learning, but also a signal of cultural significance, the time is right for us to advocate for a more complete APA narrative.

With the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center’s recent opening of the exhibition ''Beyond Bollywood: Indian Americans Shape the Nation'', we are underlining a commitment to exploring stories that have traditionally been left untold&mdash;particularly around Americans whose identities include South Asian, Southeast Asian, Pacific Islander, multi-heritage, women, and LGBTQ. Incidentally, these vital APA narratives are dispersed and incomplete on Wikipedia.

Let’s change that.
