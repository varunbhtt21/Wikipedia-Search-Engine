'''Tegsbron''' is a bridge in [[Umeå]] that took the major European routes [[European route E4|E4]] and [[European route E12|E12]] over the [[Ume River]] until 2012.

The construction of Tegsbron started in 1945 and it was opened on 10 October 1949 becoming Umeå's second bridge over the Ume river.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kommunkansliet|1975|pp=2–3}}</ref><ref name="Sjöström92">{{Harvnb|Sjöström|1989|p=92}}</ref>

Later it was decided to build a new bridge named [[Kyrkbron, Umeå|Kyrkbron]]. This bridge was designed to relieve the traffic on the Tegsbron bridge. Kyrkbron was designed because it was predicted there would be a drastic increase in car traffic in Umea, however this proved to be very optimistic.<ref name="cerum">{{cite web |url=http://www.cerum.umu.se/digitalAssets/18/18312_1965-ume-universitet-invigs.pdf |title=1966 Trafikplan och generalplan |accessdate=12 January 2014| format=[[PDF]] |publisher=Centrum för regionalvetenskap, Umeå universitet}}</ref>

This bridge took the major European routes [[European route E4|E4]] and [[European route E12|E12]] over the [[Ume River]] until 2012. The E4 is the road that links north and south Sweden, whilst the E12 links Norway to Finland.
