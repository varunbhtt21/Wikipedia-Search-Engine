{{Ukrainian crisis}}
'''Media portrayals of the [[Ukrainian crisis]]''', including [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|2014 unrest]] and the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] following the [[Euromaidan]] movement, differed widely between [[Ukrainian media|Ukrainian]], western and [[Russian media]].<ref name=MT140311/> The Russian, the Ukrainian, and the Western media were all, to various degrees, accused of [[propaganda|propagandizing]], and of waging an [[information war]] during their coverage of the events.<ref name=NYT140417/><ref name=Dougherty/><ref name=BlackJohns/><ref name=GN140411/><ref name=GN140804/><ref name=BoydBarrett/><ref name=Sakwa/> Russian channels were repeatedly criticized for the use of misleading images, false narratives, misrepresentation, suppression,<ref name=BBC150422/> and fabricated news stories, such as a child's [[crucifixion]] and the death of a 10-year-old in shelling.<ref name=AFP140714/><ref name=BBC150408/> The [[BBC]] reported that Russian state television "appears to employ techniques of psychological conditioning designed to excite extreme emotions of aggression and hatred in the viewer",<ref name=BBC150204/> which, according to [[The Guardian]], is part of a coordinated "informational-psychological war operation".<ref name=Guardian20150409/><ref>{{cite web|author=Octavian Manea|title=Vasily Gatov: Deconstructing the Russian Infowar and mindset|url=http://www.stopfake.org/en/vasily-gatov-deconstructing-the-russian-infowar-and-mindset/|publisher=StopFake.org|date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref>

A regular theme in the Russian media was that the Ukrainian army, which has many Russian-speaking members, was committing "genocide" against Russian-speakers and that they strongly desired Russia to "protect" them against Kiev.<ref name=FT141009/><ref name=NYB140307/><ref name=Reut141114/> This presentation contradicted a poll showing that less than 20% of eastern residents wanted Russia's protection.<ref name=EL150222/> They supported Russia's denials of involvement in the Crimean crisis, until [[Vladimir Putin]] boasted about the key role of Russian soldiers, and continue denying its involvement in the [[war in Donbass]], despite evidence that Russia regularly shelled across the border.<ref name=Time150320/><ref name=AP161221/>

==Media in Russia==
The [[Russian media]] consistently portrayed the crisis in Ukraine as having been instigated by the post-Yanukovych Ukrainian government,<ref name="MT140311" /><ref name="Forbes140917" /><ref name="NPRaccuse" /> and represented [[Euromaidan]] as being controlled by "ultranationalist", "fascist",<ref name="Time140929" /><ref name="GNAY140317" /><ref name=NYB140320/> "[[neo-Nazi]]", and "[[anti-Semitic]]" groups,<ref name="Atlantic140326" /> with [[Right Sector]] a common theme.<ref name=CEPA201608/> The revolution was depicted as a violent "[[coup d'etat]]"<ref name=CEPA201608/> fomented by the West in order to overthrow an [[Second Azarov Government|elected government]].<ref name="MT140311" /><ref name="AP140315" /><ref name="FT140303" /> Police brutality against Euromaidan supporters was omitted.<ref name="Mash150429" /> Portrayals by the Russia state media were generally close to those by the Russian government; they presented western countries, particularly the United States, as orchestrating events in Ukraine in order to harm Russia.<ref name="Memo98-2015" /><ref name="CEPI150515" /> Accusations of Russophobia were common in response to criticism of Russian actions.<ref name=OSW56/> The [[Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement]] was depicted as a weapon against the Kremlin, protesters as paid stooges of the United States, and the Vilnius summit as akin to the [[Munich Agreement]].<ref name="BF131205" />
In addition to events in Ukraine, Russia has described other uprisings in eastern Europe which are unfavorable to the Kremlin's interests as being controlled by foreign powers and fascists. In a July 2009 open letter calling Russia "a revisionist power", [[Vaclav Havel]], [[Lech Walesa]], and other former leaders of central and eastern Europe criticized Russia for "[challenging] our claims to our own historical experiences" and "[asserting] a privileged position in determining our security choices."<ref name=GW090715>{{cite news |url= http://wyborcza.pl/1,86871,6825987,An_Open_Letter_to_the_Obama_Administration_from_Central.html |title= An Open Letter to the Obama Administration from Central and Eastern Europe |authors= [[Valdas Adamkus]], [[Martin Bútora]], [[Emil Constantinescu]], [[Pavol Demeš]], [[Luboš Dobrovský]], [[Mátyás Eörsi]], [[István Gyarmati]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Rastislav Káčer]], [[Sandra Kalniete]], [[Karel Schwarzenberg]], [[Michal Kováč]], [[Ivan Krastev]], [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], [[Mart Laar]], [[Kadri Liik]], [[János Martonyi]], [[Janusz Onyszkiewicz]], [[Adam Daniel Rotfeld]], [[Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga]], [[Alexandr Vondra]], [[Lech Wałęsa]] |newspaper= [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |date= 15 July 2009 }}

Reporting on a Euromaidan protest attended by over a hundred thousand people, [[Channel One Russia]] said that the protests were "dying out" with "only a few hundred" attending.<ref name="BF131208" /><ref name=RFE131209/> The head of ''[[Rossiya Segodnya]]'', [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Kiselyov|Dmitry Kiselyov]], said, "Information war is now the main type of war, preparing the way for military action"<ref name="Politico150104" /> and the Russian Minister of Defense, [[Sergei Shoigu]], described the media as an arm of the Russian military.<ref name="RS150328" /> Russian state media frequently reported stories that were completely made up or used distorted statements by Ukrainian and Western politicians. In 2015 European Union External Action started a periodic publication called "Disinformation Review" documenting such articles by Russian media accompanied by debunking information.<ref>{{cite web|title = European Union - EEAS (European External Action Service) {{!}} "Disinformation Review" - new EU information product|url = http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/ukraine/press_corner/all_news/news/2015/2016_11_04_1_en.htm|website = eeas.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>

Following the parliamentary vote in which [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] was chosen as [[First Yatsenyuk Government|transitional Prime Minister]], [[RT (TV network)|''RT'']] described Ukrainian government officials as "coup-appointed".<ref name=RFE140425/> Continuing after the election of [[Petro Poroshenko]] as President, Russian news outlets regularly described the Ukrainian government as a "[[Military junta|junta]], "[[fascist]]", and "illegitimate".<ref name=Forbes140917/><ref name=IMR1411/><ref name=BBC140810/> Kiselyov's two-hour Sunday show ''Vesti Nedeli'' "developed a near single-minded fixation on Ukraine" and presented the post-Maidan authorities as "fascist usurpers" who were "propped up" by NATO.<ref name=NR140701/> Ukraine was often portrayed as "irreparably dysfunctional", "artificial", "deeply divided", or as a [[failed state]].<ref name=EL150222/><ref name=IWPR150114/><ref name=Econ150530/> Russian state media claimed that Kiev authorities had allowed total [[anarchy]] to take root in Ukraine and that the country was under the control of "banderovtsy", followers of Ukrainian nationalist [[Stepan Bandera]].<ref name=MT140311/><ref name=BBC140810/><ref name=WSJ140502/><ref name=NYT140418/> According to [[Boris Nemtsov]]'s report, ''[[Putin. War]]'', the rhetoric of [[World War II]] was projected onto the crisis, with Russia presented as fighting against "fascism".<ref name=Netmsov-Report/> Eastern Ukrainians were portrayed as desiring Russia's intervention and protection, despite a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll showing that less than 20% of residents held such views.<ref name=EL150222/> The Ukrainian government was accused by Russian media of "[[genocide]]"<ref name=Reut141114/><ref name=KHPG140618/> and "[[pogrom]]s" against the large [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian-speaking population]] in [[Eastern Ukraine|eastern]] and [[Southern Ukraine|southern]] Ukraine.<ref name=MT140311/><ref name=AP140315/> These "pogroms" were said to have been directed toward churches and synagogues, though local Jewish communities denied that any pogroms took place.<ref name=Atlantic140326/><ref name=NYT140408/> [[Russia-1]] and [[RIA Novosti]] claimed that these "pogroms" and "anarchy" resulted in a "humanitarian crisis" in Ukraine, and predicted that refugees would "flood in".<ref name=MT140311/> In early March 2014, prior to the [[war in Donbass]], Russian channels said large numbers of refugees were fleeing the "chaos" in Ukraine and portrayed the new Kiev authorities as "fascists," and an ''[[RT (TV channel)|RT]]'' anchor declared that Russian military intervention was "aimed only at saving Russian lives."<ref name=FT140303/>  ''Channel One'' presented footage from [[Shehyni]], at a border crossing between Ukraine and Poland, as Ukrainians escaping to Russia.<ref name=DB140303/><ref name=France140304/><ref name=CBCjlw/> Russian state channels depicted Donbass civilians as under attack by Ukrainian forces and made no mention of insurgents firing from residential areas.<ref name=BBC150120/> They described the Ukrainian army's operations as "punitive"<ref name=Netmsov-Report/> and presented the war in Donbass as a "[[civil war]]".<ref name=HIPS-Report/> On Russian citizens fighting against Ukraine, they "repeated the official line that the troops are "volunteers" or traveled to Ukraine on leave rather than in any official capacity" while describing foreigners fighting for Ukraine as "mercenaries".<ref name=BBC140905/> There were frequent mentions of "Slavonic unity" and "Russian brotherhood".<ref name=BBC140905/> A group of Russian nationalists prepared an international exhibition [[Material Evidence]], presented with highly anti-Western and pro-Russian bias.

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', British historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]] said that Putin "used television to impose his own narrative of a socially conservative, proud Russia threatened by fascists in Kiev, an expansionist NATO and a decadent EU."<ref name=GN150201/> Joshua Yaffa of ''[[The New Republic]]'' reported a "propaganda onslaught unprecedented in the post-Soviet era, implying or inventing dark suspicions about Western motives in Ukraine while painting Russia's own meddling as a heroic answer to the call of justice."<ref name=NR140701/> In an interview with the [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]], [[Peter Pomerantsev]] said, "The Kremlin has reinvented the conflict in Ukraine as a genocide against Russians. People believe that the fascists are coming to get them, because that's what they have seen on TV, or that the CIA is behind massacres in Ukraine."<ref name=IWPR150114/> Ingo Mannteufel of ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' reported that "Kremlin-run media outlets have been hammering the Russian people and foreign audiences with messages that "fascist politicians and US intelligence agencies" have taken over neighboring Ukraine".<ref name=DW150509/> The Russian media has employed "Soviet language", referring to "traitors", "fascists", and "fifth columns".<ref name=TNR140720/> In an open letter to [[Vladimir Putin]], Ukrainian Jews, a mostly Russian-speaking community, said the Russian media had fabricated stories of forced Ukrainization, bans on the Russian language, and growth of anti-Semitism, and suggested that Putin had "confused Ukraine with Russia, where Jewish organizations have noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year."<ref name=OLJ/>

The Russian media focused particularly on [[Right Sector]], portraying the group as powerful, fascist, and neo-Nazi and saying that it was persecuting Russian-speakers and Jews.<ref name=BBC140810/><ref name=AP140314/><ref name=FP140602/> Writing for ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', Hanna Kozlowska stated that Russian propaganda tried to demonize the Ukraine government and build a case for the annexation of Crimea by depicting Right Sector as a powerful neo-Nazi group which might take control of Ukraine.<ref name=FP140602/> During the first half of 2014, Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in online Russian mass media.<ref name=FP140602/> The [[Associated Press]] and other international news organizations found no evidence that the group had committed hate crimes.<ref name=AP140314/> Right Sector and other far-right candidates had poor results in both the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election]] and [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]].<ref name=Forbes140529/><ref name=JTA141031/> Josef Zissels, chairman of the Vaad Association of Jewish Organization and Communities of Ukraine, stated: "The failure of the ultranationalists reflects a reality which we have been trying to represent all the time despite Russian propaganda's attempt to portray Ukrainian society as intolerant."<ref name=JTA140527/> After the parliamentary election, Vyacheslav Likhachev of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress said that "Russian propaganda speaks of a 'Ukrainian Fascist junta,' but in reality there are more voters for the far-right in the European Union than in Ukraine."<ref name=JTA141031/> Jillian Kay Melchior of the ''[[National Review]]'' found the claims of discrimination against Russian-speakers "absurd," saying the Russian language was prevalent even in Kiev.<ref name=NR140416/>

During the [[Crimean crisis]], Russian media supported the Russian government's assertions that Russian troops were not involved.<ref name=Time150320>{{cite news|title=Putin's Confessions on Crimea Expose Kremlin Media|url=http://time.com/3752827/putin-media-kremlin-crimea-ukraine/|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=20 March 2015|accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref> Russian channels declared that Ukrainian nationalists from western Ukraine and Kiev were assaulting and killing Russians in Crimea; they claimed that a bus in [[Simferopol]] was carrying members of [[Right Sector]] who were attacking Crimean residents, although the footage showed a bus with Crimean license plates transporting men armed with Russian weapons, after roads to Crimea had been blocked by Russian soldiers.<ref name=DB140303/><ref name=France140304/> ''Russia 24'' used footage of Maidan square in [[Kiev]] to support its claims of chaos in Simferopol, Crimea.<ref name=France140304/> Claims of violence and suppression against Russian-speakers in Ukraine were used as justification for the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014)|Russian military intervention]] in [[Crimea]].<ref name=BBCdiverge/> Russian media claimed that the western media ignored the apparent "violence", and that demonstrators in Crimea were protesting for democratic rights. In reference to this, Russian sources consistently refer to the events as the "Russian Spring", harking back to pro-democracy movements like the [[Prague Spring]] and [[Arab Spring]].<ref name=RIAN140303/> The annexation of Crimea was portrayed as the will of the people and a "reunification".<ref name=PN150315/> Pro-Russian protesters in eastern Ukraine, including those who were armed and had taken journalists hostage, were portrayed as peaceful "pro-federalization" activists.<ref name=RFE140425/>

At the same time some Russian media were promoting anti-western and pro-war views: Channel ''Rossiya 2'' aired a short simulation of a [[RT-2PM2 Topol-M|Topol-M]] rocket hitting [[London]] while channel ''5'' simulated a conventional invasion on [[Warsaw]], [[Berlin]] and Baltic states.<ref>{{cite news|title=From cold war to hot war|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21643220-russias-aggression-ukraine-part-broader-and-more-dangerous-confrontation|newspaper=The Economist|date=14 February 2015|issn=0013-0613|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref>

Anti-government groups in eastern and southern Ukraine have been consistently characterized as "local people bravely fighting for their rights", as "self-defence forces", and as "supporters of federalization".<ref name=MT140311/><ref name=NPRaccuse/><ref name=BBCpoles/><ref name=NYTdisinform/> According to broadcasts by the [[Russia-1]] state television channel, "Kiev threatened the citizens of Donetsk with psychological attacks from the air. Periodically, military helicopters and planes circle menacingly over the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk".<ref name=MT140311/> In addition, the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Ukrainian army]], which has launched various [[Donetsk People's Republic|offensives against militants]] in Donetsk Oblast, has been continually portrayed as having "low morale", and being "disorganized".<ref name=BBCpoles/> [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]], a television channel owned by Russian state oil company [[Gazprom]], reported that "Ukrainian troops refused to take orders from their commanders, and sided with pro-Russian militiamen".<ref name=BBCpoles/>

In July 2014, ''[[ITAR-TASS]], [[RIA Novosti]]'', and ''[[LifeNews]]'' reported that pro-Russian separatists had shot down a Ukrainian military plane over [[Torez]].<ref name=Netmsov-Report/><ref name=Mash150501/> When news emerged about the [[MH17]] crash, Russian channels began promoting various theories, all of which suggested Ukraine was responsible.<ref name=Mash150501/><ref name=AP140722/> They considered the crash to be part of a U.S. conspiracy against Russia.<ref name=TNR140720/>  Russian media claimed in late September that "hundreds of unmarked graves of civilians executed by Ukrainian army" were found and verified by OSCE monitors, a claim that was debunked by the [[OSCE]] and DPR officials.<ref name=RFE141003/><ref name=UT141002/><ref name=INT140929/> Other top stories, usually based on hearsay, with no accompanying evidence and illustrated by photos taken from unrelated incidents<ref name=Guardian20150409/> included a "three-year-old boy crucified by Ukrainian servicemen", "parcel of land and two Russian slaves for Ukrainian soldiers," a woman with five different names and stories, "Spanish air controller in Kiev", "satellite photo of Ukrainian fighter jet firing at Boeing", "Ukrainian fighter jet pilot confession" (spread in Russian media as a viable explanations for the [[MH17]] crash), [[Dmytro Yarosh]] winning the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election]], and Yarosh threatening to set off a grenade in Parliament.<ref name=RFE141212/><ref name=UT141230/><ref name=KP150106/><ref name=RS150108/> [[Rossiya Segodnya]]'s ''Ukraina.ru'' website claimed that Ukrainian president [[Petro Poroshenko]] had links with [[Lucifer]]. The story was later retracted from the original website.<ref name=Meduza150129/> In August 2015 [[Komsomolskaya Pravda|Komsomoloskaya Pravda]] published an alleged wiretap of two named [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives planning an attack on MH17 but, which was ridiculed in Western media as the English used by both "agents" was very unnatural for a native speaker and resembled "Google translated Russian phrases read from a script".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/12/propaganda-watch-listen-to-two-russians-badly-impersonate-cia-spies-to-pin-mh17-on-u-s/ | title=Propaganda Watch: Listen to Two Russians Badly Impersonate CIA Spies to Pin MH17 on U.S. | magazine=Foreign Policy | accessdate=August 14, 2015 | author=Reid Standish}}</ref>

In March 2015, [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] published a false report that the Carpatho-[[Rusyns]] had held a congress during which they decided to seek autonomy.<ref name=SF150317/><ref name=AJ150504/> Russian state media were also criticized for their reporting on [[Odessa Oblast]], particularly claims of riots and persecution of ethnic minorities.<ref name=KHRPG-Odessa/> [[Russia-1]] presented Poroshenko's statement that Ukrainian would remain the only state language as a violation of the right to speak Russian freely, although a survey found that even Donbass and eastern oblasts preferred Russian to have the status of a second official language in particular regions over "state language" status.<ref name=LangApr2015/> In April 2015, Russian media widely reported a death of a 10-year-old girl killed by Ukrainian artillery but Russian reporters on the site interviewed by the BBC admitted that "the girl never existed" and they were reporting this fake story because they "were instructed" to do so.<ref name=BBC150408/> Further fake news in Russian media included alleged "fascist attacks" on Greek population in Crimea (which Greek embassy denied) and "four American soldiers" raping two underage girls in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.interpretermag.com/kremlins-five-top-lies-last-week-about-ukraine/ | title=Kremlin's Five Top Lies Last Week about Ukraine | publisher=The Interpreter Magazine | date=2015-04-19 | accessdate=2015-04-20 | author=Paul Goble}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.russialies.com/russias-top-160-lies-about-ukraine/ | title=Russia's top 160 lies about Ukraine | publisher=RussiaLies | accessdate=July 26, 2015| date=2015-07-26 }}</ref> In May 2015, [[Izvestiya]]  allegedly "disclosed" a letter from US Embassy to LGBT activists in Russia written in English with so many errors, that the US Departament of State republished it marking the errors in red with a dedication in Russian, suggesting that the authors ask for help while writing such letters next time.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://photos.state.gov/libraries/russia/5/izvestiya/izvestiya-fake.pdf |title = Izvestiya Fake|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Departament of State|last = |first = }}</ref>

The BBC reported that the Russian state media had a "tendency to focus on events in Ukraine to the almost complete exclusion of problems at home."<ref name=BBC150428/> In May 2015, Slovak monitoring group ''MEMO 98, Internews Ukraine'', and ''Yerevan Press Club of Armenia'' completed a report on Russian TV channels for the Civil Society Forum of the [[Eastern Partnership]]. MEMO 98's Rasťo Kužel observed that Russian media "diverted attention from important domestic issues and scared the population with the possibility of a war and the need of Russia to protect itself against an external enemy."<ref name=Memo98-2015/> In an interview for ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', [[OSCE]] observer Paul Picard stated: "We often see how Russian media outlets manipulate our statements. They say that we have not seen Russian troops crossing the borders. But that only applies to two border crossings. We have no idea what is going on at the others" (Russia having refused to allow the OSCE to expand its mission).<ref name=DW150624/>

Leaked emails of Kristina Potupchik, former [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] spokeswoman, later employee of President Vladimir Putin's administration, revealed wide-scale monitoring of any critical articles in Russia opposition media, placing paid comments and [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] by [[web brigades]] coordinated by Potupchik<ref name=GVO141227/> (according to earlier leaks she was involved in similar activities at least since 2012).<ref name=Gazeta120209/> For example, Potupchik reported to her supervisors about alleged irregularities in [[Alexei Navalny]]'s passport application form, attaching its scans to the email. As noted by ''The Insider'', she had no legal way to obtain these forms as they are considered sensitive documents, and a few days later [[LifeNews]] reported exactly these irregularities as part of campaign against Navalny.<ref name=Theins141226/> According to Alexander Sytnik, a former member of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research, his organization was one of the channels for "illegal funding of pro-Russian analysts in Ukraine through third parties".<ref name=EDM20015/>

On a number of occasions, [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Dmitry Rogozin]] and [[Nikolai Patrushev]] have given examples of Western prejudice and hostility against Russia; one of these examples was an alleged statement by [[Madelaine Albright]] about Russia "controlling too much of Siberia's resources". As Russian independent media shortly found out, this phrase was never voiced by Albright, but instead by a former Russian security services officer [[Boris Ratnikov]], who in 2006 gave examples of what kind of "secret" information he was able to extract from Western leaders using experimental "remote mind control" research. Even though the origins of the claim were traced in 2007, Russian leaders repeatedly used it as if it were a real statement. Asked by a journalist about this particular statement, Putin replied that "I know this is what they think in their minds".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/world/europe/putin-cites-claim-about-us-designs-on-siberia-traced-to-russian-mind-readers.html | title=Putin Cites Claim About U.S. Designs on Siberia Traced to Russian Mind Readers | newspaper=New York Times | date=2014-12-18 | accessdate=June 26, 2015 | first=Robert | last=Mackey}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/putting-words-in-albrights-mouth/193094.html | title=Putting Words in Albright's Mouth | newspaper=The Moscow Times | date=2007-11-07 | accessdate=June 26, 2015 | author=Smolchenko, Anna}}</ref>

Themes of Russia's "information war" include Russia having the right to a "[[sphere of influence]]" and "only laying claim to what is rightfully hers", its neighbors being "failed states", Europe "harming" its economy and security by building ties with them, "moral equality" between Putin and the West, "Western decadence" and threats to "traditional" ways of life, Europe being most harmed by sanctions, Putin's government being "legitimate" and "successful", and obscuring Russia's role in post-Soviet crises by presenting them as ethnic conflicts.<ref name=Martens1506/> Descriptions of the Ukrainian government as "illegitimate" or "self-appointed" and the country as "fascist" were common in Russian reports during much of the conflict, but had declined sharply by the end of 2015.<ref name=Meduza151229/> Ukraine was the main subject of negative reports until the Russian media shifted their attention to Turkey.<ref name=Meduza151229/>

Multiple Russian news outlets have been criticized for producing unsubstantiated reports of atrocities.

In May 2014, Cathy Young of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reported that journalists were being abducted and "subjected to bizarre propaganda rituals on Russian television."<ref name=DB140518/> Irma Krat, a journalist and [[Euromaidan]] activist who was held prisoner from April to July 2014 by pro-Russian militants, said that ''[[LifeNews]]'' interrogated her after she had been injected with a drug and that ''[[NTV (Russia)]]'' had manipulated footage: "The interview was cut and spliced so that it makes me appear to have almost admitted to being a killer, a sadist, and as if I was renouncing the Maidan."<ref name=RFE140807/> [[Institute of Modern Russia|''Interpretermag.com'']] said that some Russian reporters were involved in serious violations of journalism ethics.<ref name=IM140930/><ref name=IM141029/> After pro-Kremlin station ''[[LifeNews]]'' approvingly filmed the abuse of Ukrainian [[POW]]s by pro-Russian forces, [[Dunja Mijatović]] of the [[OSCE]] said that the station's portrayal amounted to "unethical and inadmissible reporting" and an "abuse of journalists' rights and privileges."<ref name=KHPG150123/>

Some Russian media have been accused of employing [[whataboutism]] as a response to criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine.<ref name=Mash150429/><ref name=spec140726/><ref name=DB140309/> The firing of Galina Timchenko, chief editor of Russian news website [[Lenta.ru]], after she published an interview with one of [[Right Sector]]'s leaders, Andriy Tarasenko, was cited by western media as an incident of [[censorship]].<ref name=BBClenta/><ref name=econ140314/> She also faced pressure to use material from Russia's state-run media.<ref name=NR140416/> [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] wrote that [[Russia-24]]'s editing of RFERL's interviews was "a useful case study in how a video's context can be shifted to represent one particular point of view."<ref name=RFE140621/> [[Rossiya Segodnya]] published an interview with [[Igor Girkin]] after removing his statements on working for Russia's [[Federal Security Service]] and chaos among pro-Russian militants.<ref name=RFERL141202/>

In early March 2014, Shaun Walker of ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported, "Russian state television has gone out of its way to manufacture an image of the [[Euromaidan|protests]] as a uniquely sinister phenomenon; a far-right movement backed by the west with the ultimate goal of destabilising Russia. ... On the ground in Crimea, what is particularly odd is that the most vociferous defenders of Russian bases against supposed fascists appear to hold far-right views themselves."<ref name=GNSW140304/> In August 2014, BBC News reported, "Russian state TV's coverage of the crisis has been consistently sensationalist, using a wide repertoire of propaganda techniques to incite revulsion and hostility towards the authorities in Kiev."<ref name=BBC140810/> The [[Institute of Modern Russia]] wrote, "Inside Russia, and in areas of eastern Ukraine where Russian television is popular, the Kremlin's political technologists have managed to create a parallel reality where "fascists" have taken power in Kiev, ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine are in mortal danger and the CIA is waging a war against Moscow."<ref name=IMR1411/> In March 2014, historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]] rejected the claims of a "fascist coup", stating "Although one can certainly debate the constitutional nuances, this process was not a coup. And it certainly was not fascist. Reducing the powers of the president, calling presidential elections, and restoring the principles of democracy are the opposite of what fascism would demand."<ref name=NYB140307/> Some observers were critical of the Russian media's heavy focus on radical and right-wing groups during [[Euromaidan]], finding that the protests were broad-based.<ref name=FT140303/> Commenting in the [[Kyiv Post]] on "fascist" accusations against Ukraine, Lily Hyde wrote, "Today's Russia, with its focus on a strong leader, primacy of the state, and aggressive imperial ambitions, is far more text-book "fascist" than Ukraine."<ref name=KP140909/> The Kyiv Post's Oleg Sukhov and BBC News' Stephen Ennis accused Russian media of "[[demonization]]" of Ukrainians.<ref name=Sukhov140911/><ref name=BBC141115/> Sukhov said Russian media regularly used fascist labels "without pointing out the relatively low support for far-right groups among the Ukrainian population or the presence of neo-Nazis among Russian-backed insurgents," and he criticized their presentation of the Ukrainian crisis as "orchestrated by the United States while ignoring Russia's direct involvement in support of separatists."<ref name=Sukhov140911/> [[Bernard-Henri Levy]] said the claims of "fascism" in Ukraine were part of a "misinformation campaign."<ref name=DB1402026/> Sergei Loiko, a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' correspondent interviewed by ''Novoye Vremya Ukraine,'' criticized Russian channels, saying "there were no reasons for [this war]. They are all fictional. They are built on lies, spread by Russian television. There was no reason for people to kill each other.

Timothy D. Snyder criticized the presentation of [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian-speakers]] in Ukraine as [[Russians in Ukraine|ethnic Russians]] who desired Russia's "protection."<ref name=NYB140307/> In October 2014, [[Taras Kuzio]] wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' that "the world view created by Putin's state controlled media has never corresponded to reality. Putin always mixed up "Russian speakers" with "Russians" in Ukraine, believing they were one and the same. So he was always unable to fathom the fact that a large proportion of Ukrainian armed forces and National Guard are Russian speakers."<ref name=FT141009/> The Russian media's depiction of the mainly [[Russophone]] city of [[Kharkiv]] as eager to join Russia was called "wishful thinking" by Katya Soldak of ''[[Forbes]]'', who said that events in the city and a survey conducted by [[Alexei Navalny]] did not support the portrayal.<ref name=Forbes140928/> The [[University of Helsinki]]'s Michael Gentile and Lucian Kim of ''[[Reuters]]'' were critical of the focus on ethnicity and language to explain the conflict in Donbas. Gentile stated that "rather than being divided between Ukrainians and Russians, the Donbas is divided between people who believe in the concept of Ukrainian sovereign statehood and those who are nostalgic of the Soviet past."<ref name=VU150210/> Kim wrote, "As strenuously as the Kremlin propaganda machine raises the hobgoblin of Ukrainian nationalism, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia isn't about ethnicity or language — it's about the kind of country that people want to live in."<ref name=Kim150302/> Pierre Vaux, writing in [[Left Foot Forward]], criticized "the efforts of Kremlin propagandists to portray the Ukrainian government as waging a war on Russian speakers", stating that "large swathes of the government are Russian speakers. So are many of the military leaders in the east, including commanders of volunteer formations, such as [[Semen Semenchenko|Semyon Semyonchenko]]".<ref name=LFF1503/> In addition to [[Russophone]]s from Ukraine, about a hundred Russian citizens joined pro-Ukrainian forces, "[discrediting] incessant Kremlin propaganda that Russian speakers are being persecuted in Ukraine", according to the ''Kyiv Post''.<ref name=KP150424/>

Assertions that the West had broken an agreement against [[Enlargement of NATO|NATO enlargement]] were criticized by some commentators. Pavel Stroilov, who copied Kremlin documents, said that "if the idea of a broken promise is being used as [[casus belli]] in Ukraine, it is being used fraudulently."<ref name=Spec140906/> Citing a 1995 article from ''The New York Times'', [[Anne Applebaum]] said the suggestion that the EU and NATO had provoked Russia was "based on revisionist history promoted by the current Russian regime—and it is wrong. For the record: No treaties prohibiting NATO expansion were ever signed with Russia. No promises were broken."<ref name=Slate141017/><ref name=NYT950810/> In 2014 interviews with ''[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]'' and Germany's ''[[ZDF]]'', [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] also dismissed claims of a non-expansion pledge and said the idea that the West had deceived him was "a myth. The press had a hand in it."<ref name=RBTH141016/><ref name=FAZ141108/> According to Ben Nimmo of the Central European Policy Institute, the Russian media was "distorting Western perceptions of the conflict. Claims that NATO promised not to expand into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) after German reunification, and that Russia's fear of that enlargement is justifiable, have entered the mainstream media, creating the impression that the West is to blame for Russia's direct assault on Ukraine."<ref name=CEPI150515/> Applebaum and French intellectual [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] rejected assertions that Russia had suffered "humiliation" and "encirclement".<ref name=Slate141017/><ref name=Levy150209/> In an article for the ''Guardian'', Christopher Clark and Kristina Spohr wrote that "misframing the past as a narrative of deceptions, betrayals and humiliations is a profoundly dangerous move" which undermined "the entire fabric of treaties and settlements that make up the post-cold war order."<ref name=GN150524/> Accused of trying to "encircle" Russia and deepening divisions by accepting new members, NATO said that the statement "ignores the facts of geography. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, 1,215 kilometres, or less than one-sixteenth, face current NATO members" and referred to the "[[Helsinki Final Act]] which says that every state has the right "to belong or not to belong to international organizations, to be or not to be a party to bilateral or multilateral treaties including the right to be or not to be a party to treaties of alliance." And by signing the NATO-Russia Founding Act, Russia agreed to respect states' "inherent right to choose the means to ensure their own security.""<ref name=NATO/>

[[Edward Lucas (journalist)|Edward Lucas]] and [[Peter Pomerantsev]] noted that Russia's portrayal borrowed from Soviet narratives and terminology. "By telling Russians that, as in 1941-45, they are fighting fascists, the Kremlin aims both to galvanize its own population but also to delegitimize any dissenters: to speak against the war is to betray Russia itself."<ref name=CEPA201608/> Accusations of "provocation" appeared frequently in Russian discourse, turning "the dynamics of the conflict ... upside down: the attacker becomes the victim and the victim is accused of starting the conflict."<ref name=CEPA201608/>

[[Russia-1]]'s ''Crimea: The Road to the Homeland'', which aired in March 2015, was criticized for distorting a March 2014 incident in which a man named Oleg Gorshkov attempted to stop a truck from breaking through a Crimean checkpoint,<ref name=BBC150316/> for unsupported claims of an anti-Crimean "pogrom" in [[Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi]],<ref name=KP150318/> and for a "sycophantic" Putin interview.<ref name=Slate150319/> The same month, three Russian channels claimed that a 10-year-old girl had been killed by shelling in the Petrovsky region of Donetsk; BBC News said that the story had been "made up".<ref name=BBC150408/>

Writing for Lithuania's [[Delfi (web portal)|''Delfi'']], Viktoras Denisenko stated that "Some Russian propaganda narratives are identifiable and exposed, but quite a lot of them are stealthy and reach their audience and successfully make their way into mass perception where they become entrenched."<ref name=Delfi150126/> In April 2015, [[Lithuania]]'s Radio and Television Commission banned [[RTR-Planeta]] for three months, stating that it had violated the law against "war propaganda, hatred and inciting discord" and ignored repeated warnings.<ref name=AP150408/><ref name=EUOB150409/> Some Ukrainians responded to Russian reporting with humour while others found it inappropriate.<ref name=KHRPG-Odessa/><ref name=AFP150526/>

In September 2015 [[Linas Antanas Linkevičius|Linas Linkevičius]] called for more response and debunking to claims of Russian media, adding that "a lie is not an alternative point of view", which is an argument frequently used by media presenting "Russian point of view".<ref>{{cite web|title = No freedom to lie|url = https://euobserver.com/opinion/130188|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}</ref> According to the [[Centre for Eastern Studies]], "information campaigns using the stereotype of Russophobia are leading to a consolidation of political nationalism" in Russia; "attacking 'Russophobes' is a way of protecting Russian society itself from having any doubts about the Kremlin's policy", "mobilising them in the face of real or alleged threats", and "restoring psychological comfort" after a failure.<ref name=OSW56/>

In May 2016 [[Canal+]] reviewed a number of reports by [[Rossiya 24]] from France, verifying them with people interviewed by Russian journalists, and found out that their opinions were severely misrepresented by the Russian channel, either by manipulative editing or intentionally distorted translation.

==Media in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada==
Many in the Western media described Ukrainian society as deeply "divided".<ref name=CBC131209/> Most reported the [[Euromaidan]] as a protest movement against corruption and for democracy, with a minority presence of far-right groups,<ref name=CBC140119/><ref name=UCLem/> though some suggested that they played the decisive role in armed confrontations.<ref name=GN140305/> Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s accumulation of wealth received coverage.<ref name=PM140225/> Moscow's claims of fascism and western conspiracies were often included for balance.<ref name=Guardian20150409/>

Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] was described variously as a "bully,"<ref name=HP131217/><ref name=FP140816/> "imperialist,"<ref name=GN140318/><ref name=TA140723/> and a "brilliant" and skilled leader.<ref name=NR140718/><ref name=Spiegel131216/><ref name=NYT141220/> As of December 2014, BBC News and Reuters take no position on whether Russia is a party to the armed conflict, saying simply that Russia is "accused" by "Ukraine and its Western allies."<ref name=BBC141209/><ref name=Reut141228/> A few days after the [[OSCE]]'s Observer Mission wrote that it "continued to observe high numbers of dumper trucks transporting coal from the Luhansk region to the Russian Federation,"<ref name=OSCE141224/> ''[[Reuters]]'' reported on Russia's offer to sell coal to Ukraine, saying "months of fighting a pro-Russian uprising has disrupted coal supplies" but not mentioning the OSCE's observations.<ref name=Reut141227/> In 2015, the BBC and ''The Guardian'' continued to portray [[Odessa]] and [[Kharkiv]] as deeply divided,<ref name=Divisions/> despite polls showing that supporters of separatism or joining Russia were a small minority.<ref name=ODKH/> Western media avoided describing anti-Ukrainian foreign fighters as foreigners invading Ukraine, preferring to describe them as "rebels" or "separatists".<ref name=AC161021/> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described a Russian citizen, who had no connection to Ukraine prior to taking up arms against its government, as a "pro-Russian rebel".<ref name=Telegraph161017/>

Some western sources stated that the pro-Russian unrest was fomented by the Russian government and [[Russian special forces]].<ref name=MT140311/> Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' accused Russia of "manufacturing of chaos in Ukraine" and described the chaos as "made in Moscow."<ref name=TGAM140718/><ref name=TGAM140718b/> Some outlets proclaimed a "new cold war".<ref name=GNbia/> Seeing similarities with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s annexation of various lands with German-language speakers, such as [[Austria]] and the [[Sudetenland]], some called the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]] Russia's [[Anschluss]].<ref name=DB150105/> On [[Tony Brenton]]'s proposal to make a deal with Putin, Con Coughlin of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote, "This seems uncomfortably similar to the [[appeasement]] arguments that were made in the 1930s – rather than confront Hitler over his threatening behaviour towards Germany's European neighbours, we should reach an accommodation with the Nazis."<ref name=TEL141219/> Conversely, [[Peter Hitchens]] of ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' accused the West of warmongering attitudes towards Russia: "we think we are the heroes, setting out with brave hearts to confront the Dark Lord, and free the saintly Ukrainians from his wicked grasp", and "stupid, ill-informed people nowadays like to compare Mr Putin with Hitler".<ref name=Hitchens/>

Ian Birrell, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', criticized Western leaders, saying they had done "little more than talk tough" and "Their failure is symbolized by verbal acrobatics as they avoid using the word "invasion", talking instead of "incursion" and "aggression.""<ref name=IND140901/> Commenting on [[Barack Obama]]'s refusal to send weapons to Ukraine as part of his policy of "no military solution" and avoiding escalation, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "weak U.S. and European support has allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to impose his own military solution as he has repeatedly escalated his aggression."<ref name=WP140919/> ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' stated "The West has dithered under the assumption that providing lethal aid to Ukraine would escalate the conflict. But a sanctions-dominant approach clearly has not prevented escalation. Indeed, with France's determination to sell the Mistral ships to Russia, the West is in the peculiar position of arming the aggressor and forbidding arms to the victim."<ref name=FP140816/> [[Paul A. Goble]] was critical of Western governments' response, saying "by signalling that it will not oppose a particular case of aggression, the West has taught Putin and his regime a lesson, but very much the wrong one: aggression works and after "a decent interval" will be ignored, have no consequences for relations with the West, and then can be repeated."<ref name=IM140923/> In September 2014, ''[[GlobalPost]]'''s Gregory Feifer commented on the Ukrainian perspective, stating, "the arguments of some in the West who preach tolerance for Putin are generating anguish and disbelief – and increasingly outrage and hostility – toward the countries whose values Ukrainians believe they're being left alone to defend."<ref name=GP140923/> In February 2015, Charles Crawford of ''The Telegraph'' concluded that Putin had been "rewarded for his bullying."<ref name=Teleg150213/>

In ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', Oliver Bullough said that Western countries, including the UK, Austria, and Switzerland, had enabled the theft of billions by the Yanukovych government and were making little effort to track and return Ukrainian money, concluding, "If cynicism spreads among Ukrainians and they conclude that the West and Russia are as bad as each other -- and that, in essence, Westerners say pretty things but in reality care only for money -- then the revolution will fail."<ref name=FP140909/>

A number of U.K. and U.S. commentators echoed the Russian state media's portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis. Seumas Milne, John Pilger, John Mearsheimer, Stephen Cohen, and others blamed "neo-Nazis" in Ukraine and "NATO expansion", expressed understanding for Putin whom the West had "provoked", and presented Ukraine as a pawn which Russia was entitled to treat as its [[sphere of influence]].<ref name=GN140305/><ref name=gua140513>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/13/ukraine-us-war-russia-john-pilger |title= In Ukraine, the US is dragging us towards war with Russia |first= John |last= Pilger |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 13 May 2014 }}</ref><ref name=JJM>{{cite journal |url= https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-18/why-ukraine-crisis-west-s-fault |title= Why the Ukraine Crisis Is the West's Fault |issue= September/October 2014 |first= John J. |last = Mearsheimer |authorlink = John Mearsheimer |journal= [[Foreign Affairs]] |date= September–October 2014 }}</ref><ref name=WAJ140710/>

[[Seumas Milne]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized NATO's eastward expansion, and stated that "it is hardly surprising that Russia has acted to stop the more strategically sensitive and neuralgic Ukraine falling decisively into the western camp, especially given that Russia's only major warm-water naval base is in Crimea".<ref name=GN140305/> Likewise, [[John J.

His thesis is that Russia has the right to decide the fate of the countries in its neighborhood in its own interest. ... Mearsheimer is denying countries their right to self-defense or to join NATO."<ref name=PIIE140820/> Budjeryn also dismissed Mearsheimer's argument that the EU and NATO had provoked the conflict: "That the Russians failed to design a model of development and a security arrangement that would be equally attractive and did not require arm-twisting to keep together is not the West's fault. Turns out, democracy and rule of law is not the West's property to peddle around the world, but a political model post-Communist societies chose to pursue when they were free to do so."<ref name=WAJ1409/> Motyl criticized Mearsheimer's article for "empirically preposterous claims" and "evidentiary cherry-picking, citing only those Russian claims that support [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], while ignoring the many others that do not."<ref name=WAJ1501/> [[Thefederalist.com]]'s Tom Nichols questioned the depiction of Putin as a Russian nationalist and realist, writing that Putin had "reminded a previously slumbering NATO why it exists," "invigorated Ukrainian nationalism," "[violated] almost every rule of competent strategy" ("needless multiplication of enemies" and "letting emotion overcome policy"), and was drawing the US into the conflict, saying [[Barack Obama]]'s administration "has no interest in a fight and would just as well walk away from European affairs if only given half a chance."<ref name=TF140902/>

In March 2014, Alan Yuhas wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'', "The occupation of Crimea by pro-Russian forces has been accompanied by a remarkable propaganda push by Moscow – an effort that has infiltrated western media and helped redefine the debate in Russia's favor."<ref name=GNAY140317/> In ''[[World Affairs]],'' Arthur Milikh criticized Western journalism, saying "much of the Western media, unwittingly complicit, maintain a spirit of scepticism to avoid open accusations against [Putin]. For example, many of those labeled Ukrainian "separatists" are in fact Russian-trained and -equipped troops."<ref name=WA-Milikh/> Some suggested [[false balance]] in Western reports on Ukraine. [[Paul A.

[[Occidental College]]'s [[Agnia Grigas]] and the Cicero Foundation's Marcel Van Herpen wrote that Russian propaganda "has insinuated itself into and been internalized by the Western media, complementing Russia's military tactics in achieving Putin's expansionist goals."<ref name=Forbes140917/> Laas Leivat of ''Estonian Life'' also found that Western media were "[[Internalization|internalizing]]" Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as an "irreparably dysfunctional" and "deeply divided" country.<ref name=EL150222/> [[Institute of Modern Russia|Interpretermag.com]]'s [[Catherine A.

When the Ukrainian government or even Western governments discuss the presence of Russian weapons or soldiers in the east, the media present their statements and then the Russian denial as if they were of equal value, but they are not."<ref name=HIPS-Report/>

''[[Newsweek]]'' was criticized for articles by Damien Sharkov and Felicity Capon.<ref name=SF150208/><ref name=ICDS150526/> Sharkov and the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Kenneth Roth]], falsely claimed that Ukrainian lawmakers had passed a motion allowing deserters to be shot.<ref name=SF150208/> Halya Coynash of the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] found western reporting of the [[2015 Ukraine bus attack]] lacking: "The BBC and other western media reports present the Ukrainian side, then the militant denial, leaving out any detail about the labyrinth of different versions from the latter."<ref name=KHPG150115/>

Casey Michel stated that many Western media "maintained a bulwark against Russian obfuscation" but others were "pushing Russia's fantasies" such as "Russia is the victim!"<ref name=Inter150626/> Yuri M.

==Media in Ukraine==
[[Ukrainian media]] stated that the unrest in Ukraine was manufactured by Russia.<ref name=MT140311/> They have consistently accused Russia of being a provocateur, and of controlling the anti-government groups behind the scenes.<ref name=NRdanger/> The annexation of Crimea was viewed as illegitimate and illegal.<ref name=GNill/> Following the start of the [[War in Donbass]], the Ukrainian government and some media described the armed groups of the self-proclaimed [[Donetsk People's Republic]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic]] as "terrorists" and "separatists" and referred to the military operation against the DPR and LPR as an "anti-terrorist" operation.<ref name=MT140311/><ref name=RSterror/>

In September 2014, ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' was critical of the West's response to the crisis, stating "Ukraine can never surrender its nation and the West should be ashamed of its ongoing [[appeasement]] of Putin, who is trying to veto the Western, democratic aspirations of Ukrainians who do not share his warped dream of recreating a version of the Soviet Union."<ref name=KP140911/>

Halya Coynash of the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] criticized Russia's calls for "federalization" of Ukraine while quickly suppressing autonomy initiatives within Russia.<ref name=KHPG140930/> Ukrainian media widely condemned the November 2014 [[2014 Donbass general elections|Donbass general elections]], with comparisons to elections in the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Oleksiy Matsuka]], chief editor of ''Donbass News'' called the poll "votes for vegetables."<ref name=BBC141104/>

=== Reactions ===
In April 2014, historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]] stated that "Ukraine is now the site of the largest and most important free media in the Russian language, since all important media in Ukraine appear in Russian, and since freedom of speech prevails. Putin's idea of defending Russian speakers in Ukraine is absurd on many levels, but one of them is this: people can say what they like in Russian in Ukraine, but they cannot do so in Russia itself."<ref name=FAZ140416/> In August 2014, BBC News stated that Ukrainian coverage depicted Russia in a "negative light but language has been restrained in comparison to that on Russian TV."<ref name=BBC140810/> They reported that Ukrainian media were increasingly airing "direct accusations" and "harsh criticism" of Russia but "alternative opinions are also aired, and presenters make no attempt to block dissent."<ref name=BBC140810/> Conversely, Joseph L. Black, the Distinguished Research Professor at the [[Carleton University]], stated that Ukrainian media used [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing language]] towards the rebels, referring to them as "[[Colorado potato beetle|Colorado beetles]]" and calling for their "extermination as vermin"; in his view, the "Russian official press releases and websites were less inflammatory in their language".<ref name=BlackJohns/> Likewise, Mikhail A. Molchanov, professor and former chair of the Department of Political Science at [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], said that the Ukrainian media consistently portrays Russia as an Asiatic "other" of "European" Ukraine and the West, referring to it as a "madhouse" and "[[Mordor]]", and to the Russians as "not a people, but a rabble".<ref name=Molchanov/>

In December 2014, [[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned the creation of the Ukrainian [[Ministry of Information (Ukraine)|Ministry of Information]], which is intended to counteract "Russian propaganda", observing that "In a democratic society, the media should not be regulated by the government."<ref>{{cite web |title=RWB Opposes Creation of Information Ministry |publisher=Reporters without Borders |date=2 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url=http://en.rsf.org/ukraine-rwb-opposes-creation-of-02-12-2014,47325.html }}</ref>

==Media in other countries==
In September 2014, Japan's ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' said, "The latest ceasefire accord is defective in that it does not mention the withdrawal of thousands of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine. ... It is essential to ensure the withdrawal of Russian troops and end Russia's provision of arms to the rebels to maintain the integrity of Ukrainian sovereignty and territory."<ref name=YS140907/> France's ''[[Le Figaro]]'' wrote that Vladimir Putin's policies were "pushing Ukraine into the arms of NATO."<ref name=Figaro140904/> In Switzerland's ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', Volker Pabst wrote: "Putin needs an external enemy to suppress criticism and to keep his corrupt system going. He is therefore increasingly provoking foreign policy crises."<ref name=NZZ140509/>

[[:de:Jan C. Behrends|Jan C. Behrends]] of ''Zeitgeschichte-online'' wrote, "To hold on to [[Ostpolitik]], Berlin has over the past 20 years ignored warning signs from [[Chechnya]] to [[Occupied territories of Georgia|Georgia]] and the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] restructuring of the Russian state. The "modernization partnership" was pursued at any cost. Warnings from Poland or the [[Baltic states]] were dismissed as doomsday predictions." He stated, "Of course, the Kremlin bears responsibility for the war in Ukraine" but blamed Germany's and Europe's weakness on Berlin: "For too long, the Foreign Ministry followed comfortable patterns of thinking, engaged in too much [[appeasement]], integrated too deeply with a power over which we ultimately have no control."<ref name=ZGO1409/> In ''New Eastern Europe'', Dustin Dehez said that the German government was interested primarily in preserving its economic ties with Russia and "seemed ready to sacrifice not just the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but also its relationship with its Eastern European allies."<ref name=NEE140819/> In his article for ''[[Die Zeit]]'', Boris Schumatsky said, "Putin triumphs when other world leaders allow the lies to go unchallenged. Of course Putin knows that at least some politicians are wise to his ways. But to him the crucial thing is this: they don't call the fraud a fraud, nor the invasion an invasion, nor the hybrid war a war."<ref name=Zeit141001/> Volodymyr Valkov said EU and NATO policies "cannot be considered as "provocative policies" against Russia to excuse Russian annexation of Crimea and occupation of Ukraine's eastern regions. Many former Soviet republics and Warsaw pact countries have chosen democracy and joined the alliances that best represent their interests and aspirations. Ukraine has a right to follow the same path and defend its choice."<ref name=NEE140905/>

''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' presented the toppling of [[Communism|Communist]] monuments as "anti-Russian sentiment".<ref name=AFP150418/>

In an article published in February 2014 by [[RFERL]], Glenn Kates said some media's maps, such as one presented by [[Al Jazeera]], oversimplified the divisions in Ukraine.<ref name=RFERL140227/> Andriy Portnov said, "The German, as well as British or French media, quite often publish misleading maps of 'ethnic zones'" and "automatically [ascribe] the preferred language of everyday communication to political preferences and even ethnicity."<ref name=OD141124/>

In May 2014, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that "when German talk shows invite Russian journalists to speak about the Ukraine crisis, they are almost always pundits who could have been taken directly out of the Kremlin propaganda department."<ref name=Spiegel140530/> [[Munich University]]'s Fabian Burkhardt studied the presentation of the Ukraine crisis on German talks shows, reviewing 81 guests from December 2013 to April 2014. He reported a "heavy lean towards pro-Russia guests," with many having "economic ties to Russia," and found that of the 27 guests who were journalists, none were from Ukraine, compared to eight from Russia, while most of the German journalists were experts on Russia rather than Ukraine.<ref name=IMR1411/><ref name=Burkhardt/> In December 2014, a statement signed by over 140 German intellectuals criticised "superficial reporting and frequent appearances of Kremlin mouthpieces in television discussions on Ukraine" which had resulted in "misinformation and biased interpretations regarding Ukraine" becoming "anchored in the minds of many ordinary people".<ref name=SPIRE/>

By January 2015, media coverage of events in Ukraine had decreased significantly.<ref name=IM150106/> The former Prime Minister of Sweden [[Carl Bildt]] said, "It's striking how most media just avoid the battles in eastern Ukraine. It's ongoing aggression in Europe. It must not be seen as normal."<ref name=TW150118/>

In ''New Eastern Europe'', Sławomir Budziak stated that new pro-Russian media outlets had appeared in the Czech Republic, publishing "far-fetched claims, speculations, conspiracy-mongering, lies, defamation and propaganda" which fostered "a state of doubt" and "mistrust" in readers.<ref name=NEE150330/>

==Terminology==
Western media have generally referred to armed anti-government and pro-Russian groups in Ukraine as "rebels" or "separatists."<ref name=MT140728/> ''Reuters'' describes the events in eastern Ukraine as an "[[uprising]]" and "revolt" by "[[separatists]]."<ref name=Reut141228/> Casey Michael of ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' questioned the use of "Ukrainian" and "rebels" to describe the armed pro-Russian groups, saying that their leadership and many fighters were "outsiders and usurpers, men with either mercenary or imperial motivations."<ref name=MT140728/> Laas Leivat of ''Estonian Life'' criticised the use of the term "separatists," saying it "obscures the reality of the situation" and "supports the Kremlin's version of events."<ref name=EL150222/> As of December 2014, ''BBC News'' and ''Reuters'' prefer the terms "crisis" and "conflict" over "war".<ref name=BBC141209/><ref name=Reut141228/> The word "invasion" was usually avoided, a choice criticized by [[Garry Kasparov]], Ian Birrell of ''[[The Independent]]'', and Trudy Rubin of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.<ref name=IND140901/><ref name=Kasparov140830/><ref name=Phila141123/> In April 2015, Julian Reichelt of [[Bild.de]] wrote that the "deceptive language of politics" (e.g. efforts "to prevent a war in Ukraine") often influenced reporting, making journalists "complicit in disguising what is actually happening in Ukraine, where a war is already in full swing."<ref name=PEU150427/>

Peter Dickinson stated that the Western media was "[[enabling]]" Russian aggression against Ukraine.<ref name=AC160803/> He called it "absurd" that Western media described a foreigner who had arrived from Russia to fight against Ukraine, such as [[Arsen Pavlov]], as a "pro-Russian separatist" and stated that the media was "creating the impression of a Russia-leaning local who was defending his democratic rights."<ref name=AC161021/>

Russia's actions were described as [[terrorism]] by [[Alexander J.

There is no fratricidal conflict in the east among Ukrainians, nor is there much support for any kind of secessionist movement in the Donbas."<ref name=Bonner150209/> [[Anne Applebaum]], in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', also questioned the use of "civil war", describing the war in eastern Ukraine as "an artificial conflict, run by Russian security and enhanced by a sophisticated pan-European [[disinformation]] campaign."<ref name=WP150208/> Criticizing the term's use in German media, Reichelt wrote that it "comes straight out of Putin's propaganda machine, which frames the war as a national issue rather than an act of aggression. Calling it a [civil war] is an insult to the people who are being attacked, to our readers, and to our profession."<ref name=PEU150427/>

== Public reactions and social media ==
According to an April 2014 poll by the [[Razumkov Centre]] in Ukraine, the Russian media was trusted by 12.7% of respondents, the western media by 40.4%, and the Ukrainian media by 61.5%.<ref name=PRUA140519/> After a survey conducted from 5–13 September 2014, the [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]] reported 5% of Ukrainians had a "great deal" or "fair amount" of confidence in the Russian media, 42% in the Western media, and 67% in media based in Ukraine.<ref name=IFES-Sept2014/>

The Russian media had more influence in parts of [[Donbass]].<ref name=Politico150104/><ref name=Reut141114/> Having spoken to anti-Kiev protesters in [[Donetsk]] in March 2014, Lucian Kim of [[Reuters]] said, "In my 20 years as a journalist, I had never experienced such hostility – especially from a group that was supposedly facing persecution. ... Besides a few stock phrases about a "referendum" and "the illegitimate Kiev junta," I also got no answers as to their motivations.

A controversy developed over some reactions by the public to the media's coverage. In March 2014, the Polish version of ''[[Newsweek]]'' expressed suspicion that Russia was employing people to "bombard" its website with pro-Russian comments on Ukraine-related articles.<ref name=NWPL140304/> Poland's governmental [[computer emergency response team]] later confirmed that pro-Russia commentary had "flooded" Polish internet portals at the start of the Ukrainian crisis.<ref name=JT150429/> In May 2014, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted a large number of pro-Kremlin comments on news articles relating to Ukraine, which the newspaper believed was an "orchestrated pro-Kremlin campaign".<ref name=gn140504/> ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', and [[Reuters]] reported that German-language media websites had been "flooded" with pro-Russia comments since March 2014.<ref name=Spiegel140530/><ref name=SDZ140613/><ref name=NZZ140629/><ref name=Reut141125/> ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'', ''[[BuzzFeed]]'', ''[[Yle]]'', ''[[:ru:Мой район (газета)|Moi Raion]]'', [[Agence France-Presse]], [[Associated Press]], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and others reported on allegations that a Russian company, the [[Internet Research Agency]], employed hundreds of workers to write comments in both Russian and western news sites.<ref name=BF140602/><ref name=Spiegel150601/><ref name=PaidComm/><ref name=AFP150405/><ref name=NYT150602/> Dubbed a "troll factory/house/farm" by the media,<ref name=Spiegel150601/><ref name=NYT150602/> it operates out of a building on Savushkin Street in [[Saint Petersburg]], following a move from the outskirts of the city.<ref name=AFP150405/> The agency may also have a location in Moscow.<ref name=Spiegel150601/> Jürg Vollmer of ''Watson.ch'' reported that Putin had developed the company since 2011 to "systematically manipulate public opinion on the Internet."<ref name=Watson140622/> Ilya Klishin of ''[[Dozhd]]'' said his sources suggested that Russian expats in Germany, India, and Thailand were also involved.<ref name=MT140521/> Russian blogger Anton Nosik said in August 2014 that "Comments were already serving as a well-financed Kremlin instrument of war against the opposition, even five years ago ...

A poll conducted in December 2014 found that 63% of Germans have "little or no trust" in the coverage by German media of the Ukrainian conflict. This is compared to 53% for the coverage of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] and 40% for coverage about the recent [[Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer#2014 strikes|strike of German locomotive drivers]]. When respondents who said that they do not trust German media when it comes to Ukraine were asked why they have mistrust, 31% gave the reason as "coverage is one-sided/not objective", 18% said that "the coverage does not correspond to reality", and 9% said "the coverage is imprecise/not sufficiently comprehensive".<ref>{{cite news|title=ZAPP Studie: Vertrauen in Medien ist gesunken |trans-title=ZAPF study: Trust in media has sunk |language=German |newspaper=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] |date=17 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url=http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/zapp/ZAPP-Studie-Vertrauen-in-Medien-gesunken,medienkritik100.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225231734/http://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/zapp/ZAPP-Studie-Vertrauen-in-Medien-gesunken%2Cmedienkritik100.html |archivedate=25 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Vertrauen in Medien-Berichterstattung über den Ukraine-Konflikt |trans-title=Trust in media coverage of the conflict in Ukraine |language=German |publisher=ZAPP |date=16 December 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url=https://www.tagesschau.de/kultur/zapp-umfrage-101.pdf }}</ref>

In May 2016, the Ukrainian hacker website [[Myrotvorets]], which is curated by [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] and Ukrainian authorities, published a list of journalists who received press accreditation in [[Donetsk People's Republic]] in order to cover war on both sides; the journalists have been labeled as "collaborators with terrorists". Since the publication, a number of these journalists (including [[Hromadske.TV]] reporter Yekaterina Sergatskova and freelance journalist Roman Stepanovich) received death threats in emails and phone calls. The data publication was condemned by David Weisbrot, the chair of the Australian Press Council, as well as G7 ambassadors to Kiev and an international group of journalists, including the BBC, The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and The Economist.<ref name=DB161205/><ref name=WP161205/>
