The '''Jigüey Dam''' is an [[arch-gravity dam]] on the [[Nizao River]] about {{Convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic|San Cristóbal]] in [[San Cristóbal Province]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]. At {{Convert|110.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, it is the third highest dam in the country. The purpose of the dam is to produce [[hydroelectric]] power and it supplies the largest hydroelectric power station in the country. The dam diverts water through over {{Convert|4.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} of headrace pipe and [[penstock]] to the power station downstream. The power station contains two 49 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generators for an installed capacity of 98 MW. The dam was completed and its power station was commissioned 1992. It cost US$500 million to build and funding was provided by the host government.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arqhys.com/construccion/presa-jiguey.html | title=Presa Jiguey | publisher=Arqhys Architecture | accessdate=24 April 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ansaldoksa.com/Data/Jeddah22072006/Reference%20List%2020067.pdf | title=Reference List | publisher=Ansaldoksa | accessdate=24 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424032959/http://ansaldoksa.com/Data/Jeddah22072006/Reference%20List%2020067.pdf | archivedate=24 April 2014 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hidroelectrica.gob.do/Central.aspx?IDCentral=16 | publisher=Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company | accessdate=24 April 2014 | title=Data Plant: Jiguey | language=Spanish}}</ref>
