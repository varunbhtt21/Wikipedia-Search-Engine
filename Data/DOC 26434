The '''Starmus International Festival''' is an international gathering focused on celebrating astronomy, space exploration, music, art, and allied sciences such as biology and chemistry. It was founded by [[Garik Israelian]], an astronomer at the Institute for Astrophysics in [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]].

The Festival has featured [[Buzz Aldrin]], [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Alexei Leonov]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[Brian May]], [[Jill Tarter]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[Rick Wakeman]] among others.

== History ==
[[File:Starmus V festival announced.jpg|thumb|Starmus V festival announced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starmus V — Star-studded Line Up for 2019|url=https://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann18011/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>]]
In 2007 Brian May, founding guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], completed his PhD dissertation, which was left unfinished in 1974 when Queen began to achieve significant success. May's work focused on zodiacal dust in the solar system. He had studied at [[Tenerife]] earlier through [[Imperial College]] in London, and resumed work there more than 30 years later. In 2007, his new co-advisor was [[Garik Israelian]], and the two struck up a friendship, Israelian also being a musician. This led to the founding of the Starmus Festival — the name paying homage to stars and music — and the stage was set for the first Festival, which would occur four years later.

== Concept ==
The festival has occurred in 2011, 2014 and 2016 in Tenerife, Spain. The fourth Starmus festival was held in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]] from June 18 to 23, 2017, under the title 'Life And The Universe'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Head to a property in Spain for the Starmus festival|url=http://www.rightmove.co.uk/overseas-magazine/head-to-a-property-in-spain-for-the-starmus-festival|website=rightmove overseas|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref><ref name="astronomy">{{cite web|url=http://cs.astronomy.com/asy/b/daves-universe/archive/2015/04/28/starmus-festival-announced-for-summer-2016-in-tenerife.aspx|title=Starmus Festival announced for summer 2016 in Tenerife - Astronomy Magazine - Interactive Star Charts, Planets, Meteors, Comets, Telescopes|publisher=cs.astronomy.com|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>

The festival is described as an event where "the greatest minds in space exploration, astronomy, cosmology, and planetary science get together for a week of incredible talks, sharing of information, and appreciation of the knowledge we have of space and the universe."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eicher|first1=David|title=Starmus Festival planned for September!|url=http://cs.astronomy.com/asy/b/daves-universe/archive/2014/01/30/starmus-festival-planned-for-september.aspx|website=Astronomy Magazine|publisher=Kalmbach Publishing Co|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>

== 2011 Starmus Festival, “Starmus I”  ==

The first Starmus Festival took place June 20–25, 2011, on Tenerife, and La Palma, Canary Islands. The primary site of the event was the Ritz-Carlton Abama Hotel in Tenerife. The theme was “50 Years of Man in Space,” and featured as speakers a blend of astronaut-explorers, astronomers, biologists, chemists, and artists. The Festival presented the rare opportunity for delegates, as the attendees were called, to share time, speak with, share refreshments, and converse with the speakers. Events generally began in the afternoon through the early evening, so that delegates had plenty of time to also enjoy the volcanic beauty of the islands, which featured beaches, geological wonders, and — on La Palma — the largest optical telescope in the world, the 14.2-m Gran Telescopio Canarias, as well as other instruments. About 300 people attended Starmus I.

The talks were many: Neil Armstrong talked about Starmus and our future on Earth; Buzz Aldrin spoke about possible future missions to Mars; Alexei Leonov described the early days of the Soviet space program and his historic first spacewalk; Brian May asked about future human exploration in space and whether humans should first clean up their act here on Earth.
Further exploring themes of space exploration, Cosmonaut [[Viktor Gorbatko]] recalled early Soviet missions; [[Apollo 8]] astronaut [[Bill Anders]] related details of the early American space program; [[Apollo 13]] astronaut Jim Lovell described the harrowing mission he endured returning that crippled spacecraft to Earth; and [[Apollo 16]] astronaut [[Charlie Duke]] described his adventures in the Apollo program.

Covering themes of life in the universe, Nobel Prize winning chemist [[Jack Szostak]] outlined the origin of life on Earth; Richard Dawkins described evolution and exobiology; astronomer [[Michel Mayor]] recalled extrasolar planets including his own first discovery; and Jill Tarter explored extraterrestrial intelligence in the universe.

Astrophysics and cosmology received straight coverage in a variety of talks, as with descriptions of supernovae and gamma ray bursts by astrophysicist [[Adam Burrows]]; the acoustic nature of the universe by Garik Israelian; black holes by astrophysicist Kip Thorne; the creation of the universe by cosmologist [[Joseph Silk]]; cosmic signals from the beginning by cosmologist [[George Smoot]]; and five cosmic breakthroughs of the past 50 years by astronomer [[Robert Williams (astronomer)|Robert Williams]].

Talks involving technology were also given, as with technologist Rich Goldman's description of the relationship between space exploration and technology; physicist [[Sami Solanki]]’s exploration of whether the Sun is causing global warming; and astronomer Leslie Sage’s description of how astronomy has changed what it means to be human.

Finally, several talks focused on the new era of spacefarers, with cosmonaut [[Sergei Zhukov (cosmonaut)|Sergei Zhukov]]’s presentation on the future of Russian space exploration; Swiss astronaut [[Claude Nicollier]]’s recollections of orbiting on the space shuttle; and cosmonaut [[Yuri Baturin]]’s plea for space explorers to help to change Earth and its inhabitants for the better.

The event also highlighted a “108 Minute Round Table Discussion” with several of the speakers, seated underneath the 10.4-meter [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]], in homage to the length of the first space mission, flown by [[Yuri Gagarin]].

Starmus I also featured a spectacular concert event featuring Edgar [[Froese]] and [[Tangerine Dream]], along with Brian May who joined the concert for several songs. The show was recorded.

An astrophotography competition was opened for astronomy enthusiasts, and Alex Cherney won the prize, on the [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]] to make an image with the world's largest optical telescope.

In 2014, Canopus Publishing Ltd. produced a book consisting of the transcripts of the Starmus talks, numerous illustrations, and other materials. Titled “''Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space'',” the volume featured a foreword by Stephen Hawking. Editors in Chief Garik Israelian and Brian May were assisted in the book's production by Executive Editor [[David J. Eicher]]  and by Editorial Director Robin Rees. The volume was dedicated to Alexei Leonov and to Neil Armstrong, who died a year after the Festival took place but before the book was released.<ref name="prnewswire">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/starmus-festival-and-stephen-hawking-launch-the-book-starmus-50-years-of-man-in-space-274263251.html|title=Starmus Festival and Stephen Hawking Launch the Book 'Starmus, 50... -- TENERIFE, Spain, September 7, 2014 /PR Newswire UK/ --|publisher=prnewswire.co.uk|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>

== 2014 Starmus Festival, “Starmus II” ==
The second Starmus Festival occurred September 22–27, 2014, again on Tenerife, and La Palma, Canary Islands. This time the theme was “Beginnings: The Making of the Modern Cosmos.” Again, the primary site of the event was the Ritz-Carlton Abama Hotel in Tenerife.

This time aided by greater publicity, the number of Starmus delegates swelled to nearly 1,000. Talks at Starmus II included Nobel Prize winning astronomer Robert Wilson describing his joint discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation; ''[[Astronomy Magazine]]'' Editor in Chief [[David J. Eicher]] asking whether the revolution in factual knowledge about the universe is being swamped by sci-fi and entertainment nonsense; Alexei Leonov speaking to the crowd about his space exploration experiences; and Richard Dawkins outlining what potential alien life forms might be like.

Talks also included an address by Brian May on stereo imaging of astronomical objects, with 3D glasses; and Stephen Hawking lecturing on the origin of the universe. Nobel Prize winning astrophysicist John Mather then foreshadowed science to come with the James Webb Space Telescope. The audience then screened a film, [[51 Degrees North]], with words by the film's director, [[Grigorij Richters]], who received musical contributions by May in the film. Hawking later delivered a second lecture on black holes.

More presentations followed, with Apollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke describing his scientific procedures on the lunar surface during the mission; Nobel Prize winning chemist Harry Kroto then described his career and development of carbon nanochemistry; and [[Apollo 7]] astronaut [[Walt Cunningham]] wondered about the future of exploration and the lack of a risk-taking, adventurous culture in the current world.

As with Starmus I, Starmus II also highlighted a “108 Minute Round Table Discussion” with several of the speakers, seated underneath the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias, in homage to the length of the first space mission, flown by [[Yuri Gagarin]].

The second Starmus also featured a Sonic Universe Concert, this time featuring Rick Wakeman, celebrated for his years in the rock band Yes, and his current band. They were joined for several songs by Brian May, and again the whole performance was recorded.

A final celebration occurred as a tribute to Alexei Leonov, and featured Leonov writing and explaining some of his work on a large auditorium chalkboard. Moreover, the event also featured musical contributions by Cypriot soprano Katerina Mina and Greek composer and musician Alexandros Hahalis.

== 2016 Starmus Festival, “Starmus III” ==
The third STARMUS festival took place in 2016 in the Canary Islands, on Tenerife and La Palma from June 27 to July 2. The theme of the third festival was: Beyond The Horizon: A Tribute To Stephen Hawking.

As was the case with the previous two festivals, the third STARMUS festival grew in attendance with over 1200 delegates attending. The festival was not lacking presenters either; STARMUS III featured the most high-profile scientists and science communicators in the world, including: [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[Roger Penrose]], [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Brian Greene]], [[Kip Thorne]], [[Garik Israelian]], [[Martin Rees]], [[Chris Hadfield]], [[Alexei Leonov]], [[Rusty Schweickart]], [[Jill Tarter]], [[Carolyn Porco]], and Joel Parker.

== Sonic Universe Concerts ==
Open to the general public at large as well as the Starmus Festival delegates, the two Sonic Universe Concerts were held at the Magma Arte & Congresos, an arena in Tenerife. The first concert in 2011 featured Edgar Froese and Tangerine Dream, along with Brian May. Their performance was recorded and produced into a CD entitled "Starmus - Sonic Universe" in 2011 and is the only album to highlight both Tangerine Dream and Brian May.<ref name="brianmay">{{cite web|url=http://brianmay.com/brian/briannews/briannewsmar13.html|title=Brian News - March 2013|publisher=brianmay.com|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> The second concert in 2014 featured Rick Wakeman and his band, accompanied by May. Progressive rock band [[Nosound]] also performed in 2014 at Starmus II, with this show recorded and produced into a CD/DVD set entitled "''[[Teide 2390]]''".<ref name="kscopemusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/2015/02/19/nosound-concert-film-starmus-astronomy-festival/|title=http://www.kscopemusic.com/2015/02/19/nosound-concert-film-starmus-astronomy-festival/|publisher=kscopemusic.com|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> The Starmus II performance was special as it is the band's first full, live, recorded album.

== Star Party ==
Each of the first two Starmus Festivals featured a star party with many participants traveling to the summit of Mt. Teide on Tenerife for dark sky observing. In addition to observing a variety of deep-sky objects with an array of telescopes, participants were entertained by the Italian progressive rock band Nosound.

== Astrophotography School ==
The 2014 Starmus featured a small astrophotography school for enthusiasts who wanted to learn about imaging the sky and also have access to one of the darkest skies on Earth with their own equipment. For three days following the main Festival, September 28–30, 2014, participants stayed at the observatories on Mt. Teide on Tenerife, and seminars took place featuring noted astroimagers Damian Peach and Rogelio Bernal Andreo, along with Astronomy Magazine Editor in Chief [[David J. Eicher]].

==Books and DVDs==
In 2014 Starmus published its first book: ''Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space''. An ambitious series of talks, articles and recollections assembled to celebrate the human exploration of space. It is the result of the unique Starmus meeting in 2011 on Tenerife, where the legendary Russian and American pioneers of the space age met up for the first time to share the moments that electrified the human race. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Bill Anders, Yuri Baturin, Charlie Duke, Victor Gorbatko, Alexei Leonov, Jim Lovell, Claude Nicollier, and Sergei Zhukov tell their personal stories about the first space walk, the lunar landing, the heroic recovery of Apollo 13, the repair of the Hubble Space Telescope, and much more.

In 2016 Starmus published its second book: ''Origins of the Cosmos''. Edited by Garik Israelian and Brian May, the book synthesizes our current view of the universe. Written in a style that is understandable to anyone who is interested in these matters, it includes contributions from many prominent figures of the science world, including Alexei Leonov, Walt Cunningham, Richard Dawkins, David Eicher, John Ellis, Katerina Harvati, Stephen Hawking, Harry Kroto, Mark Boslough, John Mather, and Robert Wilson.

In 2014 Rick Wakeman released a DVD called ''Rick Wakeman and Brian May – Starmus 2014''. Rick Wakeman has made several appearances at Starmus. The DVD was recorded at the second Starmus festival in 2014 where he was joined on stage by Brian May, the guitarist from Queen.
