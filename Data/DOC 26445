'''Spoilum''' (active 1765–1805; Chinese name: '''Guan Zuolin''') was a Chinese artist active in [[Guangzhou]] between 1785 and 1810, during the [[Old China Trade]]. He painted portraits of Chinese and Western merchants and sea captains in the Western style painting with oil on canvas rather than ink on paper or silk in the Chinese style.<ref>{{cite journal
