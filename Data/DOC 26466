The '''Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement''' (EDCA) is an agreement between the [[United States]] and the [[Philippines]] intended to bolster the [[Philippines–United States relations|U.S.–Philippine alliance]].  The agreement allows the United States to rotate troops into the Philippines for extended stays and allows the U.S. to build and operate facilities on Philippine bases, for both American and Philippine forces.<ref name=InqDec2015>{{cite news|last1=Dizon|first1=Nikko|title=Filipinos asked: Who do you want on your side?|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/133741/filipinos-asked-who-do-you-want-on-your-side|accessdate=December 13, 2015|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=December 13, 2015}}</ref>  The US is not allowed to establish any permanent [[military base]]s.<ref name=PhDFA />  It also gives Philippine personnel access to American ships and planes.<ref name=InqDec2015 />

Evan Medeiros, the [[U.S. National Security Council]]’s senior director for Asian affairs was quoted in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' as saying, "This is the most significant defense agreement that we have concluded with the Philippines in decades."<ref name=EilperinWAPost>Juliet Eilperin, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/us-philippines-to-sign-10-year-defense-agreement-amid-rising-tensions/2014/04/27/a04436c0-cddf-11e3-a75e-463587891b57_story.html "U.S., Philippines to sign 10-year defense agreement amid rising tensions"] ''The Washington Post'', April 28, 2014</ref>

==Background==
{{History of the Philippines}}
For more than a century, the Philippines has been important to American defense strategy. Currently, the Philippines is a "[[major non-NATO ally]]" of the United States.<ref name=EilperinWAPost />

The U.S. acquired the Philippines from Spain after the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 and then fought the [[Philippine–American War]] against [[Philippine revolution]]aries to secure their rule. After both wars, the Philippines was [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|a territory of the United States from 1898 to 1946]]. The United States granted the [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Philippines independence]] in 1946.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/phtoc.html "Philippines: A Country Study"] Federal Research Division, U.S. Library of Congress</ref>

The [[Mutual Defense Treaty]] was signed in 1951 and ratified in 1952 by the governments of the United States and the Philippines. The purpose of the Treaty was to "strengthen the fabric of peace" in the Pacific, by formally adopting an agreement to defend each other's territory in the case of external attack.<ref>The Avalon Project, [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/phil001.asp "Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of the Philippines; August 30, 1951"] Yale Law School, Lillian Goldman Law Library</ref> In line with this treaty, the United States maintained several military bases in the Philippines, including [[Subic Bay Naval Base]] and the [[Clark Air Base]]. In 1992, the bases closed after the [[Philippine Senate]] rejected, by a close vote, a treaty that would have extended the bases' lease. The treaty was rejected because of U.S. reluctance to set a firm time frame for troop withdrawal and to guarantee that no nuclear weapons would pass through the base.<ref>David E. Sanger, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/28/world/philippines-orders-us-to-leave-strategic-navy-base-at-subic-bay.html "Philippines Orders U.S. to Leave Strategic Navy Base at Subic Bay"] ''The New York Times'', December 28, 1991</ref>

The [[Philippines–United States Visiting Forces Agreement]] (VFA) was signed by the governments of the Philippines and the United States in 1998, and came into effect in 1999. This was the first military agreement since the closing of U.S. bases in 1992. The VFA outlined a set of guidelines for the conduct and protection of American troops visiting the Philippines. The Agreement also stipulated the terms and conditions for American military to pass through or land in Philippine territory. The VFA is a reciprocal agreement in that not only does it outline the guidelines for U.S. troops visiting the Philippines but also for Philippine troops visiting the United States.<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/107852.pdf "Visiting Forces Agreement"] U.S. Department of State, 1998</ref>

The signing of the VFA led to the establishment of annual bilateral [[military exercises]] between the U.S. and the Philippine known as [[Balikatan]], as well as a variety of other cooperative measures.<ref>[http://www.vfacom.ph/content/article/FAQs "Frequently Asked Questions: Visiting Forces Agreement"] Presidential Commission on the Visiting Forces Agreement</ref> The [[Balikatan]] training exercises ("shoulder-to-shoulder") are annual military exercises between the U.S. and the Philippines. They are structured to maintain and develop the security relationship between the two countries' armed forces through crisis-action planning, enhanced training to conduct [[counterterrorism]] operations, and promoting interoperability of the forces.<ref name="autogeneratedmil">Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo, [http://www.afp.mil.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=113%3Aph-us-balikatan-exercises-to-start-in-may&catid=8&Itemid=481 "PH-US Balikatan Exercises to Start in May"] Armed Forces of the Philippine, April 21, 2014</ref>

Over the years the exercises have expanded to include other surrounding countries in [[Southeast Asia]]. The trainings have also had a shifting focus. During the U.S.-led "[[War on Terror]]" the annual Balikatan Exercises focused on training for counterterrorism missions.<ref name="autogeneratedmil"/> There has been some controversy over these exercises; a growing number of Philippine people are angry over the continued presence of U.S. troops in the Philippines.<ref>Sandy Araneta, [http://www.philstar.com/headlines/797438/student-activists-protesting-balikatan-deface-us-embassy-seal "Student activists protesting Balikatan deface US embassy seal"] ''The Philippine Star'', April 17, 2012</ref>

[[File:US marines Typhoon Haiyan relief.jpg|thumb|US Marines assist in Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts, November 2013]]

Disaster relief and crisis response has since become an important focus of the U.S.–Philippine security relationship especially following [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda)]], and is a key impetus of the EDCA agreement.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The [[United States Marines]] were among the first to arrive in the Philippines after the devastating [[typhoon]] hit the Philippines on November 8, 2013. At the immediate request of the [[Philippine government]], U.S. and international relief agencies arrived three days after the storm to provide aid and assistance to the thousands of injured and homeless.<ref>Marine Corps Staff Sgt.

==Summary of the agreement==
According to Ambassador Goldberg, the goal of the EDCA is to "promote peace and security in the region." While outlining new defense-cooperation measures, the agreement also allows for the United States to respond more quickly to environmental and humanitarian disasters in the region.<ref>Ankit Panda, [http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/us-philippines-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-bolsters-pivot-to-asia/ "US-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement Bolsters 'Pivot to Asia'"] ''The Diplomat'', April 29, 2014</ref>

Designed to supplement the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement, the EDCA reaffirms mutual cooperation between the United States and the Philippines to develop their individual and collective capacities to resist armed attack by: improving interoperability of the two country's armed forces, promoting long-term modernization, helping maintain and develop maritime security, and expanding humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.gov.ph/2014/04/29/document-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/ "Document: Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement"] ''Official Gazette'', April 29, 2014</ref>

The agreement allows for U.S. forces and contractors to operate out of "agreed locations," which are defined as: "facilities and areas that are provided by the Government of the Philippines through the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) and that United States forces, United States contractors, and others as mutually agreed".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The Agreement hands over all operational controls of these "Agreed Locations" to the United States, and allows U.S. forces to preposition and store defense materiel, equipment, and supplies. The Agreement makes clear that this materiel cannot include nuclear weapons.

The EDCA is effective for an initial period of ten years, and thereafter, it shall continue in force automatically unless terminated by either Party by giving one year's written notice through diplomatic channels of its intention to terminate the agreement (Article XII, Sec. 4 of EDCA). While the US forces may exercise operational control, put troops and equipment, construct facilities, and be accommodated in certain agreed locations, the Philippines shall still retain ownership of the agreed locations (Article V, Sec. 1 of EDCA). Importantly, the United States is not allowed to establish any permanent military bases, and must hand over any and all facilities in the "agreed locations" to the Philippine government upon the termination of the agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ph/2014/04/28/qna-on-the-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/ |title=Q&A on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=April 28, 2014 |website=gov.ph |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)]] |access-date= |quote=''Official Gazette''}}</ref>

The agreement also stipulates that the U.S. is not allowed to store or position any nuclear weapons on Philippine territory.<ref name=PhDFA>Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, [http://www.gov.ph/2014/04/28/qna-on-the-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/ "Q&A on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement"] ''Official Gazette'', April 28, 2014</ref>

===Agreed locations===
In April 2015, the United States Government asked for access to eight bases in the Philippines, including the formerly American [[Subic Bay Naval Base]] and [[Clark Air Base]], as well as bases on [[Cebu]], [[Luzon]], and [[Palawan]].<ref name=SMH2015>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |agency=Reuters |title=US seeks access to Philippine bases as part of Asia pivot |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/us-seeks-access-to-philippine-bases-as-part-of-asia-pivot-20150425-1mt29i.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |location=Australia |date=April 25, 2015 |access-date=May 5, 2015 }}</ref>

On March 19, 2016, the Philippines and the United States government agreed on the 5 locations of military bases for the American troops under the EDCA: [[Antonio Bautista Air Base]] ([[Palawan]]), [[Basa Air Base]] ([[Pampanga]]), [[Fort Magsaysay]] ([[Nueva Ecija]]), [[Lumbia Airport]] ([[Cagayan de Oro]]),  [[Mactan Air Base|Benito Ebuen Air Base]]  ([[Mactan]], [[Cebu]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/03/20/1564662/us-philippines-agree-5-base-locations-under-edca|title=US, Philippines agree on 5 base locations under EDCA|newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=March 20, 2016|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref>

==Implementation==
In January 2019 the United States and the Philippines officially completed the first major project under the EDCA at [[Cesar Basa Air Base]] in [[Pampanga]] province, north of Manila. The United States and the Philippine government are working on future EDCA projects at four other locations - [[Fort Magsaysay]] Military Reservation in [[Nueva Ecija]] province north of Manila, [[Lumbia Air Base]] in [[Cagayan de Oro]] province in the southern Philippines, [[Antonio Bautista Air Base]] in [[Puerto Princesa]] in [[Palawan]], and [[Mactan Benito Ebuen Air Base]] in [[Cebu]] province.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-01/30/c_137787684.htm|title=Philippines, U.S. eye 4 more projects under Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement|date=January 30, 2019|publisher=xinhuanet.com}}</ref>
