*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] QPQ done. Article moved from user space on 3rd May. So its new. Its quite long enough than our minimum criteria. Its well written and cited. The hook is referenced and luckily found that book too. Am AGFing on other offline sources used in the article. The image is freely licensed and good for use. It also is quite different than the usual images of gods that we promote in religious hooks. Interesting article! Good to go. §§[[User:Dharmadhyaksha|<font color = "red" >Dharmadhyaksha</font>]]§§ {[[User talk:Dharmadhyaksha|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/Dharmadhyaksha|C]]} 07:39, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
