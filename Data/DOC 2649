The '''Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament''' is the conference tournament for the [[Big Ten Conference]]. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic berth into the [[NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA Tournament]].

The tournament was first held in [[2014 Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2014]], the first year of conference play; the first four tournaments alternated  between the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] and [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].<ref name=NCAA>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Big Ten announces tournament sites |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/icehockey-men/article/2012-04-19/big-ten-announces-tournament-sites |location=Park Ridge, Illinois |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |agency= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727092241/http://www.ncaa.com/news/icehockey-men/article/2012-04-19/big-ten-announces-tournament-sites |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |date=April 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> Starting with the [[2018 Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2018]] tournament, the format switched to a playoff-style format, and no longer use neutral sites.

==Format==
===2014–2017===
All six Big Ten teams participated in the [[single-elimination tournament]], which was held over three days at one host site.<ref name=B1Gpress>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Big Ten Announces Conference Schedule for Inaugural Season of Men's Ice Hockey |url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-hockey/spec-rel/050813aaa.html |location= |publisher=[[Big Ten Conference]] |agency= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609050947/http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-hockey/spec-rel/050813aaa.html |archivedate=June 9, 2013 |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Teams were seeded by the regular season conference standings. In the quarterfinals on Thursday, No. 3 played No. 6 and No. 4 played No. 5. On Friday, No. 2 played the winner of the first game and No. 1 played the winner of the second game (the teams are not [[reseeding|reseeded]]). The two semifinal winners played each other on Saturday in the final.<ref name=Jovenitti>{{cite news|last=Jovenitti|first=Tony|title=Big Ten Tournament Preview|url=http://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2014/03/19_big_ten_tournament_preview.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329015042/http://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2014/03/19_big_ten_tournament_preview.php|archivedate=29 March 2014|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=College Hockey News|date=19 March 2014|author2=Jashvina Shah}}</ref>

===  2018–present ===
Due to the poor attendance of the neutral site tournaments, and the addition of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey|Notre Dame]] as a seventh Big Ten team in hockey, a new format was introduced in 2018. The No. 1 team in the regular season conference standings automatically advances to the conference semifinals, while the remaining teams are seeded into best-of-three quarterfinals to determine the three remaining teams. The remainder of the playoff is single-elimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-hockey/spec-rel/050417aaa.html|title=Big Ten Announces Conference Schedule for 2017-18 Hockey Season|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=[[Big Ten Conference]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="sbnation-oncampus"/><ref name="startrib-newbig10format"/>

All games are held at the home arena of the team with the higher seed, rather than a neutral site. In order to reduce the likelihood of scheduling conflicts at team venues, the semifinals and championship are played as single games (in contrast to other conference tournaments).<ref name="sbnation-oncampus">{{cite web|url=https://www.sbncollegehockey.com/2016/9/30/13125088/big-ten-officially-approves-on-campus-playoffs|title=Big Ten Officially Approves On-Campus Playoffs|last=Dilks|first=Chris|date=September 30, 2016|website=[[SB Nation]]|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="startrib-newbig10format">{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/big-ten-hockey-in-process-of-approving-new-on-campus-playoff-format/380295071/|title=Big Ten hockey in process of approving new on-campus playoff format|last=Gonzalez|first=Jason|date=May 20, 2016|website=[[Star Tribune]]|accessdate=20 June 2017}}</ref>
