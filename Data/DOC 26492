:({{Find sources|Jerome C. Glenn}})
Problematic article, heavily edited by COI editors, still containing some flattery (cited as an expert on Future studies methodology by RAND Corporation) sourced to dead links. None of that is a reason for deletion of course. However, notability is claimed, but not supported by facts. 1/ Director of [[The Millennium Project]] (itself tagged for notability for more than a year) does not seem to be a notable position. 2/ Being a faculty member at a non-accredited university ([[Singularity University]]), does not meet [[WP:PROF]]. 3/Author of reports and articles in itself is not sufficient for notability. [[Web of Science]] lists 51 articles for "Glenn JC", cited 206 times in total, for an [[h-index]] of 8. Worse, the 4 highest-cited articles seem to be by someone with the same name, but publishing in medicine. That leaves the highest-cited article with 13 citations in total and this "Glenn JC" and an h-index of 3. As so often, Google Scholar [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=1&q=%22Jerome+C.+Glenn%22&hl=en&as_sdt=1,5 gives higher citation rates], with 251 hits for ''State of the Future''. However, looking at those hits many of them (especially in later pages) are from websites, not from academic publications. The second-highest cited article only gets 41 hits. 4/ The article claims 2 honorary doctorates and 1 honorary professorship. If these would be at reputable universities, that might show notability, but unfortunately, if I Google "Jerome C. Glenn" I get WP, Facebook, his organization, etc, but not these honors. His bio at his organization's website lists Universidad Ricardo Palma and Universidad Franz Tamayo as the places that bestowed these honors on him, which I find less than overwhelming (even i this could be verified). 5/ The article claims that he "has keynoted over 200 organizations around the world". After 1-4, I start having problems believing this, I must admit. In sum, this BLP clearly fails [[WP:ACADEMIC]] and neither is there any evidence that it meets [[WP:GNG]]. Hence: '''Delete'''.

*'''Delete''' for reasons given amply above. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 22:45, 3 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Delete'''. The ''State of the Future'' reports have reasonably high citation counts on Google scholar, but I think any notability there goes to the Millenium Project rather than him personally. And there seems to be nothing else of note; in particular I don't see the evidence for [[WP:PROF]] nor [[WP:GNG]]. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 23:01, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' Nothing found that could qualify it for [[WP:GNG]], no links to any of the 200 organisations does damage its credibility as well. [[User:Amortias|Amortias]] ([[User talk:Amortias|T]])([[Special:Contributions/Amortias|C]]) 23:48, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
