'''Arthur Adel''' (November 22, 1908 – September 13, 1994) was an American [[astronomer]] and [[astrophysicist]]. His research focused on atmospheric [[spectrography]]. He worked at [[Lowell Observatory]] and was for many years a professor at what is now [[Northern Arizona University]], both in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]].

== Early life and education ==
Adel was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name="aas">{{cite journal |author=Richard L.

He worked as a [[machinist]] for a year before attending the [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor, where he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 1931 and in 1933 a PhD with a dissertation on "The Infrared Spectrum and the Structure of the Carbon Dioxide Molecule".<ref name="aas"/><ref name=biodic/>

== Career ==
Beginning in 1933, he did research at the Lowell Observatory, demonstrating that the harmonics of the vibration of methane and ammonia molecules gave rise to the absorption bands observed in planetary atmospheres, and later publishing extensively on the water-vapor-related parameters in Earth's atmosphere.<ref name="aas"/> In 1935–36 he was a postdoctoral research fellow at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. During World War II, he worked for the US Navy in Washington, DC, [[de-gaussing]] submarines,<ref name=biodic/> and from 1942 to 1946 was a faculty member in physics at the University of Michigan. From 1946 to 1948 he was an assistant professor at the [[McMath–Hulbert Observatory|McMath-Hulbert Solar Observatory]], then operated by the university, while also studying the effective radiation temperature of the [[ozone layer]] for the US Air Force at a base in New Mexico.<ref name=biodic/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Spencer R.
