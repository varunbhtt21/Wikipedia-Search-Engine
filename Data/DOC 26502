Title : Enlist Weed Control System
Text : The '''Enlist Weed Control System''' is an [[agriculture|agricultural]] system that includes seeds for [[genetically modified crops]] that are resistant to Enlist (a broadleaf [[herbicide]] with two active agents,  [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[glyphosate]]) and the Enlist herbicide; spraying the herbicide will kill weeds but not the resulting crop.<ref name=reuters/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://farmprogress.com/story-usda-releases-draft-environmental-impact-statement-dows-enlist-13-106875| author= |title=USDA Releases Draft Environmental Impact Statement on Dow's Enlist|publisher=American Agriculturist| date=January 3, 2014 |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> The system was developed by [[Dow AgroSciences]], part of  [[Dow Chemical Company]].<ref name=reuters>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/us-agriculture-dow-enlist-insight-idUSBREA290HU20140310 |author=Carey Gilliam| title=As Dow seeks growth, new Enlist crop/chemicals seen as key| publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=March 10, 2014 |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> In October 2014 the system was registered for restricted use in  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://deltafarmpress.com/corn/enlist-duo-approved-six-states-restrictions|title = Enlist Duo approved in six states, with restrictions|last = |first = |date = October 15, 2014|work = Delta Farm Press|accessdate = October 17, 2014}}</ref> In 2013, the system was approved by Canada for the same uses.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www2.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/registration-enlist-duo|title = Registration of Enlist Duo|date = October 2014|accessdate = October 17, 2014|website = EPA|publisher = Environmental Protection Agency|last = EPA}}</ref>

The Enlist approach was developed to replace the "Roundup-Ready" system that was introduced in 1996 by [[Monsanto]] and which has become less useful with the rise of glyphosate-resistant weeds.<ref name=reuters/>

==''Enlist Duo''==
''Enlist Duo'' is an [[herbicide]] that contains the choline form of [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[glyphosate]] plus an unknown number of unlisted ingredients.  Dow added chemicals to the mixture in what it termed  "Colex-D technology".<ref name=farmfuture>{{cite web| url=http://farmfutures.com/story-epa-consider-comments-registration-enlist-duo-herbicide-0-111931| author= |title=EPA to Consider Comments on Registration of Enlist Duo Herbicide| publisher=Farm Futures| date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

==Enlist crops==
As of April 2014 maize and soybeans resistant to 2,4-D and glyphosate had been approved in Canada,<ref name=fleury/> and in September 2014 the [[USDA]] approved the same two crops.<ref name=wired>{{cite news|author1=Brandon Keim|title=New Generation of GM Crops Puts Agriculture in a 'Crisis Situation'|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/09/new-gm-crops/|accessdate=13 April 2015|work=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast.|date=25 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=ISAAAaad1>ISAAA GM Approval Database [http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gene/default.asp?GeneID=88&Gene=aad-1 GM Approval Database Genes List, Gene: aad1].

==Criticism==
2,4-D was one of the main ingredients of [[Agent Orange]], a defoliant used during the [[Vietnam War]] that was blamed for many health problems.<ref name=NPIC2>{{cite web|title=2,4-D General Fact Sheet|url=http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/24Dgen.html|publisher=National Pesticide Information Center|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> According to a Reuters article the main health problems arose from [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|dioxin]] contamination created in the synthesis of the other Agent Orange component, [[2,4,5-T]], not only from 2,4,-D.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/dow-biotech-idUSL1E9CIBN320130118|publisher=Reuters| title=Dow's Controversial New GMO Corn Delayed Amid Protests|year=2013}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has moved to rescind its approval due to conflicting claims from the manufacturer about synergistic effects from mixing the two herbicides. Dow had told the EPA that the combination of the two herbicides didn't enhance their toxicity to plants, but an earlier [[patent application]] from Dow claimed that it did.<ref name="NPR">{{cite news |first1=Dan |last1=Charles |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |title=Busted: EPA discovers DOW weedkiller claim; wants it off the market |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/11/25/457393114/busted-epa-discovers-dow-weedkiller-claim-wants-it-off-the-market |date=November 25, 2015 |accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref>
