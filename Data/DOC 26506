'''John Gawen''' (died 1418), of [[Norrington Manor|Norrington]], [[Wiltshire]], was an English politician. He was  the eldest son of John Gawen and Margaret  Jooe.

He was a [[Member of Parliament|Member]] (MP) of the [[Parliament of England]] for [[Wiltshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Wiltshire]] in 1394 and 1395.<ref>http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/gawen-john-1418</ref>

He built Norrington Manor in the late  1370s. He had the reputation of being an outstanding lawyer and  an efficient administrator  who served for many years as [[justice of the peace]]. He became one of the leading figures in the county, due largely  to his close association with [[John Waltham]],   [[ Bishop of Salisbury]], and later with John, 6th [[Baron Lovel]]. Both Waltham and Lovel were favourites of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], which no doubt contributed to Gawen's powerful local position. However the downfall of King Richard and his replacement by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]  did not affect Gawen's position: he remained a leading figure in his county until his death  in 1418..

He married twice: his family remained at Norrington until the seventeenth century.  The family were notable [[recusants]], and were ultimately forced to sell Norrington to pay the fines imposed for recusancy. [[John Gavan]] (died 1679), the Catholic martyr who was executed during the [[Popish Plot]], was probably descended form Gawen.
