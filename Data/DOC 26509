==Background==
More than 15,000 people have been killed in Nigeria over the last 15 years in this conflict. Most attacks involve religious motivation; typically stemming from [[Islamist insurgency in Nigeria|demands for Islamic Sharia law]] to replace [[constitution of Nigeria|supreme secular law]] of the [[Nigeria|Federal Republic of Nigeria]].  The group [[Boko Haram]] has been attributed to being behind the attacks. Since that group has little internal organization and is fragmented into factions<ref>http://www.economist.com/node/21528307</ref> these actions are generally not attributed to any specific group or leader.

==Attack==
A car with explosives inside of it drove up to a police checkpoint. Once the car arrived at the checkpoint, a man got out of the car and began running away as the car blew up. This caused smaller explosions to occur as other cars caught on fire and exploded. According to Frank Mba, the police superintendent, a total of six cars were blown up as a result of the car bomb. The attack happened near the area where a large [[April 2014 Nyanya bombing|bombing]] happened the month before.<ref>{{cite web|title=Death toll rises from car bomb in Nigerian capital Abuja|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/car-bomb-nigerian-capital-abuja|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>
