{{quote|You made contentment the chief rule of life,

Despising haughty wealth, O God-like Zenon.

With solemn look, and hoary brow serene,

You taught a manly doctrine; and didst found

By your deep wisdom, a great novel school,

Chaste parent of unfearing liberty.

And if your country was Phoenicia,

Why need we grieve, from that land Cadmus came,

Who gave to Greece her written books of wisdom.}}

==Dedications==
[[Chrysippus]] dedicated a two-book treatise on Proverbs to Zenodotus.<ref>[http://attalus.org/old/diogenes7d.html#200 ''The Lives of the Philosophers'' by Diogenes Laërtius. Book: Lives of Stoic Philosophers, Section 200]</ref>
