"Jhingur" in Hindi refers to an insect from Cricket family and is recognized by the noise it makes.
# '''Tippa Jharia''' : It is a local picnic spot where school children normally show up during onset or offset of Winter season. One can find lotus flowers blooming in the Tippa Jharia lake all the year round and locals consider that as nothing less than magic on spiritual levels. This lake is only about 2-3&nbsp;km from the Hanuman temple. This delicate ecosystem seems untouched by mankind however we should make all efforts to preserve this natural habitat and keep it clear and clean as it is an ecosystem as well.
