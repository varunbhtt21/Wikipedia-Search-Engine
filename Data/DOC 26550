Minor ISKCON creationist who published some books, but not enough to be notable via [[WP:AUTHOR]] and isn't otherwise notable for [[WP:BIO]]. [[User:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|jps]] ([[User talk:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|talk]]) 19:19, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Plenty of coverage in [[WP:RS]], and according to sources (both in the article and found on searching) the main figure articulating Hare Krishna views of science. Passes [[WP:GNG]]. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.1.194|101.117.1.194]] ([[User talk:101.117.1.194|talk]]) 00:58, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I said it in 2011 and I still feel the same way: I consider his views to be hogwash, but he was notable. Sources in the article demonstrate that.
