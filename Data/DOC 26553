==Biography==
In the mid 1740s, he and his brother [[Ivan Ivanovich Belsky|Ivan Ivanovich]] were enrolled at the "Канцелярия от строений" (Chancellory of Buildings), where they studied with [[Ivan Vishnyakov]], among others.<ref name="RDB" /> He painted murals, fresco panels and theatrical scenery for several  Imperial Palaces, as well as icons for [[St Andrew's Church, Kiev]]. In 1762, together with Ivan, he provided some paintings for the "Triumphal Arch", celebrating the coronation of [[Catherine the Great]].<ref name="RDB" />

In 1764, he was elected to the Academy. In 1771, a series of didactic murals he executed for the [[Smolny Institute]] (one of the [[Institute for Noble Maidens|Institutes for Noble Maidens]]) resulted in an award of what was then the immense sum of 70 Rubles. The following year, he achieved the rank of Master Painter. In 1773, he was presented with a charter of liberty from the Academy, granting him and his progeny freedom from the poll-tax, conscription, enserfment and other possible obligations.
