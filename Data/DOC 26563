'''West Creek''' is a tributary of [[Fishing Creek (North Branch Susquehanna River)|Fishing Creek]], in [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia County]] and [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]], in [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States. It is {{convert|9.1|mi|km}} long and flows through Davidson Township in Sullivan County and Jackson Township, Sugarloaf Township, Benton Township, and Benton in Columbia County.<ref name = "nationalmap">{{Citation|author = [[United States Geological Survey]]|url = http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/|title = The National Map Viewer|accessdate = March 5, 2015}}</ref> The water temperature of the creek ranges from {{convert|0|C|F}} to {{convert|25|C|F}}. The [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] ranges from 0 to nearly 10 cubic meters per second. Rock formations in the watershed include the [[Trimmers Rock Formation]], the [[Catskill Formation]], and the [[Huntley Mountain Formation]]. The creek's watershed has an area of 16.6 square miles, most of which is agricultural, forested, or urban land. A small number of dams, mills, and schoolhouses were built on West Creek in the 19th and early 20th century. West Creek has the highest level of [[biodiversity]] of any stream in the upper Fishing Creek watershed.

==Course==
West Creek begins on Huckleberry Mountain in Davidson Township, Sullivan County. It flows east for several hundred feet before turning south-southeast for several tenths of a mile, exiting Sullivan County and entering Jackson Township, Columbia County. It then turns south-southwest for a short distance, reaching the base of Huckleberry Mountain and crossing [[Pennsylvania Route 118]], before southeast for a few miles in a valley, receiving one unnamed tributary from the [[wikt:left bank|left]] and another from the [[wikt:right bank|right]]. The creek then enters Sugarloaf Township and receives another unnamed tributary from the left and turns south. For the next few miles, it flows alongside West Creek Road and receives another unnamed tributary from the right. It then crosses [[Pennsylvania Route 239]] and receives York Hollow, its first named tributary, from the right. The creek then turns southeast for several miles, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 239 and receiving another unnamed tributary from the left and entering Benton Township. It turns south for more than a mile, still flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 239 and crossing it several times. The creek then exits its valley and turns south-southwest, flowing along the edge of a plain. After several tenths of a mile, it receives Spencer Run, its second and final named tributary, from the right and then turns south for more than a mile, passing along the western border of Benton. The creek then turns south-southeast and exits Benton. A few tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Fishing Creek.<ref name = "nationalmap"/>

West Creek joins Fishing Creek {{convert|21.72|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth.<ref name = "gaz">{{Citation|url = http://www.lycoming.edu/cwi/pdfs/paGazetterOfStreams.pdf|title = Pennsylvania Gazetteer of Streams|date = November 2, 2001|accessdate = December 14, 2014}}</ref>

==Hydrology==
The water temperature in West Creek in the summer can be as high as {{convert|25|C|F}}, which is 3° Celsius (5.4° Fahrenheit) higher than coldwater fish can tolerate. Between May 2010 and July 2011, it ranged from below {{convert|0|C|F}} in February and March 2011 to {{convert|25|C|F}} in August 2010.<ref name = "conservation"/>

Between May 2010 and July 2011, the concentration of [[dissolved oxygen]] in West Creek ranged from slightly under eight milligrams per liter in May 2010 to nearly seventeen milligrams per liter in late January 2011. This is well above the minimum required concentration of dissolved oxygen for optimal fish habitation.<ref name = "conservation"/>

West Creek is less affected by episodic acidification than most of the rest of the upper Fishing Creek watershed, with the exception of [[Coles Creek (Pennsylvania)|Coles Creek]]. The [[pH]] of West Creek is at its lowest in late winter and spring, when it is typically around 6.3. During the rest of the year, it is above 7.0. The entire pH range of the creek ranges from just over 6.0 to 7.2 or 7.3. The concentration of dissolved [[aluminum]] in West Creek is under 70 micrograms per liter, considerably less than the concentration needed to kill fish. The aluminum concentration is, in fact, usually approximately zero and is often under 40 micrograms per liter. However, early in 2011, the concentration was observed twice to be nearly 60 micrograms per liter.<ref name = "conservation"/>

The [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] of West Creek is usually less than two cubic meters per second. However, it sometimes is between two and five cubic meters per second and has occasionally been as high as nearly ten cubic meters per second.<ref name = "conservation"/> The [[Electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]] of the creek ranges from slightly over 40 to more than 60 [[siemens (unit)|micro-siemens]] per centimeter.<ref name = "slide1">{{Citation|author = Matthew R.

==Geography and geology==
The elevation near the [[river mouth|mouth]] of West Creek is {{convert|735|ft|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref name = "gnis">{{Citation|author = [[Geographic Names Information System]]|url = http://gnis.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:1192054,West%20Creek|title = Feature Detail Report for: West Creek|accessdate = March 5, 2015}}</ref> The elevation of the creek's [[river source|source]] is between {{convert|1780|and|1800|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name = "nationalmap"/>

The rock in the southern part of the watershed of West Creek is of the [[Trimmers Rock Formation]]. This consists of [[siltstone]] and [[shale]] and comes from the [[Devonian]] period. The northern part of the watershed has rock belonging to the [[Catskill Formation]], which consists of [[sandstone]] and siltstone and also comes from the Devonian. The [[Huntley Mountain Formation]] can be found at the headwaters of the creek. This formation consists of sandstone and siltstone and comes from the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] and Devonian periods.<ref name = "conservation"/>

==Watershed==
The watershed of West Creek has an area of {{convert|17.2|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name = "gaz"/> The creek's mouth is in the [[United States Geological Survey]] quadrangle of Benton. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Elk Grove.<ref name = "gnis"/>

There is significant [[agriculture|agricultural]] activity done in the lower reaches of the watershed of West Creek and there are also some residential areas. Additionally, there are some agricultural lands in the upper reaches of the watershed. Much of the rest of the watershed is [[forest]]ed land.<ref name = "conservation">{{Citation|author = Matthew Opdyke|url = http://www.fishingcreeksportsmanassn.org/Downloads/conservation_plan.pdf|title = Fishing Creek Watershed Coldwater Conservation Plan|date = August 2011|accessdate = May 3, 2014}}</ref> Some of the most downstream parts of the watershed are urban.<ref name = "slide1"/>

==Biology==
There are 41 [[macroinvertebrate]] taxa that have been observed in West Creek, more than have been observed in all of upper Fishing Creek. The number of macroinvertebrates per square meter in West Creek at the site WC1 (in the lower reaches of the creek) is nearly 900, which is far higher than the number of macroinvertebrates per square meter in any other site except the site WC2, in the middle reaches of the creek.<ref name = "conservation"/> Site WC2 has a macroinvertebrate density of 600 macroinvertebrates per square meter.<ref name = "conservation"/> Approximately 60% of the taxa are ''[[Ephemeroptera]]'' (mayflies), 10% each are ''[[Plecoptera]]'' (stoneflies), and approximately 5% are ''[[Trichoptera]]'' (caddisflies).<ref name = "slide1"/>

There are a total of eight species of wild fish in West Creek. [[Brook trout]] and [[brown trout]] both inhabit West Creek, although brook trout are slightly more common than brown trout, with nine brook trout and only seven brown trout being observed in a 2010 or 2011 [[electrofishing]] survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are [[sculpin]], [[eastern blacknose dace]], and [[cutlips minnow]]s. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, a total of 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species of fish in the watershed include [[johnny darter]], [[white sucker]], and [[creek chub]].<ref name = "conservation"/>

In 2011, the habitat quality of upper Fishing Creek and its tributaries were rated on a scale of 1 to 200 (with a higher rating indicating better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. The headwaters of West Creek were given a rating of 192. The rating is significantly lower further downstream, with it being 175 downstream of the crossing of Pennsylvania Route 239. The rating averages 138 where the creek is in Benton and the lowest rating is 115. This rating occurred downstream of the Market Street bridge in Benton.<ref name = "conservation"/>

The [[Shannon Diversity Index]], which is commonly used to measure the diversity of biological communities, of West Creek is slightly over 2.5. The [[Hilsenhoff Biotic Index]], a measure of pollution-tolerant macroinvertebrates, on much of the creek ranges from 1.6 to 2.5, although an area of the creek near Benton ranges from 2.6 to 3.5. There is little [[riparian buffer]]ing along the sections of West Creek where agriculture is done.<ref name = "conservation"/>
