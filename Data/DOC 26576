===Romualdez Mansion===
[[File:JC Romualdez - Road.jpg|thumb|View of the Romualdez Mansion from Jesus street]]
Located at the Jesus Corner San Luis, the Romualdez Mansion is an ancestral house belonging to Daniel Romualdez who also served as the Cabeza de Barangay during his time. He is the paternal grandfather of politician [[Daniel Romualdez]] and a distant relative of [[Imelda Marcos]].

The Romualdez Mansion is a pre-war residential building with a flat facade which borrows some features from the secessionist architecture characterized by ornate metal grills and floral engravings. Another distinctive feature is the intricately designed patterns punctured on the eaves supported by triangular support which was also applied to its voladas.

===Thelmo House===
Currently owned by the Thelmo family, the house is believed to be the former residence of Justice [[Natividad Almeda-Lopez]], the first female lawyer in the Philippines. In popular culture, the house continues to be a popular filming sites for local television series and movies.

The Thelmo House is Pandacan’s favored house of shoot. And this is easy to understand. Built before World War II on an 800 sq m lot, it is the street’s sole property with high concrete fence and a garden in front a brick and concrete two-storey Venetian-style villa. An arched front door in floral motif opens to a massive balayong staircase. The backside is made of bricks to check soil erosion from the estero beside the property. Although it has undergone minor maintenance jobs such as repainting of the exterior that somehow removed traces of its age, the Thelmo House has seen better times. The garage at the far end had been converted into a carinderia that operates irregularly.

A television or film crew’s partiality for the Thelmo House is plausible. They get the favored status from its barangay: Teodora San Luis St. is closed for traffic and can be used for parking lot for the gen sets and cast and crew vehicles, provide security services, and even an unobtrusive neighborhood ready to act as extras if required. But nobody knows until when shoots can be held at the Thelmo House or, for that matter, if it will continue to exist, as it has been up for sale for P25M for the longest time. The security assurance here is to declare it as a heritage house that it duly deserves.<ref name="Todo Entertainment">{{cite web|title=Nora Aunor and Coco Martin Shoot in Pandacan|url=http://www.todoentertainment.com/www_todoentertainment_home.ws?wsajx=1&idb=11428337&idpnl&pg1=13&arch=-1|website=www.todoentertainment.com|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140915105446/http://www.todoentertainment.com/www_todoentertainment_home.ws?wsajx=1&idb=11428337&idpnl&pg1=13&arch=-1|archivedate=September 15, 2014|df=}}</ref>
