So I think the crust of the character is that at some point in time we have always done things without thinking and often it can be a problem, you can make lot of mistakes. So just that carefree attitude, that energy is something I use to have when I was 17 so playing this character just took me back to when I was 17 years. So yeah it's just a lively character."<ref name=devlpmnt/> Further, Deeksha noted that the film is realistic. Her character had less or no make up with simple hairstyles and costumes. She had kept her dialogue delivery normal without any filmy touches. A notable aspect, she added that the film warrants that the girl is not garish while the boy doesn't start showing off his abs.

==Critical response==

===India===

Critic Blessy Chettiar for ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'' assigned a score of 2 on 5 and called it a mediocre entertaining film and a mixture of [[Imtiaz Ali (director)|Imtiaz Ali]]'s former work(s), stating, "In short, LHDD (''Lekar Hum Deewana Dil'') is ''Love Aaj Kal'', ''Jab photographer (We) Met'' ''Rockstar'', and set out on a ''Highway'', landing in a ''Cocktail'' of sorts.
