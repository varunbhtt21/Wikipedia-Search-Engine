'''William Robbie''' (December 17, 1849 – November 11, 1929) was the sixteenth [[List of mayors of Chico, California|President of the Chico Board of Trustees]], the [[City council|governing body]] of [[Chico, California]] from 1907 to 1919.

He was born in [[Old Deer]], [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]] on December 17, 1849, the son of James Robbie and Elspet Webster.

William had an illegitimate daughter by Isabella Reid in 1870 named Margaret.<ref>[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=doigk&id=I38029 RootsWeb.com]</ref>

William and his brother John emigrated to America in 1875, and he became a naturalized citizen.

In 1879, he partnered with his brother and John Bruce to form ''Robbie and Bruce,'' a supplier of cut stones located at First and Broadway in Chico. It would later be renamed the ''Chico Granite and Marble Works,'' and later ''Chico Marble Works.''

As mayor, he oversaw the building of the [[Chico Municipal Building|old City Hall]] which was dedicated in 1911. He also accepted the deed to Children's Playground from [[Annie Bidwell]] in 1911. He oversaw the building of roads through lower [[Bidwell Park]] so that the, "people of Chico could see their new park."<ref>[http://www.aauw-chico.org/newsletters/201012.pdf American Association of University Women - Chico Branch]</ref>

In 1910, he was a founding member of the Butte Humane Society board of directors.<ref>[http://buttehumane.org/page/_files/Newsletter--2011--Spring.pdf Butte Humane Society]</ref>

In 1918, the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu]] claimed the life of his son George, while the rest of the family recovered.<ref>[http://www.newsreview.com/chico/outbreak-past/content?oid=47378 Chico news and Review - Outbreak past: How Chico survived the Spanish Flu]</ref>
