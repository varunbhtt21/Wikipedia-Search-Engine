Title : List of dangerous snakes
Text : {{disputed|date=February 2015}} Of the 3,500 snake species, there are around 600 venomous snake species in the world. This is an overview of the snakes that pose a significant health risk to humans, through [[snakebite]]s or other [[trauma (medicine)|physical trauma]].

The varieties of snakes that most often cause serious snakebites depend on the region of the world.<!--  name=Brut2013/> --> In Africa, the most dangerous species include [[black mamba]]s, [[Bitis arietans|puff adders]], and [[carpet viper]]s.<!-- <ref name=Brut2013/> --> In the Middle East the species of greatest concern are carpet vipers and [[elapid]]s;<!-- <ref name=Brut2013/> --> in Central and South America, ''[[Bothrops]]'' (including the [[terciopelo]] or fer-de-lance) and ''[[Crotalus]]'' ([[rattlesnake]]s) are of greatest concern.<!-- <ref name=Brut2013/> --> In South Asia, it has historically been believed that [[Indian cobra]]s, [[common krait]]s, [[Russell's viper]] and carpet vipers were the most dangerous species; <!-- <ref name=Brut2013/> -->however other snakes may also cause significant problems in this area of the world.<ref name=Brut2013>{{cite book|last=Brutto|first=edited by Hector H. Garcia, Herbert B. Tanowitz, Oscar H. Del|title=Neuroparasitology and tropical neurology|date=2013|isbn=9780444534996|pages=351|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJx3g30aDhIC&pg=PA351}}</ref> While several species of snakes may cause more bodily destruction than others, any of these venomous snakes are still very capable of causing human fatalities should a bite go untreated, regardless of their venom capabilities or behavioral tendencies.

==Most venomous==
{{Main|Venomous snake}}
The [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) of a venom is the [[Dose (pharmacology)|dose]] required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. A lower LD<sub>50</sub> is indicative of increased toxicity.

There are four methods in which the LD<sub>50</sub> test is measured:

[[subcutaneous injection|Subcutaneous]] : Venom is injected into the fatty layer beneath the skin. <br>[[intravenous injection|Intravenous]] : Venom is injected directly into a vein. <br>[[intramuscular injection|Intramuscular]] : Venom is injected into a muscle. <br>[[intraperitoneal injection|Intraperitoneal]] : Venom is injected into the abdominal cavity. <br>The most commonly tested methods are subcutaneous and intravenous injections of mice. Subcutaneous is the most applicable to actual bites. Only large ''[[Bitis]]'' or extremely large ''[[Bothrops]]'' or ''[[Crotalus]]'' specimens would be able to deliver a bite that is truly intramuscular. Intravenous injections are extremely rare in actual bites. Testing using dry venom mixed with 0.1% [[bovine serum albumin]] in [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], gives more consistent results than just saline alone.

==Extremely dangerous==

Mortality (often determined by measured toxicity on mice) is a commonly used indicator to determine the danger of any given venomous snake, but important too are its efficiency of venom delivery, its venom yield and its behavior when it encounters humans.<ref name="World's Deadliest Snakes">Venomous Snakes.

===Black mamba=== 
[[File:Dendroaspis polylepis by Bill Love.jpg|upright|thumb|Black mamba (''Dendroaspis polylepis'')]]
The African [[Black mamba]] (''Dendroaspis polylepis'') is a large and highly venomous snake species native to much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. It is the second longest venomous snake species in the world and is the fastest moving land snake, capable of moving at 4.32 to 5.4 metres per second (16–20&nbsp;km/h, 10–12&nbsp;mph).<ref name="NG">{{cite web|title=Black Mamba|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/black-mamba/|work=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="record">{{cite book|last=Glenday|first=Craig|title=Guinness World Records 2009|year=2009|publisher=Bantam|isbn=978-0553592566|page=57}}</ref> It is quite possibly the snake most feared by the population in Africa and considered the most dangerous by some, and has a reputation as a fierce and territorial snake. When cornered or threatened, the black mamba can put up a fearsome display of defense and aggression. A black mamba will often mimic a cobra by spreading a neck-flap, exposing its black mouth, raising its body off the ground, and hissing. It can rear up around one-third of its body from the ground, which can put it at about four feet high. When warding off a threat, the black mamba delivers multiple strikes, injecting large amounts of virulently toxic venom with each strike, often landing bites on the body or head, unlike other snakes. Their strikes are very quick and extremely accurate and effective.<ref name="Chippaux" /> If the attempt to scare away the threat fails, it will strike repeatedly.<ref name="NG" /> 

This species of snake often shows an incredible amount of tenacity, fearlessness, and aggression when cornered or threatened, during breeding season, or when defending its territory.<ref name="ErZug" /> They are also known to have a 100% rate of [[envenomation]]; the probability of dry bites (no venom injected) in black mamba strikes is almost non-existent.<ref name="Davidson" /><ref name="Crisp">{{cite journal |pmid=4035489 |year=1985 |last1=Crisp |first1=NG |title=Black mamba envenomation |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=293–4 |journal=South African Medical Journal}}</ref> The venom of the black mamba is a protein of low molecular weight and as a result is able to spread rapidly within the bitten tissue.

The proteins in black mamba venom are of low molecular weight, low viscosity, and the venom's high activity in terms of hyaluronidases, which is also essential in facilitating dispersion of venom toxins throughout tissue (spreading the venom through the body) by catalyzing the hydrolysis of hyaluronan, a constituent of the extracellular matrix (ECM), hyaluronidase lowers the viscosity of hyaluronan, and Dendroaspin natriuretic peptide (DNP), a newly discovered component of mamba venom, is the most potent natriuretic peptide and is unique to the genus ''Dendroaspis'', or mambas. It is a polypeptide analogous to the human atrial natriuretic peptide; it is responsible for causing diuresis through natriuresis and dilating the vessel bloodstream, which results in, among other things, acceleration of venom distribution in the body of the victim, thereby increasing tissue permeability.<ref name="JW presentation01">{{cite AV media |people=Wasilewski, Joe|year=2011 |title=Wildlife Footage|medium=Motion picture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVoD9doGRso&t=02m25s|accessdate=28 December 2014|location=Africa |publisher= Youtube}}</ref><ref name=VJ>{{cite book|last1=Valenta|first1=J.|title=Venomous Snakes: Envenoming, Therapy|date=2010|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|isbn=978-1-60876-618-5|pages=108–111}}</ref> These advanced and highly evolved physical and biological features combined with this species' large size, explosive aggression, and quickness make the black mamba a terrifying adversary. [[Neurology|Neurological]], [[Respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[cardiovascular]] symptoms rapidly begin to manifest, usually within less than ten minutes. Common symptoms are rapid onset of dizziness, drowsiness, headache, coughing or difficulty breathing, convulsions, and an erratic heartbeat. Other common symptoms which come on rapidly include neuromuscular symptoms, shock, loss of consciousness, [[hypotension]], [[pallor]], [[ataxia]], excessive salivation (oral secretions may become profuse and thick), limb paralysis, nausea and vomiting, [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], fever, and severe abdominal pain. Local tissue damage appears to be relatively infrequent and of minor severity in most cases of black mamba envenomation. [[Edema]] is typically minimal.

In case studies of black mamba envenomation, respiratory paralysis has occurred in less than 15 minutes. Envenomation by this species invariably causes severe neurotoxicity because black mambas often strike repeatedly in a single lunge, biting the victim up to 12 times in extremely rapid succession.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis)|url=http://www.thewildlifemuseum.org/exhibits/Africa-Deadly/doc/Black%20Mamba.pdf|publisher=The Wildlife Museum}}</ref> Such an attack is fast, lasting less than one second, and so it may appear to be a single strike and single bite.

===Coastal taipan/Papuan taipan===
[[File:Costal Tiapan at Taronga Zoo.jpg|thumb|Coastal Taipan (''Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus'') at Taronga Zoo]]
The [[Coastal taipan]] (''Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus'') is a large, highly venomous Australian elapid that ranges in an arc along the east coast of Australia from northeastern [[New South Wales]] through [[Queensland]] and across the northern parts of the [[Northern Territory]] to northern [[Western Australia]]. It has one subspecies, the Papuan taipan (''Oxyuranus scutellatus canni''). The Papuan taipan is found throughout the southern parts of the island of [[New Guinea]]. This snake can be highly aggressive when cornered and will actively defend itself.<ref name="DD" /> They are extremely nervous and alert snakes, and any movement near them is likely to trigger an attack. When threatened, this species adopts a loose striking stance with its head and forebody raised. It inflates and compresses its body laterally (not dorso-ventrally like many other species) and may also spread the back of its jaws to give the head a broader, lance-shaped appearance. In this position the snake will strike without much provocation, inflicting multiple bites with extreme accuracy and efficiency. The muscular lightweight body of the Taipan allows it to hurl itself forwards or sideways and reach high off the ground, and such is the speed of the attack that a person may be bitten several times before realizing the snake is there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coastal Taipan|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Coastal-Taipan|publisher=Australian Museum|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref> This snake is considered to be one of the most venomous in the world. Ernst and Zug ''et al.'' 1996 and the Australian venom and toxin database both list a {{LD50}} value of 0.106&nbsp;mg/kg for subcutaneous injection.<ref name="ErZug" /><ref name="AVRU">{{cite web|title=Australian Venom Research Unit|url=http://www.avru.org/index.html|publisher=University of Melbourne|date=2018-06-05}}</ref> 

Engelmann and Obst (1981) list a value of 0.12&nbsp;mg/kg [[Subcutis|SC]], with an average venom yield of 120&nbsp;mg per bite and a maximum record of 400&nbsp;mg.<ref name="Engelmann" /> To demonstrate just how deadly this species is, an estimate was made on the number of mice and adult human fatalities it is capable of causing in a single bite that yields the maximum dose of 400&nbsp;mg. Based on the study by Ernst and Zug ''et al.'' 1996, which listed the {{LD50}} of the coastal taipan at 0.106&nbsp;mg [[Subcutis|SC]] and a venom yield of 400&nbsp;mg, this would be sufficient enough to kill 208,019 mice and 59 adult humans in a single bite that delivers 400&nbsp;mg of venom. The venom apparatus of this species is well developed. The fangs are the longest of any Australian elapid snake, being up to {{convert|1.2|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long, and are able to be brought forward slightly when a strike is contemplated. Coastal taipans can inject large amounts of highly toxic venom deep into tissue. Its venom contains primarily [[taicatoxin]], a highly potent [[neurotoxin]] known to cause [[hemolytic]] and coagulopathic reactions.<ref name="DD" /> 

The venom affects the nervous system and the blood’s ability to clot, and bite victims may experience headache, nausea and vomiting, collapse, convulsions (especially in children), paralysis, internal bleeding, myolysis (destruction of muscle tissue) and kidney damage. In a single study done in [[Papua New Guinea]], 166 patients with enzyme immunoassay-proven bites by Papuan taipans (''Oxyuranus scutellatus canni'') were studied in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Of the 166 bite victims, 139 (84%) showed clinical evidence of envenoming: local signs were trivial, but the majority developed hemostatic disorders and neurotoxicity. The blood of 77% of the patients was incoagulable and 35% bled spontaneously, usually from the gums. [[Microhematuria]] was observed in 51% of the patients. Neurotoxic symptoms (ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar paralysis, and peripheral muscular weakness) developed in 85%. Endotracheal intubation was required in 42% and mechanical ventilation in 37%. [[Electrocardiography|Electrocardiographic]] (ECG or EKG) abnormalities were found in 52% of a group of 69 unselected patients. Specific antivenom raised against Australian taipan venom was effective in stopping spontaneous systemic bleeding and restoring blood coagulability but, in most cases, it neither reversed nor prevented the evolution of paralysis even when given within a few hours of the bite. However, early antivenom treatment was associated statistically with decreased incidence and severity of neurotoxic signs. The low case fatality rate of 4.3% is attributable mainly to the use of mechanical ventilation, a technique rarely available in Papua New Guinea. Earlier use of increased doses of antivenoms of improved specificity might prove more effective.<ref name="Lalloo">{{cite journal|last=Lalloo|first=DG |author2=Trevett AJ |author3=Korinhona A |author4=Nwokolo N |author5=Laurenson IF |author6=Paul M |author7=Black J |author8=Naraqi S |author9=Mavo B |author10=Saweri A|title=nake bites by the Papuan taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus canni): paralysis, hemostatic and electrocardiographic abnormalities, and effects of antivenom|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|date=June 1995|volume=52|issue=6|pages=525–531|pmid=7611559|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The onset of symptoms is often rapid, and a bite from this species is a life-threatening medical emergency. Prior to the introduction of specific antivenom by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in 1956, a coastal taipan bite was nearly always fatal.  In case of severe envenomation, death can occur as early as 30 minutes after being bitten, but average death time after a bite is around 3–6 hours and it is variable, depending on various factors such as the nature of the bite and the health state of the victim.<ref name="DD" /> Envenomation rate is very high, over 80% of bites inject venom. The mortality rate among untreated bite victims is nearly 100%.<ref name="DD">{{cite web|title=Immediate First Aid for bites by Australian Taipan or Common Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus)|url=http://toxicology.ucsd.edu/Snakebite%20Protocols/Oxyura~2.htm|publisher=University of California at San Diego|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref name="OS">{{cite web|title=Oxyuranus scutellatus|url=http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0518|work=Clinical Toxinology Resource|publisher=University of Adelaide|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>

==Highly dangerous==
===The Big Four===
The [[Big Four (Indian snakes)|Big Four]] are the four venomous snake species responsible for causing the most snake bite cases in South Asia (mostly in India). The Big Four snakes cause far more snakebites because they are much more abundant in highly populated areas. They are the [[Indian cobra]] (''Naja Naja''), [[common krait]] (''Bungarus caeruleus''), [[Russell's viper]] (''Daboia russelii'') and the [[Echis carinatus|Saw-scaled viper]] (''Echis carinatus'').<ref name="Whi90">Whitaker Z. 1990.

====Common krait====
[[File:Bungarus caerulus.jpg|thumb|Common krait (''Bungarus caeruleus'')]]
The [[common krait]] (''Bungarus caeruleus'') is often considered to be the most dangerous snake species in India. Its venom consists mostly of powerful [[neurotoxin]]s which induce muscle paralysis. Clinically, its venom contains pre[[Synapse|synaptic]] and postsynaptic neurotoxins,<ref name="ct2" />. Due to the fact that krait venom contains many presynaptic neurotoxins, patients bitten will often not respond to antivenom because once paralysis has developed it is not reversible.<ref name="EMJ" /> This species causes an estimated 10,000 fatalities per year in [[India]] alone.<ref name="RW" /> There is a 70-80% mortality rate in cases where there is no possible or poor and ineffective treatment (e.g., no use of [[mechanical ventilation]], low quantities of antivenom, poor management of possible infection). Average venom yield per bite is 10&nbsp;mg (Brown, 1973), 8 to 20&nbsp;mg (dry weight) (U.S. Dept. Navy, 1968), and 8 to 12&nbsp;mg (dry weight) (Minton, 1974).<ref name="ct2">{{cite web|title= University of Adelaide Clinical Toxinology Resources|url=http://toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0015|quote=Mortality rate:70-80%}}</ref> The lethal adult human dose is 2.5&nbsp;mg.<ref name="EMJ">{{cite journal|last=Isbister|first=G K|title=Snake antivenom research: the importance of case definition|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|year=2005|volume=22|issue=6|pages=399–400|

====Russell's viper====
[[File:Tushar mone.jpg|thumb|Russell's viper (''Daboia russelii'')]]
[[Russell's viper]] (''Daboia russelii'') produces one of the most excruciatingly painful bites of all venomous snakes. Internal bleeding is common. Bruising, blistering and necrosis may appear relatively quickly as well.<ref name="Warrell">{{cite web|last=Warrell|first=David A.|title=Clinical Features of Snakebite|url=http://www.ilo.org/oshenc/part-vi/biological-hazards/item/255-clinical-features-of-snakebite|work=Encyclopedia of Occupational Health and Safety|publisher=Encyclopedia of Occupational Health and Safety|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> The Russell's viper is irritable, short-tempered and a very aggressive snake by nature and when irritated, coils tightly, hisses, and strikes with lightning speed. This species is responsible for more human fatalities in India than any other snake species, causing an estimated 25,000 fatalities annually.<ref name="RW" /> The {{LD50}} in mice, which is used as a possible indicator of snake venom toxicity, is as follows: 0.133&nbsp;mg/kg intravenous, 0.40&nbsp;mg/kg intraperitoneal, and about 0.75&nbsp;mg/kg subcutaneous.<ref name="aa" /> For most humans, a lethal dose is approximately 40–70&nbsp;mg. However, the quantity of venom produced by individual specimens is considerable. Reported venom yields for adult specimens range from 130–250&nbsp;mg to 150–250&nbsp;mg to 21–268&nbsp;mg. For 13 juveniles with an average length of 79&nbsp;cm, the average venom yield was 8–79&nbsp;mg (mean 45&nbsp;mg).<ref name="Mal03" />

====Saw-scaled viper====
[[File:Saw-scaled Viper (Echis carinatus) Photographed By Shantanu Kuveskar.jpg|thumb|Saw-scaled viper (''Echis carinatus'')]]
The [[Saw-scaled viper]] (''Echis carinatus'') is small, but its unpredictability, aggressive temper, and lethal venom potency make it very dangerous. This species is one of the fastest striking snakes in the world, and mortality rates for those bitten are very high. In [[India]] alone, the saw-scaled viper is responsible for an estimated 5,000 human fatalities annually.<ref name="RW" /> However, because it ranges from [[Pakistan]], India (in rocky regions of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab), [[Sri Lanka]], parts of the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]] north of the equator,<ref name="McD99">McDiarmid RW, Campbell JA, Touré T. 1999.

This species produces on the average of about 18&nbsp;mg of dry venom by weight, with a recorded maximum of 72&nbsp;mg. It may inject as much as 12&nbsp;mg, whereas the lethal dose for an adult human is estimated to be only 5&nbsp;mg.<ref name="Daniels" /> 

Envenomation results in local symptoms as well as severe systemic symptoms that may prove fatal. Local symptoms include swelling and intense pain, which appear within minutes of a bite. In very bad cases the swelling may extend up the entire affected limb within 12–24 hours and blisters form on the skin.<ref name="Ali04">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali G, Kak M, Kumar M, Bali SK, Tak SI, Hassan G, Wadhwa MB | year = 2004 | title = Acute renal failure following echis carinatus (saw–scaled viper) envenomation | url = http://medind.nic.in/iav/t04/i4/iavt04i4p177.pdf#search=%22%22echis%20carinatus%22%20%2B%20envenomation%22 | journal = Indian Journal of Nephrology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 177–181 }}</ref> Of the more dangerous systemic symptoms, [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]] and coagulation defects are the most striking.

Almost all patients develop [[oliguria]] or [[Oliguria|anuria]] within a few hours to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, [[Dialysis|kidney dialysis]] is necessary due to [[acute renal failure]] (ARF), but this is not often caused by [[hypotension]].

In the [[Colombia]]n states of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and [[Chocó Department|Chocó]], it causes 50-70% of all snakebites, with a [[sequelae]] rate of 6% and a fatality rate of 5% (Otero et al., 1992). In the state of [[Lara (state)|Lara]], [[Venezuela]], it is responsible for 78% of all envenomations and all snakebite fatalities (Dao-L., 1971). One of the reasons so many people are bitten is because of its association with human habitation and many bites occur indoors (Sasa & Vázquez, 2003).

===King cobra===
[[File:Ophiophagus-hannah-kaeng-krachan-national-park.jpg|thumb|King cobra (''Ophiophagus hannah''), [[Kaeng Krachan National Park]]]]
The [[King cobra]] (''Ophiophagus hannah'') is the longest venomous snake in the world, and it can inject very high volumes of venom in a single bite. The venom {{LD50}} is 1.80&nbsp;mg/kg [[Subcutaneous injection|SC]] according to Broad et al. (1979).<ref name="tox">[http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0048 University of Adelaide Clinical Toxinology Resource]</ref> The mean value of subcutaneous {{LD50}} of five wild-caught king cobras in [[Southeast Asia]] was determined as 1.93&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="CRC Press">{{cite book |title=Handbook of clinical toxicology of animal venoms and poisons|publisher=CRC Press|volume=236|year=1995|location=USA|isbn=978-0-8493-4489-3}}</ref> Between 350 and 500&nbsp;mg (dry weight) of venom can be injected at once (Minton, 1974).

The king cobra has a fearsome reputation. When annoyed, it spreads a narrow hood and growls loudly, but some scientists claim that their aggressiveness is grossly exaggerated.<ref name="Greene">{{cite book|last=Greene|first=HW|title=Snakes: The Evolution of Mystery in Nature|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0520224872}}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}</ref> In most of the local encounters with live, wild king cobras, the snakes appear to be of rather placid disposition, and they usually end up being killed or subdued with hardly any hysterics. These support the view that wild king cobras generally have a mild temperament, and despite their frequent occurrence in disturbed and built-up areas, are adept at avoiding humans. Naturalist Michael Wilmer Forbes Tweedie felt that "this notion is based on the general tendency to dramatise all attributes of snakes with little regard for the truth about them. A moment’s reflection shows that this must be so, for the species is not uncommon, even in populated areas, and consciously or unconsciously, people must encounter king cobras quite frequently. If the snake were really habitually aggressive records of its bite would be frequent; as it is they are extremely rare."<ref name="Tweedie">{{cite book|last=Tweedie|first=MWF|title=The Snakes of Malaya|year=1983|publisher=Singapore National Printers Ltd|location=Singapore|oclc=686366097}}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}</ref> Mortality rates vary sharply depending on many factors.

The [[Many-banded krait]] (''Bungarus multicinctus'') is the most venomous krait species known based on toxinological studies conducted on mice. The venom of the many-banded krait consists of both pre- and postsynaptic [[neurotoxin]]s (known as [[α-bungarotoxin]]s and [[beta-Bungarotoxin|β-bungarotoxin]]s, among others). Due to poor response to antivenom therapy, mortality rates are very high in cases of envenomation - up to 50% of cases that receive antivenom are fatal.

===Tiger snake===
[[File:Tiger snake 2.jpg|thumb|Tiger snake (''Notechis'' spp.)]]
[[Tiger snake]]s (''Notechis spp'') are highly venomous. Their venoms possess potent [[neurotoxin]]s, [[Coagulation|coagulant]]s, [[haemolysin]]s and [[myotoxin]]s and the venom is quick-acting with rapid onset of breathing difficulties and paralysis. The untreated mortality rate from tiger snake bites is reported to be between 40 and 60%.<ref>[http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0540 University of Adelaide Clinical Toxinology Resource]</ref> They are a major cause of snakebites and occasional snakebite deaths in Australia.<ref name="TSB">{{cite web|title=Australian Tiger Snakes|url=http://www.toxinology.com/about/tiger_snake_snakebite.html|work=Clinical Toxinology Resources|publisher=University of Adelaide|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

===Green mambas===
[[File:Dendroaspis viridisPCCA20051227-1885B.jpg|thumb|upright|Western green mamba (''Dendroaspis viridis'')]]
Green mambas (Western, Eastern, and Jameson's) are all highly venomous snakes that can be highly aggressive and unpredictable in disposition. They can suddenly go from a state of relative calm to an extremely agitated and dangerous state. All three species have a tendency to strike repeatedly with little provocation, although they are generally much less aggressive than their larger cousin, the Black mamba. All three species of green mamba are highly arboreal, alert, extremely quick, and agile. Although the potency of their venom is similar to the more venomous [[Naja|cobra]] species, mamba venom is much more rapid-acting and the dendrotoxins contained in mamba venom is generally more devastating in nature to the central nervous system, causing more severe neurotoxicity in more rapid fashion.<ref name="Davidson"/>

The [[Western green mamba]] (''Dendroaspis viridis'') is highly venomous and aggressive with a {{LD50}} of 0.7&nbsp;mg/kg [[Subcutaneous injection|SC]] and the average venom yield per bite is approximately 100&nbsp;mg. The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be very high (>80%).

The [[Eastern green mamba]] (''Dendroaspis angusticeps'') has an average venom yield per bite of 80&nbsp;mg according to Engelmann and Obst (1981).<ref name="Engelmann">{{cite book|last=Engelmann|first=Wolf-Eberhard|title=Snakes: Biology, Behavior, and Relationship to Man|year=1981|publisher=Leipzig Publishing; English version published by Exeter Books (1982)|location=Leipzig; English version NY, USA|isbn=978-0-89673-110-3|pages=51}}</ref> The [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] {{LD50}} for this species ranges from 0.40&nbsp;mg/kg to 3.05&nbsp;mg/kg depending on different toxicology studies, authority figures and estimates. The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be very high (70-75%). Generally the calmest and most shy of the green mamba species, the Eastern green will still strike repeatedly if cornered or agitated.

The [[Jameson's mamba]] (''Dendroaspis jamesoni'') is known to be quite aggressive and defensive. The average venom yield per bite for this species is 80&nbsp;mg, but some specimens may yield as much as 120&nbsp;mg in a single bite. The [[Subcutaneous injection|SC]] {{LD50}} for this species according to Brown (1973) is 1.0&nbsp;mg/kg, while the [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] {{LD50}} is 0.8&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="Brown73">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=John H.|title=Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes|year=1973|publisher=Charles C.

===True cobras===
The [[Naja|cobras]] (''Naja spp'') are a medically important group of snakes due to the number of bites and fatalities they cause across their geographical range. The genus ''Naja'' consists of 20 to 22 [[species]], but has undergone several [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revisions in recent years, so sources vary greatly.<ref name="ITIS">{{ITIS |id=700233 |taxon=''Naja'' |accessdate=13 April 2008}}</ref>  They range throughout [[Africa]] (including some parts of the Sahara where ''Naja haje'' can be found), [[Southwest Asia]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. The most recent revision,<ref name=wallach>{{cite journal|last=Wallach|first=Van |author2=Wüster, W |author3=Broadley, Donald G.|title=In praise of subgenera: taxonomic status of cobras of the genus Naja Laurenti (Serpentes: Elapidae)|journal=Zootaxa|year=2009|volume=2236|issue=1|pages=26–36|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2009/f/zt02236p036.pdf}}</ref> listed 28 species after the synonymisation of ''Boulengerina'' and ''Paranaja'' with ''Naja''. But unlike some other members of the family [[Elapidae]] (the species of the genus ''Bungarus'', genus ''Oxyuranus'', genus ''Pseudohaje'', and especially genus ''Dendroaspis''), half of the bites by many species of both African and Asian origin of the genus ''Naja'' are "[[dry bite]]s" (a dry bite is a bite by a venomous snake in which no venom is released). Roughly 45-50% of bites by most cobra species are dry bites and thus don't cause envenomation.<ref name=WHO-03>{{cite journal|last=Warrell|first=DA|author2=Theakston RD |author3=Griffiths E |title=Report of a WHO workshop on the standardization and control of antivenoms|journal=Toxicon|date=April 2003|volume=41|issue=5|pages=541–57|pmid=12676433|doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(02)00393-8}}</ref> 

Some of the species which are known and documented to deliver dry bites in a majority of cases (50% +) include: ''Naja naja'', ''Naja kaouthia'', ''Naja sputatrix'', ''Naja siamensis'', ''Naja haje'', ''Naja annulifera'', ''Naja anchietae'' and ''Naja nigricollis''. Some species will inject venom in the majority of their bites, but still deliver high number of dry bites (40-45%) include: ''Naja sumatrana'', ''Naja melanoleuca'', ''Naja atra'', ''Naja mossambica'' and ''Naja katiensis''. Within this [[genus]], there are a few species in which dry bites are very rare. Envenoming occurs in at least 75-80% of bite cases involving these species. The species which typically cause envenomation in the majority of their bites include some of the more dangerous and venomous species of this genus: ''Naja oxiana'', ''Naja philippinensis'', ''Naja nivea'', and ''Naja samarensis''. There are many more species within the genus which have not yet been subject to much research and studies, and as a result, very little is known about their behaviour, venom, diet, habitat and general temperaments. Some of these species include ''Naja sagittifera'', ''Naja annulata'', ''Naja christyi'' and many others.

====Caspian cobra====
[[File:Naja oxiana Caspian cobra in a defensive posture.jpg|thumb|Caspian cobra (''Naja oxiana'')]]
The most medically important species of snake bites in [[Central Asia]] is the [[Caspian cobra]] (''Naja oxiana''). It is the most venomous species of [[Naja|cobra]] in the world, slightly ahead of the Philippines cobra based on a toxinological study from 1992 found in the Indian Journal of Experimental Biology, in which this species produced the highest potency venom among cobras. The venom of this species has the most potent composition of toxins found among any [[Naja|cobra]] species known. It is made up of primarily highly potent [[neurotoxin]]s but it also has [[cytotoxin|cytotoxic]] activity (tissue-death, necrosis) and [[Cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxins]].<ref name="cytotoxins">{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BJ20041892 |title=Cancer cell injury by cytotoxins from cobra venom is mediated through lysosomal damage |year=2005 |last1=Sharonov |first1=George V. |last2=Sharonov |first2=Alexei V. |last3=Astapova |first3=Maria V. |last4=Rodionov |first4=Dmitriy I. |last5=Utkin |first5=Yuriy N. |last6=Arseniev |first6=Alexander S. |journal=Biochemical Journal |volume=390 |pages=11–8 |pmid=15847607 |issue=Pt 1 |pmc=1184559}}</ref> Two forms of "cytotoxin II" ([[cardiotoxin]]) were found in the venom of this species.<ref name="CTII">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00478.x |title=Two forms of cytotoxin II (cardiotoxin) from Naja naja oxiana in aqueous solution .

The bite of this species may cause severe pain and swelling, along with severe neurotoxicity. Weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, hypotension, and paralysis of throat and limbs may appear in less than one hour after the bite. Without medical treatment, symptoms rapidly worsen and death can occur rapidly after a bite due to respiratory failure. An adult woman bitten by this species in northwestern Pakistan suffered severe neurotoxicity and died while en route to the closest hospital nearly 50 minutes after envenomation. Between 1979 and 1987, 136 confirmed bites were attributed to this species in the former [[Soviet Union]]. Of the 136, 121 received antivenom, and only four died. Of the 15 who did not receive antivenom, 11 died. This species is an abundant snake in northeastern Iran and is responsible for a very large number of snakebite mortalities.<ref name=L84>{{cite book|last=Latifi|first=Mahmoud|title=Snakes of Iran|year=1984|publisher=Society for the Study of Amphibians & Reptiles|isbn=978-0-91-698422-9}}</ref> Antivenom is not as effective for envenomation by this species as it is for other Asiatic cobras within the same region, like the Indian cobra (''Naja naja'') and due to the dangerous toxicity of this species' venom, massive amounts of antivenom are often required for patients.

Research has shown its venom is purely a neurotoxin, with no apparent necrotizing components and no [[cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxins]]. These snakes are capable of accurately spitting their venom at a target up to 3 metres (9.8&nbsp;ft) away. Bites from this species produce prominent neurotoxicity and are considered especially dangerous. A study of 39 patients envenomed by the Philippine cobra was conducted in 1988. Neurotoxicity occurred in 38 cases and was the predominant clinical feature. Complete Respiratory failure developed in 19 patients, and was often rapid in onset; in three cases, apnea occurred within just 30 minutes of the bite. There were two deaths, both in patients who were moribund upon arrival at the hospital. Three patients developed necrosis, and 14 individuals with systemic symptoms had no local swelling at all. Both cardiotoxicity and reliable nonspecific signs of envenoming were absent.

Envenomation usually causes some combination of local pain, swelling, fever, general weakness, headache, & vomiting. This is not a typically aggressive snake, but it will strike and hiss loudly when provoked. It can strike at a distance of ⅔ of its body length. It does not usually spread a hood nor hold up its body up off the ground like [[Naja|true cobras]] do. Envenomation by this species should be considered a serious medical emergency.

===Spitting cobras===
[[File:Naja pallida.jpg|thumb|Red spitting cobra (''Naja pallida''), juvenile]]
[[Spitting cobra]]s are another group of cobras that belong to the genus ''Naja''. Spitting cobras can be found in both Africa and Asia. These cobras have the ability to eject venom from their fangs when defending themselves against predators. The sprayed venom is harmless to intact skin. However, it can cause permanent blindness if introduced to the eye and left untreated (causing chemosis and corneal swelling). The venom sprays out in distinctive geometric patterns, using muscular contractions upon the venom glands. These muscles squeeze the glands and force the venom out through forward-facing holes at the tips of the fangs.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.01170 |title=The buccal buckle: The functional morphology of venom spitting in cobras |year=2004 |last1=Young |first1=B.

The [[Indochinese spitting cobra]] (''Naja siamensis'') is a venomous spitting cobra whose venom consists of postsynaptic neurotoxins, metalloproteinases, powerful cardiotoxins, with cytolytic activity, and Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> with a diversity of activities. The {{LD50}} of its venom is 1.07-1.42&nbsp;mg/gram of [[mouse]] body weight.<ref name="chanhome11" /> Cranial palsy and respiratory depression are reported to be more common after bites by Naja siamensis than by Naja kaouthia. Indochinese spitting cobras will use their venom for self-defense with little provocation, and as the name implies, are capable of spitting venom when alarmed, often at the face and eyes of the animal or human threatening them. A case report in the literature describes pain and irritation of the eyes, bilateral redness, excessive tear production and whitish discharge, with superficial corneal opacity but normal acuity.<ref name="WJO">{{cite web|last=Williams, Jensen, O'Shea|first=David J., Simon D., Mark|title=Snake Management in Cambodia|url=http://garudam.info/files/WHO2009-Cambodia.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

====Black-necked spitting cobra====
[[File:Naja nigricollis (Warren Klein).jpg|thumb|upright|Black-necked spitting cobra (''Naja nigricollis'')]]
The [[Black-necked spitting cobra]] (''Naja nigricollis'') is a species of spitting cobra found mostly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. They possess medically significant [[venom]], although the mortality rate for untreated bites on humans is relatively low (~5-10%). Like other [[spitting cobras]], this species is known for its ability to project [[venom]] at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision and permanent blindness. ''N. nigricollis'' is known for its tendency to liberally spit venom with only the slightest provocation. However, this aggressiveness is counterbalanced by it being less prone to bite than other related species.<ref name="WCH3">{{cite web|title=Naja nigricollis - General Details, Taxonomy and Biology, Venom, Clinical Effects, Treatment, First Aid, Antivenoms|url=http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0185|work=WCH Clinical Toxinology Resource|publisher=University of Adelaide}}</ref><ref name="SB95" />

===Rinkhals===
[[File:Rinkhals2.jpg|thumb|upright|Rinkhals (''Hemachatus haemachatus'')]]
The [[Rinkhals]] (''Hemachatus haemachatus'') is a not a true cobra in that it does not belong to the genus ''Naja''. However, it is closely related to the true [[cobra]]s and is considered to be one of the true [[spitting cobras]].<ref name="Hunter">{{cite web|url=http://www.venomousreptiles.org/articles/34|title=Venomous Reptiles|accessdate=|author=S. Hunter|authorlink= |year=2000 |format= |website= |publisher=|pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> The venom of this species is less viscous than that of other African elapids, naturally, as thinner fluid is naturally easier to spit. However, the venom of the rinkhals is produced in copious amounts. Average venom yield is 80–120&nbsp;mg and the murine {{LD50}} is 1.1-1.6&nbsp;mg/kg [[Subcutis|SC]] with an estimated lethal dose for humans of 50–60&nbsp;mg. Actual bites from this species are fairly rare, and deaths in modern times are so far unheard of. Local symptoms of swelling and bruising is reported in about 25% of cases. General symptoms of drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, violent abdominal pain and vertigo often occur, as does a mild pyrexial reaction. Neurotoxic symptoms are however rare and have only included diplopia and dyspnoea. Ophthalmia has been reported, but has not caused as severe complications as in some of the spitters in the genus ''Naja'' (especially ''N. nigricollis'' and ''N. mossambica'').<ref name="rinkhals">{{cite web|title=The Natural History and Captive Care of the Rinkhals spitting cobra|url=http://www.venomousreptiles.org/articles/34|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

===African vipers===
====Puff adder====
[[File:Bitis arietans.jpg|thumb|Puff adder (''Bitis arietans'')]]
The [[Bitis arietans|Puff adder]] (''Bitis arietans'') is responsible for more fatalities than any other African snake. This is due to a combination of factors, including its wide distribution, common occurrence, large size, potent venom that is produced in large amounts, long fangs, their habit of basking by footpaths and sitting quietly when approached.<ref name="Mal03" /><ref name="SB95" /><ref name="Spa04" /> The venom has [[cytotoxic]] effects<ref name="Wid94">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00176504 |title=Load cycling closure of fasciotomies following puff adder bite |year=1994 |last1=Widgerow |first1=A.D. |last2=Ritz |first2=M. |last3=Song |first3=C. |journal=European Journal of Plastic Surgery |volume=17 |issue=1}}</ref> and is one of the most [[toxin|toxic]] of any vipers based on LD50 studies.<ref name="Mal03" /> The {{LD50}} values in mice vary: 0.4–2.0&nbsp;mg/kg [[Intravenous|IV]], 0.9–3.7&nbsp;mg/kg [[Peritoneum|IP]], 4.4–7.7&nbsp;mg/kg [[Subcutaneous injection|SC]].<ref name="Bro73" /> Mallow et al. (2003) gives a LD<span style="font-size:100%;"><sub>50</sub></span> range of 1.0–7.75&nbsp;mg/kg SC. Venom yield is typically between 100–350&nbsp;mg, with a maximum of 750&nbsp;mg.<ref name="Mal03" /> Brown (1973) mentions a venom yield of 180–750&nbsp;mg.<ref name="Bro73" /> About 100&nbsp;mg is thought{{by whom|date=October 2016}} to be enough to kill a healthy adult human male, with death occurring after 25&nbsp;hours. In humans, bites from this species can produce severe local and systemic symptoms. Based on the degree and type of local effect, bites can be divided into two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface [[extravasation]], and those with [[hemorrhage]]s evident as [[ecchymosis]], bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep [[necrosis]] and [[compartment syndrome]].<ref name="pmid21226389">{{cite journal |pmid=21226389 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/9565 |title=Case report: Hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of puff adder (Bitis arietans) bite |year=2010 |last1=Rainer |first1=PP |last2=Kaufmann |first2=P |last3=Smolle-Juettner |first3=FM |last4=Krejs |first4=GJ |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=395–8 |journal=Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine}}</ref> 

Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant [[hemorrhage]] or [[coagulation]] in the affected muscles.

====Rhinoceros viper====
[[File:Rhinocerous viper - Bitis nasicornis.jpg|thumb|Rhinoceros viper (''Bitis nasicornis'')]]
The [[Rhinoceros viper]] (''Bitis nasicornis'') is a large species of viper that is similar to the [[Gaboon viper]], but not as venomous, smaller and with a less dangerous bite. They are slow moving, but like other ''Bitis'' species, they're capable of striking quickly, forwards or sideways, without coiling first or giving a warning. Holding them by the tail is not safe; as it is somewhat prehensile, they can use it to fling themselves upwards and strike.<ref name="Mal03" /> They have been described as generally placid creatures, not as bad-tempered as the [[Bitis arietans|Puff adder]]. When approached, they often reveal their presence by hissing,<ref name="Mal03" /> said to be the loudest hiss of any African snake—almost a shriek.<ref name="Spa04" /> 

Relatively little is known about the toxicity and composition of the venom, but it has very minor neurotoxic, as well as hemotoxic venom, as do most other venomous snakes. The hemotoxic venom in rhinoceros vipers is much more dominant. This venom attacks the [[circulatory system]] of the snake's victim, destroying [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[blood vessel]]s. Internal bleeding also occurs. In mice, the intravenous {{LD50}} is 1.1&nbsp;mg/kg. The venom is supposedly slightly less toxic than those of the Puff adder and the Gaboon viper. The maximum wet venom yield is 200&nbsp;mg.<ref name="SB95" /> In only a few detailed reports of human envenomation, massive swelling, which may lead to necrosis, had been described.<ref name="SB95" /> In 2003, a man in [[Dayton, Ohio]], who was keeping a specimen as a pet, was bitten and subsequently died.<ref name="CC03">[http://www.channelcincinnati.com/news/2380861/detail.html Firefighter Dies After Bite From Pet Snake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060401022204/http://www.channelcincinnati.com/news/2380861/detail.html |date=2006-04-01 }} at [http://www.channelcincinnati.com/index.html channelcincinnati.com].

The [[Crotalus tigris|Tiger rattlesnake]] (''Crotalus tigris'') has a comparatively low [[venom]] yield<ref>Weinstein and Smith (1990)</ref> but is considered to have the most toxic of all rattlesnake venoms, and the highest venom toxicity of all snakes in the Western Hemisphere. Although they're reluctant to bite, tiger rattlensnakes are known to be cantankerous and aggressive . Because of their tendency to stand their ground and aggressively defend themselves, they pose a serious threat to humans. Tiger rattlesnake venom has a high [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] fraction that is [[antigen]]ically related to Mojave toxin (see ''[[Crotalus scutulatus]]'', venom A), and includes another component immunologically identical to crotamine, a [[myotoxin]] also found in tropical rattlesnakes (see ''[[Crotalus durissus#Venom|Crotalus durissus]]'').

Humans are rarely bitten by the tiger rattlesnake, and literature available on bites by this snake is scarce. The several recorded human envenomations by tiger rattlesnakes produced little local pain, swelling, or other reaction following the bite and, despite the toxicity of its venom, no significant systemic symptoms have been recorded. The comparatively low venom yield (6.4–11&nbsp;mg dried venom) and short {{convert|4.0|mm|cm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4.6|mm|cm|abbr=on}} fangs of the tiger rattlesnake possibly prevent severe envenoming in adult humans. However, the clinical picture could be much more serious if the person bitten was a child or an individual with a slight build. The early therapeutic use of [[antivenom]] is important if significant envenomation is suspected. Despite the low venom yield, a bite by this rattlesnake should be considered a life-threatening medical emergency. Untreated mortality rate is unknown.<ref name="Nor-C&L04" /><ref name="ctigris" />

The neotropical rattlesnake in Brazil is of special importance because of the high incidence of envenoming and mortality rates. Clinically, venom of this snake does not usually cause local effects at the bite site and is usually painless. However, the etiology progresses to systemic neurotoxic and myalgic symptoms, with frequent renal failure accompanied by acute tubular necrosis.<ref name="furtado">{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1678-91992003000200005 |title=Age-related biological activity of South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) venom |year=2003 |last1=Furtado |first1=M.

S. |journal=Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins Including Tropical Diseases |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=186–201}}</ref> The huge area of distribution, potent venom in fairly large quantities and a definite willingness to defend themselves are important factors in their dangerousness. In Brazil and probably also in other countries in their area of distribution, this species is probably the most dangerous rattlesnake. After the fer-de-lance (''Bothrops asper''), it is the most common cause of snake envenoming. In the first half of the 20th century as well as in the 1950s and 1960s, 12% of treated cases ended fatally. Untreated cases apparently had a mortality rate of 72% in the same period, but this was due to the fact that there was no antivenom, poor medical care and neglect (Rosenfeld, 1971). In more recent times, an average of 20,000 snakebites are registered each year in Brazil, almost 10% of them caused by the neotropical rattlesnake. The mortality rate is estimated at 3.3% and is thus much lower than in the past (Ribeiro, 1990b). A study from southeastern Brazil documented only one fatality from 87 treated cases (Silveira and Nishioka, 1992).<ref name="C.durissus">{{cite web|title=Venomous and Poisonous Animals Biology & Clinical Management|url=https://www.vapaguide.info/catalogue/TER-PIT-61|work=VAPAGuide|publisher=Biomedical database|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>

====Mojave rattlesnake====
[[File:Crotalus scutulatus 02.JPG|thumb|Mojave rattlesnake (''Crotalus scutulatus'')]]
The [[Mojave rattlesnake]] (''Crotalus scutulatus'') is another species which is considered to be dangerous. Although they have a reputation for being aggressive towards people, such behavior is not described in the scientific literature. Like other rattlesnakes, they will defend themselves vigorously when disturbed. The [[Peritoneum#Intraperitoneal|IP]] {{LD50}} value is 0.18&nbsp;mg/kg with an average venom yield between 50–150&nbsp;mg per bite. The most common subspecies of Mojave rattlesnake (type A) has venom that is considered to be one of the most debilitating and potentially deadly of all North American snakes, although chances for survival are very good if medical attention is sought as soon as possible after a bite.<ref name="cbsnews">"Mojave Green snake bites 6-year-old California boy, 42 vials of antivenom needed", Jaslow, Ryan, CBS News, 10 July 2012,  http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57469802-10391704/mojave-green-snake-bites-6-year-old-california-boy-42-vials-of-antivenom-needed/</ref> Based on median LD<sub>50</sub> values in lab mice, venom A from subspecies A Mojave rattlesnakes is more than ten times as toxic as venom B, from type B Mohave green rattlesnakes which lacks Mojave toxin.<ref>Hendon, R.A., A.L.

Medical treatment as soon as possible after a bite is critical to a positive outcome, dramatically increasing chances for survival.<ref name="cbsnews" /> However, venom B causes pronounced [[Proteolysis|proteolytic]] and [[Bleeding|hemorrhagic]] effects, similar to the bites of other rattlesnake species; these effects are significantly reduced or absent from bites by venom A snakes.<ref name="Norris">Norris RA. 2004.

All rattlesnake venoms are complex cocktails of enzymes and other proteins that vary greatly in composition and effects, not only between species, but also between geographic populations within the same species. The Mojave rattlesnake is widely regarded as producing one of the most toxic snake venoms in the New World, based on {{LD50}} studies in laboratory mice.<ref name="Glenn1">Glenn, J.L., R.C.Straight. 1982.

===Pit vipers===
====Malayan pit viper====
[[File:Calloselasma rhodostoma.jpg|thumb|Malayan pit viper (''Calloselasma rhodostoma'')]]
The [[Malayan pit viper]] (''Calloselasma rhodostoma'') is an Asian species of pitviper that is reputed to be an ill-tempered snake that is quick to strike in defense. This species is one of the main causes of snakebite envenoming in Southeast Asia. However, mortality rate among untreated bite victims is very low (1-10%).<ref name="cr">{{cite web|title=Calloselasma rhodostoma|url=http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&mode=PrintFriendly&id=SN0080|work=Clinical Toxinology Resource|publisher=University of Adelaide|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> Although bites are common, death is very rare. When a victim dies of a bite it is chiefly caused by haemorrhages and secondary infections.<ref name="Warrell86" /> Before specific antivenom became available, the mortality rate in hospitalised patients was around 1% (Reid et al. 1967a). In the study of Reid et al. (1963a), of a total of 291 patients with verified ''C. rhodostoma'' bites, only 2 patients died, and their deaths could only be indirectly attributed to the snakebites. One patient died of [[tetanus]] and one from a combination of an anaphylactic reaction to the antivenom, an intracerebral haemorrhage and severe pre-existing anaemia. In 23 fatalities due to ''C. rhodostoma'' bites recorded in northern Malaysia between 1955 and 1960, the average time between the bite and death was 64.6 h (5–240 h), the median time 32 h (Reid et al. 1963a). According to a study of fatal snakebites in rural areas of Thailand, 13 out of 46 were caused by ''C. rhodostoma'' (Looareesuwan et al. 1988). The local necrotising effect of the venom is a common cause of morbidity. [[Gangrene]] can lead to the loss of toes, fingers or whole extremities; chronic infections ([[osteomyelitis]]) can also occur.<ref name="Warrell86">{{cite book|last=Warrell|first=DA|title=Natural toxins : animal, plant, and microbial|year=1986|publisher=Clarendon Press; Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198541738|pages=25–45}}</ref> The intravenous {{LD50}} for Malayan pit viper venom is 6.1&nbsp;mg/kg mouse<ref name="Tan" /> and the average venom yield per bite is 40–60&nbsp;mg (dry weight).<ref name="cr" />

====Sharp-nosed pit viper====
[[File:Sharp-Nosed Viper 01.jpg|thumb|Sharp-nosed pit viper (''Deinagkistrodon acutus'')]]
The [[Deinagkistrodon acutus|Sharp-nosed pit viper or hundred pacer]] (''Deinagkistrodon acutus'') is another Asian species of pitviper that is medically important. This species is considered dangerous, and fatalities are not unusual. According to the U.S. Armed Forces Pest Management Board, the venom is a potent [[hemotoxin]] that is strongly hemorrhagic. Bite symptoms include severe local pain and bleeding that may begin almost immediately. This is followed by considerable swelling, blistering, necrosis, and ulceration.<ref name="afpmb">{{cite web|title=Deinagkistrodon acutus|url=http://www.afpmb.org/content/venomous-animals-d#Deinagkistrodonacutus|work=Armed Forces Pest Management Board|publisher=United States Army|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> Brown (1973) mentions a venom yield of up to 214&nbsp;mg (dried) and {{LD50}} values of 0.04&nbsp;mg/kg [[Intravenous|IV]], 4.0&nbsp;mg/kg [[Peritoneum|IP]] and 9.2-10.0&nbsp;mg/kg [[Subcutaneous injection|SC]].<ref name="Bro73" /> The envenomation rate is up to 80% and the untreated mortality rate is very low (1-10%).<ref name="da">{{cite web|title=Deinagkistrodon acutus|url=http://www.toxinology.com/fusebox.cfm?fuseaction=main.snakes.display&id=SN0081|work=Clinical Toxinology Resource|publisher=University of Adelaide|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> Antivenom is produced in China and Taiwan.<ref name="Meh87">Mehrtens JM. 1987.
