'''Plama Pleven''' (Плама Плевен) is a former [[Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] [[oil refinery]] located near the city of [[Pleven]]. The facility was opened in 1971 as a [[state owned company]]. In 1996, Plama Pleven was privatized by the [[Sofia]]-based company Euroenergy, but it filed for bankruptcy two years later.

== History ==
Plama Pleven was found in 1971 as a state-owned enterprise near the city of [[Pleven]] in the northern part of [[Bulgaria]]. In 1996, the facility was privatized by Euroenergy for 61.8 million BGN (before denomination) and a debt of 61.8 bn BGN (before denomination). The new owner failed to stabilize the refinery, and in 1998 an insolvency procedure started. The company officially announced bankruptcy in 1999. Following the bankruptcy, the assets were transferred to a new company called Nova Plama (Нова Плама), but production was not restored. Nova Plama subsequently went bankrupt in 2006.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/articles/50233/Plama+Pleven+Oil+Refinery+Bankrupts+2nd+Time “Plama Pleven Oil Refinery Bankrupts 2nd Time]</ref><ref>[http://sofiaecho.com/2011/10/18/1179697_plama-refinery-to-resume-production-in-december “Plama refinery to resume production in December]</ref> Rumors circulated about possible international investment from [[China]] or [[Iran]], but this never came to fruition. The facility remains closed to this day.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/articles/132991/Bulgaria+to+Launch+2nd+Refinery+in+Pleven “Bulgaria to Launch 2nd Refinery in Pleven"]</ref>

== Location ==
Plama Pleven was built near the city of Pleven in Northern Bulgaria. It was located in an area far from navigable rivers and coastlines. This location was chosen due to the small oil deposits in the region and for strategic military reasons as the only other Bulgarian refinery at that time, [[Neftochim]], now [[LUKOIL Neftochim Burgas]], was located in the [[Black Sea]] city of [[Bourgas]] near the Turkish border. <ref>[https://circabc.europa.eu/webdav/CircaBC/ESTAT/regportraits/Information/bg021_geo.htm “PLEVEN - Geography and history"]</ref> The facility's relative isolation is cited as a primary reason for the company's decision to file for bankruptcy.
