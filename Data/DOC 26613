Looks to go way back on the web, but I'm just not finding sources to pass [[WP:GNG]]. The majority of the article is currently links to lists that include the site (e.g. a section on "Library Recommended Lists"). Seems like it's pointedly trying to show notability but in the process hurting the article and failing in the attempt. &mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 19:50, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*Also, it's kind of secondary to the sourcing, but the site is basically a web relic -- a website directory with heavy advertising. --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 19:51, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I'm not seeing the in depth cverage and independence needed. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 09:20, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Did not find any independent reliable source with significant (or in fact any) coverage about the topic to meet [[WP:GNG]]. I admit I didn't search long; the name's generic quality makes it challenging to search. No sources are currently cited in the article. I read the previous discussion and simply disagree with the rationale that "keep" voters applied, i.e. that reliable sources are unnecessary because links on independent websites (Yahoo, NASA, etc.) that describe the site are sufficient. I'll check back here in case someone posts reliable sources that I overlooked. [[User:Agyle|Agyle]] ([[User talk:Agyle|talk]]) 22:40, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
