'''Mount Carmel''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi]], United States.

Once a thriving 19th-century community, little remains today of Mount Carmel but a museum located within a historic home.

==History==
Mount Carmel is one of the oldest settlements in Jefferson Davis County.<ref name="NPS">{{cite web | title = Holloway, John Fielding, House - National Register of Historic Places Registration Form | publisher = U.S. National Park Service | date = September 27, 1994 | url = http://www.apps.mdah.ms.gov/nom/prop/15411.pdf}}</ref>

Mt. Zion Methodist Church was established near Mount Carmel in 1817.<ref>{{cite web | last = Riner | first = Steve | title = Mt.

John Ragan, a Revolutionary soldier from Virginia, laid out the town in 1819, in what was then [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]].<ref name="NPS"/><ref name="SP">{{cite web | title = Mt.

The town also had a well-regarded co-educational school, Mount Carmel Academy, which opened prior to 1830.  At one point it had 70 to 80 students.  The school moved in 1845.<ref name="NPS"/><ref>{{cite book | title = Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Mississippi, Part 1 | publisher = Firebird Press | year = 1891 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eMX-Snn_mEsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 311}}</ref>

Benjamin L.C. Wailes traveled through the community in 1852 and wrote in his journal:
<blockquote>After crossing [the] Bouie over a bridge (passing through the bottom land in which there is a good deal of large oak & gum mixed with some Shortleaf pine) ascended a considerable eminence to a level table land of Oak and hickory, on which the village of Mount Carmel is situated.  About 70 inhabitants. Two or three considerable Country Stores. More business [is] done [here] than at Williamsburg, and the situation is much handsomer, & the buildings (tho' plain frame) [are] better.<ref name="NPS"/></blockquote>

Around 1873, John Fielding Holloway built a large house in Mount Carmel, and it remains the community's only 19th-century structure.<ref name="NPS"/>

Mount Carmel was by-passed during the construction of the [[Gulf and Ship Island Railroad]] in 1899, and the [[Mississippi Central Railroad]] in 1903.  As a result, many businesses and residents moved to one of the nearby railway towns of [[Prentiss, Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Prentiss]], [[Bassfield, Mississippi|Bassfield]], or [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]].<ref name="NPS"/>  In 1904, Mount Carmel was officially unincorporated.<ref name="NPS"/>

The nearly abandoned community began to grow again during the early 20th century, when African-Americans began purchasing land in the town and surrounding community.  The new community began to prosper, and contained all the essential services, goods and farm products needed for self-sufficiency.<ref name="NPS"/>  In 1911, Robert Decatur "Cap" Polk, a leading African-American planter and businessmen, purchased the Holloway House, and installed a large and modern farm on the nearby property.<ref name="NPS"/>  Now called the [[John Fielding Holloway House]], it remains one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in Jefferson Davis County.  The home is a historical and cultural center, and tours are available.<ref>{{cite web | title = Holloway-Polk House Historical and Cultural Center | publisher = Holloway-Polk House Historical and Cultural Center | url = http://www.hphhcc.org/ | accessdate = May 2014}}</ref>
