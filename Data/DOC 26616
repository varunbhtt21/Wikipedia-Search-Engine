The group's members, [[Sarah Versprille]] and [[Daniel Hindman]], first met while college students in [[New Jersey]], they lived in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and both moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] in 2011, playing in the group [[Vetiver (band)|Vetiver]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pure-bathing-culture-mn0002995164/biography Pure Bathing Culture] at [[AllMusic]]</ref> Around 2012 they began playing live shows, and released an EP produced by [[Richard Swift (singer-songwriter)|Richard Swift]] in 2012 on [[Father/Daughter Records]]. The band toured in the US opening for [[Caveman(Band)|Caveman]] and [[Father John Misty]]. 

The band released its first full-length album on [[Partisan Records]] in 2013. The album was highlighted by the single, "Pendulum", which some critics likened in style to [[Fleetwood Mac]]. One of the tracks, "Scotty", drew its lyrics and melody in part from the 1980 hit single "[[Into the Night (Benny Mardones song)|Into the Night]]" by [[Benny Mardones]]. Touring for this release included a full US tour opening for [[Widowspeak]], followed by co-headline tour with [[La Luz (band)|La Luz]] and another full US tour opening for [[Tennis (band)|Tennis]] in the fall of 2014.

The band recorded their second full length record with producer [[John Congleton]] in February 2015 in Dallas, Texas. The band released its second full-length album on Partisan Records, Pray for Rain, which was released on October 23rd, 2015. 
[[The Guardian]] said: "And it’s their strength with melodies that will keep listeners coming back…..they prove they have a sparklingly sure touch for the purest kind of guitar pop, with a song whose arpeggiated guitar line is a smile set to music."  This release was followed by a country-wide headlining tour as well as a headlining tour in the UK with sold out shows in Manchester and London. More touring in the US followed in 2016 including opening slots for [[Lucius]], [[Chvrches]], and [[Death Cab For Cutie]].

In 2017 the band toured opening for [[Death Cab For Cutie]] and [[The Shins]] and began work on their third full length record with producer [[Tucker Martine]].

On April 26, 2019 the band released their third full-length, "Night Pass" on new indie label Infinite Companion. Produced by [[Tucker Martine]], recorded at Flora Recording and Playback in their hometown, Portland, OR, "Night Pass" is record about perseverance and the lasting strength of love. [[Pitchfork (website)]] summated the experiences as follows, "Pure Bathing Culture juxtapose the highs with the lows, packaging distress as euphoria. The album does its most interesting work on songs like “Moonrise” and “Thin Growing Thing,” where Versprille wails, “Do you want to take it higher?,” as if in homage to Steve Winwood’s 1986 hit “Higher Love.” At its best, Night Pass flaunts the sounds that might have embarrassed you in your dad’s station wagon: the noodly electrified riffs of Fleetwood Mac’s Tango in the Night or the earnest soulfulness of Peter Gabriel’s So." <ref>https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pure-bathing-culture-night-pass/</ref> The band will tour with [[Lucius]] and [[American Football (band)]] in support of the record this summer.
