:({{Find sources|2014 Kramatorsk clashes}})
This article is a [[WP:FORK]]. It was created yesterday, for no apparent reason, and contains no original content. All of it is either a duplication of or copied from [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]], [[Timeline of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]], or [[Donetsk People's Republic]]. We don't need another timeline. We've already got one. There is no indication that the separate events described here are found grouped together in reliable sources as the 'Kramatorsk clashes'. Let's get this out of the way. [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 19:58, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Keep''' - As the creator of this article I would like to state the following. Wikipedia always urges that material be relegated to other newer sub-articles from another article so that article's size could be cut-down. Which in fact I intended to do today. I intended to cut down those other two articles to only the basic information since the info is now in this one. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 20:01, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:That is unacceptable, however, because it is giving [[WP:UNDUE]] weight to certain events in ways that are not found in reliable sources. Furthermore, these events are not at all described in reliable sources as the 'Kramatorsk clashes', nor are they grouped together. It is functionally a piece of original research.

::Regardless, the timeline already is a sub-article for that purpose. [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 20:06, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:::The timeline is a sub-article but it does not contain all of the information that is here. Also, there are multiple precedens for this kind of article. I would refer you to [[Rif Dimashq clashes (November 2011–March 2012)]], [[Idlib Governorate clashes (September 2011–March 2012)]], [[2012 Aleppo Governorate clashes]], [[Deir ez-Zor clashes (2011–present)]] where you don't have any source calling the events in that way but the names of the articles and both the templates are virtually the same to this one. I can find more examples if you like. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 20:08, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:Sadly, as we all know, one can read the essay [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]]. Just because other stuff does exist, that does not mean it should exist. Wikipedia is not based on precedent. Regardless, those are quite different situations, as they are not adequately covered elsewhere, and because they are large, extended events over a period of time. Everything in this article is covered elsewhere adequately, and avoids giving [[WP:UNDUE]] weight. This article has no basis for existence. If you're trying to imply the events here are comparable to the events in those articles, then you are using a [[WP:CRYSTAL]] ball, and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. At present, these events do not have notability on their own as a specific chain of events.

::If you would read that policy more carefully it states further ''In consideration of precedent and consistency, though, identifying articles of the same nature that have been established and continue to exist on Wikipedia may provide extremely important insight into general notability of concepts, levels of notability...'' The Kramatorsk incidents/clashes have been notable enough in the media since both pro-Western and pro-Russian media have been reporting on them in detail every time they appear. Also, that policy states the exact opposite should maybe used as well. That as much this article should not exist and the others should, it works viceversa as well, with maybe this one needing to exist and the others don't. And the crystal ball policy does not apply hear because I wasn't making a prediction, but a comparison. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 20:16, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

:That would be true, except that this does not meet the core policies of the project. I'd also like to clarify that [[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]] is an essay, not a policy. They haven't been notable on their own. All incidents regarding Kramatorsk in the western media have been reported in larger articles about the unrest in Donetsk Oblast as a whole, as an example. We've matched that style of coverage well, as there simply isn't enough content to warrant an independent article. You are making a prediction. You are implying that these events will continue happening, and thereby warrant keeping this article, even if it does not meet the standards at present.

::''as there simply isn't enough content to warrant an independent article'' Wikipedia does not have a policy on how much content is needed for an independent article. ''You are implying that these events will continue happening, and thereby warrant keeping this article'' I am not implying or predicting anything, I am stating fact, and fact is these events have already BEEN occurring for the last three weeks. And that time period is with which this article deals with. In any case, I stated my '''compromise proposition''', that if other editors agree, '''I will cut-down those other two articles in material so this one wouldn't be a fork''', which in fact was my original intention today. '''That way your own objectional issue to this article will no longer apply.''' But now I will wait before doing so until other editors voice their oppinions.[[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 20:25, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:My objection is in you giving these events [[WP:UNDUE]] weight. The other articles cannot be trimmed, as that would be giving these events [[WP:UNDUE]] weight. It is inappropriate, at yet, for there to be yet another article dealing with events that have already been adequately described elsewhere, and which do not have enough notability to separate them out as a separate 'Kramatorsk clashes' article.

::They are not notable in your opinion, not the media who report on them daily. And your argument that isn't true because they are talked about as only part of the larger unrest in Ukraine is simply in-correct because you have whole news articles devoted to specific incidents, for example the attack on the airbase which left up to 11 anti-Kiev fighters dead, or the alleged killing of 10 civilians. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 20:33, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::We are [[WP:NOTNEWS]]. We don't write journalistic articles. We look at the overall schema of things, in terms of historicity. They are notable in the context of the overall unrest, they are not notable enough for their own encyclopaedic article.

:::Like I said, your opinion. And I would say some of the things you just said are in contrast to Wikipedia'c policy on notability (ignoring what sources/media regard as notable). I would even venture to say that we deciding on our own the overall schema of things is Original Research in itself. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 20:40, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

To be honest, I think this article should not be deleted. I'm not trying to take sides, though. -Arbutusthetree  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Arbutus the tree|contribs]]) 20:24, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Delete''' - per nom, it's a FORK. Also, judging by their edit history EkoGraf and Arbutus the tree are probably the same user (the cross interest in Ukrainian and Syrian topics). I also seem to remember that there was a portfolio of other SPA accounts with the same interests that got recently banned as sock puppets but I'll have to dig out the relevant SPI.[[User:Volunteer Marek|Volunteer Marek]] ([[User talk:Volunteer Marek|talk]]) 20:54, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::I am highly offended by your accusation Volunteer Marek. I only became interested in Ukraine this morning. For the last three years I have been editing Syrian articles and before that Libyan (check my edit history). And that other user seems more interested in Iraq than Syria. I'm seeing he edited only one Syrian article [[Free Syrian Army]] (once) and the semi-Syrian article ISIS (several times). [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 21:14, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

Volunteer Marek, i'm a bit confused what's going on, because EkoGraf and Arbutus the tree are not the same users. I run my own independent user, and it's ridiculous to claim EkoGraaf and Arbutus the tree are the same users. Plus, I only just found out today that the "Kramatorsk Clashes" page had been made. Plus, i only just signed up for wikipedia recently. -Arbutus the Tree  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Arbutus the tree|contribs]]) 21:54, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Keep''' - Cutting down on those articles and merging that information here would be helpful for people who want to know the details about Kramatorsk alone, rather than to search for it in the timeline. There is also information from [[Siege of Sloviansk]] about Kramatorsk that should be here, such as the attack on Gen. Vasyl Krutov. I myself would like to see this article expanded, and believe the creation of more sub-articles for the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]] is a positive thing. The Siege of Sloviansk, which was originally named the Sloviansk Standoff, could arguably have been deleted or merged over the same issue. [[User:SkoraPobeda|SkoraPobeda]] ([[User talk:SkoraPobeda|talk]]) 16:11, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::Not true, however, because the [[Siege of Sloviansk]] article is  highly notable in its own right, and only pertains to one ongoing event. The same cannot be said for the Kramatorsk article, which puts together unrelated events that are not directly connected.

::: But the Ukrainian military is carrying out the "anti-terrorist" operation in and around Kramatorsk similarly to Sloviansk. The only difference here is that they've entered the city. Also, multiple media outlets are just now reporting of the fighting in Kramatorsk, giving it notability that wasn't there before.  [[User:SkoraPobeda|SkoraPobeda]] ([[User talk:SkoraPobeda|talk]]) 16:56, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:This is somewhat true. However, the article, as it stands, isn't about the military operation at present. It is lumping together all events in the city over a longer duration. This does not seem appropriate. I might be accepting on article that only dealt with the present military events, which perhaps would now be justified by reliable sources. However, it should not include events not related to the present skirmishes.

::Alright, I agree with keeping the article with present events. [[User:SkoraPobeda|SkoraPobeda]] ([[User talk:SkoraPobeda|talk]]) 17:40, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

Perhaps this article could be merged with the Seige of Sloviansk?--[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 17:56, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:Two different towns, two different events, two different military operations. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 18:58, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*That's true —[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 19:02, 4 May 2014 (UTC)be 
:::I don't agree with that merger, but [[User:EkoGraf]] has just hit the nail on the head. The article here can exist if it describes the present military operation. However, lumping other events in that are not part of that military operation goes against the way reliable sources cover the events. I'll say definitively that I'll withdraw my deletion request if the scope is limited to the present military operation, and if this article expands its coverage of that operation.

:It was, but it wasn't separate from the overall events. The present operation in Kramatorsk is independent of the others, at least in the manner that it is reported upon.

::They are not the same operation. There was a new offensive, over the past couple of days. This is entirely separate from the re-capture of the airfield weeks ago.

Allright guys, I have 3 solutions we could try:

*'''1'''. Keep the "Kramatorsk Clashes" but have information that is only from the May offensive 
*'''2'''. Keep the "Kramatorsk Clashes" and have information from the early operation (April 15.)
*'''3'''. Make 2 seperate articles. One could been called the "1st Kramatorsk Offensive", which is from April 15-16. The 2nd could be the "2nd Kramatorsk Offensive", which is from the May Offensive. --[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 20:56, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:I'm ether for option 2 or option 3. [[User:RGloucester]]? [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 21:00, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::Neither are acceptable. Both give [[WP:UNDUE]] weight. [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 21:12, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
Okay, so that didn't work. So would it be good to create an article called the "Kramatorsk" offensive with only information about the recent offensive? Allthough if that is the solution, in the "history" part of the article, it should say that Ukrainian troops captured the airfield on April 15 and unsuccessfully tried to take the town a day later. Is that okay? --[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 21:19, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

::I would accept this solution. A small background section is not a problem. [[User:RGloucester|<span style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:12pt;color:#000000">RGloucester </span>]] — [[User talk:RGloucester|☎]] 21:41, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
Thank you RTGloucester for your cooperation. Do you think this is okay EkoGraf? This solution would have the article "Kramstorsk Offensive" with information up from May 2 and a background section with the military operation on April 15 with info about the airfield capture? --[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 21:49, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Isn't that in essence option number 2, just putting the airfield captured into a background section? :P In any case, agree. Also include the militant attack on the airfield that destroyed the helicopter and the place in the background section. [[User:EkoGraf|EkoGraf]] ([[User talk:EkoGraf|talk]]) 23:15, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:{{Ping|EkoGraf}} It isn't the same to me, as it avoids lumping together separate events. The article's scope will be the offensive, but background details will be presented as such so that the reader is informed of what led to the offensive. My problem with this article, as I've said, is the way it lumps together events in ways that are not found in sources, and which give [[WP:UNDUE]] weight. Regardless, if you are willing to accept this proposal, I will withdraw my deletion request.

Okay, so if the April 15. offensive and the militant attack on the helicopter were included in the background section of the article, would that be okay?—[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 23:36, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
