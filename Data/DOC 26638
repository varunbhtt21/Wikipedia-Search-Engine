'''''Diodia virginiana''''' is a plant species in the  [[Rubiaceae]], common name '''Virginia buttonweed'''. It is a spreading, matted perennial with opposite leaves, often mottled because of a virus that attacks the foliage. Flowers are white, cross-shaped with 4 petals. Fruits are green, often floating on water. The species can become a nuisance weed, hard to eradicate because of underground parts that remain behind when you try to pull up the plant.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tennesseeturfgrassweeds.org/admin/Lists/Fact%20Sheets/Attachments/9/W147.pdf |title=Turf Grass Science at the University of Tennessee, Virginia Buttonweed (''Diodia virginiana'') |access-date=2014-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503224858/http://www.tennesseeturfgrassweeds.org/admin/Lists/Fact%20Sheets/Attachments/9/W147.pdf |archive-date=2014-05-03 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>
