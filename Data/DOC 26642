*'''Delete'''. Page was created by an SPA and left to languish but there was no info from RS to add anyway. Article topic lacks [[WP:GNG|significant coverage]] from [[WP:RS|reliable]], [[WP:IS|independent sources]]. <small>([[WP:42|?]])</small> It didn't pass a [[Wikipedia:Search engine test|search engine test]] or have more than a listing in a [[WP:VG/RS|video game reliable sources]] search. Please ping me if more (esp. non-English and offline) sources show in the future.
