This information would likely be noted in the articles it relates to rather than have its own article, as it's merely a collection of three existing games without any notable changes.  [[User:Jns4eva|Jns4eva ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]] ([[User talk:Jns4eva|talk]]) 20:08, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. It's pretty much just a disambiguation page at this point, when you get down to it. There just hasn't been enough coverage to really justify it having an article. We could always, at best, mention this in the articles. We could probably redirect this to the earliest game in the trilogy (I think it's [[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon (video game)]]) and say "Tom Clancy's Classic Trilogy redirects here, for the other two games see ____ and ____".

*'''Redirect''' per {{u|Tokyogirl79}}. Somebody will come looking for it.  [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 13:47, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[Tom Clancy#Video games]] (to later expand out [[Wikipedia:Summary style|summary style]]). There are a fair number of hits in a [[WP:VG/RS]] search, but the main ones (from IGN) can be summarized in the Tom Clancy article, if even necessary to include at all. I'm surprised there isn't a [[Tom Clancy games]] overview article, but that would be the natural resting place once it exists. For now, Clancy's article is a fine location. However, this package itself does not have independent notability for its own article. <span style='font:1.1em"Avenir";padding:1px 3px;border:1px solid #909;color:#909'>czar&nbsp;[[User:Czar|<font color="#909">♔</font>]]</span> 03:23, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
