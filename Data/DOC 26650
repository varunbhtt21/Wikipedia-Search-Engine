'''David Bradley''' (born 1954) is a [[Minnesota Chippewa Tribe|Minnesota Chippewa]] artist.

==Personal life==
Born in [[Minnesota]] in 1954, many of Bradley's early years were in the [[Minneapolis]] metropolitan area until his family was split up and redistributed, having fallen victim to the prevailing view of what constituted an adequate family. In 1970, he left Minnesota and began a journey starting in the [[Southwestern United States]] and taking him through [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] — where he lived for a year with [[Maya peoples|Mayan Indians]] — before his return to the U.S where he spent time among the [[Navajo|Navajo Indians]] in Arizona.<ref>Bradley, David (1991). “Restless Native.”  Plains Art Museum {{ISBN|0934266328}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}  After receiving training at the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]] (IAIA), and went on to receive a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Fine Arts]] from the [[College of Santa Fe]] in 1980.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manifestations: New Native Art Criticism|last=<!--same as publisher-->|first=|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Native Arts|year=2011|isbn=9780615489049|location=Santa Fe, NM (USA)|pages=86|oclc=904871040}}</ref>

==Artistic career==

===Early work===

{{Quote|text=When I first entered the somewhat glamorous world of professional art, I thought I would steer clear of politics and keep my life as simple and positive as possible.  Eventually, I realized that Indians are, by definition, political beings … I saw the continual exploitation of the Indian art community by museums in the Southwest … I witnessed multi-million dollar fraud by pseudo-Indian artists … and so [I] began to speak out on what I saw as widespread corruption in the art world.|sign=David Bradley|source=<ref>Hill, Rick, ed. (1992). "Creativity Is Our Tradition: Three Decades of Contemporary Art at the Institute of American Indian Arts." Institute of American Indian Arts {{ISBN|1881396045}}.</ref>}}

=== Activism ===
{{Quote|text=To be an artist from the Indian world carries with it certain responsibilities. We have an opportunity to promote Indian truths and at the same time help dispel the myths and stereotypes that are projected upon us. I consider myself an at-large representative and advocate of the Chippewa people and American Indians in general. It is a responsibility which I do not take lightly.|sign=David Bradley<ref name=":0"/>|source=}}
