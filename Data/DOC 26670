Comparison of individual products/models. [[WP:NOTCATALOG|Wikipedia is not a catalog]]. This is an article that is perpetually out of date (somewhat relevant is [[WP:RECENT]]). An encyclopedia shouldn't duplicate a consumer electronics retailer's product comparison tool. Of course, if the point of the list is not to list current models but all tablet models, then the problem is [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]]. &mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 20:24, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I agree that (part of) the list may already be a little out of date. However, many devices can still be attained from 2nd hand websites. The reason the article was made is not so much to list the commercial devices, but to allow people to compare these devices and pick the best (cheapest) option for them so that they can attain useful information trough it (ie via wikipedia). It wasn't made to compare the commercial devices ''an sich''. [[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 08:04, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
**But Wikipedia is [[WP:NOT|not]] a buying guide or a product comparison site. Allowing people to compare in order to pick the best is not a reason for keeping. --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 15:55, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' This list serves a purpose. Enough for it, not to be deleted. <span style="text-shadow:#333333 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em;">[[User:Harsh_2580|Harsh]]</span>[[User talk:Harsh_2580|<font color="blue"> <small>(talk) </small></font>]] 13:23, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
**That it serves a purpose or is [[WP:USEFUL]] is an [[WP:AADD|argument to avoid in deletion discussions]]. --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 15:55, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' I'm a programmer an often i need to use this list to know which tablets exist, and their specs such as width an height in pixels.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/193.136.33.133|193.136.33.133]] ([[User talk:193.136.33.133|talk]]) 10:16, 9 May 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
