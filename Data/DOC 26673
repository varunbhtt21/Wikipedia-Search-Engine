The '''Prejmer fortified church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica fortificată din Prejmer}}; {{lang-de|Kirchenburg von Tartlau}}) is a [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheran]] [[fortified church]] in [[Prejmer]] (''Tartlau''), [[Brașov County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]] and the ethnographic area of the [[Burzenland]]. The church was founded by the Germanic [[Teutonic Knights]], and then was eventually taken over by the [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community. Initially [[Roman Catholic]], it became Lutheran following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Together with the surrounding village, the church forms part of the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

===Background and church===
Around 1211, King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] permitted the knights to settle around Prejmer, where they began constructing a church<ref name="com"/> in 1218,<ref name="org"/> in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].<ref name="djc"/> They were responsible for the Greek cross plan, the only one of its kind in Transylvania, but found in a few churches in northeast Germany.<ref name="com">{{ro icon}} [http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/prejmer___tartlau/89/ Prejmer/Tartlau] at biserici-fortificate.com</ref> Following their expulsion in 1225, the [[Cistercians]], who took over in 1240, finished the church.<ref name="org">{{ro icon}} [http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/prejmer-tartlau/ Prejmer/Tartlau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504001623/http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/prejmer-tartlau/ |date=2014-05-04 }} at biserici-fortificate.org</ref><ref name="djc"/>

The [[triptych]] [[altarpiece]], the oldest in the province, dates to around 1450; the main panel is joined to side panels painted on both faces, on two levels. The entire piece depicts scenes from the ''[[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]''. The ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]'' is the central subject,<ref name="com"/> four times the size of the other panels, over half this panel is gilt. The front side panels show the ''[[Foot washing|Washing of the Feet]]'', the ''[[Last Supper]]'', the ''[[Flagellation of Christ|Flagellation]]'' and the ''[[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Judgement of Caiaphas]]''; the rear has the ''Weeping Women'', the ''[[Entombment of Christ|Entombment]]'', the ''[[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]'' and the ''[[Myrrhbearers]]''. The figures are simple and reduced to their essentials, their movements restrained or even statuesque, their clothing unruffled. The backgrounds are cursory, with the interiors showing only slight attention to [[Perspective (graphical)|geometric perspective]]. The colors are vivid, with the reds given a particular glow by the gilt background.<ref name="dragut">[[Vasile Drăguț]], ''Arta gotică în România'', p.247. Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 1979</ref> The artist is unknown but was presumably trained in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] school.<ref name="com"/> A bell tower was added above the center of the church in 1461. The Greek cross shape was modified between 1512 and 1515: two side [[nave]]s of unequal size were added while the main one was extended. The interior is simple and does not have traces of frescoes, while 19th century paintings were removed during restoration.<ref name="org"/>

===Fortifications and recognition===
When [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces or other invaders would break through the [[Buzău Pass]], Prejmer was the first place they encountered;<ref name="com"/> the village was destroyed over 50 times between the 13th and 17th centuries, while the church was only rarely captured.<ref name="org"/> Due to this strategic position, the church was strongly fortified<ref name="org"/> in the 15th-16th centuries.<ref name="djc"/> After [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] ordered defensive systems to be built in the Burzenland, high, strong walls were built and surrounded with a water-filled [[moat]]. It seems that a subterranean tunnel linked the church to the exterior. The circular walls are up to 5 m thick and reach nearly 12 m in height. The circular walls surround the church, while a second and smaller wall sits atop the arched passage at the entrance gate.<ref name="com"/> Other defensive features include five towers and a [[battlement]]. On the interior side of the wall, there are four levels containing rooms and storage space and backed by the battlement. The over 270 rooms could offer shelter to some 1600 villagers in case of attack. Entry into the complex is made through a 30 m long tunnel protected by a [[portcullis]] with wooden grilles strengthened by iron and powerful oak doors.<ref name="org"/> To the right of the entrance stands a large [[barbican]].<ref name="djc"/>

Frequently damaged or altered,<ref name="com"/> with the last stage of extensions and modifications happening in the 18th century,<ref name="djc">{{ro icon}} [http://www.brasov.djc.ro/ObiectiveDetalii.aspx?ID=1039 Ansamblul bisericii Evanghelice C. A. fortificate Prejmer] at the Brașov County Cultural Affairs Office site</ref> Prejmer was restored to its original form following a restoration between 1960 and 1970.<ref name="com"/> The site is now a museum, visitors can see some of the wall rooms, climbing the many stairs and walking the corridors that join them along the wall, eventually reaching the [[battlement]]s on the outside.<ref name="org"/> In 1999, Prejmer, together with five other places, was added to the already-listed [[Biertan]] to form the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165 "World Heritage Committee Inscribes 48 New Sites on Heritage List"] at the UNESCO site</ref> Additionally, the church is listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by Romania's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], with the following being listed as separate entries: the inner wall and rooms, the outer wall, the barbican, the battlement and the arched [[Long gallery|gallery]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_BV.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Braşov]</ref>
