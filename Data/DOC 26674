Article is well-sourced.  Hook is 190 characters long (under the 200 character max. limit) and is interesting.  Refs 7 and 10 (verifying the hook) are both reliable sources; the former is an offline source (hence AGF as reliable), while the latter is from ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.  QPQ done.  Looks good to go! â€”[[User:Bloom6132|Bloom6132]] ([[User talk:Bloom6132|talk]]) 16:50, 21 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
