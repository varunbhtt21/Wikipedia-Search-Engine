Comparison of individual products/models. [[WP:NOTCATALOG|Wikipedia is not a catalog]]. This is an article that is perpetually out of date (somewhat relevant is [[WP:RECENT]]). An encyclopedia shouldn't duplicate a consumer electronics retailer's product comparison tool. Also, [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]] as it makes no justification for the 12"-13.3" size range ([[subnotebook]] does not declare such a class). Finally, if the point of the list is not to list current models but all 12" - 13.3" subnotebook models, then the problem is much more clearly [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]]. &mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 20:28, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

::'''Keep''' I agree that (part of) the list may already be a little out of date. However, many devices can still be attained from 2nd hand websites. The reason the article was made is not so much to list the commercial devices, but to allow people to compare these devices and pick the best (cheapest) option for them so that they can attain useful information trough it (ie via wikipedia). It wasn't made to compare the commercial devices ''an sich''. [[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 08:04, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:::'''Comment''' - {{tq|to allow people to compare these devices and pick the best (cheapest) option for them so that they can attain useful information trough it (ie via wikipedia)}} -- specifically violates [[WP:NOT]]. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a buying guide or tool for price shopping. --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 14:25, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''.  Inherently non-notable topic.  A ''list of presently available 13.3 inch subnotebooks'' will continually be out of date.  -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 03:19, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' inherently out of scope, impossible to maintain and keep current (in fact it looks like it's already out of date).  No way this could reasonably be maintained and it's of no encyclopedic value even if it were.
