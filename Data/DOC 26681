Comparison of individual products/models. [[WP:NOTCATALOG|Wikipedia is not a catalog]]. This is an article that is perpetually out of date. An encyclopedia shouldn't duplicate a consumer electronics retailer's product comparison tool. If the point of the list is not to list current models but all subnotebook models ever manufactured, then the problem is much more clearly [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE]]. &mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 20:29, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:I created the page in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comparison_of_subnotebooks&dir=prev&action=history May 2008 from a previous page]. At that time, 7-9 inch netbooks were attracting significant interest for the surprising sales volume of a low cost device that shipped with a Linux operating system. Tablets and lower priced Ultrabooks have eaten up the market now. The [[Netbook]] article covers this now. The EeePC was influential and groundbreaking, and so has its own article, but most of the more recent devices aren't groundbreaking and don't warrant much interest anymore. The [[EeePC]] article notes "In January 2013, Asus officially ended production of their Eee PC series due to declining sales as a result of consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks" and so there isn't much point in listing the comparison between 7-9 inch devices as there was when they were seen as influential in the future of the space.
