==Early life, education and early career==
Vigil grew up at Nambé Pueblo, New Mexico. He began his career as a financial and business consultant in New Mexico and [[Washington, D.C.]] after earning a business degree from [[Eastern New Mexico University]], located in [[Portales, New Mexico|Portales]], New Mexico. But by the early 1980s, he began to realize that his life in Washington gave him "nothing to feed his soul". A performance called "Night of the First Americans"{{clarify|date=July 2015|reason=what type of performance?   dance? musical?  performance art?}} at the [[Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C., inspired him to return to New Mexico, where he began working exclusively as a [[micaceous]] [[clay]] potter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Vigil|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PEM_artscape/pdf/lonnie_vigil_reference-01.pdf|publisher= [[Peabody Essex Museum]] |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Vigil|url=https://sarweb.org/?artist_lonnie_vigil-p:artist_dubin_fellowship_recipients|publisher= [[School for Advanced Research]] |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

==Art career==
Vigil is singularly credited with reviving unpainted, micaceous pottery and establishing its credibility as a contemporary art form.<ref>{{cite web|title=Micaceous Pottery Jar|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/micaceous-pottery-jar/BwFVi9RPVCinww?hl=en|publisher= [[Google Cultural Institute]]/[[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]]|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>  He defines himself as a "PhD" in his field.<ref>{{cite web|last=Godreche|first=Dominique|title=10 Elegant Jars by Nambe Pueblo Potter Lonnie Vigil|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/10-elegant-jars-nambe-pueblo-potter-lonnie-vigil-153964| work = [[Indian Country Today Media Network]] | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

An expert in micaceous clay pottery, he takes classic ceramic techniques and refines them to push the medium beyond the expected norms.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Grimes, John R. |author2=Feest, Christian F. |author3=Curran, Mary Lou |title=Native American Art From the Peabody Essex Museum|date=2002|publisher = [[American Federation of Arts]]; [[University of Washington Press]]|location = New York City; Seattle|isbn=0-295-98240-3|page=66}}</ref>

He works primarily in micaceous clay, which is characterized by its sparkling mica flecks, using Nambe clay and slip and traditional outdoor firing techniques.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Vigil|url=https://sarweb.org/?artist_lonnie_vigil-p:artist_dubin_fellowship_recipients|publisher= [[School for Advanced Research]] |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>  He hand-gathers the clay for each of his pieces, adding sand to make it workable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Godreche|first=Dominique|title=10 Elegant Jars by Nambe Pueblo Potter Lonnie Vigil|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/10-elegant-jars-nambe-pueblo-potter-lonnie-vigil-153964| work = [[Indian Country Today Media Network]] | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

Like many contemporary ceramic artists in the [[American Southwest]], Vigil preserves the traditions of his culture while pursuing his own creative initiatives. His artworks reflect the style of his ancestors{{spaced ndash}} hand-built forms used for cooking and storage.

He attributes his success as an artist to the guidance of his great-grandmother, Perfilia Anaya Pena, and great-aunts, who are also potters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lonnie Vigil|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PEM_artscape/pdf/lonnie_vigil_reference-01.pdf|publisher= [[Peabody Essex Museum]] |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

For him, each instance of making a pot is an encounter with [[Earth Mother]] and with his Nambe [[pueblo]] ancestors who worked the clay before him. He believes that each pot "speaks to the continuity in the identity of family and community", but is simultaneously an act of connection between the potter, Earth Mother, and the ancestral spirits that guide them.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Grimes, John R. |author2=Haukaas, Thomas |author3=Curran, Mary Lou |author4=Kramer, Karen |title=Power and Beauty|journal= [[American Indian Art Magazine]]|issue=Winter 2003|page=55|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PEM_artscape/pdf/e3780_-_e302691_reference.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

===Creative process===
"There is collaboration between the clay and myself{{spaced ndash}} the clay tells me what direction to take. I let the pot dry in the house for a day or two, then take it outside, and smooth the surface. My pots are traditional, and I follow the techniques of my ancestors{{spaced ndash}} except for the asymmetricals I have created. In the past, Pueblo people cooked in clay, using pots for everything. It is not that common anymore; they mostly use them for special occasions."<br /> –Lonnie Vigil<ref>{{cite web|last=Godreche|first=Dominique|title=10 Elegant Jars by Nambe Pueblo Potter Lonnie Vigil|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/10-elegant-jars-nambe-pueblo-potter-lonnie-vigil-153964| work = [[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>
