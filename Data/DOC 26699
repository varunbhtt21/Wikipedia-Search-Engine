'''Nathan Begaye''' (1969–2010) was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ceramics artist of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Hopi]] descent.

==Background==
Nathan Begaye was born in Phoenix, Arizona in 1969 to a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] father and a [[Hopi]] mother.<ref name=free>Clark, Garth. ''Free Spirit: The New Native American Potter.'' Hertogenbosch, Netherlands: Stedelijik Museum's, 2006: 102-123.</ref> He was raised by his maternal grandparents in the [[Third Mesa]] and [[Tuba City, Arizona]].<ref name=free /> His aunt was noted Hopi potter [[Otellie Loloma]]. His upbringing in the Navajo/Hopi communities was steeped in tribal traditions, and he was schooled in the lore, history, religion, symbolism, and customs of the Navajo and Hopi peoples.<ref name=free />

==Art career==
Begaye's interest in pottery began early, at age 10, and he had his first public exhibition only one year later.<ref name=hands>{{cite book|title=Changing Hands: Art Without Reservation, 1: Contemporary Native American Art from the Southwest|date=2002|publisher=Merrell|location=London|pages=33|editor=David Revere McFadden, Ellen Napiura Taubman}}</ref> He learned traditional techniques and pigment recipes from people in his tribal community, both Navajo and Hopi.<ref name=free /> As they were tribal secrets, he kept these to himself even when he became a teacher later in life.<ref name=free /> After receiving a [[Santa Fe Indian Market|SWAIA]] scholarship,<ref name=focus>{{cite journal|last=Nichols|first=Robert F.|title=Beautiful...as Possible: The Pottery of Nathan Begaye|journal=FOCUS Magazine|date=June–July 1993}}</ref> he left home at age 14 to study ceramics at the [[Institute of American Indian Arts|Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA)]] in Sante Fe, NM.<ref name=free />

Although his upbringing was very conservative, Begaye used unexpected and unorthodox techniques in his work.<ref name=free /> Said to utilize a "maverick sense of form, texture, color, and design,"<ref name=glosband>{{cite journal|last=Glosband|first=Merrily|title=Indian Market: New Directions in Southwestern Native American Pottery|journal=Ceramics Monthly|date=April 2002|volume=50|issue=4|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PEM_artscape/pdf/e301798_e301807_e301803_e301812_e301793_e301794_e301797_e301813_e301799_reference.pdf}}</ref> Begaye's work was often personal and autobiographical.<ref name=free />
