Wikipedia is not a directory or a list of links, which is all this article contains. A comment on the talk page from 2011 asks about fixing this, but nothing has been done. <small><span style="border:1px solid #20406F;padding:1px 3px;">[[User talk:Alex.muller|<font color="#20406F">Alex Muller</font>]]</span></small> 20:41, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Weak delete''' - there are two shooting ranges ([[Stock Exchange Rifle Club]] and [[The Borough of Wandsworth Rifle Club]]) that are on the list and would likely be at home in a list of ''notable'' shooting ranges in the UK. But this isn't that. This is a list of external links that includes links to the only two notable ranges on the list. The introduction doesn't provide any meaningful inclusion criteria but given the nature of such things, the list may well include ''every'' shooting range in the UK, thus removing the need for strict inclusion criteria (don't know, don't live in the UK). I suppose I can't see any reason why the commentary at the top and the two notable examples couldn't be included at [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom]]. The list wouldn't seem to include the [[National Shooting Centre]] (an Olympic venue for which we don't have a stand-alone article). But I still don't think that three notable examples justifies a list like this.

*'''Delete''' - I came in expecting to find an article about shooting ranges or a list of UK shooting ranges that had articles written about them, not a collection of external links.--[[User:Mike Searson|'''Mike''']] - [[User_talk:Mike_Searson|'''Μολὼν λαβέ''']] 00:30, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Totally agree with Mike_Searson - Assumed I would see lists ... Not external links...
