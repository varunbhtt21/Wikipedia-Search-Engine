'''Robert Eighteen-Bisang''' is a Canadian author and scholar, who is one of the world's foremost authorities on [[vampire literature]] and mythology.<ref name=now1>{{cite news|last=Now|first=Surrey|title=Does this man think he's a vampire?|url=http://www.canada.com/surreynow/news/story.html?id=04ad9002-13e2-4697-b1d9-53feff9b7c85|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Canada|date=31 Oct 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042507/http://www.canada.com/surreynow/news/story.html?id=04ad9002-13e2-4697-b1d9-53feff9b7c85|archivedate=26 June 2014|df=}}</ref>

His book ''Bram Stoker's Notes for Dracula: A Facsimile Edition'', which was written with [[Elizabeth Miller (academic)|Elizabeth Miller]], won the [[Lord Ruthven Award]].<ref name=sfdb1>{{cite web|title=Robert Eighteen-Bisang|url=http://www.sfadb.com/Robert_Eighteen-Bisang|publisher=Science Fiction Awards Database|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>  The "Ruthven," as it is often called, is awarded annually for the most outstanding work in vampire fiction or scholarship.

Other books by Eighteen-Bisang include ''Vampire Stories'', which includes vampire stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]: ''[[The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire]]'', ''The Captain of the Polestar'', ''John Barrrington Cowles'', and ''[[The Parasite]]'', along with ''[[The Adventure of the Illustrious Client]] ''– which Eighteen-Bisang claims is a rationalized version of Dracula – and four more stories with tenuous connections to vampires. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book "a stretch" and something "only completionists are likely to add this to their collections."<ref name=pw1>{{cite web|title=Vampire Stories|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-60239-797-2|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Eighteen-Bisang grew up in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] as the son of a professional [[poker player]]. In university, he was a [[backgammon]] player and won four championships. Eighteen-Bisang aspired to be a university professor, but was talked out of the position by his professors themselves, believing the position would be too restrictive for him. After a career in marketing, Eighteen-Bisang gained an interest in vampire literature and started his research, collecting and writing.<ref name=Zamprelli1 /> As an adult, Eighteen-Bisang still plays in backgammon tournaments and is a member of the Vancouver Backgammon Club.<ref name=backgammon>{{cite web|title=Vancouver Backgammon Club|url=http://vancouverbg.com/author/admin/|publisher=Vancouver Backgammon Club|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

Eighteen-Bisang has amassed the largest collection of vampiric literature in the world, which he houses at his personal residence.<ref name=whispers>{{cite web|title=VINTAGE VAMPIRE STORIES Edited by HWA Member Robert Eighteen-Bisang|url=http://hwadarkwhispers.wordpress.com/tag/robert-eighteen-bisang/|publisher=Dark Whispers|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=abebooks>{{cite web|title=Vintage Vampire Stories|url=http://www.abebooks.com/Vintage-Vampire-Stories-Eighteen-Bisang-Robert-Richard/9533384902/bd|publisher=Abe Books|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The collection includes about 2,500 books, 2,000 comic books, 1,000 magazines and over 100 films, including a [[first edition]] of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''.

==Academic involvement==

Eighteen-Bisang is credited as proving that the novel Dracula is based on the infamous [[serial killer]] [[Jack the Ripper]].<ref name=Zamprelli1 /><ref name=jackther>{{cite web|last=Eighteen-Bisang|first=Robert|title=Dracula, Jack the Ripper and A Thirst for Blood|url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/rip-thirst.html|publisher=Casebook|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>  He has also discounted that Bram Stoker based his iconic character Dracula on [[Vlad the Impaler]], as many people believe.<ref name=holte1>{{cite web|last=Holte|first=Jim|title=the Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts, vol 21}}</ref>

Eighteen-Bisang is a member of the American chapter of the [[Transylvanian Society of Dracula]], led by president [[J.
