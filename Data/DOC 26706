After appearing regularly for the side he signed a two-year deal with [[Servette FC]] on 7 July 2011.<ref>[http://www.wiwsport.com/View/detailNews.php?idN=13 Issaga Diallo et Abdoulaye Fall au Servette FC (Issaga Diallo and Abdoulaye Fall to Servette FC)]; WIW Sport, 7 July 2011 {{fr icon}}</ref> After failing to gain a work permit, he moved to Spain and joined [[CD Badajoz]] in [[Segunda División B]].<ref>[http://www.hoy.es/20110822/deportes/segunda-b/badajoz-completa-plantilla-diego-201108221856.html El Badajoz completa su plantilla con Diego Torres y Abdoulaye Fall (Badajoz completes roster with Diego Torres and Abdoulaye Fall)]; Hoy, 22 August 2011 {{es icon}}</ref>

Fall appeared in 23 matches (21 starts, 1980 minutes of action) and scored two goals during [[2011–12 Segunda División B|the campaign]], as his side were eventually relegated.
