'''Nicholas Galanin''' (pronounced gah-LANN-in) is a multi-disciplinary artist and musician of mixed Tlingit/Aleut and non-Native ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ace|first=Barry|title=Nicholas Galanin|url=http://www.iaia.edu/museum/vision-project/artists/nicholas-galanin/|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Native Arts|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> His work often explores a dialogue of change and identity between Native and non-Native communities.

This two part, looping video mixes traditional Tlingit culture with contemporary Western culture. In the first video, a dancer ([[David Elsewhere]]) [[popping|pops]] to a customary [[Tlingit]] song. In the second, a [[Tlingit]] dancer in customary regalia dances to a spare [[Electronic music|electronic]] groove composed by Galanin. The Tlingit song contains the words used in the title of the piece, "Tsu Heidei Shugaxtutaan" pronounced "soo HAYdee shoe GAK tu tahn."
