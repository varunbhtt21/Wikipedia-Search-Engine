Fails [[WP:NFILM]] - it appears to be a remake of something that ''might'' have won an award, but even that didn't warrant a film.  Wikipedia is not a listing of all films ever made - they must be notable. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User talk:DangerousPanda|<font style="color:#ffffff;background:black;"> the panda </font><font style="color:#000000;background:white;"> ₯’</font>]]</span></small> 20:52, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. My searching is slow going since I don't speak Norweigan and am relying on a translation program, but I'm finding enough to assert notability. I've found a few reviews in the papers as well as other articles. I've asked for help from [[WP:NORWAY]] as well, in the hopes of getting a native speaker to search for additional sources to flesh it out.

:*I've also done a little research on the other film and the book itself, and found that all three meet notability guidelines, so I've created articles for the other film and the novel. Although I will say in all fairness, some of the sources were harder to find at times.

*'''Keep''' Enough coverage to meet [[WP:GNG]], esp. for being screened in the TIFF Kids International Film Festival. Also [https://www.festivalscope.com/film/kick-it this] article showing its English title is ''Kick It!'', which can help non-Norwegian speakers.

:'''Keep'''. This is the 11th most watched movie on cinemas in Norway this far in 2014, seen by over 100&nbsp;000. ([http://www.filmweb.no/filmtoppen/?view=year source]). --[[User:Torstein|torstein]] ([[User talk:Torstein|talk]]) 17:39, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
