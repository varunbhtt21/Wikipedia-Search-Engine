The '''Postgate family''' is an English family that has been notable in a variety of different fields.  It originated in the [[North York Moors]] and records go back to land held by Postgates in 1200. Fields and a farm bearing the name still exist. The name is rare outside Yorkshire.

[[John Postgate (food safety campaigner)]] (1820–1881) was an English surgeon who became Professor of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology at [[Queen's College, Birmingham]] (which later became [[Birmingham University]]) and was a leading campaigner against [[food adulteration]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Postgate, John|volume=46 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35582}}</ref>

His son [[John Percival Postgate]] (1853–1926) was professor of comparative philology at [[University College, London]], then of Latin at the [[University of Liverpool]] from 1909 to 1920.  He edited the ''[[Classical Association|Classical Review]]'' and the ''[[Classical Quarterly]]'', and published both school textbooks and editions of [[Latin poetry]].  He married Edith Allen,<ref>{{acad|id=PSTT872JP|name=Postgate, John Percival}}</ref> and they had six children.

John Percival Postgate's daughter Dame [[Margaret Cole]] (1893–1980) was married in 1918 to the socialist [[economist]] and writer [[G. D. H. Cole]].  They wrote over 30 [[detective novel]]s together between 1925 and 1948. She went into London politics and received a [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]].  Her brother [[Raymond Postgate]] (1896&nbsp;–1971) was notable as a [[socialist]], journalist and editor, social historian, [[mystery fiction|mystery novelist]] and gourmet. He founded ''[[The Good Food Guide]]'' in 1951, which was ahead of its time in being largely based on volunteer reports on restaurants. He married Daisy Lansbury (1892–1971), daughter of, and secretary to, the politician [[George Lansbury]] (1859–1940) who led the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from 1932 to 1935, and whose biography was among Raymond's books.

In the next generation, Raymond's children include the [[microbiologist]] [[John Postgate (microbiologist)|John Postgate]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (1922–2014),<ref name="whoswho">{{Who's Who|surname=POSTGATE|othernames=Prof. John Raymond|id=U31218|volume=2014|edition=online edition via [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Professor of Microbiology at the [[University of Sussex]], who was also a writer on, and sometime performer of, [[jazz]].<ref>[https://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows Royal Society list of Fellows]; Postgate was elected in 1977.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cFPZHPo_hgC&pg=PR1&lpg=PR1 John Postgate (microbiologist) profile], Cambridge University Press; accessed 23 April 2016.</ref> His brother, [[Oliver Postgate|Richard Oliver Postgate]] (1925–2008), was an [[animator]], [[puppeteer]] and writer, who created television series including ''[[Noggin the Nog]]'', ''[[Ivor the Engine]]'', ''[[Clangers]]'' from the 1950s to the 1980s. Oliver Postgate had three sons, Stephen Postgate, Simon Postgate and Daniel Postgate. His youngest son [[Daniel Postgate]] is a children's book writer and illustrator, he inherited Oliver's company [[Smallfilms]] and since then has created a new series of Postgate's ''Clangers'' on [[CBeebies]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|title=Postgate, Richard Oliver (1925–2008)|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/100678|accessdate=28 May 2012 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/100678}}</ref> Their cousin, actress Dame [[Angela Lansbury]] (born 1925), has had a film and stage career spanning over 70 years.

The family is probably related collaterally to the Catholic [[recusant]] priest and martyr Blessed [[Nicholas Postgate]] (1596/97 – 7 August 1679) who was [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|hanged, disembowelled and quartered]] at [[York]] in the aftermath of the [[Popish Plot]], as well as to Michael Postgate who founded the Postgate School at Great Ayton where Captain Cook was educated.<ref>Postgate (2001) pp. 75–76, where more sources concerning Nicholas and Michael may be found.</ref> An American branch was founded by emigrant William  Postgate (1819–1861), brother of John the food safety campaigner, whose descendants include John W. Postgate (playwright) and Margaret J Postgate (sculptor).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Australian writer and academic [[Coral Lansbury]], the mother of [[Malcolm Turnbull]], the 29th [[Prime Minister of Australia]], was a distant cousin through the Lansburys.
