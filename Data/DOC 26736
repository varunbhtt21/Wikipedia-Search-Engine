==Origins==
Born in [[London]], he was the son and heir of Sir Richard Moleyns (died 1384), of Stoke Poges. Books in the nineteenth century and self-published websites today claim that he and his paternal ancestors were [[barons]], which is untrue as none were summoned to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]].<ref name = Woodger/> His mother's name was Eleanor, taken to be the daughter of Henry Beaumont, 3rd Baron Beaumont, (died 1369) and his wife [[Margaret de Vere]] (died 1398).<ref name = Richardson>{{cite|page = 523|first = Douglas |last = Richardson|title = Plantagenet Ancestry: A Study In Colonial And Medieval Families, 2nd Edition |year =  2011|ISBN = 9781461045137 |url = https://books.google.fr/books/about/Plantagenet_Ancestry_A_Study_In_Colonial.html?id=kjme027UeagC&redir_esc=y|access-date = 2 October 2017}}</ref> 

==Career==
His father died when he was only four years old and he did not inherit his father's lands until he reached majority in 1399. Shortly after, he also inherited the lands of his grandfather, the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] Sir William Moleyns (died 1381), which had been held for life by his widow Margery (died 1399), daughter of Sir Edmund Bacon. This made him owner of ten manors in Buckinghamshire, six in [[Wiltshire]] and three in [[Oxfordshire]], with a substantial income.<ref name = Woodger/> He also had lands in [[Norfolk]].<ref name = Richardson/>

He was soon involved in local government in Buckinghamshire, being appointed to commissions on defence and on finance, and in 1419 was made a [[justice of the peace]] for the county. In 1413 he was knighted by the new king [[Henry V of England |Henry V]] and in April 1414 was elected as an MP of the [[Parliament of England]] for [[Wiltshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Wiltshire]].<ref name = Woodger/>

==Death and memorial==
He died on 8 June 1425<ref>''The Paston Family in the Fifteenth Century: Volume 1, The First Phase'', by Colin Richmond p.50</ref> and was buried in the church of St Giles at Stoke Poges.<ref name = Woodger/> On the north side of the altar on a memorial brass are the images of a knight and his lady, with their arms above and an inscription in [[Latin]] below: {{quote|Hic iacent Willielmus Molyns miles qui obiit viii die mensis junii anno domini mccccxxv et Domina Margeria uxor eius quorum animabus propicietur deus amen (''Here lie William Moleyns, knight, who died the eighth day of the month of June in the year of the Lord 1425, and Dame Margery his wife, whose souls may God have in care.

==Marriage and family==
By 29 September 1401 he was married to a woman from [[Cornwall]] called Margery, who died on 26 March 1439.<ref name = Woodger/> Her family name is unclear,<ref>''The surname of his wife is not known, but she may have been related to John Treverbyn, for she had a reversionary interest in estates in Cornwall. which once belonged to him, she and Moleyns taking possession of the same in 1413.''[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/moleyns-sir-william-1378-1425]</ref><ref name = Richardson/> with some sources naming it as Whalesborough.<ref>Yorkist Lord: John Howard, Duke of Norfolk, c. 1425 -1485 by Anne Crawford p.11</ref><ref>If so, she may have been the daughter of Sir John II Whalesborough (died 1381), of Whalesborough, and the sister of Sir John III Whalesborough (died 1418).</ref>
