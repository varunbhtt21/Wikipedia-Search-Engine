 |Article           = Aakhri Adaalat
 |Description       = This is the cover art for Aakhri Adaalat. The cover art copyright is believed to belong to the distributor of the film or the publisher of the film.
 |Source            = http://www.ebay.com/itm/India-Bollywood-1988-Aakhri-Adaalat-Press-Book-Vinod-Khanna-Dimple-Jackie-Shroff-/321217306274?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4aca0b1ea2
 |Portion           = The entire cover: because the image is cover art, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image.
 |Low_resolution    = The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original cover. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable as artwork on pirate versions or other uses that would compete with the commercial purpose of the original artwork.
 |Purpose           = Main infobox. The image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary of the work for which it serves as cover art. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed in the infobox at the top of the article discussing the work, to show the primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Use for this purpose does not compete with the purposes of the original artwork, namely the creator providing graphic design services to film concerns and in turn marketing films to the public.
 |Replaceability    = As film cover art, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the film would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary.
 |other_information = Use of the cover art in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above.
