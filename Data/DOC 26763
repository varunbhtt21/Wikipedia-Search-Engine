Title : 1997 Falkland Islands general election
Text : {{Politics of the Falkland Islands}}
The '''Falkland Islands general election of 1997''' was held on Thursday 9 October 1997 to elect members to the [[Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Council]]. Eight [[Councillor]]s were elected through [[universal suffrage]] using [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]], five from the [[Stanley constituency]] and three from the [[Camp constituency]].

It was the first election to take place after a [[constitution of the Falkland Islands|constitutional amendment]] came into force, which redistributed the representation in the constituencies, giving an additional seat to Stanley and removing one from Camp. The amendment also modified [[voter eligibility]].<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |year=1997 |title=The Falkland Islands Constitution (Amendment) Order 1997 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/864/contents/made |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}</ref>
