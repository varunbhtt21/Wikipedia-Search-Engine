Upon its release, ''A Town Called Paradise'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Christopher R. Weingarten of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a mixed review, stating, "EDM has changed pop, and now pop is changing veteran DJ Tiësto. He's moved from the abrasively chilly trance of 2009's Kaleidoscope to embrace pianos and guitars, a warm sound like the 4 a.m. version of Taylor Swift or Coldplay. He's a consummate crowd-pleaser, but he's best when he gets weird: The warped grind of "Echoes" is a standout; "Wasted" might be one of 2014's best country songs."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/a-town-called-paradise-20140617|title=A Town Called Paradise|publisher=}}</ref>
