{{nihongo|'''Part-time job terrorism'''|バイトテロ|baito tero}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[social phenomenon]]; part-time employees perform [[pranks]] and stunts, such as climbing into ice cream freezers or holding their body horizontally suspended, more colloquially termed '[[planking (fad)|planking]]', on the counter-tops at fast-food restaurants, usually with the sole purpose of gaining recognition from their peers through the photos and/or videos they later display on social media sites.<ref name="wsj">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2013/09/18/part-timers-terrorize-employers-with-pranks/|title=Part-Timers 'Terrorize' Employers and pranks - Japan Real Time - WSJ|publisher=blogs.wsj.com|accessdate=2014-06-01|date=2013-09-18}}</ref> This social phenomenon commonly involves people with either lack of education or high job dissatisfaction&mdash;a factor which is commonly cited by the media alongside low pay and arduously long working hours. Although pranks such as the aforementioned would not be seen as shocking by many other cultures, they are considered disgraceful in [[Japan culture|Japanese culture]]. In the US media, the similar problem is described as "gross fast food employees" that can cause serious damage to a brand's reputation.

Japanese culture is often associated with long hours, some individuals working as many as 60 hours a week. Such working hours are associated with mental and physiological health complications, with Japanese newspapers citing rare cases of spontaneous death, informally known as [[Karōshi]]. To complicate matters further, Japanese offices are often noisy, smoke-filled (due to lack of smoking laws) environments and this may have further adverse effects on the health and well-being of employees. Part-time job terrorism might in this context be a form of escapism, disenchanted employees gaining support from their peers outside of work to compensate for the praise or reward their working life lacks.

The social phenomenon emerged around the summer of 2013, when internet-based Japanese news agencies such as Yukan-news recorded such an incident.<ref name="ameba">{{cite web|url=http://yukan-news.ameba.jp/20131006-48/|title=バイトテロ　記事の見出しに、ネット流行語大賞の予測も - 夕刊アメーバニュース|publisher=yukan-news.ameba.jp|accessdate=2014-06-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016005656/http://yukan-news.ameba.jp/20131006-48/|archivedate=2013-10-16|df=}}</ref> with more traditional news agencies later following suit.<ref name="msn">{{cite web|url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/affairs/news/131020/crm13102009230002-n1.htm|title="バイトテロ"で初の破産…多摩のそば店、負債３３００万円＋（1/3ページ） - MSN産経ニュース|publisher=sankei.jp.msn.com|accessdate=2014-06-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129033624/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/affairs/news/131020/crm13102009230002-n1.htm|archivedate=2013-11-29|df=}}</ref> In Japanese the social phenomenon is termed ''baito tero''.<ref name="wsj"/> The name stems from the Japanese word ''baito'', which means "part-time job" and is a loan-word originating from the German ''arbeit'', meaning "work".<ref>産経新聞などの全国紙でも「バイトテロ」の呼称が使われるようになっている{{Cite news

Japanese employers are disturbed by such unacceptable behaviors, and penalties and punishment can range from termination of employment to a civil suit; employees, in some circumstances, can be held financially accountable for loss of business due to the negative publicity.<ref name="msn2">{{cite web |url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/news/130812/biz13081215490002-n1.htm |title=ブロンコビリーがバイト撮影問題を起こした足立梅島店を閉店　バイト店員に損害賠償請求も - MSN産経ニュース |publisher=sankei.jp.msn.com |accessdate=2014-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117113601/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/news/130812/biz13081215490002-n1.htm |archivedate=2014-01-17 |df= }}</ref>
