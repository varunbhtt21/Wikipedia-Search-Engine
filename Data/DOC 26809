The '''Volvo B6BLE''' was a 5.5-litre engined [[Low-entry bus|low-entry]] [[midibus]] chassis manufactured by [[Volvo Buses|Volvo]] between 1999 and 2001, with three unfinished or unsold chassis being bodied in 2004 and 2005.

==History==
The Volvo B6BLE was presented in November 1998<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990915101814/http://www.bus.volvo.se/presscenter/oldPress/showArchived.asp?id=1953 Enter the Volvo B6BLE - A refined version of the Volvo B6LE] ''Volvo Buses'' 5 November 1998</ref> as a replacement for the [[Volvo B6LE|B6LE]]. Compared to the B6LE it had a new lower chassis frame with increased [[low-floor bus|low floor]] area, independent front suspension giving more than 10&nbsp;cm wider gangway between the front wheel arches, and front end "kneeling", giving a 25&nbsp;cm entrance height. Like its predecessor, it continued to compete with the [[Dennis Dart SLF]].

A total of 346<!--352 less 6 unknown--> known B6BLEs were produced between 1999 and 2001,<ref>[http://www.buslistsontheweb.co.uk/index.htm?http://www.buslistsontheweb.co.uk/list.asp?ListName=817&Type=&Page=1&WW=0 Volvo B6BLE] Bus Lists on the Web</ref> including two for Australia,<!--Edwards Bus Service, Eden V18 and V19--> nine for Norway and two for Sweden. When the Irvine plant was closed in 2000, production moved to Sweden. The last buses were registered as late as April 2002, but the model year on the chassis [[VIN]]s reveal that they were built in 2001, waiting to be bodied.

A further B6BLE was delivered for [[Plaxton]]'s ''Bus 2000'' concept in 2004, followed by a second ''Bus 2000'' B6BLE in 2005, but the VINs indicate that they were initially manufactured in model year 2000. A third chassis was available for the ''Bus 2000'' project in 2005; however, it was not required, and was instead sold to New Zealand and bodied by [[Kiwi Bus Builders]].<ref>[http://fleetlists.busaustralia.com/nz.php?search=NIM&chassisreq=Volvo%20B6BLE&bodyreq=Kiwi%20Bus%20Builders Nimon & Sons] Australian Bus Fleet Lists</ref> This chassis had 1999 as model year.

In some markets, the B6BLE was followed by short-wheelbase variants of the [[Volvo B7RLE|B7RLE]].
