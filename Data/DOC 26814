Title : Become Ocean
Text : '''''Become Ocean''''' is an American orchestral composition by [[John Luther Adams]].  The [[Seattle Symphony]] Orchestra commissioned the work and premiered it at  [[Benaroya Hall]], Seattle, on 20 and 22 June 2013.  The work won the 2014 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] and the 2015 [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/2014 |title=The Pulitzer Prizes &#124; Awards |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

The work, in a single [[Movement (music)|movement]], was inspired by the oceans of [[Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].  The composer took his title from a phrase of [[John Cage]] in honour of Lou Harrison,<ref name="Budmen">{{cite news | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/performing-arts/article49290345.html | title=New World plays Pulitzer winner Adams’ riveting score | work=Miami Herald | author=Lawrence Budmen | date=2015-12-11 | accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref> and further explained his title with this note placed in his score:

: "Life on this earth first emerged from the sea. As the polar ice melts and sea level rises, we humans find ourselves facing the prospect that once again we may quite literally become ocean."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/double-take/letter-from-the-archive-john-luther-adams | title=Letter from the Archive: John Luther Adams | work=The New Yorker | author=Joshua Rothman | date=2014-04-18 | accessdate=2016-05-14}}</ref>

Each group is given slowly moving sequences of sound, often in the form of [[arpeggio]]s for the strings, and each block has its own rise and fall. Thus the groups overlap in an ever-changing pattern. Harmonies are fundamentally tonal; simple diatonic intervals form the basis of the wind instruments' staggered chords. The phrase lengths are constructed so that there are three moments when all the groups reach a climax together; the first is early on, and the second represents the greatest surge of sound. From that point, the music is played in reverse: the entire piece is a [[palindrome]]. Music critic [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] has hand-drawn a diagram of the work and digitised it.

Underlying this pattern, a rippling effect is provided by a centrally placed [[piano]] (which plays continually throughout), four [[harp]]s, [[celesta]], one [[Percussion section|percussionist]] on [[bass drum]]s, [[timpani]], [[gong|tamtam]] and [[cymbal]]s, and two percussionists, placed on each side, on [[Mallet percussion|mallet instruments]].

The composer specifies colored lighting to match the activity of the orchestral groups, but after the first two performances these were not used.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Performances==
The initial review, by Melinda Bargreen in ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', was lukewarm, finding the work "pleasant", but:

: "after the first 20 minutes or so, the musical ideas had pretty much run their course, and there were no further developments to justify sustaining the piece."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bargreen |first=Melinda |date=21 June 2013 |title=At SSO, impassioned Shostakovich, ''Become Ocean'' |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/at-sso-impassioned-shostakovich-lsquobecome-oceanrsquo-classical-review/|newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=29 October 2016}}</ref> 

By contrast, Alex Ross, writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and on his blog, gave a strongly positive review, saying he "went away reeling" and that "[i]t may be the loveliest apocalypse in musical history."  He compared ''Become Ocean'' with ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' and also provided a technical analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2013/07/jlas-become-ocean.html |last=Ross |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Ross (music critic) |title=Water Music |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>  Following the world premiere in Seattle, Morlot and the Seattle Symphony performed the work at the [[Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall]] in Portland, Oregon, on March 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2014/03/the_seattle_symphony_pays_a_we.html | title=The Seattle Symphony pays a welcome visit to Portland, rejoicing in nature | work=The Oregonian | author=James McQuillen | date=2014-03-31 | accessdate=2016-06-08}}</ref>  It was repeated in Seattle at a free concert on May 2, 2014.  

The New York premiere of ''Become Ocean'' occurred on May 6, 2014 at Carnegie Hall, with the Seattle Symphony and Morlot performing in the now-defunct 'Spring for Music' series at Carnegie Hall. This was the first live performance of the work that Adams himself heard, as an eye condition and resulting surgery caused him to miss the world premiere in Seattle.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/arts/music/a-new-york-premiere-for-john-luther-adamss-become-ocean.html | title=A Composer Attuned to the Earth's Swirling Motion: A New York Premiere for John Luther Adams's 'Become Ocean' | work=The New York Times | author=Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim | date=2014-05-04 | accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref> Reviews, including one by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' chief music critic, [[Anthony Tommasini]], were generally highly complimentary.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/arts/music/seattle-symphony-explores-nature-at-spring-for-music.html| title=Out of the Northwest, Through Sea and Desert: Seattle Symphony Explores Nature at Spring for Music | work=The New York Times | author=Anthony Tommasini | date=2014-05-08 | accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref> Subsequent performances have occurred in Winnipeg (February 2015), Los Angeles (November 2015) and Miami (December 2015).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/composers-work-came-to-him-in-waves-291022141.html | title=Composer's work came to him in waves | work=Winnipeg Free Press | author=Holly Harris | date=2015-02-06 | accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ludovic-morlot-la-phil-become-ocean-20151113-story.html | title=Seattle conductor Ludovic Morlot at the helm of the L.A.

The work was performed by the [[MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra|MDR Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Kristjan Järvi]] in Leipzig on 13 January 2017, and was broadcast on the [[MDR Klassik]] radio station on 14 January 2017. {{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Recording==
[[Cantaloupe Music]] released the premiere recording on October 30, 2014, on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]]. The DVD includes still images and a [[surround sound]] mix supervised by Adams.  After hearing this recording of ''Become Ocean'', [[Taylor Swift]] donated USD $50,000 to the Seattle Symphony.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/03/taylor-swift-gives-50000-to-seattle-symphony/ | title=Taylor Swift Gives $50,000 to Seattle Symphony | work=The New York Times (ArtsBeat blog) | author=Michael Cooper | date=2015-12-03 | accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref>

=="Become" trilogy==
''Become Ocean'' was followed by ''[[Become River]]'' (2014), for chamber orchestra, and ''[[Become Desert]]'' (2018), for an ensemble of five orchestral and choral groups. The composer said these works formed "...a trilogy that I never set out to write in the first place."<ref>{{cite news |last=May |first=Thomas |date=14 March 2018 |title=Seattle Symphony to present world premiere of John Luther Adams' highly anticipated 'Become Desert' |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/classical-music/seattle-symphony-to-present-world-premiere-of-john-luther-adams-highly-anticipated-become-desert/ |work=Seattle Times |location=Seattle, Washington |access-date=1 April 2018 }}</ref>
