'''Lebanese Protestant Christians''' refers to [[Lebanese people]] who are adherents of [[Protestantism]] in [[Lebanon]] and who are a [[Christianity|Christian]] minority in an overwhelmingly [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] (25% [[Lebanese people (Shia Muslims)|Shia]] and 25% [[Lebanese people (Sunni Muslims)|Sunni]]) and [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] (24% [[Lebanese people (Maronite Christians)|Maronite]] and 8% [[Lebanese people (Greek Orthodox Christians)|Eastern Orthodox]]) country.

Most Protestants in Lebanon were converted by missionaries, primarily English and American, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They are divided into a number of denominations, including Presbyterian, Congregational, and Anglican. They are perceived by some to number disproportionately highly among the professional middle class. 

The Lebanese Protestant Christians constitute less than 1 percent of the population and live primarily in [[Beirut]] ([[Greater Beirut]]).<ref>[http://www.ghazi.de/christ.html]</ref> 

Under the terms of an unwritten agreement known as the [[National Pact]] between the various political and religious leaders of Lebanon, the Protestant community in Lebanon has one reserved seat in the Parliament of Lebanon. (see [[Politics of Lebanon#Legislative_branch]])
