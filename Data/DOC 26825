===Colchester United===
Kent joined Colchester's [[Colchester United F.C. Under-23s and Academy|Academy]] for his two-year scholarship in 2012. During his scholarship, Kent was named [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the under-18 side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cu-fc.com/team/player-profile/frankie-kent/26 |title=Frankie Kent |publisher=Colchester United FC |accessdate=7 September 2014 }}</ref> He was first called into the first-team squad by manager [[Joe Dunne]] in December 2013, where he was drafted in as defensive cover over the festive period after [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] loanee [[Ben Tozer]] had been recalled from his loan at Colchester by his parent club.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waldron |first1=Jonathan |date=26 December 2013 |title=Kent added to U's squad for festive schedule |url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/headlines/10899205.Kent_added_to_U_s_squad_for_festive_schedule/ |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}</ref> During the same [[2013–14 Colchester United F.C. season|season]], with the under-18s,  Kent helped his side earn a league title and cup winning double. He played in the [[Football League Youth Alliance#Youth Alliance Cup|Youth Alliance Cup]] final held against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] at [[Valley Parade]] on 29 April 2014 as the U's won the game 4–2.<ref name="YAC">{{cite news |last1=Marston |first1=Carl |date=30 April 2014 |title=League-Cup double for super Colchester United Under-18s |url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/league_cup_double_for_super_colchester_united_under_18s_1_3579076?usurv=skip |newspaper=East Anglian Daily Times |location=Ipswich |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}</ref>

Just four days after his under-18s cup triumph, Kent made his professional debut for Colchester United on 3 May 2014. He came on as a half-time substitute for [[Magnus Okuonghae]] in a 1–0 away win against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marston |first1=Carl |date=3 May 2014 |title=Colchester United end season on winning note with Craig Eastmond on target |url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/colchester_united_end_season_on_winning_note_with_craig_eastmond_on_target_1_3585272 |newspaper=East Anglian Daily Times |location=Ipswich |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}</ref>

====2014–15 season====
Kent made his first [[EFL League One|League One]] appearance of the season and his first senior start on 16 August when he replaced the suspended Magnus Okuonghae in the centre of defence for a game against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]]. He played the full 90 minutes as the U's succumbed to a 2–1 defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28716644 |title=Bristol City 2–1 Colchester |date=16 August 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 August 2014 }}</ref> He was once again called upon on 13 September when he replaced [[Sammie Szmodics]] in a tactical substitution in Colchester's 2–0 victory against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] at [[Brisbane Road]]. He replaced Szmodics prior to half-time after Magnus Okuonghae was dismissed for a serious foul on [[Dave Mooney]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29090256 |title=Leyton Orient 0–2 Colchester |date=13 September 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref> Okuonghae's ensuing four-match ban allowed Kent to make his first home start for the club on 16 September when the U's fell to a 3–2 defeat to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], in which Colchester squandered a two-goal lead by conceding three goals in six second-half minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29120697 |title=Colchester 2–3 Sheff Utd |date=16 September 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}</ref> In Okuonghae's absence, Kent established himself as a first-team regular, and with his contract set to expire at the end of the season, he was rewarded with a three-and-a-half year contract extension, which he signed on 16 October 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marston |first1=Carl |date=16 October 2014 |title=Frankie Kent is third Colchester United player to sign a new deal |url=http://www.greenun24.co.uk/colchester-united/frankie_kent_is_third_colchester_united_player_to_sign_a_new_deal_1_3809702 |newspaper=Green'Un |location=Ipswich |accessdate=17 October 2014 }}</ref>

Kent once again held  a starting berth for Colchester's home clash with [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] on 21 October. However, less than one minute into the game, Kent fell to the ground after being struck in the head by the ball. Meanwhile, referee Darren Sheldrake allowed play to continue, as the Spireites scored through [[Sam Clucas]]. Kent then received four minutes of treatment on the field before being replaced by Magnus Okuonghae. After being stretchered off the pitch, Kent reappeared on the sidelines before the first-half ended.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waldron |first1=Jonathan |date=21 October 2014 |title=Sears scores superb late winner as U's beat Chesterfield |url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/colchesterunited/11549809._/? |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |accessdate=21 October 2014 }}</ref>

Following his injury, Kent returned to action in Colchester's 2–1 home defeat by [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 1 November.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29767338 |title=Colchester 1–2 Port Vale |date=1 November 2014 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=2 November 2014 }}</ref> It would prove to be his last game of the season, after suffering a knee injury that ruled him out of action until March 2015. A slip in a training session in March set back his recovery, and he failed to regain fitness before the end of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waldron |first1=Jonathan |date=22 May 2015 |title=U's defender Kent on a fitness mission |url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/colchesterunited/12964834._/? |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |accessdate=25 May 2015 }}</ref>

====2015–16 season====
Kent returned to first-team action in the 3–2 [[EFL Trophy]] defeat at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] on 1 September 2015, playing the full 90 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34047908 |title=Northampton 3–2 Colchester |date=1 September 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 September 2015 }}</ref> After making 29 appearances in the [[2015–16 Colchester United F.C. season|2015–16 season]],<ref name="Games played by Frankie Kent in 2015/2016">{{Soccerbase season|74309|2015|name=Frankie Kent|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> Kent was named as Colchester's ''Young Player of the Year'' at the club's end of season awards on 13 May 2016.<ref name="YPOTY">{{cite news |last1=Waldron |first1=Jonathan |date=13 May 2016 |title=Alex Gilbey crowned Player of the Year at Colchester United awards night |url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/colchesterunited/14492721.Gilbey_scoops_U_s_player_of_the_year_award/? |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |accessdate=14 May 2016 }}</ref>

====2016–17 season====
Early in the [[2016–17 Colchester United F.C. season|2016–17]] season, Kent was close to leaving the club on loan following his recovery from tendonitis. However, in November 2016, manager [[John McGreal]] switched tactics to utilise three central defenders, and Kent began a run of form alongside [[Tom Eastman]] and [[George Elokobi]] that would see Colchester through a nine-game unbeaten run. As a result, Kent was awarded the [[Football League Young Player of the Month|EFL Young Player of the Month]] for December.<ref name="EFLYP"/> Kent was then ruled out for the remainder of the season after suffering ruptured ankle ligaments during Colchester's 2–1 win against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on 11 February 2017, having made 15 first-team appearances.<ref>{{cite news |last=Waldron |first=Jonathan |date=23 February 2017 |title=Denny Johnstone and Frankie Kent will be sidelined for the rest of Colchester United's League Two campaign |url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/colchesterunited/15110722.U_s_pair_ruled_out_for_the_rest_of_the_season/ |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |accessdate=24 February 2017 }}</ref>

====2017–18 season====
Kent scored his first professional goal on 9 August 2017 during Colchester's 2–1 [[EFL Cup]] defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He also scored an [[own goal]] in the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40798479 |title=Colchester United 1–2 Aston Villa |date=9 August 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=9 August 2017 }}</ref> He then scored his first league goal on 26 August against [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40983809 |title=Colchester United 5–1 Forest Green Rovers |date=26 August 2017 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=29 August 2017 }}</ref>

On 21 September, Kent signed a new contract to keep him with the club until summer 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last=Waldron |first=Jonathan |date=21 September 2017 |title=Frankie Kent has signed a new contract keeping him at Colchester United until 2020 |url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/colchesterunited/15550080.Kent_aiming_to_stay_on_upward_curve_after_agreeing_new_U_s_deal/ |newspaper=Daily Gazette |location=Colchester |accessdate=24 September 2017 }}</ref>
