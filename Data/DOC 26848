'''Feras Bugnah''' (born September 29, 1987) is a [[Saudi Arabia]]n filmmaker, video blogger and actor. His [[YouTube]] video series, called "Malob Aleyna", or "We Are Being Cheated", highlights social inequalities and political issues that the group of filmmakers feels are being overlooked by the Saudi government and specifically [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]]. He was reportedly arrested in 2011 for a particular episode of this series that exposed poverty in [[Riyadh]]. He is also known for a series called Malub Aleina/Malob Aleyna in which he educates viewers on the viewpoints of members of Saudi's lower classes.

==Youmak Maai==
The YouTube series "Youmak Maii", which translates to "Your Day With Me", highlights different social and economic viewpoints of Saudi society. All five characters in the show are played by Feras Bugnah. Each episode features Bugnah playing a different character, such as a street cleaner, blind man, and a street beggar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/462613 |title=Feras Bugnah’s many faces &#124; Arab News — Saudi Arabia News, Middle East News, Opinion, Economy and more |publisher=Arabnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>
