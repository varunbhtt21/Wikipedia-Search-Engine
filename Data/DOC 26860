'''Sho-Air TWENTY20''' is a professional Women's [[road bicycle racing]] [[Cycling team|team]] based in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/team/1922-Exergy-Twenty16-2013|title=ProCyclingStats|publisher=}}</ref> The team's most notable riders were the Olympic time trial champion [[Kristin Armstrong]] and [[2013 Giro d'Italia Femminile]] overall winner [[Mara Abbott]].

==Team history==
The team was founded in 2005 as ProMan Hit Squad, but in 2009 the team was renamed Twenty12 to reflect the team's focus on developing riders for the [[2012 Olympic Games]]. This subsequently brought [[Exergy]] on board as a sponsor of the team as well as receiving UCI status. For the 2013 season (and after the 2012 Olympics) the team was renamed Exergy Twenty16 to reflect the new focus on the [[2016 Olympic Games]], however in late 2013 Exergy's sponsorship of the team ended.

For the 2014 season the team dropped back down to a Nationally ranked elite women's team and primarily raced the US domestic circuit. For the 2015 season the team was known as Twenty16 presented by Sho-Air as the team secured title sponsorship by [[Sho-Air]] (an international asset management and transportation company) as well as becoming a UCI team again, increasing the number of US based UCI Women's teams to five; {{ct|RLW|2015}}, {{ct|TIB|2015}}, {{ct|UHC2|2015}} and newly promoted {{ct|PPC|2015}} being the other four. In preparation for the 2015 season the team signed double World Team Time Trial champion [[Carmen Small]] as well as [[2014 Gent–Wevelgem Women's race|2014 Gent–Wevelgem]] champion [[Lauren Hall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/twenty16-gains-sho-air-as-sponsor-returns-to-the-uci-ranks|title=Twenty16 gains Sho-Air as sponsor, returns to the UCI ranks|work=Cyclingnews.com}}</ref> The team also signed; [[Jess Cerra]], [[Lauren Komanski]], [[Allie Dragoo]], [[Kaitie Antonneau]], [[Andrea Dvorak]], [[Alison Jackson (cyclist)|Alison Jackson]], [[Allison Arensman]], [[Amber Gaffney]], [[Maddy Boutet]] and [[Summer Moak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/womens-news-shorts-boels-dolmans-look-ahead-to-european-season-after-qatar-victory|title=Women's news shorts: Boels-Dolmans look ahead to European season after Qatar victory|work=Cyclingnews.com}}</ref>
