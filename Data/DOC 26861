'''Cornwall Hill''' is a small suburb south of [[Pretoria]], Gauteng, South Africa, It borders the suburb of [[Irene, Gauteng|Irene]]. Cornwall Hill takes its name from the [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] brigade that was stationed here during the Anglo-Boer war.

==Anglo-Boer War==
During the [[Anglo-Boer War]], at the time of the British occupation of Pretoria, over a thousand Mounted Infantry, two companies of the 2nd [[Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry]] and 350 [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers|Northumberland Fusiliers]] guarded the section of railway line at [[Irene, Gauteng|Irene]]. Cornwall Hill takes its name from the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry brigade. These Cornish men, camped on the western slopes of the highest hill in the vicinity of the Irene Station, built a rough stone fort to protect the railway line linking Johannesburg to Pretoria, and thus the hill became known as Cornwall Hill.

==World War II Monument==
