'''Pedro Soares de Sousa''', also known as ''Pero Soares de Sousa'' exercised the role of the third Donatary-Captain for the island of Santa Maria, between 1571 and 1573 (he was preceded in his post by [[João de Marvão]], as the lieutenant of [[João Soares de Sousa]]), as well as between 1576 and 1580 and succeeded by [[Jerónimo Coutinho]]. He should not be confused with his descendant and seventh Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria, who in a testament dated 12 February 1634, referred to his 1616 ascendancy to the stewardship of Santa Maria.

==Biography==
He was the son of [[João Soares de Sousa]] and Guiomar da Cunha (daughter of Francisco da Cunha de Albuquerque and Brites da Câmara, cousins of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]]).

Raised at Corte, he was known as a man of character and charity, as was his father. He was a knight in the Order of Christ and commander of São Pedro do Sul.

While still young and single he had a daughter, Concórdia de Sousa, who became a nun, taking on the name Concórdia dos Anjos.<ref>Adriano Ferreira (1996), p. 104</ref>

On the island of Madeira, he married Beatriz de Morais, daughter of João de Morais and Catarina Fernandes, bearing five children:
* João Soares de Sousa (c. 1560 -?), a monk in the Order of Saint Jerome (or [[Hieronymites]]);
* António Soares, who departed for India;
* Henrique de Sousa, who later died;
* [[Brás Soares de Sousa]] (1570–1634) 5th Donatary-Captain, who married Doroteia de Melo;
* Ana de São João, who became a nun in the [[Convent of Nossa Senhora da Esperança (Ponta Delgada)|Convent of Nossa Senhora da Esperança]], in [[Ponta Delgada]].

===Donatary-Captain===
{{See also|Captaincies of the Azores#Donatary-Captaincy of Santa Maria}}
The island of Santa Maria was attacked by French corsairs in 1576; a squadron of Gauls, that included three boats (a galleon, a carrack and a zabra) disembarked with an armed force of arcabuzes.<ref name="HistAzores">{{citation |url=http://historiadosacores.tumblr.com/post/21597438480/vila-das-velas-ilha-de-sao-jorge-piratas-e |contribution=Piratas e Corsários nos Açores |title=História dos Açores-History of the Azores |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |language=Portuguese}}</ref> After defeating local combatants, the French set Vila do Porto aflame. Pedro Soares de Sousa, in order to reinforce the defense, solicited his brother-in-law (Rodrigo de Baeça), who petitioned the Donatary-Captain of São Miguel (D. [[Manuel da Câmara]]), who immediately dispatched men and troops under the command of Sergeant-major Simão do Quental.<ref name=HistAzores/> Reinforced by these men, and following several days of sacks and destruction, the corsairs were defeated near the Church of São Antão, and reembarked, abandoning the island.<ref name=HistAzores/> But, even before taking flight the pirates had forced a payment of 50 cows, 20 hogs and 30 rams, so that they did not set fire to the village.<ref name=HistAzores/> It is unclear whether the ransom was paid, since the destruction of Vila do Porto still occurred. During the course of the battle, a gunshot killed Manuel de Sousa, son of [[João Soares de Sousa]].<ref name=HistAzores/> Matias Nuno Velho and Cristóvão Vaz Velho were nominated by the captain to lead the Mariense counterattack, that forced back the enemy who began setting the homes ablaze.<ref name=HistAzores/> Meanwhile, other boats disembarked and took Vila do Porto, motivating the reinforcements from São Miguel. In two days arms and munitions, disembarked in Santana, permitting a group of 250 men to take the Vila.<ref name=HistAzores/> Vila do Porto was sacked during the next three days and fire-bombed. On the third day, 200 men from São Miguel, under the command of Francisco Arruda da Costa arrived, but the French were warned by a runaway African slave.<ref name=HistAzores/>
