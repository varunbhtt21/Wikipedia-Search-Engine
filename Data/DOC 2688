==Music video==
Simon filmed a sensual music video for the track, which was shot on a beach on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in July 1990. The video alternates between clips of Simon on the beachfront in the day, during the evening in the same sitting, and at night with a roaring bonfire while she and company dance around and play guitars.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t5KMI8-1vs|title=Carly Simon - Better Not Tell Her|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|date= |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>
