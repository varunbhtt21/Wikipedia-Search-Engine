Let me start off by saying this was a disappointing season for us at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Tropical cyclones]]. Although a total of 15 tropical cyclones developed, none reached major hurricane status and there was no significant damage, except in the case of [[Hurricane Ingrid]]. The season even fell below most of the professionals expectations! In contrast, these articles are not disappointing. You see, because the season was lame, we were left with fewer articles and more time to improve them (compare this to the [[2012 Atlantic hurricane season|2012 AHS]], for instance). [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] and [[User:TropicalAnalystwx13|TropicalAnalystwx13]] are co-nominators. Finally, this will be a WikiCup nomination.--[[User:12george1|12george1]] ([[User talk:12george1|talk]]) 22:44, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*WHat makes the two storms notable enough to deserve separate articles? [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 11:15, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

**What makes them not notable?--[[User:12george1|12george1]] ([[User talk:12george1|talk]]) 17:58, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
***Outside of hurricanes, I've seen extremely few disasters with sub-10 fatalities and sub-$100k damages with separate articles. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 09:10, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
****Well, there's a general agreement that all tropical cyclones are notable. Named storms all get mentions in a variety of scientific documents, so there are always a bunch of verified independent sources. Andrea, Barry, and Ingrid are all essentially sub-articles. As content forks are allowed, I think they are all legitimate articles, considering I believe the season article would be too long (and overly focused with undue weight) with Andrea and Barry. ♫ [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (<small>[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]</small>)  03:26, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
******You're not thinking about it the right way. Think about it like they are sub-articles of the season. 04:49, 6 June 2014 (UTC)<small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Yellow Evan|Yellow Evan]] ([[User talk:Yellow Evan|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yellow Evan|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->
