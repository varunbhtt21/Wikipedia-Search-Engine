==Biography==
Ginty started his career playing a local New Jersey Band called "Rose Hill" where he transitioned from a drummer to playing the Hammond B3.  He played in this band from approximately 1991 till 1994. Then in 1996 he played organ on [[Neal Casal]]’s record “Fade Away Diamond Time”, which led him to play on records by [[Whiskeytown]], [[James Iha]], and [[Hazeldine]], before joining [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]’s touring band for [[MTV Unplugged]], [[Saturday Night Live]], the first [[Lilith Fair]] tour in 1998, and the following Papillion Tour in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princetoninfo.com/index.php/component/us1more/?key=07-12-06%20organ |title=PrincetonInfo |publisher=PrincetonInfo |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref> The following years saw him playing on records by [[Citizen Cope]], [[Matthew Sweet]], and [[Shannon McNally]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/471612-John-Ginty |title=John Ginty Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref>

In 2000, Ginty got together with pedal steel player [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]], and helped him form the “Family Band”, which consisted of Randolph, Ginty, and Robert's cousins Danyel Morgan on bass, and Marcus Randolph on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2013/12/25/john-ginty-word-of-mouth/ |title=John Ginty: Word Of Mouth &#124; The Aquarian Weekly |publisher=Theaquarian.com |date=2013-12-25 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref> After a year of touring, the Family Band released “[[Live at the Wetlands|Live At the Wetlands]]” in 2002. The album is a live recording of the band at the famed NYC club recorded by producer [[Jim Scott (producer)|Jim Scott]]. The band recorded a studio follow-up in 2002 again with producer [[Jim Scott (producer)|Jim Scott]], called “Unclassified”, which garnered the band two Grammy nominations, one for best rock instrumental performance 46th Grammy Awards and for Best Rock Gospel Album. In that same year, the band backed the legendary [[Blind Boys of Alabama]] on the Grammy winning release “Higher Ground”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2005/07/11/john-ginty-attends-church-with-the-blind-boys |title=Need We Say More? > News > John Ginty Attends Church with the Blind Boys |publisher=Jambands.com |date=2005-07-11 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Schlosser |first=Craig |url=http://firstnightmorris.com/john-ginty-rocks-with-bad-news-travels/ |title=John Ginty Rocks with Bad News Travels &#124; First Night Morris County |publisher=Firstnightmorris.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216162908/http://firstnightmorris.com/john-ginty-rocks-with-bad-news-travels/ |archivedate=2013-12-16 |df= }}</ref> According to [[People Magazine]], “John Ginty's organ nicely complement the Blind Boys' vigorous jubilee-style gospel, creating a sound that will indeed take you Higher. “<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138140,00.html |title=Picks and Pans Review: Higher Ground |publisher=People.com |date=2014-05-30 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref>

2004 saw Ginty playing on records by [[Bad Religion]], [[Tift Merritt]], Neal Casal,<ref name="nashvillescene1"/> and “[[The Clarence Greenwood Recordings]]” by Citizen Cope, where Ginty is credited with playing Keyboards, Organ, Synthesizer, and Synthesizer Strings.
While continuing his session work and touring with Citizen Cope, in 2006 Ginty formed the New Jersey-based John Ginty Band. They released a live record called “Fireside Live”, recorded in Denville, NJ. It is the first recording to showcase Ginty as a bandleader. The recording includes guest performances by Ratdog's Mark Karan, and J.T. Thomas from Bruce Hornsby's Band. The record was released on Ginty's own label, Shark Tank Records.
Glide Magazine said of the record, “Fireside Live is loads of fun, as if Joey DeFrancesco or Jimmy Scott traded in the more academic jazz aesthetic (but retained same chops and improvisational proclivities) to front a boozy gospel-rock outfit Ginty’s taken to calling “outlaw gospel.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/3539/john-ginty-band/ |title=John Ginty Band: Fireside Live |publisher=Glide Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref>
He has played with such artists as [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Matthew Sweet]], [[Citizen Cope]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]], [[Court Yard Hounds]], the [[Dixie Chicks]], and many others.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Ginty |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-ginty-mn0000146105/credits |title=John Ginty &#124; Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref> as well as the critically acclaimed “Like A Bird, Like a Plane” by [[Charlie Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/16413/Charlie-Mars-Like-A-Bird-Like-A-Plane |title=Charlie Mars: Like A Bird, Like A Plane on JamBase |publisher=Jambase.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref>

One minute Todd Wolfe is confidently weaving a guitar solo in the smooth "Peanut Butter" and the next minute, vocalist Alecia Chakour is strutting about on the soulful and spunky "Seven & The Spirit."<ref name="relix1"/>

''[[Keyboard Magazine]]'' February 2014 issue featured lessons by John Ginty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/5-ways-to-comp-on-a-hammond-b-3/154136 |title=5 Ways To Comp on a Hammond B-3 |publisher=Keyboardmag |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref>
