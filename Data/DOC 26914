'''Post-transition metals''' are a set of [[metal]]lic elements in the [[periodic table]] located between the [[transition metal]]s to their left, and the [[metalloid]]s to their right. Depending on where these adjacent groups are judged to begin and end, there are at least five competing proposals for which elements to include: the three most common contain six, ten and thirteen elements, respectively (see image). All proposals include [[gallium]], [[indium]], [[tin]], [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]].

Physically, post-transition metals are soft (or brittle), have poor mechanical strength, and have melting points lower than those of the transition metals. Being close to the [[dividing line between metals and nonmetals|metal-nonmetal border]], their [[crystal structure|crystalline structures]] tend to show [[covalent bond|covalent or directional bonding]] effects, having generally greater complexity or fewer [[coordination number|nearest neighbours]] than other metallic elements.

Chemically, they are characterised—to varying degrees—by covalent bonding tendencies, acid-base [[amphoterism]] and the formation of anionic species such as [[aluminate]]s, [[stannate]]s, and [[bismuthate]]s (in the case of [[aluminium]], tin, and bismuth, respectively). They can also form [[Zintl phase]]s (half-metallic compounds formed between highly [[electronegativity|electropositive]] metals and moderately [[electronegativity|electronegative]] metals or metalloids).

The name is universally used, but not officially sanctioned by any organization such as the [[IUPAC]]. The origin of the term is unclear: one early use was in 1940 in a chemistry text.<ref>[[#Deming|Deming 1940, p.&nbsp;704–715]]</ref> Alternate names for this group are ''B-subgroup metals, other metals,'' and ''p-block metals;'' and at least eleven other labels.

==Applicable elements==
[[File:MP & EN plot of metals8c.png|500px|right|thumb|Scatter plot of electronegativity values and melting points for metals (up to fermium, element 100) and some borderline elements (Ge, As, Sb, At). Elements categorised by some authors as post-transition metals are distinguished by their relatively high electronegativity values and relatively low melting points. High electronegativity corresponds to increasing nonmetallic character;<ref>[[#Roher2001|Roher 2001, pp.&nbsp;2‒3]]</ref> low melting temperature corresponds to weaker cohesive forces between atoms and reduced mechanical strength.<ref>[[#Messler|Messler 2006, p.&nbsp;347]]</ref> The geography of the plot broadly matches that of the periodic table. Starting from the bottom left, and proceeding clockwise, the [[alkali metal]]s are followed by the heavier [[alkaline earth metal]]s; the [[rare earth elements|rare earths]] and [[actinides]] (Sc, Y and the [[lanthanide]]s being here treated as rare earths); [[transition metal]]s with intermediate electronegativity values and melting points; the [[refractory metal]]s; the [[platinum group]] metals; and the [[coinage metal]]s leading and forming a part of the post-transition metals.

The increased electronegativity of Be and Mg and the higher melting point of Be distances these light alkaline earth metals from their heavier congeners. This separation extends to other differences in physical and chemical behaviour between the light and heavier alkaline earth metals.{{#tag:ref|''Physical properties:'' "The lighter alkaline earths possess fairly high electrical and thermal conductivities and sufficient strength for structural use. The heavier elements are poor conductors and are too weak and reactive for structural use."<ref>[[#Russell2005|Russell & Lee 2005, p.&nbsp;165]]</ref> ''Chemical:'' The lighter alkaline earths show covalent bonding tendencies (Be predominantly; Mg considerably) whereas compounds of the heavier alkaline earths are predominantly ionic in nature; the heavier alkaline earths have more stable [[hydride]]s and less stable [[carbide]]s.<ref>[[#Cotton|Cotton et al. 1999, pp.&nbsp;111–113]]; [[#Greenwood2002|Greenwood & Earnshaw 2002, p.&nbsp;111–113]]</ref>|group=n}}]]

Usually included in this category are the group 13–15 metals in periods 4–6: [[gallium]], [[indium]] and [[thallium]]; [[tin]] and [[lead]]; and [[bismuth]]. Other elements sometimes included are the group 11 metals [[copper]], [[silver]] and [[gold]] (which are usually considered to be transition metals); the group 12 metals [[zinc]], [[cadmium]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (which are otherwise considered to be transition metals); and [[aluminium]], [[germanium]], [[arsenic]], [[selenium]], [[antimony]], [[tellurium]], and [[polonium]] (of which germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are usually considered to be metalloids). [[Astatine]], which is usually classified as a nonmetal or a metalloid, has been predicted to have a metallic crystalline structure. If so, it would be a post-transition metal. Elements 112–118 ([[copernicium]], [[nihonium]], [[flerovium]], [[moscovium]], [[livermorium]], [[tennessine]], and [[oganesson]]) may be post-transition metals; insufficient quantities of them have been synthesized to allow sufficient investigation of their actual physical and chemical properties.

Which elements start to be counted as post-transition metals depends, in periodic table terms, on where the transition metals are taken to end.{{#tag:ref|A first [[IUPAC]] definition states "[T]he elements of groups 3–12 are the d-block elements. These elements are also commonly referred to as the transition elements, though the elements of group 12 are not always included". Depending on the inclusion of group 12 as transition metals, the post-transition metals therefore may or may not include the [[group 12 element]]s—[[zinc]], [[cadmium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. A second IUPAC definition for transition metals states "An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell." Based on this definition one could argue group 12 should be split with mercury and probably also [[copernicium]] as transition metals, and zinc and cadmium as post-transition metals. Of relevance is the synthesis of [[mercury(IV) fluoride]], which seemingly establishes mercury as a transition metal. This conclusion has been challenged by Jensen<ref>[[#Jensen2008|Jensen 2008]]</ref> with the argument that HgF<sub>4</sub> only exists under highly atypical non-equilibrium conditions (at 4&nbsp;K) and should best be considered as an exception. Copernicium has been predicted to have (a) an electron configuration similar to that of mercury; and (b) a predominance of its chemistry in the +4 state, and on that basis would be regarded as a transition metal. However, in recent years, doubt has been cast on the synthesis of HgF<sub>4</sub> and the possible existence of copernicium(IV), so that group 12 would have only post-transition metals.|group=n}} In the 1950s, most inorganic chemistry textbooks defined transition elements as finishing at [[group 10 element|group 10]] ([[nickel]], [[palladium]] and [[platinum]]), therefore excluding [[group 11 element|group 11]] ([[copper]], [[silver]] and [[gold]]), and [[group 12 element|group 12]] ([[zinc]], [[cadmium]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). A survey of chemistry books in 2003 showed that the transition metals ended at either group 11 or group 12 with roughly equal frequency.<ref name=Jensen/> Where the post-transition metals end depends on where the metalloids or nonmetals start. [[Boron]], [[silicon]], germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium are commonly recognised as metalloids; other authors treat some or all of these elements as nonmetals.

==Rationale==
The diminished metallic nature of the post-transition metals is largely attributable to the increase in nuclear charge going across the periodic table, from left to right.<ref name=Cox17>[[#Cox|Cox 2004, p.&nbsp;17]]</ref>  The increase in nuclear charge is partially offset by an increasing number of electrons but as these are spatially distributed each extra electron does not fully screen each successive increase in nuclear charge, and the latter therefore dominates.<ref>[[#Atkins2011|Atkins & de Paula 2011, p.&nbsp;352]]</ref> With some irregularities, atomic radii contract, ionisation energies increase,<ref name=Cox17/> fewer electrons become available for metallic bonding,<ref>[[#Greenwood2002|Greenwood & Earnshaw 1998, pp.&nbsp;222–3]]</ref> and "ions [become] smaller and more polarizing and more prone to covalency."<ref>[[#Steele|Steele 1966, p.&nbsp;193]]</ref> This phenomenon is more evident in period 4–6 post-transition metals, due to inefficient screening of their nuclear charges by their d<sup>10</sup> and (in the case of the period 6 metals) f<sup>14</sup> electron configurations;<ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson 1970]]</ref> the screening power of electrons decreases in the sequence s > p > d > f. The reductions in atomic size due to the interjection of the d- and f-blocks are referred to as, respectively, the 'scandide' or '[[d-block contraction]]',{{#tag:ref|The scandide contraction refers to the first row transition metals; the d-block contraction is a more general term.|group=n}} and the '[[lanthanide contraction]]'.<ref>[[#Huheey|Huheey & Huheey 1972, p.&nbsp;229]]; [[#Mason|Mason 1988]]</ref> Relativistic effects also "increase the binding energy", and hence ionisation energy, of the electrons in "the 6s shell in gold and mercury, and the 6p shell in subsequent elements of period 6."<ref>[[#Cox2004|Cox 2004, pp.&nbsp;20, 186, 188]]</ref>

==Nomenclature==
The origin of the term ''post-transition metal'' is unclear. An early usage is recorded by Deming, in 1940, in his well-known<ref>[[#Science|Science Education 1948, p.&nbsp;120]]</ref> book ''Fundamental Chemistry.''<ref name=Deming>[[#Deming|Deming 1940, p.&nbsp;704–715]]</ref> He treated the transition metals as finishing at [[group 10]] ([[nickel]], [[palladium]] and [[platinum]]). He referred to the ensuing elements in periods 4 to 6 of the periodic table (copper to germanium; silver to antimony; gold to polonium)—in view of their underlying d<sup>10</sup> electronic configurations—as post-transition metals.

===Group 11===
{{main|Group 11 element}}
The group 11 metals are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells. Physically, they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with post-transition metals. "The filled ''d'' subshell and free ''s'' electron of Cu, Ag, and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity. Transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between ''s'' electrons and the partially filled ''d'' subshell that lower electron mobility."<ref>[[#Russell2005|Russell & Lee 2005, p.&nbsp;302]]</ref> Chemically, the group 11 metals in their +1 valence states show similarities to other post-transition metals;<ref>[[#Steele|Steele 1966, p. 67]]</ref> they are occasionally classified as such.<ref>[[#Deming|Deming 1940, pp.&nbsp;705–7]]; [[#Karamad|Karamad, Tripkovic & Rossmeisl 2014]]</ref>

'''Copper''' is a soft metal (MH 2.5–3.0)<ref>[[#Cheemalapati|Cheemalapati, Keleher & Li 2008, p.&nbsp;226]]</ref> with low mechanical strength.<ref>[[#Liu|Liu & Pecht 2004, p.&nbsp;54]]</ref> It has a close-packed face-centred cubic structure (BCN 12).<ref>[[#Donohue|Donohue 1982, p.&nbsp;222]]</ref> Copper behaves like a transition metal in its preferred oxidation state of +2.

'''Roentgenium''' is expected to be similar to its lighter homologue gold in many ways. It is expected to have a close-packed body-centered cubic structure. It should be a very dense metal, with its density of 28.7&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> surpassing all known stable elements. Roentgenium chemistry is expected to be dominated by the +3 valence state, similarly to gold, in which it should similarly behave as a transition metal. Roentgenium oxide (Rg<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) should be amphoteric; stable compounds in the −1, +1, and +5 valence states should also exist, exactly analogous to gold. Roentgenium is similarly expected to be a very noble metal: the [[standard reduction potential]] for the Rg<sup>3+</sup>/Rg couple is expected to be +1.9&nbsp;V, more than the +1.52&nbsp;V for the Au<sup>3+</sup>/Au couple that is the highest among the stable metals; this is exceeded only by darmstadtium, roentgenium, and copernicium among the superheavy metals. The [Rg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> cation is expected to be the softest among the metal cations. Due to relativistic stabilisation of the 7s subshell, roentgenium is expected to have a full s-subshell and a partially filled d-subshell, instead of the free s-electron and full d-subshell of copper, silver, and gold.

===Group 12===

'''Mercury''' is a liquid at room temperature. It has the weakest metallic bonding of all, as indicated by its bonding energy (61 kJ/mol) and melting point (−39&nbsp;°C) which, together, are the lowest of all the metallic elements.<ref>[[#Rayner2006|Rayner-Canham 2006, p.&nbsp;570]]; [[#Chambers|Chambers & Holliday 1975, p.&nbsp;58]]; [[#Wiberg2001|Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, p.&nbsp;247]]; [[#Aylward|Aylward & Findlay 2008, p.&nbsp;4]]</ref>{{#tag:ref|[[Francium]] may have a comparably low bonding energy but its melting point of around 27°C is significantly higher than that of mercury, at −39°C.|group=n}} Solid mercury (MH 1.5)<ref>[[#Poole|Poole 2004, p.&nbsp;821]]</ref> has a distorted crystalline structure,<ref>[[#Mittemeijer|Mittemeijer 2010, p.&nbsp;138]]</ref> with mixed metallic-covalent bonding,<ref>[[#Russell2005|Russell & Lee 2005, pp.&nbsp;1–2; 354]]</ref> and a BCN of 6.

'''Copernicium''' is expected to be a gas at room temperature, although experiments have so far not succeeded in determining its boiling point with sufficient precision to prove this. Like its lighter congener mercury, many of its singular properties stem from its closed-shell d<sup>10</sup>s<sup>2</sup> electron configuration as well as strong relativistic effects. Its cohesive energy is even less than that of mercury and is likely only higher than that of flerovium. Solid copernicium is expected to crystallise in a close-packed body-centred cubic structure and have a very high density of 23.7&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, surpassing all stable elements. Copernicium chemistry is expected to be dominated by the +2 oxidation state, in which it would behave like a post-transition metal similar to mercury, although the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s orbitals means that this oxidation state involves giving up 6d rather than 7s electrons. A concurrent relativistic destabilisation of the 6d orbitals should allow higher oxidation states such as +3 and +4 with electronegative ligands, such as the halogens. Copernicium should be the most noble metal in the periodic system, with a very high standard reduction potential of +2.1&nbsp;V expected for the Cn<sup>2+</sup>/Cn couple. Copernicium oxide (CnO) is expected to be predominantly basic.

'''Nihonium''' is expected to have a hexagonal close-packed crystalline structure, albeit based on extrapolation from those of the lighter group 13 elements: its density is expected to be around 16&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. With a standard electrode potential of +0.6&nbsp;V for the Nh<sup>+</sup>/Nh couple, it should be between copper and silver in inertness. The relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons is very high and hence nihonium should predominantly form the +1 oxidation state; nevertheless, as for copernicium, the +3 oxidation state should be reachable with highly electronegative ligands, with {{chem|NhF|4|-}} likely being of similar stability to {{chem|AgF|4|-}} (which is a strong oxidising agent, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass). Because of the shell closure at flerovium caused by spin-orbit coupling, nihonium is also one 7p electron short of a closed shell and would hence form a −1 oxidation state; in both the +1 and −1 oxidation states, nihonium should show more similarities to astatine than thallium. The Nh<sup>+</sup> ion is expected to also have some similarities to the Ag<sup>+</sup> ion, particularly in its propensity for complexation. Nihonium oxide (Nh<sub>2</sub>O) is expected to be amphoteric.

'''Flerovium''' is expected to be a gaseous metal due to spin-orbit coupling "tearing" apart the 7p subshell, so that its 7s<sup>2</sup>7p<sub>1/2</sub><sup>2</sup> valence configuration forms a quasi-closed shell similar to those of mercury and copernicium. Indeed, experimental evidence suggests that it has a boiling point of around −60&nbsp;°C, which is by far the lowest of all the metals. Solid flerovium should have a hexagonal close-packed structure and be a rather dense metal, with a density of around 14&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Flerovium is expected from its standard electrode potential of +0.9&nbsp;V for the Fl<sup>2+</sup>/Fl couple to have similar nobility to palladium. Flerovium oxide (FlO) is expected to be amphoteric, forming anionic flerovates in basic solutions.

'''Arsenic''' is a moderately hard (MH 3.5) and brittle semi-metallic element. It is commonly regarded as a metalloid, or by some other authors as either a metal or a non-metal. It exhibits poor electrical conductivity which, like a metal, decreases with temperature. It has a relatively open and partially covalent crystalline structure (BCN 3+3).

'''Moscovium''' is expected to be a quite reactive metal, with a similar standard reduction potential to that of aluminium (−1.5&nbsp;V for the Mc<sup>+</sup>/Mc couple). This increased reactivity is consistent with the quasi-closed shell of flerovium and the beginning of a new series of elements with the filling of the loosely bound 7p<sub>3/2</sub> subshell, and is rather different from the relative nobility of bismuth. Like thallium, moscovium should have a common +1 oxidation state and a less common +3 oxidation state, although their relative stabilities may change depending on the complexing ligands or the degree of hydrolysis. Moscovium(I) oxide (Mc<sub>2</sub>O) should be quite basic, like that of thallium, while moscovium(III) oxide (Mc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) should be amphoteric, like that of bismuth.

'''Selenium''' is a soft (MH 2.0) and brittle semi-metallic element. It is commonly regarded as a nonmetal, but is sometimes considered a metalloid or even a [[heavy metals|heavy metal]]. Selenium has a hexagonal polyatomic (CN 2) crystalline structure. It is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.7 eV, and a photoconductor meaning its electrical conductivity increases a million-fold when illuminated. Selenium forms covalent bonds with most other elements, noting it can form ionic selenides with highly electropositive metals. The common oxide of selenium ([[selenium trioxide|SeO<sub>3</sub>]]) is strongly acidic. Selenium forms a series of anionic selenites and selenates such as Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub>,<ref name=g781>[[#Greenwood2002|Greenwood & Earnshaw 2002, pp.&nbsp;781–3]]</ref> as well as Zintl phases such as Cs<sub>4</sub>Se<sub>16</sub>.<ref name=g762>[[#Greenwood2002|Greenwood & Earnshaw 2002, pp.&nbsp;762–5]]</ref>

'''Tellurium''' is a soft (MH 2.25) and brittle semi-metallic element. It is commonly regarded as a metalloid, or by some authors either as a metal or a non-metal. Tellurium has a polyatomic (CN 2) hexagonal crystalline structure. It is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38 eV. Tellurium forms covalent bonds with most other elements, noting it has an extensive organometallic chemistry and that many tellurides can be regarded as metallic alloys. The common oxide of tellurium ([[tellurium dioxide|TeO<sub>2</sub>]]) is amphoteric. Tellurium forms a series of anionic tellurites and tellurates such as Na<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>6</sub>TeO<sub>6</sub>, and Rb<sub>6</sub>Te<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub> (the last containing tetrahedral {{chem|TeO|4|2-}} and trigonal bipyramidal {{chem|TeO|5|4-}} anions),<ref name=g781/> as well as Zintl phases such as NaTe<sub>3</sub>.<ref name=g762/>

'''Polonium''' is a radioactive, soft metal with a hardness similar to lead.<ref>[[#Beamer|Beamer & Maxwell 1946, pp.&nbsp; 1, 31]]</ref> It has a simple cubic crystalline structure characterised (as determined by electron density calculations) by partially directional bonding,<ref>[[#Russell2005|Russell & Lee 2005, p.&nbsp;431]]</ref> and a BCN of 6. Such a structure ordinarily results in very low ductility and fracture resistance<ref>[[#Halford|Halford 2006,p.&nbsp;378]]</ref> however polonium has been predicted to be a ductile metal.<ref>[[#Legut|Legut, Friák & Šob 2010]]</ref> It forms a covalent hydride;<ref>[[#Wiberg2001|Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, pp.&nbsp;594]]; [[#Petrii|Petrii 2012, p.&nbsp;754]]</ref> its halides are covalent, volatile compounds, resembling those of tellurium.<ref>[[#Bagnall1966|Bagnall 1966, p.&nbsp;83]]</ref> The oxide of polonium in its preferred oxidation state (PoO<sub>2</sub>; +4) is predominantly basic, but amphoteric if dissolved in concentrated aqueous alkali, or fused with potassium hydroxide in air.<ref>[[#Bagnall1966|Bagnall 1966, pp.&nbsp;42, 61]]; [[#Wiberg2001|Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, pp.&nbsp;767–68]]</ref> The yellow polonate(IV) ion {{chem|PoO|3|2-}} is known in aqueous solutions of low Cl<sup>‒</sup> concentration and high pH.<ref>[[#Schwietzer2010|Schwietzer & Pesterfield pp.&nbsp;241, 243]]</ref>{{#tag:ref|Bagnall<ref>[[#Bagnall1962|Bagnall 1962, p.&nbsp;211]]</ref> writes that the fusion of polonium dioxide with a potassium chlorate/hydroxide mixture yields a bluish solid which, '...presumably contains some potassium polonate.'

'''Livermorium''' is expected to be less reactive than moscovium: the standard reduction potential of the Lv<sup>2+</sup>/Lv couple is expected to be around +0.1&nbsp;V. It should be most stable in the +2 oxidation state; the 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electrons are expected to be so weakly bound that the first two ionisation potentials of livermorium should lie between those of the reactive [[alkaline earth metal]]s [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]]. The +4 oxidation state should only be reachable with the most electronegative ligands. Livermorium(II) oxide (LvO) should be basic and livermorium(IV) oxide (LvO<sub>2</sub>) should be amphoteric, analogous to polonium.

'''Astatine''' is a radioactive element that has never been seen; a visible quantity would immediately be vaporised due to its intense radioactivity.<ref>[[#Emsley2011|Emsley 2011, p.&nbsp;58]]</ref> It may be possible to prevent this with sufficient cooling.<ref name="Hermann, Hoffmann 2013">[[#Hermann|Hermann, Hoffmann & Ashcroft 2013, p.&nbsp;11604–1]]</ref> Astatine is commonly regarded as a nonmetal,<ref>[[#Hawkes2010|Hawkes 2010]]; [[#Holt2007|Holt, Rinehart & Wilson c. 2007]]; [[#Hawkes1999|Hawkes 1999, p.&nbsp;14]]; [[#Roza2009|Roza 2009, p.&nbsp;12]]</ref> less commonly as a metalloid<ref>[[#Harding2002|Harding, Johnson & Janes 2002, p.&nbsp;61]]</ref> and occasionally as a metal.

'''Tennessine''', despite being in the halogen column of the periodic table, is expected to go even further towards metallicity than astatine due to its small electron affinity. The −1 state should not be important for tennessine and its major oxidation states should be +1 and +3, with +3 more stable: Ts<sup>3+</sup> is expected to behave similarly to Au<sup>3+</sup> in halide media. As such, tennessine oxide (Ts<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is expected to be amphoteric, similar to gold oxide and astatine(III) oxide.

===Group 18===
{{main|Oganesson}}

'''Oganesson''' is expected to be a very poor "noble gas" and may even be metallised by its large atomic radius and the weak binding of the easily removed 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electrons: certainly it is expected to be a quite reactive element that is solid at room temperature and has some similarities to [[tin]], as one effect of the spin–orbit splitting of the 7p subshell is a "partial role reversal" of groups 14 and 18. Due to the immense polarisability of oganesson, it is expected that not only oganesson(II) fluoride but also oganesson(IV) fluoride should be predominantly ionic, involving the formation of Og<sup>2+</sup> and Og<sup>4+</sup> cations. Oganesson(II) oxide (OgO) and oganesson(IV) oxide (OgO<sub>2</sub>) are both expected to be amphoteric, similar to the oxides of tin.

==Related groupings==

===B-subgroup metals===
Superficially, the B-subgroup metals are the metals in Groups IB to VIIB of the periodic table, corresponding to groups 11 to 17 using current IUPAC nonmenclature. Practically, the group 11 metals (copper, silver and gold) are ordinarily regarded as transition metals (or sometimes as coinage metals, or noble metals) whereas the group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium, and mercury) may or may not be treated as B-subgroup metals depending on if the transition metals are taken to end at group 11 or group 12. The 'B' nomenclature (as in Groups IB, IIB, and so on) was superseded in 1988 but is still occasionally encountered in more recent literature.<ref>[[#Zubieta|Zubieta & Zuckerman 2009, p.&nbsp;260]]: 'The compounds AsSn and SbSn, which are classified as alloys of two B subgroup metals, exhibit superconducting properties with a transition temperature of about 4&nbsp;K.'; [[#Schwartz|Schwartz 2010, p.&nbsp;32]]: 'The metals include the alkali and alkaline earths, beryllium, magnesium, copper, silver, gold and the transition metals. These metals exhibit those characteristics generally associated with the metallic state. The B subgroups comprise the remaining metallic elements. These elements exhibit complex structures and significant departures from typically metallic properties. Aluminum, although considered under the B subgroup metals, is somewhat anomalous as it exhibits many characteristics of a true metal.'</ref>{{#tag:ref|Greenwood and Earnshaw<ref>[[#Greenwood2002|Greenwood & Earnshaw 1998, p.&nbsp;548]]</ref> refer to the B-subgroup metals as post-transition elements: 'Arsenic and antimony are classed as metalloids or semi-metals and bismuth is a typical B sub-group (post-transition-element) metal like tin and lead.'|group=n}}

The B-subgroup metals show nonmetallic properties; this is particularly apparent in moving from group 12 to group 16.<ref>[[#Phillips1965|Phillips & Williams 1965, pp.&nbsp;4‒5]]; [[#Steele|Steele 1966, p.&nbsp;66]]</ref> Although the group 11 metals have normal close-packed metallic structures<ref>[[#Phillips1965|Phillips & Williams 1965, p.&nbsp;33]]</ref> they show an overlap in chemical properties. In their +1 compounds (the stable state for silver; less so for copper)<ref>[[#Wiberg2001|Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, pp.&nbsp;1253, 1268]]</ref> they are typical B-subgroup metals. In their +2 and +3 states their chemistry is typical of transition metal compounds.<ref>[[#Steele|Steele 1966, p.&nbsp;67]]</ref>

===Borderline metals===
Parish<ref>[[#Parish1977|Parish 1977, pp.&nbsp;201–202]]</ref> writes that, 'as anticipated', the borderline metals of groups 13 and 14 have non-standard structures. Gallium, indium, thallium, germanium, and tin are specifically mentioned in this context. The group 12 metals are also noted as having slightly distorted structures; this has been interpreted as evidence of weak directional (i.e. covalent) bonding.{{#tag:ref|Aluminium is identified by Parish, along with germanium, antimony and bismuth, as being a metal on the boundary line between metals and non-metals; he suggests that all these elements are 'probably better classed as metalloids.'<ref>[[#Parish1977|Parish 1977, pp.&nbsp;178]]</ref>|group=n}}

===Chemically weak metals===
Rayner-Canham and Overton<ref>[[#Rayner2006|Rayner-Canham & Overton 2006, p.&nbsp;29‒30]]</ref> use the term ''chemically weak metals'' to refer to the metals close to the metal-nonmetal borderline. These metals behave chemically more like the metalloids, particularly with respect to anionic species formation. The nine chemically weak metals identified by them are beryllium, magnesium, aluminum, gallium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, and polonium.{{#tag:ref|Pauling,<ref>[[#Pauling1988|Pauling 1988, p.&nbsp;173]]</ref> in contrast, refers to the strong metals in Groups 1 and 2 (that form ionic compounds with 'the strong nonmetals in the upper right corner of the periodic table.').|group=n}}

===Fusible metals===
Cardarelli,<ref>[[#Cardarelli|Cardarelli 2008, p.&nbsp;1181]]</ref> writing in 2008, categorizes zinc, cadmium, mercury, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead, antimony and bismuth as fusible metals. Nearly 100 years earlier, Louis (1911)<ref>[[#Louis|Louis 1911, p.&nbsp;11–12]]</ref> noted that fusible metals were alloys containing tin, cadmium, lead, and bismuth in various proportions, "the tin ranging from 10 to 20%."

===Heavy metals (of low melting point)===
Van Wert<ref>[[#Vanwert|Van Wert 1936, pp.&nbsp;16, 18]]</ref> grouped the periodic table metals into a. the light metals; b. the heavy brittle metals of high melting point, c. the heavy ductile metals of high melting point; d. the heavy metals of low melting point (Zn, Cd, Hg; Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn; As, Sb, Bi; and Po), and e. the strong, electropositive metals. Britton, Abbatiello and Robins<ref>[[#Britton|Britton, Abbatiello & Robins 1972, p.&nbsp;704]]</ref> speak of 'the soft, low melting point, heavy metals in columns lIB, IlIA, IVA, and VA of the periodic table, namely Zn, Cd, Hg; Al, Ga, In, Tl; [Si], Ge, Sn, Pb; and Bi. The Sargent-Welch ''Chart of the Elements'' groups the metals into: light metals, the lanthanide series; the actinide series; heavy metals (brittle); heavy metals (ductile); and heavy metals (low melting point): Zn, Cd, Hg, [Cn]; Al, Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn, Pb, [Fl]; Sb, Bi; and Po.<ref>[[#Sargent|Sargent-Welch 2008]]</ref>{{#tag:ref|Hawkes,<ref>[[#Hawkes1997|Hawkes 1997]]</ref> attempting to address the question of what is a heavy metal, commented that, 'Being a heavy metal has little to do with density, but rather concerns chemical properties'. He observed that, 'It may mean different things to different people, but as I have used, heard and interpreted the term over the last half-century, it refers to metals with insoluble sulfides and hydroxides, whose salts produce colored solutions in water, and whose complexes are usually colored.' He goes on to note that, 'The metals I have seen referred to as heavy metals comprise a block of all the metals in Groups 3 to 16 that are in periods 4 and greater. It may also be stated as ''the transition metals and post-transition metals.''|group=n}}

===Less typical metals===
Habashi<ref>[[#Habashi|Habashi 2010]]</ref> groups the elements into eight major categories: [1] typical metals (alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and aluminium); [2] lanthanides (Ce–Lu); [3] actinides (Th–Lr); [4] transition metals (Sc, Y, La, Ac, groups 4–10); [5] less typical metals (groups 11–12, Ga, In, Tl, Sn and Pb); [6] metalloids (B, Si, Ge, As, Se, Sb, Te, Bi and Po); [7] covalent nonmetals (H, C, N, O, P, S and the halogens); and [8] monatomic nonmetals (that is, the noble gases).

===Metametals===
The ''metametals'' are zinc, cadmium, mercury, indium, thallium, tin and lead. They are ductile elements but, compared to their metallic periodic table neighbours to the left, have lower melting points, relatively low electrical and thermal conductivities, and show distortions from close-packed forms.<ref>[[#Wiberg2001|Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, p.&nbsp;143]]</ref> Sometimes beryllium<ref>[[#Klemm1950|Klemm 1950]]</ref> and gallium<ref>[[#Miller2002|Miller GJ, Lee C & Choe W 2002, p.&nbsp;22]]</ref> are included as metametals despite having low ductility.

===Ordinary metals===
Abrikosov<ref>[[#Abrikosov|Abrikosov 1988, p.&nbsp;31]]</ref> distinguishes between ''ordinary metals'', and [[transition metals]] where the inner shells are not filled. The ordinary metals have lower melting points and cohesive energies than those of the transition metals.<ref>[[#Cremer|Cremer 1965, p.&nbsp;514]]</ref> Gray<ref>[[#Gray2009|Gray 2009, p.&nbsp;9]]</ref> identifies as ordinary metals: aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, nihonium, tin, lead, flerovium, bismuth, moscovium, and livermorium. He adds that, 'in reality most of the metals that people think of as ordinary are in fact transition metals...'.

===Other metals===
As noted, the metals falling between the transition metals and the metalloids on the periodic table are sometimes called ''other metals'' (see also, for example, Taylor et al.).<ref>[[#TaylorN|Taylor et al. 2007, p.&nbsp;148]]</ref> 'Other' in this sense has the related meanings of, 'existing besides, or distinct from, that already mentioned'<ref>[[#OED1989|''Oxford English Dictionary'' 1989, 'other']]</ref> (that is, the alkali and alkaline earth metals, the lanthanides and actinides, and the transition metals); 'auxiliary'; 'ancillary, secondary'.<ref>[[#Rogets|Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus]]</ref> According to Gray<ref>[[#Gray2010|Gray 2010]]</ref> there should be a better name for these elements than 'other metals'.

===P-block metals===
The ''p-block metals'' are the metals in groups 13‒16 of the periodic table. Usually, this includes aluminium, gallium, indium and thallium; tin and lead; and bismuth. Germanium, antimony and polonium are sometimes also included, although the first two are commonly recognised as metalloids. The p-block metals tend to have structures that display low coordination numbers and directional bonding. Pronounced covalency is found in their compounds; the majority of their oxides are amphoteric.<ref>[[#Parish1977|Parish 1977, pp.&nbsp;178, 189–190, 192–3]]</ref>

===Peculiar metals===
Slater<ref>[[#Slater|Slater 1939, p.&nbsp;444‒445]]</ref> divides the metals 'fairly definitely, though not perfectly sharply' into the ''ordinary metals'' and the ''peculiar metals'', the latter of which verge on the nonmetals. The peculiar metals occur towards the ends of the rows of the periodic table and include 'approximately:' gallium, indium, and thallium; carbon, silicon '(both of which have some metallic properties, though we have previously treated them as nonmetals),' germanium and tin; arsenic, antimony, and bismuth; and selenium '(which is partly metallic)' and tellurium. The ordinary metals have centro-symmetrical crystalline structures{{#tag:ref|On manganese, Slater says, '[It] is a very peculiar and anomalous exception to the general order of the elements. It is the only definite metal, far from the nonmetals in the table, which has a complicated structure.'<ref>[[#Slater|Slater 1939, p.&nbsp;448]]</ref>|group=n}} whereas the peculiar metals have structures involving directional bonding. More recently, Joshua observed that the peculiar metals have mixed metallic-covalent bonding.<ref>[[#Joshua|Joshua 1991, p.&nbsp;45]]</ref>

===Poor metals===
Farrell and Van Sicien<ref>[[#Farrell2007|Farrell & Van Sicien 2007, p.&nbsp;1442]]</ref> use the term ''poor metal'', for simplicity, 'to denote one with a significant covalent, or directional character.' Hill and Holman<ref>[[#Hill2000|Hill & Holman 2000, p.&nbsp;40]]</ref> observe that, 'The term poor metals is not widely used, but it is a useful description for several metals including tin, lead and bismuth. These metals fall in a triangular block of the periodic table to the right of the transition metals. They are usually low in the activity (electrochemical) series and they have some resemblances to non-metals.' Reid et al.<ref>[[#Reid|Reid 2011, p.&nbsp;143]]</ref> write that 'poor metals' is, '[A]n older term for metallic elements in Groups 13‒15 of the periodic table that are softer and have lower melting points than the metals traditionally used for tools.'

===Semimetals===
In modern use, the term 'semimetal' sometimes refers, loosely or explicitly, to metals with incomplete metallic character in crystalline structure, electrical conductivity or electronic structure. Examples include [[gallium]],<ref>[[#Pashaey1973|Pashaey & Seleznev 1973, p. 565]]</ref> [[ytterbium]],<ref>[[#Johansen1970|Johansen & Mackintosh 1970, pp.&nbsp;121–4]]; [[#Divakar1984|Divakar, Mohan & Singh 1984, p.&nbsp;2337]]; [[#Dávila2002|Dávila et al. 2002, p.&nbsp;035411-3]]</ref> [[bismuth]],<ref>[[#Jezequel1997|Jezequel & Thomas1997]]</ref> [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]<ref>[[#Savitsky|Savitsky 1961, p.&nbsp;107]]</ref> and [[neptunium]].<ref>[[#Hindman1968|Hindman 1968, p.&nbsp;434]]: 'The high values obtained for the [electrical] resistivity indicate that the metallic properties of neptunium are closer to the semimetals than the true metals. This is also true for other metals in the actinide series.'; [[#Dunlap1970|Dunlap et al. 1970, pp.&nbsp;44, 46]]: '<span style="white-space: nowrap">...</span>α-Np is a semimetal, in which covalency effects are believed to also be of importance<span style="white-space: nowrap">...</span>For a semimetal having strong covalent bonding, like α-Np<span style="white-space: nowrap">...</span>'</ref> Metalloids, which are in-between elements that are neither metals nor nonmetals, are also sometimes instead called semimetals. The elements commonly recognised as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium. In old chemistry, before the publication in 1789 of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] 'revolutionary'<ref>[[#Strathern2000|Strathern 2000, p.&nbsp;239]]</ref> [[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie|''Elementary Treatise on Chemistry'']],<ref>[[#Roscoe1894|Roscoe & Schormlemmer 1894, p.&nbsp;4]]</ref> a semimetal was a metallic element with 'very imperfect ductility and malleability'<ref>[[#Murray|Murray 1809, p.&nbsp;300]]</ref> such as zinc, mercury or bismuth.

===Transition metals===
Historically, the transition metal series "includes those elements of the Periodic Table which 'bridge the gap' between the very electropositive alkali and allkaline earth metals and the electronegative non-metals of the groups: nitrogen-phosphorus, oxygen-sulfur, and the halogens."<ref>[[#Young|Young et al. 1969, p.&nbsp;228]]</ref> Cheronis, Parsons and Ronneberg<ref>[[#Cheronis|Cheronis, Parsons & Ronneberg 1942, p.&nbsp;570]]</ref> wrote that, "The transition metals of low melting point form a block in the Periodic Table: those of Groups II 'b' [zinc, cadmium, mercury], III 'b' [aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium], and germanium, tin and lead in Group IV. These metals all have melting points below 425&nbsp;°C."{{#tag:ref|In fact, both aluminium (660.32) and germanium (938.25) have melting points greater than 425°C.|group=n}}
