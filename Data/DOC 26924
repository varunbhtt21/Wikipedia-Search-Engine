* ... that two [[Boeing 747]]s landed on a 50 foot-wide runway when they were delivered to the '''[[South African Airways Museum Society]]'''?
:*
<small>Created by [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]). Self nominated at 22:53, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough, nom has 4 DYK credits so no QPQ is required. Issues with the hook: no mention in the article or in fn7 or fn8 where "Maluti" landed. Also the wording of the hook makes it sound as if they did this simultaneously, although it was actually more than two years apart. Accuracy is not consistent at the moment, and close paraphrasing is a concern:
::*Article:"The historic flight operated out of Johannesburg International Airport" sounds like a flight, but it was an organisation, so its full name should be used in the first instance and be capitalised.
::*Article:"The DC-3 was delivered with a certificate of airworthiness and Vermuelen was able to introduce it to the commercial operation before it was formally approved by SAA." the source seems to suggest it was the DC-4. 
::*Article:"Vermeulen required a second DC-3 and a second DC-4" not reflective of the source. Perhaps you meant "acquired"?
::*Article:"In 1999 SAA decided that the SAA Historic Flight should be shut down and its assets disposed of" source "SAA...had decided that the SAA Historic Flight must be shut down and the assets must be disposed of" close paraphrasing concern. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 07:28, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Hi "[[User:Cloudz679|Cloudz679]] I have attended to the problems raised in your comment above. Please see if the article is now up to standard. Thanks. [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 13:02, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
:* Also <s>'''ALT1:''' ... that two [[Boeing 747]]s landed on a 50-foot wide runway on separate occasions when they were delivered to the '''[[South African Airways Museum Society]]'''?</s>
*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]]According to fn6 the first plane landed on runway 11. The second plane is not mentioned as landing on that runway in the article, nor in fn8 or fn9. Also please remember that the "hook fact must have an inline citation right after it", per the rules. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 13:16, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  I have added fn10. That source should cover it. [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 18:26, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]]The new source is good but the article needs to reflect the wording in the proposed hook, or it cannot be used. Also as I mentioned previously,  "hook fact must have an inline citation right after it". <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 12:11, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Added runway 11 info to the article. Should be alright now. [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 13:06, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The citation needs to be duplicated and go after "It landed on Rand Airport's runway 11, which is 50 foot-wide (15 metres) and 5617 foot-long, without the use of reverse thrust." <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 14:05, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Thanks. Done. [[User:Nathan121212|Nathan121212]] ([[User talk:Nathan121212|talk]]) 15:56, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Nomination now meets all criteria. Although I asked for ALT1, I think the original hook is "hookier". <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 16:08, 10 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
