The album received generally positive reviews from select critics. David Lim, writing for ''So So Gay'', praised the album: "''Till Death Do Us Party'' is not only an affirmation of Adore’s vocal and songwriting prowess – it also puts her forward as a strong candidate for the platinum-selling American pop sorority of [[Katy Perry|Katy]], [[Kesha]], [[Miley Cyrus|Miley]] and [[Lady Gaga|Gaga]]."<ref name="sosogay" /> Luis Gonzalez of AlbumConfessions wrote, "''Till Death Do Us Party'' is a project which easily exceeds initial expectations. While most former contestant's from RuPaul's Drag Race tend to release generic material void of any vocal merit, Adore Delano proves her time on American Idol was well deserved" in his four-star review.<ref name="albumconfessions" />

== Chart performance ==
In the US, the album debuted at number 59 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], number 3 on the [[Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart, and number 11 on the [[Independent Albums]] chart. It became the highest charting album amongst her peers in the Rupaul's Drag race (including Rupaul's efforts)
