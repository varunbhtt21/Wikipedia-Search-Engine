In 1977 Palmer set up the nonprofit Centerspace Dance Foundation to support Centerspace, an alternative dance venue that he founded at Project Artaud. He also organized his own troupe, Gary Palmer Dance Company, for which Centerspace  served as home base until the early 1990s.<ref name="ps">Stack, Peter.

''Metro'', July 16–22, 1998.</ref> Palmer's choreography for Gary Palmer Dance Company is highly kinetic, featuring open balletic movement in tension with tighter gestures. He developed his dance sequences in response to his dancers' individual strengths rather than setting predetermined movement on them. The result is choreography with strong theatrical values and frequent speed changes reminiscent of the work of [[Lucinda Childs]].<ref name="or">Roca, Octavio.

''San Francisco Chronicle'', April 17, 1995.</ref> By the late 1990s, he was being called a "key performer and innovator in the San Francisco contemporary dance scene".<ref name="ps"/> Over the years, Palmer has worked with many musicians, including [[Jay Cloidt]], [[Pamela Z]], [[Paul Dresher]], and Christopher Fulkerson. Dancers in his company have included Betsy Ceva, Jonny McPhee, Robert Allen, Charles Chism, and Melissa Moss.

In 1982, Palmer inaugurated a series called “Men Dancing” that featured only male dancers and choreographers in order to "give male dance artists a creative space outside of traditional roles (as partners to ballerinas) or archetypes (heroes or villains)".<ref>Huston, Johnny Ray.

''SF Weekly'', Sept. 13, 1995.</ref> With works by such luminaries as [[Remy Charlip]] and [[Jose Limon]] alongside lesser-known choreographers, it became a popular annual event in the Bay Area,<ref>Green, Judith.

In 1991, Gary Palmer moved his company from San Francisco to San Jose, where he performed at various South Bay venues such as the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts. He toured his company to Lima, Peru, in 1996 and subsequently collaborated with the Ballet Nacional de Peru on the 'Americas Series', which premiered at the Montgomery Theater in San Jose in 1997.<ref name="ps"/>

In 1997, Palmer was hired to be the executive director of the nonprofit San Jose Dance Theatre, which he subsequently merged with his own company to form a combined entity that included both a professional company and a classical ballet school intended to serve around 150 students.<ref name="th"/> In 1999, two dancers and some crew members from a production of "The Nutcracker" done the previous year filed a lawsuit alleging that they had not been paid for their work. The lawsuit further alleged that money from ticket sales had been used instead to pay some old debts of the Gary Palmer Dance Company. Gary Palmer resigned as executive director of the company at the end of 1998.<ref>Hazlewood, Sara.
