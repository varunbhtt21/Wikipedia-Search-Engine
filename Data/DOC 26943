=== Fair use for [[Five Pieces for Orchestra]] === 
The image linked here is claimed to be used under fair use as: 
# it is a very short portion of one part of the entire piece;
# the transcription is only being used for informational purposes;
# it is inferior to the original piece;
# Its inclusion in the article adds significantly to the article because it shows that the "harmonic and melodic motion is curtailed, in order to focus attention on timbral and textural elements" (Erickson 1975, p.37).
