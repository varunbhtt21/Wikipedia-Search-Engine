* According to the musicologist Kenneth Womack, with ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s first song "the Beatles manufacture an artificial textual space in which to stage their art." "Sgt. Pepper" was the first Beatles track that benefitted from a newly available production technique called [[DI unit|direct injection]], which was devised by the assistant EMI engineer Ken Townshend as a method for plugging electric guitars directly into the recording console, eliminating the need for amplifiers and microphones. The musicologist Kenneth Womack credits [[DI unit|direct injection]] with "afford[ing] McCartney's bass with richer textures and tonal clarity."(Womack, Kenneth (2007). ''Long and Winding Roads: The Evolving Artistry of the Beatles''. Continuum. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1746-6}}. Page 170)
* The song utilises a rock and roll orientated [[Lydian mode]] [[chord progression]] during the introduction and verses that is built on [[Parallel key|parallel]] [[Seventh chord|seventh]]s, which the musicologist Walter Everett describes as "the song's strength".(Everett, Walter (1999). ''The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver Through the Anthology''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-512941-0}}. Page 101) 
* The musicologist Ian MacDonald praises McCartney's "screaming hard rock vocal and guitar".(MacDonald, Ian (2005). ''Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties'' (3rd ed.). Chicago Review Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55652-733-3}}. Page 233)
* In George Martin's opinion the rock and roll title track "was the most identifiably Beatles sound" on ''Sgt. Pepper''.(Martin, George; Pearson, William (1994). ''Summer of Love: The making of Sgt. Pepper''. Macmillian. {{ISBN|978-0-333-60398-7}}. Page 76)
* Hannan describes the track's unorthodox stereo mix as "typical of the album", with the lead vocal in the right speaker during the verses, but in the left during the chorus and [[Thirty-two-bar form#Middle eight|middle eight]].(Hannan, Michael (2008). "The sound design of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". In Julien, Olivier. ''Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles: It Was Forty Years Ago Today''. Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6708-7}}. Page 48)
