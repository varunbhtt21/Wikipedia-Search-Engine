* a slightly better quality/resolution version is visible online [http://www.greattenor.com/Yudik.JPG here], The online version has artifacts and the general layout tempt me to the conclusion this is a scan from a magazine, the image has been added to the background and the background image is not identified. All of these lead me to the conclusion that this image is either not freely licence, or only the image of the player is.

* A professionally taken but web resolution image of a motor cycle. The angle is one used for many of this manufacturer's product shots (see the first three images in [http://www.ediciones-tecnicas.com.ar/mecanica_libros_5_1024.htm this]). The summary "I took the picture" I find unconvincing. This image is all over the internet, and tineye reports at least two uploads of versions of this image that slightly predate the upload date here.

* Image exif attributes this image to "Robert Karpa", I am assuming this is the Photographer now part of venturi + karpa. There is no indication that this is the same person as the uploader. Note that the uploader had a number of other images of the same person deleted as having incorrect licences etc. [[User:Peripitus |Peripitus]] [[User talk:Peripitus|(Talk)]] 04:22, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

* lower resolution version of an image that is online at http://pictures.topspeed.com/IMG/jpg/200904/d1-driver-profile-yo-3w.jpg. While the latter's date is after the upload date here the higher resolution, and the fact the uploader had one of their other images at the same time deleted as F9, indicate that this image is not self-made and freely licenced.

* Metadata states original size was 1600x1200, which makes this upload at 320x240 suspicious. Also, no proof www.photosunbury.com is actually his own site, so this was likely ripped from there without permission [[User:Jackmcbarn|Jackmcbarn]] ([[User talk:Jackmcbarn|talk]]) 14:37, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::looking at the amateur website, the tone of the text on it and the tone of the sandbox text here, I am tempted towards the view that the website owned (visible in the DNS records) and the uploader here are one and the same person. - [[User:Peripitus |Peripitus]] [[User talk:Peripitus|(Talk)]] 21:07, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
