The '''2002 Algarve Cup''' is the ninth edition of the [[Algarve Cup]], an invitational [[Women's association football|women's football]] tournament hosted annually by [[Portugal]]. It was held from first to seventh of March 2002. This is the edition when the tournament was expanded to twelve teams; all prior editions had eight teams participation. The tournament was won by China, defeating Norway 2-0 in the final-game. Sweden ended up third defeating Germany, 2-1, in the third prize game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/900308/US-takes-the-fifth-in-Portugal.html|title=US takes the fifth in Portugal|publisher=Deseretnews|language=English|date=8 March 2002|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>

==Format==
The twelve invited teams are split into three groups that played a [[round-robin tournament]].

With 12 teams participating, the Algarve Cup format has been as follows: '''Groups A''' and '''B''', containing the strongest ranked teams, are the only ones in contention to win the title. The group A and B winners contest the final - to win the Algarve Cup. The runners-up play for third place, and those that finish third in the groups play for fifth place.  The teams in '''Group C''' played for places 7–12. The winner of Group C played the team that finished fourth in Group A or B (whichever has the better record) for seventh place. The Group C runner-up played the team who finishes last in Group A or B (with the worse record) for ninth place. The third and fourth-placed teams in Group C played for the eleventh place.

Points awarded in the group stage followed the standard formula of three points for a win, one point for a draw and zero points for a loss. In the case of two teams being tied on the same number of points in a group, their head-to-head result determined the higher place.
