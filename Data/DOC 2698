The '''Las Vegas Festival Grounds''' is an open-air venue on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Winchester, Nevada]]. It is owned and operated by [[MGM Resorts International]]. The venue is located at the north end of the Strip, north of [[Circus Circus Las Vegas]]. It is {{convert|26|acre}} and has a capacity of 85,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Las Vegas Festival Grounds|publisher=MGM Resorts International|url=https://www.mgmresorts.com/en/entertainment/las-vegas-festival-grounds.html|accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref>

==History==
From 1941 to the 1970s, the [[El Rancho Vegas]] occupied most of the land. In 2007, [[MGM Mirage]] (later MGM Resorts International) purchased the {{convert|26|acre|adj=on}} El Rancho site from Gordon Gaming for $444 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM buys parcels for new center|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=Howard Stutz|date=April 19, 2007|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F1326EFD387F63D10&rft_id=info%3Asid%2Finfoweb.newsbank.com&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&svc_dat=AWNB&req_dat=1028A39C75C2B899|via=NewsBank}}</ref>

In 2014, MGM announced plans to develop the site as an outdoor music venue in partnership with [[Cirque du Soleil]] and [[Ron Burkle]]'s [[Yucaipa Companies]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rock in Rio plans permanent venue on Las Vegas Strip|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=Jason Bracelin|date=April 22, 2014|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/music/rock-in-rio-plans-permanent-venue-on-las-vegas-strip/|accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref> The project was primarily designed to serve as the site of [[Rock in Rio USA]], a new biennial music festival. The venue was initially referred to as the '''City of Rock''', named after its [[City of Rock|equivalent in Rio de Janeiro]], the site of the original Brazilian version of the [[Rock in Rio]] festival. The name was soon changed to the '''MGM Resorts Festival Grounds'''.<ref>{{cite news|title=As mass gatherings go, Las Vegas is the place to be|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|author=John Katsilometes|date=September 27, 2014|url=https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2014/sep/27/mass-gatherings-go-vegas-place-be/|accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref> MGM hoped to position the grounds as a site for festivals, concerts, and sporting events (such as [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], and [[soccer]]) as a compliment to its other venues in the area.<ref name=lvsun-mgmresort>{{cite web |title=MGM Resorts, Cirque to build 33-acre, open-air venue to host Rock in Rio in Las Vegas |url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2014/apr/21/rock-rio-headed-las-vegas-mgm-resorts-cirque-build/ |work=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=bb-teams>{{cite web |title=Rock In Rio USA Teams With MGM, Cirque & Yucaipa Ahead of 2015 Debut |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/6062785/rock-in-rio-usa-teams-with-mgm-cirque-yucaipa-ahead-of-2015-debut |work=Billboard.biz |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

The festival grounds made its debut in May 2015 with the Rock in Rio USA festival.<ref name=weatherford>{{cite news|title=Rock in Rio leaves town, but turf will get more footwear|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=Mike Weatherford|date=May 16, 2015|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/mike-weatherford/rock-in-rio-leaves-town-but-turf-will-get-more-footwear/|accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref> Development costs for the site totaled $20 million.<ref name=weatherford />

In October 2015, the MGM Resorts branding was dropped and the site was renamed to simply Las Vegas Festival Grounds. The renaming was part of an effort to downplay MGM's role in the venue to improve its marketability for third-party events, and to brand the site as being part of Las Vegas's "community".<ref name=lvsun-rename>{{cite web|title=No MGM Resorts: Itâ€™s now Las Vegas Village and Las Vegas Festival Grounds|url=http://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2015/oct/01/mgm-resorts-to-renaming-las-vegas-village-las-vega/|website=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>

== Events ==
The [[Rock in Rio USA]] music festival was held at the venue in May 2015, headlined by [[No Doubt]], [[Metallica]], [[Taylor Swift]], and [[Bruno Mars]]. The festival was intended to be held biennially, but after disappointing ticket sales, plans for future editions of the event were quietly shelved.<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM Resorts: No return of Rock in Rio to the Strip|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=John Katsilometes|date=November 7, 2016|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/mgm-resorts-no-return-of-rock-in-rio-to-the-strip/|accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref>

In April 2016, the Las Vegas Festival Grounds hosted the ACM Party For a Cause Festival on the weekend preceding the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]].<ref name="lvrj-acm">{{cite news|title=Strip Scribbles: ACM lineup expands, Super Bowl 50 chefs, Fetish & Fantasy Ball|url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2016/jan/27/strip-scribbles-acm-lineup-expands-super-bowl-chef/|accessdate=14 February 2016|work=Las Vegas Sun}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Country music awards to return to Vegas with 3-day festival|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/music/country-music-awards-return-vegas-3-day-festival|accessdate=14 February 2016|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}</ref>

In 2018, the [[iHeartRadio Music Festival]] relocated its Daytime Village stage to the Las Vegas Festival Grounds, moving from the Las Vegas Village.<ref>{{cite news|title=iHeartRadio ready to return outdoor festivals to the Strip|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|author=John Katsilometes|date=May 1, 2018|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/iheartradio-ready-to-return-outdoor-festivals-to-the-strip/|accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref>

On November 1-3, the Festival Grounds will hold a new, three-day music festival called Day N Vegas, which would feature performances from rap and hip-hop artists. Major headliners include [[J. Cole]], [[Travis Scott]], and [[Kendrick Lamar]]. The festival is being organized by [[Goldenvoice]], known for organizing the [[Coachella Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Kendrick Lamar and more of the biggest names in hip-hop to headline new music festival|website=CNN|author=Chloe Melas|date=June 25, 2019|url=https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/06/25/entertainment/day-n-vegas-hip-hop-music-festival/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite website|title=Day N Vegas|website=Day N Vegas|url=https://daynvegas2019.com/|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite website|title=Festivals|website=Goldenvoice|url=https://www.goldenvoice.com/festivals/|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref>
