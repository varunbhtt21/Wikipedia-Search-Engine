:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough, no close paraphrasing seen. QPQ done. However, I am unclear as to the suitability of this article for Wikipedia, per [[WP:NOTNEWS]]. Checking on some other entries under [[:Category:Coalitions of parties in Argentina]], I just see stubs. The subject of this article simply seems too new to satisfy [[WP:EVENT]]. In terms of content, it doesn't explain what the [[Republican Proposal]] controversy is all about, and the list of sources is rather scanty.

::*I have added some more content and references. Yes, the coalition is new, but it is notable: the big politics of Argentina are involved in it, and it is among the likely major parties of the 2015 presidential elections. As for Macri, the issue is as described: from the point of view of logistics and strategy, it would be advisable for UNEN to join forces with Macri, but from the point of view of political perspectives, the coalition is centre-left and Macri is centre-right and should not mix. Some give priority to the first thing and support an agreement, and others to the second and reject it. [[User:Cambalachero|Cambalachero]] ([[User talk:Cambalachero|talk]]) 17:02, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
:::* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Yes, that's much better. In my earlier comment, I wasn't aware that the [[Republican Proposal]] was a ''party''; I thought it was a ''proposal''. Everything checks out and the hook ref is verified and cited inline. I tweaked the hook to indicate it's something happening now. Good to go.
