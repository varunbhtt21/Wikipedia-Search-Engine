The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre, took place in the [[Venetian Crete]]. Significal dramatists include [[Georgios Chortatzis]], [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]], and other Cretan writers. ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this early period of modern Greek literature, and represents one of its supreme achievements. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553–1613). The other major representative of the Cretan literature and theatre was [[Georgios Chortatzis]] and his most notable work was ''[[Erofili]]'', which was characterized by [[Kostis Palamas]] as the first work of modern Greek theatre. Other notable plays include ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros|Kornaros]], ''Panoria'' and ''Katsourbos'' by [[Georgios Chortatzis|Chortatzis]], ''Fortounatos'' by [[Markos Antonios Foskolos]], ''[[King Rodolinos]]'' by [[Andreas Troilos]], ''Stathis (comedy)'' and ''Voskopoula'' by unknown artists. During this period, there was production of different theatrical genres, such as [[tragedies]], [[comedies]], [[pastoral]] and religious plays.

==Heptanesean theatre==
After the occupation of [[Crete]] by the [[Ottoman empire]], in late 17th century, the intellectual center of the Greeks, such as the theatrical, was transferred in the [[Ionian islands]]. The Heptanesean theatre was heavily influenced by the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Notable playwrights include [[Petros Katsaitis]], [[Savoyas Rousmelis]] and  [[Dimitrios Gouzelis]]. One of the most notable works was ''Vasilikos'' (1830) by [[Antonios Matesis]].

==Greek Enlightenment and Independence==

During the pro-revolution years, notable theatrical works include the ''Achilleus or Death of Patroclus'' (1805) by [[Athanasios Christopoulos]], ''Timoleon'' (1818) by [[Ioannis Zambelios]], while ''Korakistika'' (1812) by [[Iakovakis Rizos Neroulos]] was a lampoon against the Greek intellectual [[Adamantios Korais]] and his linguistic views ([[Katharevousa]]).

After the independence, the theatrical scene of the new [[Greek Kingdom]] was dominated by writers who were closer to the [[First Athenian School]] (or Phanariotic), such as [[Alexandros Rizos Rangavis]], [[Alexandros Soutsos]] and [[Panagiotis Soutsos]]. These writers were using mainly a conservative and archaic form of the Greek language, known as [[katharevousa]]. A notable exception is the comedy ''Babylonia'' (1836), by [[Dimitris Vyzantios]], a satyra of the different Greek idiomas in simple language. Until the end of the 19th century, the romantic tragedy will dominate, such as the ''Maria Doxapatri'' (1853) and ''Fausta'' (1893) by [[Dimitrios Vernardakis]].

The [[National Theatre of Greece|Royal Theatre]] was founded in 1880 in [[Athens]]. Since the 1880s new genres started to be popular. [[Revues]], [[operettas]] and ''komidylio'' (κωμειδύλλιο) (musical comedy), with works like ''I tychi tis Maroulas'' (1889), ''O agapitikos tis voskopoulas'' (1891) by [[Dimitrios Koromilas]] and ''Golfo'' (1893) by [[Spyros Peresiadis]] (later transferred in cinema).

With the apprearence of the [[New Athenian School]] (or Palamian), in the late 19th century, and the central figure of [[Kostis Palamas]], the use of [[Demotic Greek]] became more acceptable. However, in 1903, a translation by the Royal Theatre of [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' in common Greek language (and not in Katharevousa) provoked protests by conservatives students who were in favour of Katharevousa.

Playwrights and dramatists of the new era included [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]] (probably the most important figure), [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Pantelis Horn]], [[Yórgos Theotokás]], [[Giannis Skarimpas]], [[Vasilis Rotas]], [[Angelos Terzakis]] and others. Notable actors [[Aimilios Veakis]], [[Marika Kotopouli]] and [[Cybele Andrianou]].

The Royal Theatre was re-founded in 1932 as ''National Theatre''. The first plays staged were the [[Aeschylus]]' ''Agamemnon'' and [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]]' comedy ''O theios Oneiros''. The first actor team included [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Aimilios Veakis]], [[Eleni Papadaki]] and [[Alexis Minotis]]. First theatrical director was placed [[Fotos Politis]] and from 1934 [[Dimitris Rontiris]].

==After WWII==
After the war, new playwrights appeared, like [[Dimitris Psathas]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]]. Their work in many cases was transferred in the cinema. For example, most of the plays of [[Alekos Sakellarios|Sakellarios]]/Giannakopoulos (around 140), were transferred also in the cinema.

Significant theatrical actors appeared also in the movies of the [[Greek cinema]] (which had its "Golden Age"), like [[Dimitris Horn]], [[Manos Katrakis]], [[Orestis Makris]], [[Melina Mercouri]] and more.

[[Iakovos Kambanellis]] was probably the most significant post-war Greek playwright, while [[Karolos Koun]] was also a notable director, widely known for his lively staging of ancient Greek plays.
