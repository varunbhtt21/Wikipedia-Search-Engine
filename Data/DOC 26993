'''''Ludwigia glandulosa''''', the '''cylindricfruit primrose-willow''',<ref>{{PLANTS|id=LUGL|taxon=Ludwigia glandulosa|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref> is an amphibious plant from [[Southeastern United States|southeast United States]]. It can grow partially or fully submerged.<ref name="Aquatic Plants for Freshwater Aquariums">{{cite journal |author=Live Aquaria. |year=2014|title=Aquatic Plants for Freshwater Aquariums: Ludwigia glandulosa}}</ref> It grows very slowly and needs carbon dioxide in order to grow well. The leaves of this plant will turn greener if not enough light is provided.<ref name=USDA>{{cite journal |author=National Resource Conservation Service. |year=2014|title=Ludwigia glandulosa Walter Cylindricfruit primrose-willow=}}</ref>

==Distribution and conservation status==
''Ludwigia glandulosa''  can be found in [[wetland]] areas and roadside ditches throughout most of the southern states in [[North America]]. It is a [[threatened species]] in [[Indiana]] and [[Endangered species|endangered]] in [[Maryland]].<ref name=USDA/> When including these wetland plant species, necessary protections may be restricted to the wetland and a [[Green belt|buffer area]]. However, special precautions beyond the normal 100-foot buffer may be needed in order to protect the plants from [[invasive species]] and [[Habitat destruction|human activities]]. It is extremely imperative that recommendations and guidance be done from the [[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]] before disturbance occurs.<ref name="Upland Habitat and Protected Species">{{cite journal |author=Somerset County Chesapeake Watch. |year=2014|title=Upland Habitat and Protected Species=}}</ref>

==Habitat and ecology==
''Ludwigia glandulosa''  is a plant that has a difficult time growing in most environments. As long as [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]]s are present in any amount, the plant will benefit from it tremendously.<ref name=USDA/> It is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] that will grow up to a foot and three inches maximum. ''Ludwigia glandulosa'' needs warm temperatures and lots of light in order to survive.

The study of the association between climate and the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of species can give substantial information about the effects of climate change for the future distribution of natural ecosystems.<ref name=Middleton>{{cite journal |author=Middleton, B. |year=2009|title=Regeneration Potential of Taxodium Distichum Swamps and Climate Change= pages=257-74}}</ref> Studies have now been employed in order to find information on the regenerative response to some plants in agreement to how landscapes change the environment. Fourteen species of swamp plants were observed in order to see their patterns in [[flood]]ed and non-flooded areas. Some species, including “Ludwigia glandulosa” did not [[Germination|germinate]] in flooded conditions.<ref name=Middleton/>

==Morphology==
Individuals of this species are perennials that grow as [[herb]]/[[forb]](s).  They can grow up to a foot and six inches. With a lot of light, they will be red/purple in color. If not a lot of light is present, they will fade to a green color. To check for another sign of poor growth, the lower leaves of the plant will start to shed off before the entire plant dies. ''Ludwigia glandulosa'' will grow to a maximum height of about 40&nbsp;cm and requires the water to be a pH of about 6-7.5.

==Usage==
Four stems of this plant is sometimes bought for about three [[United States dollar|American dollars]] and used in [[aquarium]]s as a mid-ground/focal point plant or as a background plant.<ref name=USDA/> With sufficient light, the red/purple leaves will thrive and provide a very [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] setting in the aquarium. As stated before, [[carbon dioxide]] would need to be added frequently to the aquarium in order for the plant to grow well.
