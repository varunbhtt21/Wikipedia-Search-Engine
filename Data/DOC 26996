'''Tourmaline Surfing Park''' is a beach access point and a surf spot in North [[Pacific Beach, San Diego]], California, USA. The park is situated at the northern end of Pacific Beach, a short distance south of where the sand beach ends and the rocky promontory of [[La Jolla]] begins. There are cliffs to the north and south of Tourmaline Surfing Park, but the park itself lies in Tourmaline Canyon, which cuts down through those cliffs to the beach.

Tourmaline Surfing Park is less than 1000 feet west of the point where Tourmaline Street crosses La Jolla Boulevard. Reaching the park involves a steep, palm-lined descent through Tourmaline Canyon to a fairly large parking lot, which is slightly elevated but situated right beside the beach. There are showers and restrooms, as well as railings and places to sit.<ref>sandiego.gov website Lifeguards, Beaches, North Pacific Beach [http://www.sandiego.gov/lifeguards/beaches/northpb.shtml] Accessed 2014-5-3</ref>

==Tourmaline Memorial==
Tourmaline Surfing Park also features "Tourmaline Memorial" a monument celebrating surfers who have enjoyed the surf at Tourmaline, in the past and the present, including Skeeter Malcolm.

Although surfers have surfed the area since the 1930s, Tourmaline Surfing Park first opened in May 1963; the idea for the memorial was conceived in 2006, and the memorial itself was completed in 2008. The motto is "Surf Well, Spread [[Aloha]], Share Waves Without Judgment"<ref>tourmaline memorial.com website, Tourmaline Surfer Memorial, San Diego, California [http://www.tourmalinememorial.com] Accessed 2014-5-3</ref>
