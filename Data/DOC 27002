{{DYK nompage links|nompage=Amy Rose|Amy Rose}}
* ... that '''[[Amy Rose]]''', a character in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video games, appeared in [[That '90s Show|an episode]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''?
:*<s> '''ALT1''':... that '''[[Amy Rose]]''', a character in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video games, fights with a bow and arrow in the comic book series ''[[Sonic the Comic]]''?
:* '''ALT2''':... that '''[[Amy Rose]]''', a character in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video games, was called "Princess Sally" in the manual of [[Sonic the Hedgehog CD|her first game]]?</s>
:* '''ALT3''':... that a [[GamesRadar]] writer simply stated "Total bitch" about '''[[Amy Rose]]''' in an article with several sentences about each of the other ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' characters?
:*
:* ''Comment'': It's probably been long enough that another ''Sonic'' character DYK wouldn't be weird now. Anyway, I gave four possible hooks since the first three are all cited to primary sources (I'm not sure if that's acceptable - though, to be clear, the facts are all pretty explicit and not [[WP:OR]]), while the last is kind of unpleasant. There's also some feminist stuff, but that might be opening a can of worms with little reason.
<small>Improved to Good Article status by [[User:Tezero|Tezero]] ([[User talk:Tezero|talk]]). Self nominated at 23:33, 3 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] This newly promoted GA is new enough and long enough and in other ways seems to meet the DYK criteria, but the only hook I could approve would be ALT3. The other hooks are cited to Wikipedia articles and I believe that is unacceptable. Also, I think you need to do a QPQ review.

::*They're not cited to the articles themselves; it's that they're non-URL sources so the article is the only link that shows up. Regardless, perhaps hook 3 is the best. And I'll do a review if you want, though I thought you had to have nominated 5 DYKs and this is my 4th. [[User:Tezero|Tezero]] ([[User talk:Tezero|talk]]) 14:47, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::::{{ping|BlueMoonset}} Well if this will be your fourth DYK, that's OK, but I need to ask someone else about the references. [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 17:24, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

::::*[[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]], if the template used for the reference (as in the Simpsons one) is the "cite episode" template, then I believe that's okay. (Same with "cite comic", "cite book", etc.) What this is doing is citing the actual work—the broadcast episode or the comic book or regular book—as the source of the information; the episode name (or comic, or book) is naturally wikilinked if it has been written up on Wikipedia. It's an ancillary link to information on Wikipedia, like there would be about the publisher or writer. The episode/comic/book itself is a primary source (see [[WP:WAF]] for talk about primary sources for fiction and what it can be used for); while I'm not positive, I believe that factually describing something that appears on screen/in print would be covered by this. (I've certainly used it that way in articles.) I'll let you decide once you've read the guideline. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 18:08, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] You are probably right but I would still prefer to go with ALT3 for safety sake, or the original hook could be used. I have struck the other two. The article is a newly promoted GA and has been nominated within the correct timeframe. There are inline citations for the hook facts. Ready to go.
