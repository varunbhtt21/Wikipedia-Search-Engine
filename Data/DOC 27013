:: Excuse me [[User:TheMesquito|nominator]], but Persian language sources existed in the article you nominated. Their being mis-formatted is an editorial issue and not a deletion rationale.

*'''Keep''' per availability of [[WP:NONENG|non-English]] sources. Quite unlikely that an [[Cinema of Iran|Iranian]] film will have English coverage. Persian language sources are perfectly fine.
