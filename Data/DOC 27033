Similar to {{no redirect|Spot-winged}} ([[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2014 May 6#Spot-winged|RfD]]), this is too vague a search term. Readers are better off seeing search results than our trying to guess what they're looking for. There are several birds called bare-eyed something, and the spectacled thrush (also known as the bare-eyed thrush, not to be confused with the [[Bare-eyed thrush]]) doesn't seem to be [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary]] among them.

:The result of the discussion was <!-- Template:Rfd top--> '''retarget''' to [[Sodium chloride]]. This was a complex RFD to close but what is clear is that there is no support for the present target nor is there a consensus for deletion. Opinion is divided three ways between those who wish to retarget to 'Sodium chloride', those who wish to retarget to 'NAC Freelance' and those who wish to have a disamb page. However, without a draft to utilise, conversion to a disambig page is outwith this RFD. Consequently I am closing with a retarget to what, narrowly, is the majority preference. It is now open to any editor, if they deem appropriate, to boldly replace the redirect with a disamb page, that can be done subsequent to, and outside, this RFD. NAC.

*'''Retarget'''. In some typefaces, probably most notably Microsoft Courier, on small screens ell and one are rendered identically. I think I mistyped a name of a respondent earlier becaus I couldn't see a difference and assumed it was Welsh ell ell whereas it was probably Russian Ilyich. So NaCl is a likely search term for this if you are on a screen that renders fonts where lowercase ell and digit one are almost indistinguishable. I have my aunt's baby 1950s [[E. Remington and Sons]] typewriter &ndash; the pic is on the article at [[touch typing]] &ndash; this typewriter doesn't have a "one" and you use lowercase ell to type a one). I am not sure what the default font is on WP (I use Mozilla firefox) but caps eye and lowercase ell are rendered identically on my 1024 &times; 768 screen.

:However [[Sodium chloride]] has its own article and should probably be retargeted there rather than to [[salt]], although it is mentioned in the lede there so I doubt people will get confused either way. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]])

*'''Delete''', I agree with BDD that a dab page listing only mispellings is very wrong, but I consider 'Nac1' -> 'NAC-1' to also be a mispelling. The search engine already shows [[NAC Freelance]] and [[BTBD14B]] in the search results; it doesnt list [[sodium chloride]], so that should be raised as a bug in the MediaWiki search algorithm.

While this was the article title almost ten years ago, it's misleading because the significance of 49 BC to Lepidus is unclear. It's not a year of birth or death—not even close. Looking over the dab [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], many are disambiguated by the year in which they held an important position, but again, no special significance of 49 BC is indicated. A user searching for this term would expect someone born that year, or perhaps holding a consulship that year. [[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 17:11, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

'''Delete'''. Unlikely search term. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 05:05, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - did nobody do even a cursory examination, or are they just out and out lying?  The article lists 49 BC as the year Lepidus was placed in charge of Rome (albeit temporarily), but this kind of formatting is what you'd use quite commonly for kings and other rulers.  This is seemingly the most important thing that happened to him, and thus probably the context in which readers are going to be searching for him.  Although formatting like this is possibly a mistake, it's a very likely search term (and even the assertion that it's a mistake is dubious - probably there are house styles that would so format it).

::I did  more than a cursory examination. But surely the (49 BC) at the back is hardly a likely search term.

*'''Comment''' [[Bill Clinton (1993–2001)]] actually sounds to me like a good redirect for the [[Clinton Administration]], yes.  Tenures of office are sometimes associated with names of leaders, whether they are ancient or modern.  I don't feel compelled to go around creating these redirects, but they aren't completely unreasonable.  That is assuredly how this one began.  I'm indifferent to the survival of this redirect because I do believe it could mislead one into believing it represents a birth or death date.  In this sense, [[Bill Clinton (1993–2001)]] is a ''more'' reasonable redirect, because the chances of anyone being confused about a modern figure are substantially less.

::But why bother? [[Bill Clinton]] is already the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]]. Why do you want to add the dates on a redirect?

*'''Weak keep''', strictly this should be "Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (fl. 49 BC)", but it is close enough, and there is no other 'Marcus Aemilius Lepidus' for that year so it isnt misleading.

*'''Delete'''. I think that, ''as a search term'', no-one is likely to put in "(49 BC)" or (fl. 49 BC)" or (d. 49 BC) or whatever. In articles, sure, in the lede and so on per [[WP:OPENPARA]] and all that, that is how we start the lede, because that is ''adding information''. In a DAB, it is useful to put dates in the one-liner, because that is another small thing that helps readers to distinguish between similar terms. But this redirect assumes that someone knows he floreat (was active) in 49 BC and will type that into the search box: which is absurd. If they know that much about old Marcus then they probably don't need to look him up. I said (triumvir) was problematic for the same reason, but that is {{lang|la|''ex judice''}}.[[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 00:53, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. This whole business of appending dates to people's names and suggesting these concatenations might be search terms is implausible at best, but given the state of modern education I do understand the need not to underestimate our readers' stupidity. However, also given the state of modern education it's fairly clear that only the very literate will ever again know or care who any M. Aemelius Lepidus was, and they won't need to add a date to their search term. We are now far past our golden days, and indeed our silver ones, eheu! Incidentally, it pains me to point this out to [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]], but "floreat" is in the subjunctive mood, present tense, whereas what we need here is the indicative mood, perfect tense: "floruit".

I suppose they were drummed or caned into them) then they wouldn't likely need the article.

::In fact I probably learned it from that old teddy-bear Betjeman:

*'''Keep''' The existence of the redirect doesn't harm anything.  I agree that it's not a particularly plausible search terms, but there are other issues to consider: this page existed at this title for nearly two years (23 August 2002-21 June 2004), so it has a substantial number of links in old page revisions.  See the history of [[Lepidus]], and the seven earliest versions of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], for two examples.  We must always consider the possibility of existing links when deleting a redirect — when they're not likely (e.g. newly created gibberish), we can delete away, but we have to be a lot more careful when links are likely, and when they demonstrably exist, only an outright harmful redirect should be deleted.

The redirect is not closely enough related to its target for it to make sense. I would think that this term would redirect to an [[automobile]]-related article, such as [[Automobile safety]]. Where it stands now, the redirect is confusing and possibly misleading.

:'''Delete'''. Not mentioned at target. The old [[Christmas cracker]] joke, "when is a door not a door? When it's a jar", as a [[homonym]], but it is not mentioned there at all (neither is [[homonym]] or [[synonym]] for that matter).

*'''Delete''' though this is a stock phrase used to demonstrate speech synthesis, it is also a recorded message used in some cars to indicate the door is not securely closed, and it is a common joke; on top of the fact it describes the state that a door can be found in in relation to its jamb/frame. -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.206|65.94.171.206]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.206|talk]]) 06:04, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

Searching Flam directs here and not to [[Flam (disambiguation)]].
i.e. should Flam  continue to point to Drum rudiments#Flam rudiments, or instead should point to Flam (disambiguation) (or less probably to the heavily-visited Norwegian town of Flåm, which might arguably be the dominant topic based on Google hits) <small>--<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;border:2px solid #A9A9A9;padding:1px;">[[User:palmiped|<b>palmiped</b>]] | [[User_talk: palmiped|<font style="color:#000000;background:#D3D3D3;">&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;</font>]] </span></small> 11:54, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:'''Retarget''' to [[Flåm]], which already has the hatnote to the DAB. It's difficult for people on non-scandinavian keyboards to type the diacritical mark on the A, so I can well imagine they try it without it. ([[Angstrom]] has a character in ASCII and Unicode, and is now synonymous with LATIN UPPER CASE LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE, there is a separate space in the Unicode Basic Universal Plane for ANGSTROM SIGN but they are now synonymous and usually the glyphs are rendered identically), but LATIN LOWER CASE LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE is not easily available on most non-Scandinavian keyboards). On the other hand they might be looking for [[flan]] and just miss, who knows. You're right, it gets around 40 hits a day (the redirect), according to groks.se; [[Flåm]] gets 60&ndash;80, which suggests about a half to two-thirds of people go via the redirect, the others directly. Whether that is where they ''want'' to go I don't know, I think drumming is probably more popular than a small tourist destination in Norway, although it looks very nice and I would happily live there.
