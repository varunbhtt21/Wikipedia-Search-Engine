'''"Stop Your Sobbing"''' is a song written by [[Ray Davies]] for [[the Kinks]]' debut album, ''[[Kinks (album)|Kinks]]''.  It was later covered by [[the Pretenders]] as their first single.

==Background==

The Kinks recorded "Stop Your Sobbing" on ''[[Kinks (album)|Kinks]]'', which was rushed out in order to capitalize on the success of "[[You Really Got Me]]."<ref name=AllMusic>{{cite web|last=Maginnis|first=Tom|title=AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/stop-your-sobbing-mt0028121691|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> Kinks biographer Rob Jovanovic writes that "Stop Your Sobbing" was supposedly written by Ray about a former girlfriend who, fearing that fame would change him, broke down in tears upon seeing how popular he had become.<ref name=godsavethekinks>{{cite book|last1=Jovanovic|first1=Rob|title=God Save the Kinks: A Biography|publisher=Aurum Press|page=74}}</ref> Davies biographer Thomas Kitts instead suggests that the song may have been inspired by Davies having recently broken up with an old girlfriend.<ref name=kitts/>

The song has the singer annoyed that his girlfriend cries too much, and he wants her to stop.<ref name=complete/> The singer's pleas fail and by the end of the song he remains frustrated at the unresolved situation.<ref name=kitts/> 

[[AllMusic]]'s Tom Maginnis described the track as "grounded more heavily in the classic 50’s style of songwriting and playing," and said that "'Stop Your Sobbing' is a far cry from the wild aggression of ”You Really Got Me”."<ref name=AllMusic />  Music critic [[Johnny Rogan]] described it as "a hidden gem in the Kinks canon."<ref name=complete>{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of the Kinks|author=[[Johnny Rogan|Rogan, J.]]|pages=34–35|year=1998|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0711963142}}</ref>  Rogan praises how Davies' "fragile vocal" works well with the theme.<ref name=complete/>  It was not released as a single.<ref name=AllMusic />

A live version of the song appeared on [[One for the Road (The Kinks album)|''One for the Road'']], and the studio version appeared on [[The Ultimate Collection (The Kinks album)|''The Ultimate Collection'']].

In 1979, [[the Pretenders]] released their version of "Stop Your Sobbing" on [[Pretenders (album)|their self-titled debut album]]. The recording of this cover of the song led to the relationship between [[Ray Davies]] and [[Chrissie Hynde]] of the Pretenders, which eventually resulted in the birth of a child.<ref name=AllMusic />  The Pretenders' version of "Stop Your Sobbing" was one of three demos given to [[Nick Lowe]] and became the A-side for the first single the band released. After this recording, Lowe abandoned the fledgling group claiming that the band was "not going anywhere".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vivascene.com/first-steps-pretenders-pretenders|title=First Steps: Pretenders ‘Pretenders’|website=Vivascene|date=5 December 2014|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> However, the single made the Top 40, reaching #34 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pretenders|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/pretenders/|publisher=Official Charts Company|accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>  It didn't perform quite as well in the US, reaching #65 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pretenders awards|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pretenders-mw0000387388/awards|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>

This version of the song was one of many examples of songs initially recorded by the Kinks that were covered by other bands during the late seventies and early eighties. Other examples include the version of "[[David Watts (song)|David Watts]]" recorded by [[the Jam]], "[[The Hard Way (The Kinks song)|The Hard Way]]" by [[the Knack]], and "[[I Go to Sleep]]," an unreleased track written by Ray Davies, which, like "Stop Your Sobbing," was covered by the Pretenders.<ref name=kitts>{{cite book|title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else|author=Kitts, T.M.|pages=44, 187–188|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=041597769X}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic Ken Tucker calls the Pretenders' "Stop Your Sobbing" "ideal radio fare," describing it as having "[[Labour of Lust|Labour of Lust's]] feathery pop feel" and that "echoed to enhance Davies' wistful melancholy, Hynde sounded like a solo [[The Mamas & the Papas|Mamas and the Papas]], but her tone surged at the ends of choruses to imply enormous resentment at even having to think about sobbing."<ref>{{cite web|title=Pretenders |author=Tucker, K. |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pretenders2/albums/album/259325/review/5945712/the_pretenders |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=17 April 1980 |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107032528/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pretenders2/albums/album/259325/review/5945712/the_pretenders |archivedate=7 November 2007 }}</ref>
