Ahmad belonged to a ''[[dehqan]]'' family of [[Merv]] known as the Kamkarian family, which claimed descent from the last [[Sasanian]] king, [[Yazdegerd III]]. Ahmad was the son of a certain Sahl, and had three unnamed brothers, who were later killed during a local struggle in Merv between Iranians and [[Arabs]]. Ahmad, in order to avenge his three brothers, revolted against his overlord, the Saffarid ruler [[Amr ibn al-Layth]] (r. 879–901), but was defeated and taken prisoner in [[Sistan]].{{sfn|Gibb|1967|p=278}} However, he managed to escape and then returned to Merv, where he captured the local governor [[Abu Ja'far Ghuri]] and proclaimed his adherence to Samanid ruler [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]] (r. 892-907).{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=643-644}} He shortly went to the Samanid court at [[Bukhara]] and quickly achieved prominence under Isma'il. 

In 900 (or 901), Ismail defeated and captured Amr at [[Balkh]], and shortly conquered his territories in Khurasan, which Ahmad also played a role in. In ca. 902, Ahmad was appointed as the governor of the newly conquered province of [[Tabaristan]]. He later served as the commander of the army in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and also as leader of the personal guards of the Samanid prince who governed the city, [[Abu Salih Mansur]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=54}} During the reign of Isma'il's successor, [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907-914), Ahmad was sent in 910-11 along with other prominent Samanid officers to conquer Sistan.

During the reign of Ahmad's successor, [[Nasr II]] (r. 914-943), Ahmad was sent in 919 to suppress the rebellion of the governor of Khurasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], which he managed to accomplish.{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=643-644}}{{sfn|Houtsma|1993|p=871}} Husayn was captured during the battle and was sent to Bukhara. After a few weeks, however, after being lied to by Nasr, who had been promising him a certain thing, Ahmad shortly rebelled at [[Nishapur]], made incursions into the Samanid city of [[Gorgan]], and managed to repel its governor Karategin.{{sfn|Houtsma|1993|p=872}} He then fortified himself in Merv to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]. Ahmad was captured during the battle and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.
