:({{Find sources|California Autism Foundation}})
Non-notable organization, fails [[WP:ORG]]. All the references in the article are self referential. I found a few independent articles [http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Troubled-Group-Homes-Stay-Open-State-bails-out-2842100.php] [http://blog.sfgate.com/lshumaker/2011/05/10/adults-with-autismthe-california-autism-foundation-provides-lifetime-support/] but they are from a single source - the San Francisco Chronicle or its blogs - and thus they don't fulfill the requirement for significant coverage from multiple independent sources. Tagged for multiple problems since September 2013 with no improvement. Proposed deletion withdrawn by proposer. [[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 23:55, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''.  Seems like a major organization.  With significant coverage in SF Chronicle, yes, and also other sources if search on "California Autism Foundation -chronicle" just at main google search page.  Among 5,240,000 hits:  
**Apr 2, 2013, 11:33am PDT "John D. Rockefeller takes helm at California Autism Foundation", Renée Frojo, San Francisco Business Times, [http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2013/04/02/john-d-rockefeller-takes-helm-at.html], 
**same story also covered in "Cloverdale man leads national autism foundation", MARTIN ESPINOZA, THE PRESS DEMOCRAT April 2, 2013 [http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20130402/articles/130409900]
**Reuters, carrying business press wire story: [http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/06/idUS171016+06-Apr-2010+BW20100406]
**According to [[Guidestar]]'s copy of the nonprofit's financial report, it is a $5.6 million size organizatin (revenues, a bit more than its expenses), with 6.988m assets less liabilities to have 2.4 m net assets.  Seems major enough to be covered here.  I'm sure that there's lots more in other sources.
**The fact that the article hasn't been edited to respond to tags is a matter for editing, not AFD. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 01:02, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Thanks for your research, Doncram, but I'm not impressed by coverage from the San Francisco Business Times, the Press-Democrat (which got a basic fact wrong in the headline - it's a Bay Area foundation, not a national foundation), and a press release. My nomination stands. Anyone else want to weigh in? --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 17:34, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' due to the sources found by [[User:Doncram|Doncram]], which appear to be independent, reliable, and cover the subject in detail. Those sources aren't in the article yet so we need to get them in there, but that's a matter of clean-up not AfD. &mdash;[[User:Gorgan almighty|gorgan_almighty]] ([[User talk:Gorgan almighty|talk]]) 00:08, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
