Perhaps I'm missing something, but I see nothing here to suggest that this person is notable enough to meet [[WP:AUTHOR]]. Principal reference seems to be a self-published page. [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]] ([[User talk:Justlettersandnumbers|talk]]) 23:57, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''<s>Delete'''. I read the interview at UNC Chapel Hill. He's definitely sold a lot of books and he has a bestseller out there, but I couldn't find that he had any real notability.</s> [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 01:36, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Changing ivote. Found University of North Carolina Literary Review article. He has at least two best sellers and has written over at least two dozen books. Seems he's notable afterall. And a literary review is specific to writers so I've changed. I'll edit the article to include this. [[User:Malke 2010|Malke 2010]] ([[User talk:Malke 2010|talk]]) 02:22, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
