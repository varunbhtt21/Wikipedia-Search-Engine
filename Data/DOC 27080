No evidence of notability, no links, promotional tone. [[User:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|DBaK]] ([[User talk:DisillusionedBitterAndKnackered|talk]]) 00:09, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' This is an unreferenced, promotional article about a run-of-the-mill non-notable swim club. The article is so poorly written that it doesn't even say where the club is located. It's in Pennsylvania, for what it's worth. I was unable to find significant coverage in reliable, independent sources. The promotional intent is revealed by these gems: "(Our swim team motto is 'Eat Our Bubbles'.) There is also a baby pool for small children." Sorry, that's not encyclopedic.
