'''Eburobrittium''' was a Roman town in [[Lusitania]], located near the present town of [[Óbidos, Portugal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM67PZ_Cidade_Romana_Eburobrittium |title=Cidade Romana-Eburobrittium |work=waymarking.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}</ref>

The city was mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as located between [[Collipo]] and [[Olisipo]]. 
The exact location was only determined by the discovery of archeological finds in the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igespar.pt/pt/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/70506/ |title=Igespar Ip &#124; Património |language=pt |publisher=Igespar.pt |date= |accessdate=2014-06-01}}</ref> The city was located at the edge of a lagoon that, in Roman times, provided access to the ocean.

Eburobrittium was occupied from the 1st century BC to the second half of the 5th century AD. 
At that time it was abandoned in favour of the more defensible hill where Óbidos Castle is now located.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portugalromano.com/2011/02/cidade-romana-de-eburobrittium-obidos/ |title=Cidade Romana de Eburobrittium (Óbidos) |work=portugalromano |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}</ref>
