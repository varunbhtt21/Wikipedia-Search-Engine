She played leading roles in plays by [[Friedrich Schiller]] who was a good friend of Sophie Albrecht's. She wrote poetry, novels, and prose, and was married to the doctor and writer, Johann Friedrich Ernst Albrecht.<ref name="The Contested Quill" />

==Life==
Sophie Albrecht was born to the Baumer family. Her father was a Professor of Medicine at University of Erfurt until he died when Sophie was 14. At age 15 she married Dr. Johann Friedrich Ernst Albrecht, who was one of her father's students. In 1776, Friedrich and Sophie traveled to Reval (now [[Tallinn, Estonia]]) where Friedrich was the personal physician of Count Manteuffel. There Friedrich edited a literary anthology which included Sophie's first published poems. The Albrechts returned to Erfurt in 1781 due to Sophie's mother's failing health. Her mother died the next year. In Erfurt at age 25, Sophie published her first book of poetry and started acting.<ref name="An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Katharina|title=An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers|date=March 1, 1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0824085476|pages=19–20|edition=1}}</ref>

==Actress==
Albrecht's first performance as an actress was in an amateur production of [[Christian Felix Weiße]]'s ''Romeo and Juliet'' with great success in her hometown of Erfurt. Her debut as a professional actress happened in 1782 with the [[Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Grossmann|Grossmann troupe]]. The troupe did performances in [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]] and [[Mainz]]. A year later she met [[Friedrich Schiller]] and played [[Luise Miller]] in his first performance of [[Kabale und Liebe]]. Sophie Albrecht and Friedrich Schiller had similar interests and became close friends.<ref name="An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers" />

In 1786 Albrecht joined the Bondini troupe at [[Dresden|Dresden Court Theater]]. In 1787 she traveled to [[Leipzig]] to act in the Leipzig premier of  Schiller's [[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]], where she played Princess Eboli. The following year Albrecht traveled to a small court theater in [[Schwerin]], where her performance often consisted of acting like a naive girl. Later she traveled to [[Prague]] and [[Mannheim]] and eventually Hamburg to be a guest performer at the [[Oper am Gänsemarkt|Theater am Gänsemarkt]].<ref name="The Contested Quill" />

In 1796, Albrecht and her husband, now a popular playwright, managed the National Theater in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (at that time part the Kingdom of Denmark). Sophie commemorated the event with her ''Antrittsrede bei Eröffnung des Nationaltheaters'' (Welcoming Address at the Opening of the National Theater) on the 1st of September, 1796. A year later Albrecht quit the Altonaer Nationaltheater and divorced from her husband.<ref name="Reconstructing Women's Literary Relationships">{{cite book|last1=Dawson|first1=Ruth P.|title=Reconstructing Women's Literary Relationships: Sophie Albrecht and Female Relationship - In the Shadow of Olympus|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-0743-8|pages=173–187|date=1992-01-01}}</ref>

==Works==
===Poetry===
In Reval, Albrecht's poems were first published in a literary anthology edited by her husband. Although Sophie never did find popularity with the opposite gender and their literary establishments, she did have a strong network of women which she relied on to write about female relations.<ref name="In the Shadow of Olympus">{{cite book|last1=Katherine R. Goodman & Edith Waldstein|title=In the Shadow of Olympus : German women writers around 1800|date=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-0743-8|page=18}}</ref> Her works drew attention to the importance of female friends in her life. Sophie dedicated her first two volumes of poetry (1781; 1785) to women friends. She wrote a love poem for fellow actress, Catharina Felicitas Abt, whom Albrecht never met and who had recently died. The poem was entitled ''An dem Grabe der Madame Abt in Göttingen den 19ten August 1784'' (At the grave of Madame Abt in Göttingen the 19th of August 1784).<ref name="The Mask and the Quill">{{cite book|last1=Dupree|first1=Mary Helen|title=The Mask and the Quill|publisher=Bucknell University Press|pages=64–99}}</ref>

Sophie Albrecht wrote about love but not in its tranquility. Ruth P. Dawson describes Sophie saying, "Sophie Albrecht glorified love but could find no way to embed it in positive social narratives, connecting it instead directly and indirectly with death, and particularly, suicide".<ref name="The Contested Quill">{{cite book|last1=Dawson|first1=Ruth P.|title=The Contested Quill; Literature by Women in Germany, 1770-1800|publisher=University of Delaware Press|location=Newark, Delaware|isbn=0-87413-762-4|page=33|year=2002}}</ref> Her work is often described as melancholy with sorrow or regret as underlying themes. Another analysis of Sophie Albrecht's works by Mary Helen Dupree explains: "she channels her experience of loss and death into opportunities for self-exploration, resistance to social norms, and artistic productivity."<ref name="The Mask and the Quill" /> However, by 1792 Sophie Albrecht had stopped writing poetry.<ref name="The Mask and the Quill" />

===Prose===
Later in life Sophie a wrote [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror novel]] about ghosts and mystery. Albrecht's novel, ''Das höfliche Gespenst'' (The polite ghost), was published on three separate occasions under three different names — ''Legenden'' (Legends) (1797), ''Das höfliche Gespenst'' (The Polite Ghost), and ''Ida von Duba, das Mädchen im Walde; eine romantische Geschichte aus den grauenvollen Tagen der Vorwelt'' (Ida von Duba, the Girl in the Forest; a Romantic Story from the Dreadful Days of the Past) (1805). ''The Polite Ghost'' told a story about what happens after the war ends and the hero is dead, leaving behind a widow, who is haunted by a ghost.<ref name="The Contested Quill" /> The nature of the relationship between the two characters — Ida and Katharine — has led many to believe the text is in part about same-sex attraction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sophie Albrecht (1757–1840) im Kreis der Schriftstellerinnen um 1800.

In 1808, Albrecht published ''Romantische Dichtungen aus der ältern christlichen Kirche'' (Romantic Literature from the Early Christian Church) unlike ''The Polite Ghost'' it did not display Gothic themes.

==Later life==
Albrecht used writing as a source of income after her divorce, although her ex-husband did help sustain her until his death from typhus in 1814. She spent the next quarter century in poverty and at the age of 80 had begun writing cookbooks to earn money. Sophie Albrecht died at the age of 82. In 1841 a friend published a collection of Albrecht's poems to pay for a gravestone.<ref name="An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers" />

Sophie Albrecht was the first eighteenth century German women poet to have her works published during her lifetime.<ref name="The Contested Quill" />
