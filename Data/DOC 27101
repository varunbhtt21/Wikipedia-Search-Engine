I have done this, then I have critiqued my own work, again, as requested, to show how I am unable to properly reference things, as this is not a well referenced subject. This is ONLY intended to be on the Talk Page, as an aid to other editors' working on the article. I mention many times, in this post, that my explanation does not meet Wikipedia standards, as it is not referenced properly, and I draw conclusions in it, which I myself, point out. Again, this is ONLY meant to be posted on the Talk Page, as a possible aid to other editors working on this. I do not intend to use any of it in the article, itself, nor do I intend to edit this article. I am leaving this to others. It is a bit long, but I do not understand what, in anything that I have written, could possibly have triggered a filter. Perhaps you can help me out, here. If I have written something inappropriate in some fashion by accident, I will be more than happy to remove it, if you can point it out to me.

If there's project-wide consensus to never link to the archive.is website I guess it's OK to have the software disallow links to it, but why can't the text "archive.is" be included in an article if it's not a link, or even if it's inside a comment?

KARNA HIMSELF ACCEPTING BEFORE DURYODHANA THE FACT THAT HE FLED THE BATTLEFIELD FROM GANDHARWAS IN FRONT OF DURYODHANA'S EYES:

Narrative: 

"As regards myself, assailed by all the Gandharvas, I fled before thy eyes, unable to rally our flying host. Assailed by the foe with all his might, my body mangled with their arrows, I sought safety in flight. This however, O Bharata, seemed to me to be a great marvel that I behold you all come safe and sound in body, with your wives, troops, and vehicles, out of that super-human encounter. O Bharata, there is another man in this world who can achieve what thou, O king, hast achieved in battle to-day with thy brothers."

Vaisampayana continued, "Thus addressed by Karna, king Duryodhana replied unto the ruler of the Angas in a voice choked with tears."

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03245.htm

Incident 4:Karna defeated & freightened by Abhimanyu in chakruvyuhu:

Narrative:

Hearing these words, Karna, afflicted with the shafts of Arjuna's son, once more said unto Drona, 'Exceedingly afflicted with the shafts of Abhimanyu, I am staying in battle, only because (as a warrior) I should stay here. Indeed, the arrows of this south of great energy are exceedingly fierce. Terrible as they are and possessed of the energy of fire, these arrows are weakening my heart.'

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07045.htm

KARNA AGAIN FLED FROM BATTLEFIELD..THIS TIME FROM ABHIMANYU:

NARRATIVE:

Karna, O monarch, was filled with pain. Meanwhile, the son of Subhadra, causing Karna by means of his arrows to turn away from the field, quickly rushed against the other great bowmen. Then Abhimanyu of fierce energy and great fame, filled with wrath, broke that host of diverse forces abounding with elephants and steeds and cars and infantry. As regards Karna, afflicted by Abhimanyu with countless shafts, he fled away from the field borne by swift steeds. 

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07038.htm

Incident 5:Karna's defeat at Draupadi Swayamvar by Arjuna!

Narrative:

"And incensed at finding the strength and energy of Arjuna's arms unequalled on the earth, Karna, the son of Surya, fought with greater vigour. And parrying all those impetuous arrows shot at him by Arjuna, Karna sent up a loud shout. And this feat of his was applauded by all the warriors. Then addressing his antagonist, Karna said, 'O thou foremost of Brahmanas, I am gratified to observe the energy of thy arms that knoweth no relaxation in battle and thy weapons themselves fit for achieving victory. Art thou the embodiment of the science of weapons, or art thou Rama that best of Brahmanas, or Indra himself, or Indra's younger brother Vishnu called also Achyuta, who for disguising himself hath assumed the form of a Brahmana and mustering such energy of arms fighteth with me? No other person except the husband himself of Sachi or Kiriti, the son of Pandu, is capable of fighting with me when I am angry on the field of battle.' Then hearing those words of his, Phalguna replied, saying, 'O Karna, I am neither the science of arms (personified), nor Rama endued with superhuman powers. I am only a Brahmana who is the foremost of all warriors and all wielders of weapons. By the grace of my preceptor I have become accomplished in the Brahma and the Paurandara weapons. I am here to vanquish thee in battle. Therefore, O hero, wait a little.'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed (by Arjuna), Karna the adopted son of Radha desisted from the fight, for that mighty chariot-fighter thought that Brahma energy is ever invincible."

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01193.htm

INCIDENT 6-KARNA'S DEFEAT BY PANCHALA KING DRUPADA:

NARRATIVE:

"But the mighty bowman, Prishata's son, invincible in battle, though very much pierced with the arrows of the enemy, instantly began, O Bharata,to afflict the hostile ranks with greater vigour. And careering over the field of battle like a fiery wheel, king Drupada with his arrows smote Duryodhana and Vikarna and even the mighty Karna and many other heroic princes and numberless warriors, and slaked their thirst for battle."

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01141.htm

Arjuna later defeat Panchala King Drupada!!

INCIDENT 7:Karna Vanquished in battle by Arjuna:

Narrative:

Sanjaya said, Upon the fall, O king, of the ruler of the Sindhus, thy son Suyodhana, his face bedewed with tears, and himself filled with grief and breathing hot sighs like a snake whose fangs have been broken, that offender against the whole world, viz., thy son, experienced bitter affliction. Beholding that great terrible slaughter of his troops caused by Jishnu and Bhimasena and Satwata in battle, he became pale, dejected and melancholy, and his eyes became filled with tears. And he came to think no warrior existed on the earth that could be compared with Arjuna. Neither Drona, nor the son of Radha, nor Aswatthaman, nor Kripa, O sire, is competent to stand before Arjuna when the latter is excited with wrath, And Suyodhana, said unto himself, 'Having vanquished in battle all the mighty car-warriors of my army, Partha slew the ruler of the Sindhus. None could resist him. This my vast host hath almost been exterminated by the Pandavas. I think, there is no one that can protect my army, no, not even Purandara himself. He, relying upon whom I have been engaged in this passage-at-arms in battle, alas, that Karna hath been defeated in battle and Jayadratha slain. That Karna relying upon whose energy I regarded Krishna as straw who came to sue me for peace, alas, that Karna hath been vanquished in battle.'

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07146.htm

INCIDENT 8:Karna again defeated by Arjuna:

Narrative:

"Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded

p. 365

against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all directions.

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07155.htm

INCIDENT 9:Karna saved by Ashwathama from Arjuna:

Narrative:

Then the ape-bannered (Arjuna), urged by Kesava, shot at the Suta's son, O king, many shafts whetted on stone. Those arrows adorned with gold, shot by Partha's arms and issuing out of Gandiva, entered Karna's body, like cranes into the Krauncha mountains. With those arrows shot from Gandiva which entered Karna's body like so many snakes, Dhananjaya drove the Suta's son from Bhimasena's vicinity. His bow cut off by Bhima, and himself afflicted with the arrows of Dhananjaya, Karna quickly fled away from Bhima on his great car. Bhimasena also, O bull among men, mounting upon Satyaki's car, proceeded in that battle in the wake of his brother Savyasachin, the son of Pandu. Then Dhananjaya, with eyes red in wrath, aiming at Karna, quickly sped a shaft like the Destroyer urging forward Death's self. That shaft shot from Gandiva, like Garuda in the welkin in quest of a mighty snake, quickly coursed towards Karna. The son of Drona, however, that mighty car-warrior, with a winged arrow of his, cut it off in mid-air, desirous of rescuing Karna from fear of Dhananjaya. Then Arjuna, excited with wrath, pierced the son of Drona with four and sixty arrows, O king, and addressing him, said, 'Do not fly away, O Aswathaman, but wait a moment.' Drona's son, however, afflicted with the shafts of Dhananjaya, quickly entered a division of the Kaurava army that abounded with infuriated elephants and teemed with cars. The mighty son of Kunti, then, with the twang of Gandiva, drowned the noise made in that battle by all other twangings of bows, of shafts decked with gold. Then, the mighty Dhananjaya followed from behind the son of Drona who had not retreated to a great distance, frightening him all the way with his shafts. Piercing with his shafts, winged with the feathers of Kankas and peacocks, the bodies of men and elephants and steeds, Arjuna began to grind that force. Indeed, O chief of the Bharatas, Partha, the son of Indra, began to exterminate that host teeming with steeds and elephants and men.'"

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07135.htm

INCIDENT 10: Karna again defeated by Arjuna & was rescued by Ashwathama again who took Karna on his chariot after Karna's cart was destroyed & his steeds were killed by Arjuna!

Narrative:

"Then the mighty-armed Phalguna, in that battle, pierced Karna, the son of Vikartana, in all his limbs with a hundred arrows. All his limbs bathed in blood, the Suta's son of great prowess and bravery, pierced Phalguna in return with fifty arrows. Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by him in battle, Arjuna brooked it not. Cutting off his bow, that hero, viz., Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, quickly pierced Karna in the centre of the chest with nine arrows, Then Dhananjaya, with great speed at a time, when speed was necessary shot in that battle a shaft of solar effulgence for the destruction of Karna. Drona's son, however, with a crescent-shaped arrow, cut off that shaft as it coursed impetuously (towards Karna). Thus cut off by Aswatthaman, that shaft fell down on the earth. Endued with great prowess, the Suta's son, then, O king, took up another bow, and covered the son of Pandu with several thousands of arrows. Partha, however, like the wind dispersing flight of locusts, dispelled with his own arrows that extraordinary shower of arrows issuing out of Karna's bow. Then Arjuna, displaying his lightness of hands, covered Karna, in that battle, with his arrows, in the very sight of all thy troops. Karna also, that slayer of hosts, desirous of counteracting Arjuna's feat, covered Arjuna with several thousands of arrows. Roaring at each other like two bulls, those lions among men, those mighty car-warriors, shrouded the welkin with clouds of straight shafts. Each rendered invisible by the other's arrowy showers, they continued to strike each other. And they roared at each other and pierced each other with their wordy darts, saying, 'I am Partha, wait'--or, 'I am Karna, wait', O Phalguna! Indeed these two heroes fought with each other wonderfully, displaying great activity and skill. And the sight they presented was such that other warriors became witnesses of that battle. And applauded by Siddhas, Charnas and Pannagas, they fought with each other, O king, each desirous of slaying the other. Then Duryodhana, O king addressing thy warriors, said, 'Carefully protect the son of Radha! Without slaying Arjuna he would not abstain from battle. Even this is what Vrisha told me.' 

Meanwhile, O monarch, beholding the prowess of Karna, Arjuna, of white steeds, with four shafts shot from the bow-string drawn to the ear, despatched the four steeds of Karna to Yama's domain. And he also felled with a broad-headed arrow, Karna's charioteer from his niche in the car. And he covered Karna himself with clouds of shafts in the very sight of thy son. Thus shrouded with arrows the steedless and driverless Karna, stupefied by that arrowy shower, knew not what to do. Beholding him made carless, Aswatthaman, O king, caused him to ride on his car, and continued to fight with Arjuna."

INCIDENT 11:Karna alongwith other kaurvas unable to stop arjuna from reaching jayadratha..Arjuna vanquished alone 7 akshohinis of kaurav army out of 11 in 1 day to revenge abhimanyu death!!

Narrative:

"Sanjaya continued, 'Thus urged by
Bhima and Kesava, Savyasachin
prevailing over Drona and Karna,
began to resist the foe all round.
Many foremost of Kshatriyas (among
the Kurus), putting forth all their
prowess, failed to withstand Arjuna
who advanced at the very van of his
troops, and who, like a raging
conflagration, was consuming the
foremost ones among his foes. Then
Duryodhana and Karna, and Sakuni,
the son of Suvala, covered Kunti's
son, Dhananjaya, with showers of
shafts. Baffling the weapons of all
those warriors, that foremost of all
persons well-skilled in weapons, O
monarch, covered them (in return)
with his shafts. Aiming at their
weapons with his (and thus baffling
them all), Arjuna, endued with great
lightness of hand and possessing a
complete control over his senses,
pierced every one of those warriors
with ten keen-pointed shafts.

"Then Pandavas, O monarch, and the
Panchalas, celebrated for their
prowess, beholding the mighty-
armed Karna, loudly shouted, saying,
'There is Karna,' ' Where is Karna in
this fierce battle.'--' O thou of wicked
understanding, O lowest of men,
fight with us!"

INCIDENT 13:Arjuna jointly attacked by Karna,Drona,Ashwathama,Kripacharya,Vrishasena,sons of Somadatta,Shalya,Jayadratha & Arjuna resisted single handedly entire Kaurava Host:

Narrative:

"The son of Drona struck Vasudeva with three and seventy shafts, and Arjuna himself with three broad-headed shafts, and his standard and (four) steeds with five others. Beholding Janardana pierced, Arjuna, filled with rage, struck Aswatthaman with hundred shafts. Then piercing Karna with ten arrows and Vrishasena with three, the valiant Dhananjaya cut off Salya's bow with arrows fixed on the string, at the handle. Salya then, taking up another bow, pierced the son of Pandu. And Bhurisravas pierced him with three arrows whetted on stone, and equipped with golden wings. And Karna pierced him with two and thirty arrows, and Vrishasena with seven. And Jayadratha pierced Arjuna with three and seventy shafts and Kripa pierced him with ten. And the ruler of the Madras also pierced Phalguna in that battle with ten arrows. And the son of Drona pierced him with sixty arrows. And he, once more, pierced Partha with five arrows, and Vasudeva with twenty. Then the tiger among men, viz., Arjuna owning white steeds and having Krishna for his driver, pierced each of those warriors in return, displaying the lightness of his hand. Piercing Karna with a dozen shafts and Vrishasena with three, Partha cut off Salya's bow at the handle. And piercing the son of Somadatta with three arrows and Salya with ten, he pierced Kripa with five and twenty arrows, and the ruler of the Sindhus with a hundred, Partha struck Drona's son with seventy arrows. Then Bhurisravas filled with rage, cut off the goad in Krishna's hand, and struck Arjuna with three and twenty shafts. Then Dhananjaya, of white steeds, filled with rage, mangled those enemies of his with hundreds upon hundreds of arrows, like a mighty tempest tearing masses of clouds.'"

Ashwathama & Kripacharya exposing Karna's bravery:

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07154.htm

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07155.htm

what Lord Krishna think of karna's bravery in encounter with Abhimanyu:

Krishna said(To Arjuna):.I swear by Truth to thee, O friend, that my limbs are burning at the thought that while the son of Subhadra was thus advancing,consuming the hostile army with his shafts, even on that occasion the wicked-souled Karna was engaged in acts of hostility to that hero,Unable, O Partha, to stay in that battle before Abhimanyu's face, mangled with the shafts of Subhadra's son, deprived of consciousness, and bathed in blood, Karna drew 
deep breaths, inflamed with rage. At last, afflicted with arrows, he was 
obliged to turn his back upon the field. 

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/m08073.htm

& Finally karna himself accepting Arjuna's supeority:

Narrative:

"'Karna said(about Arjuna), "As far as I have heard,
such a superior car-warrior has
never been born on earth! Behold
my prowess, since I will contend in
battle with even that Partha who is
such. This prince of Kuru's line, this
foremost of car-warriors, careers in
battle, borne by his steeds white in
hue. Perhaps he will despatch me to
Yama's abode today. Know, however,
that with Karna's death, these all
will be exterminated. The two arms
of this prince are never covered with
sweat. They never tremble. They are
massive and covered with cicatrices.
Firm in the use of weapons, he is
possessed of great skill and endued
with great lightness of hands.
Indeed, there is no warrior equal to
the son of Pandu. He taketh a large
number of arrows and shooteth them
as if they were one. Quickly fixing
them on the bow-string, he
propelleth them to the distance of
two miles. They always fall on the
foe. What warriors is there on earth
that is equal to him? That Atiratha,
endued with great activity, with
Krishna as his ally, gratified the god
Agni at Khandava. There, on that
occasion, the high-souled Krishna
obtained his discus, and Savyasaci,
the son of Pandu, obtained his bow
Gandiva. There that mighty-armed
one, endued with might that knows
no decay, also obtained his terrible
car unto which are yoked those white
steeds, as also his two great
celestial and inexhaustible quivers,
and many celestial weapons, from
the God of Fire. In the region of
Indra he obtained his conch
Devadatta and slew innumerable
Daityas, and all the Kalakeyas. Who
is there on earth that is superior to
him? Possessed of greatness of soul,
he gratified Mahadeva himself in fair
fight, and obtained from him the
terrible and mighty weapon Pasupata
that is capable of destroying the
three worlds. The several Regents of
the world, united together gave him
their weapons of immeasurable
energy, with which that lion among
men quickly destroyed in battle
those united Asuras, the
Kalakhanjas. 

So also, in Virata's city,
moving on a single car he
vanquished all of us, and snatched
from us that wealth of kine, and took
from all the foremost of car-warriors
(portions of) their garments.
Challenging that foremost of
Kshatriyas, that hero having him of
Vrishni's race for his ally, that
warrior who is endued with such
energy and such attributes, I regard
myself, O Shalya, to be the foremost
of persons in all the world in point
of courage. He is, again, protected by
that Keshava of great energy, who i
Narayana himself and who is without
a rival, that high-souled Vasudeva,
that ever-victorious Vishnu armed
with conch, discus, and mace, whose
attributes all the world united
together, cannot (in narrating)
exhaust in 10,000 years. Beholding
the two Krishnas together on the
same car, fear entereth my heart
together with courage. Partha is the
foremost of all bowmen!

FINAL KARNA ARJUNA BATTLE(DAY 17 OF MAHABHARATA):

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/m08089.htm 

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/m08090.htm 

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/m08091.htm 

ACCORDING TO MY ANALYSIS OF THIS TRANSLATION IN THE FINAL BATTLE OF MAHABHARATA,ARJUNA & KARNA ASSAULTED EACH OTHER 35 TIMES WITH NUMEROUS, THOUSANDS & LAKHS OF ARROWS ………8 TIMES THEY NULLIFIED EACH OTHER ARROWS ,12 TIMES BOTH KARNA & ARJUNA PIERCED EACH OTHER BUT THE REMAINING 15 TIMES ARJUNA PIERCED KARNA IN EVERY PART OF HIS BODY & KARNA’S LIMBS,YOKE,STANDARD,STEEDS,CHARIOT WERE RIPPED APART & KARNA WAS LEFT MANGLED BATHED IN BLOOD & KARNA HAD NO ANSWER FOR ARJUNA’S ARROWS!!!AT THE TIME KARNA'S CHARIOT WHEELS WAS SWALLOWED BY BHOOMI,KARNA HAS SUFFERED A CLEAR DEFEAT!!

KARNA'S SERIES OF MILITARY DEFEATS BY OTHER WARRIORS APART FROM ARJUNA & THAT TOO WHEN KARNA HAD THAT MUCH HYPED KAVACH KUNDAL WITH HIM!

1.)KARNA DEFEAT BY BHIMASENA:

NARRATIVE:

Struck by Bhimasena, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, the Suta's son, that commander (of thy forces), sat down senseless on the terrace of his car.The ruler of the Madras then, beholding the Suta's son deprived of his senses, bore that ornament of battle away on his car, from that fight. 

Then after Karna's defeat, Bhimasena began to rout the vast Dhartarashtra host ike Indra routing the danavas.'"

http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/m08050.htm

2.)KARNA DEFEAT BY BHIMASENA(2ND TIME):

NARRATIVE:

Dhritrashtra said to Sanjaya:

"Hearing, however, of the repeated defeat in battle of Karna by Bhimasena of terrible deeds, a swoon seems to come upon me, I think, the Kauravas to be already slain, in consequence of evil policy of my son. Karna will never succeed, O Sanjaya, in vanquishing those mighty bowmen, viz., the sons of Pritha. In all the battles that Karna has fought with the sons of Pandu, 
the latter have invariably defeated him on the field. Indeed, O son, the Pandavas are incapable of being vanquished by the very gods with Vasava at their head"

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07129.htm

PLEASE NOTE THAT KARNA WAS ALSO DEFEATED SEVERAL BY BHIMASENA IN RAJASUYA YAGNA DURING DIGVIJAY CEREMONY OF KARNA!

 3.)Karna's defeat by Bhimasena(3rd Time):

Narrative:

"Sanjaya, said, 'While the mighty car-warriors Bhimasena was uttering those roars, mighty Karna, unable to bear them, rushed at him with a loud shout, stretching his bow with great force. Indeed, the mighty Karna, desirous of battle, displayed his strength and checked Bhima's course like a tall tree withstanding tempest. The heroic Bhima also, beholding Vikartana's son before him, suddenly blazed up in wrath and sped at him with great force many shafts whetted on stone. Karna received all those shafts and sped many in return. At that encounter between Bhima and Karna, hearing the sounds of their palms, the limbs of all the struggling combatants, car-warriors, and horsemen, began to tremble. Indeed, hearing the terrible roars of Bhimasena on the field of battle, even all the foremost of Kshatriyas regarded the whole earth and the welkin to be filled with that noise. And at the fierce peals uttered by the high-souled son of Pandu, the bows of all warriors in that battle dropped on the earth. And steeds and elephants, O king, dispirited, ejected urine and excreta. Various frightful omens of evil then made their appearance. The welkin was covered with flights of vultures and Kankas during that terrific encounter between Bhima and Karna. Then Karna struck Bhima with twenty arrows, and quickly pierced the latter's charioteer also with five. Smiling the while, the mighty and active Bhima then, in that battle, quickly sped at Karna four and sixty arrows. Then Karna, O king, sped four shafts at him. Bhima, by means of his straight shafts, cut them into many fragments, O king, displaying his lightness of hand. Then Karna covered him with dense showers of arrows. Thus covered by Karna, the mighty son of Pandu, however, cut off Karna's bow at the handle and then pierced Karna with ten straight arrows. The Suta's son then, that mighty car-warrior of terrible deeds, taking up another bow and stringing it quickly, pierced Bhima in that battle (with many shafts). Then Bhima, excited with rage, struck the Suta's son with great force on the chest with three straight shafts. With those arrows sticking at his breast, Karna looked beautiful, O bull of Bharata's race, like a mountain with three tall summits. Thus pierced with mighty shafts, blood began to flow from his wounds, like torrents of liquid red-chalk down the breast of a mountain. Afflicted with those shafts shot with great force, Karna became agitated a little. Fixing an arrow then on his bow, he pierced

Bhima, again, O sire! And once more he began to shoot arrows by hundreds and thousands. Suddenly shrouded with shafts by that firm bowman, viz., Karna, the son of Pandu, smiling the while, cut off Karna's bow-string. And then with a broad-headed arrow, he despatched Karna's charioteer to the abode of Yama. And that mighty car-warrior, viz., Bhima, deprived the four steeds also of Karna of their lives. The mighty car-warrior Karna then speedily jumping down, O king, from his steedless car, mounted the car of Vrishasena. The valiant Bhimasena then, having vanquished Karna in battle, uttered a loud shout deep as the roar of the clouds.

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07125.htm

 Narrative:

"Dhritarashtra said, 'How raged that battle, in the neighbourhood of Arjuna's car, between those two mighty car-warriors, viz., Bhima and Karna, both of whom are endued with great strength? Once before Karna had been vanquished by Bhimasena in battle."

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07127.htm


4.)Karna's defeat by Bhimasena(4th time):

The mighty-armed Bhima could not brook that conduct, in battle, of the mighty-armed Karna. Rolling his eyes ill wrath, he pierced Karna with five and twenty long shafts. Thereupon, Karna looked like a white mountain with many snakes of virulent poison (hanging from its sides). And once more, Bhimasena, endued with the prowess of a celestial, pierced the Suta's son who was prepared to lay down his life in battle, with six and then with eight arrows. And, again, with another arrow, the valiant Bhimasena quickly cut off Karna's bow, smiling the while. And he slew also with his shafts the four steeds of Karna and then his charioteer, and then pierced Karna himself in the chest with a number of long shafts endued with the effulgence of the sun. Those winged shafts, piercing through Karna's body, entered the earth, like the rays of the sun piercing through the clouds. Afflicted with arrows and his bow cut off, Karna, though proud of his manliness, felt great pain and proceeded to another car.'"

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07127.htm

KARNA START WEEPING AFTER GETTING DEFEATED BY BHIMASENA:

NARRATIVE:

Then Karna, weeping in grief, circumambulated that son of thine, who, adorned with ornaments, lay on the earth, writhing like a snake. Bhima then, having made that deadly foe of his, viz., Karna, carless, smiling by covered him with shafts and made him look like a Sataghni with numberless spikes on it. The Atiratha Karna, however, that chastiser of foes, though thus pierced with arrows, did not yet avoid the enraged Bhima in battle.'"

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07129.htm

Karna accepting he had been owned big time by Bhimasena..No other warrior has harassed Karna so much as Bhimasena:

Narrative:

Thus addressed by thy son, O sire, the son of Radha replied unto Duryodhana, that foremost one among the Kurus, in these words, 'Deeply hath my body been pierced in battle by the brave bowman Bhimasena, capable of striking vigorously with repeated showers of arrows. O giver of honours, that I am yet present in battle is because that one like me should be present here. Scorched with the powerful shafts of Bhimasena, every limb of mine is suffering from torturing pain I shall, however, for all that, fight to the best of my

p. 315

powers. My life itself is for thee. I shall strive my best so that this foremost one of the sons of Pandu may not succeed in slaying the ruler of the Sindhus. As long as I shall fight, shooting my whetted shafts, the heroic Dhananjaya, capable of drawing the bow with even his left hand, will not succeed in getting at the ruler of the Sindhus.

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07141.htm

KARNA'S DEFEAT BY PANCHALA KING DRUPADA:

NARRATIVE:

"But the mighty bowman, Prishata's son, invincible in battle, though very much pierced with the arrows of the enemy, instantly began, O Bharata,to afflict the hostile ranks with greater vigour. And careering over the field of battle like a fiery wheel, king Drupada with his arrows smote Duryodhana and Vikarna and even the mighty Karna and many other heroic princes and numberless warriors, and slaked their thirst for battle."

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01141.htm

6.)KARNA'S DEFEAT BY SATYAKI:

NARRATIVE:

"Although all those warriors headed by Karna made strong efforts for slaying Satyaki, yet those foremost of car-warriors, failed to slay him. Drona's son and Kritavarman and other mighty car-warriors, as also hundreds of foremost Kshatriyas, were all vanquished by Satyaki with only one bow. 
That hero fought, desirous of benefiting king Yudhishthira the Just, and of attaining to heaven. Indeed, Satyaki, that crusher of foes, is equal to either of the two Krishnas in energy. Smiling the while, he vanquished all thy troops, O best of men! In this world, there are only three mighty bowmen, viz., Krishna, Partha, and Satyaki. There is no fourth to be seen."

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07143.htm

Satyaki again harassing Karna:

Narrative:

Smiting the great host of Karna with whetted arrows, Satyaki penetrated into the vast and limitless army of the Bharatas.

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07109.htm

Karna again saved by Duryodhana,Jayadratha & Drona from Satyaki:

Narrative:

The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the 

Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it.

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07030.htm

ALSO SEE WHAT LORD KRISHNA THINK ABOUT KARNA'S STRENGTH:

Narrative:

"Thus addressed by Savyasachin, the mighty-armed Kesava, endued with great energy, replied in these opportune words, 'The mighty-armed Satyaki is singly a match for Karna, O son of Pandu!"

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07143.htm

7.)KARNA DEFEATED BY GANDHARWA CHITRASENA:

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03239.htm

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03240.htm

8.)KARNA DEFEATED & FRIEGHTENED BY ABHIMANYU IN CHAKRAVYUHU:

Narrative:

Hearing these words, Karna, afflicted with the shafts of Arjuna's son, once more said unto Drona, 'Exceedingly afflicted with the shafts of Abhimanyu, I am staying in battle, only because (as a warrior) I should stay here. Indeed, the arrows of this south of great energy are exceedingly fierce. Terrible as they are and possessed of the energy of fire, these arrows are weakening my heart.'

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07045.htm

Furthur defeats of Karna by Abhimanyu:

Narrative:

Then Abhimanyu, excessively pierced by those great bowmen with their straight shafts, shot shafts at Karna which was capable of piercing through every armour and body. That shaft, piercing through Karna's coat of mail and then his body, entered the earth like a snake piercing through an anthill. Deeply pierced, Karna felt great pain and became perfectly helpless. Indeed, Karna began to tremble in that battle like a hill during an earthquake.

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07035.htm

Narrative:

"Sanjaya said, 'Phalguni's son once more pierced Karna in the car with a barbed arrow, and for angering him still further, he pierced him with fifty other shafts. The son of Radha pierced Abhimanyu in return with as many shafts. Covered all over with arrows, Abhimanyu, then, O sire, looked exceedingly beautiful. Filled with rage, he caused Karna also to be bathed in blood. Mangled with arrows and covered with blood, the brave Karna also shone greatly. 2 Both of them pierced with arrows, both bathed in blood, those illustrious warriors then resembled a couple of flowering Kinsukas. The son of Subhadra then slew six of Karna's brave counsellors, conversant with all modes of warfare, with their steeds and charioteers and cars. 

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07045.htm

9.)KARNA AGAIN FLED FROM BATTLEFIELD..THIS TIME FROM ABHIMANYU:

NARRATIVE:

Karna, O monarch, was filled with pain. Meanwhile, the son of Subhadra, causing Karna by means of his arrows to turn away from the field, quickly rushed against the other great bowmen. Then Abhimanyu of fierce energy and great fame, filled with wrath, broke that host of diverse forces abounding with elephants and steeds and cars and infantry. As regards Karna, afflicted by Abhimanyu with countless shafts, he fled away from the field borne by swift steeds. 

http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07038.htm

KARNA WAS DEFEATED DESPITE HAVING THESE ADVANTAGES:

1.)KARNA HAD THAT MUCH FAMED "IMPENETRABLE KAVACH" WITH HIM!

2.)KARNA WAS FIGHTING WITH LOWER CLASS WARRIORS AS COMPARED TO ARJUNA!

3.)NO CURSE OF BRAHMAN OR PURSHURAM WAS INTERFERING WITH KARNA'S CAMPAIGN!

4.)NO SO CALLED "LORD KRISHNA HELP" WAS PROVIDED TO KARNA OPPONENTS!

5.)KARNA WAS CARRYING THE MIGHTY 'VIJAYA DHANUSH' & VARIETY OF DIVYASTRAS PROVIDED BY PURSHURAM UNLIKE HIS OPPONENTS!

;Description
: The Jeane Dixon bio is a blatant hatchet job that does not contain (and does not even allow on its talk page) investigative reporting from perfectly respectable sources.   Under the Jeane Dixon Effect I have suggested this addition, based on on Denis Brian's book on Dixon for Doubleday:

How much of that effect applies to Dixon herself in relation to the presidential death prediction needs to be weighed against the further predictions she made just preceding Kennedy's assassination. According to Eleanor Bumgardner Wright, an executive secretary to Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy and assistant to President Kennedy's sister, Eunice Shriver, Jeanne Dixon was extremely upset a few months before the assassination, saying "All I can see is the casket over the White House." [4] And Estelle Friedrichs, administrative assistant in the White House during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations "remember[ed] distinctly" that "nine days before the assassination" Jeanne Dixon had asked her to contact Grace Tully (Franklin Rosoevelt's private secretary) "to tell her to tell the President not to go down South. He will be assassinated." [5]

Can we at least get this on the talk page for now?

;Description
: I want to create an article on HP OneView. I attempted to do this on April 14th, but was not allowed. The reason given in the log is "Long-term pattern abuse," which is very confusing and groundless, because I created my Wiki account on April 14th as well. I wrote the HP OneView article and I included well-established, third-party sources for all the factual statements and opinions. In the talk section of Jasper Deng, Jasper states that unlike this page he created, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2012, the HP OneView article is not about one software product (not true; HP OneView is one product); and that the article is not arranged around features. These reasons do not seem to fall within the bounds of Wikipedia article creation and attribution guidelines. 

I would appreciate a second opinion on the legitimacy of the HP OneView page, other than Jasper Deng's.

The filter log does not have you editing the above page. The filter log shows that you tried to remove huge chunks of text from another users page. This generally isn't allowed so the filter is correct. Why don't you try discussing this on the user's talk page?

I was adding portraits on many different pages to bring more illustration. Some of these pages didn't even had any portrait of the concerned subject. I thought that this would help to improve the quality of wikipedia content. 
Thanks for your understanding and to let me know what I actually did wrong.

: Made grammatical corrections and other changes including adding the name of the honor awarded to the winning house in an academic year. The honor is called the "Cock House".

: I was making a number of edits to the page, and using preview to see the effects.  They appeared fine.  When I tried to save, it told me that it wouldn't save because the page referenced something from archive.i* (something) which was not an acceptable source. It wasn't anything I had changed, BTW, it was a link that was already on the page.  I removed the offending URL, and tried to save again, and it told me that it couldn't save the changes because they weren't a "constructive edit". Now it cycles between the two states. Short of trying to add a bogus URL, which doesn't seem like the best idea, I'm not sure there's a way I can save this.

;Description
: Added explanation (based on personal experience, and on Chevy Chase main article) to the dubious-sounding final sentence ... of the "Program" section.  My purpose was to clarify the speculative-looking existing sentence (to which someone had added inserts requesting specifics/evidence), so at least users could judge for themselves.  The turbulence of the Sixties was common knowledge; I lived through it but it repeatedly made the front cover of newsweeklies and the network TV news.  So I don't believe I was "doing something stupid or something you shouldn't have been doing."  
(I've edited over 100 articles before, including this one and the one on Billy Bang today, and never seen a "false positive" warning; so I'm not clear if I'm reporting what you need to know.  But I feel clear that I don't merit being banned.  I'll look back here to see if you feel otherwise, because I'd like to learn why.  I also think it would be helpful for Wikipedia to define "false positive" somewhere; I only know the term medically.)

;Description
: trying to post a new section in the Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard 

The Wikipedia page for [[Alejandro Estrada]] is inaccurate and the information listed is fraudulent, libelous and defamatory.  In addition, the sources cited are bogus, unreliable and appear to have been manipulated by an individual acting with criminal intent because the real [[Alejandro Estrada]] is not a "monkey doctor" and the real [[Alejandro Estrada]] is involved with an active legal matter pending in a California Court. <ref>Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number:  BP115442  GOSS, MICHAEL R. - TRUST DTD 02/13/09 Filing Date:  12/09/2009</ref><ref>Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number:  BP119874 GOSS, MICHAEL R. - DECEDENT Filing Date:  03/11/2009</ref>  Moreover, there is also an active federal investigation into [[America's Help Center]] and [[Alejandro Estrada]] is a witness in that investigation.  

The information provided by [[Wikipedia]] slanders the credibility of [[Alejandro]] because when someone tries to verify his information, the data found on [[Wikipedia]] contradicts factual information thereby creating confusion surrounding the details of the crimes in question.      [[Wikipdeia]] may or may not be contributing to the crimes being investigated by the [[FBI]] <ref>http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/victim_assistance/seeking-victim-information/short-refi-funding-investigation</ref> however, the tenacity of [[Wikipedia]] in  attacking factual information and replacing it with disinformation suggests [[Wikipedia]] has a motive for protecting the criminals targeting [[Alejandro Estrada]] and diluting [[Alex Estrada]] in the media.

It is one thing when a group of individuals act in orchestra to manipulate how information is presented in order to deceive the public, and it is an entirely different thing when a victim of a crime seeks retribution for their damages.   From my understanding, a victim has the legal right not to be misrepresented with inaccurate information about them,  therefore if [[Wikipedia]] does not honor the request to correct the disinformation then  [[Wikipedia]] may become liable.  In addition, [[Wikipedia]] may be violating [[Alejandro]]'s [[right to publicity]] among other rights.  I am only a layperson, however, I believe it would be in [[Wikipedia]]'s best legal interest to remove [[Alejandro Estrada]] until after the [[FBI]] closes their investigation. 

[[Alejandro]] was born in 1978.   [[Alejandro Estrada]] published [[Pandora, her Box and her Daddy's Curse]] in 2012 <ref>Registration Number / Date:	 TX0007593874 / 2012-08-30</ref> which was later republished [[Alejandro Carbajal Estrada]] in 2013 <ref>Registration Number / Date:	 TX0007777225 / 2013-07-31</ref>.   In 2009, music artist [[Lady Gaga]] released a song named after [[Alejandro]] and the hidden meaning behind the lyrics continue to be covered up with convoluted information.     

[[Alejandro Estrada]] became a [[Wikipedia]] page in October 2008 which was created by user [[Primatesmx]] suggesting a violation of [[Wikipedia]]'s policies because from my understanding, it is against [[Wikipedia]]'s terms and conditions for individuals to create pages about themselves.     Furthermore, [[Michael Goss]] was allegedly murdered in February 2009 which supports [[Alejandro]]'s testimony thereby establishing premeditation by his perpetrators..

According to the [[Library of Congress]] as of 5/20/2014 these entries could not be found:  Frugivores and seed dispersal / edited by [[Alejandro Estrada]] and Theodore H. Fleming. <ref>Registration Number / Date:	 TX0002136090 / 1987-08-17</ref>  New perspectives in study of Mesoamerican primates : distribution, ecology, behavior and conservation / edited by [[Alejandro Estrada]], Paul A. Garber, Mary S. M. Pavelka, LeAndra Luecke <ref>Registration Number / Date:	 TX0006316037 / 2006-02-17</ref>

This discrepancy was brought to [[Wikipedia]]'s attention on 5/23/2014 and in fact, the only reliable records for [[Alejandro Estrada]] were [[Pandora, her Box and her Daddy's Curse]] <ref>Registration Number / Date:	 TX0007593874 / 2012-08-30</ref> and [[Alejandro Carbajal Estrada]] <ref>Registration Number / Date:	 TX0007777225 / 2013-07-31</ref>, which could explain [[Wikipedia]]'s motive because when the page for [[Alejandro Estrada]] was created, [[Alejandro Estrada]] had not yet become a notable individual.   [[Alejandro]] has since become a notable individual and in over 5 years it is strange that no one editing this page has been able to provide an image of [[Alejandro Estrada]].    It is also strange how nothing is referenced to [[Alejandro Estrada]]'s presence in the media, especially considering his exposure.

So, with all that said, if the [[Library of Congress]] records have changed in any way, then it would establish a reason to [[subpoena]] the appropriate logs in order to [[audit]] the change logs to identity the individual, or individuals, with the authority to manipulate that data.     Again, I am only a [[layperson]], however, changing data in order to cover up a discrepancy might be considered an [[admission of guilt]] because on this level, doing so would be the equivalent to a [[Watergate]] scandal.

::I'll post my original comment (have saved it in computer). So: 

<blockquote>I noticed some problems with the article last week. It's kind of ridiculous to see people denying Svoboda or even the Right Sector are 'far-right' attaching the very label to an organization that was founded only recently. Cheap Soviet style agitprop. It was removed from the infobox, but the main text still reflects such exaggerations. 

First, [[Alexander Prokhanov]] is strictly speaking not ''fascist''. He was pro-Soviet and still is, blending procommunist and ultranationalist attitudes. But if you want to have a short description, he is not a fascist neither in the Western nor in the Soviet sense. The same goes for the supposed '''''fascist''' political scientist and Eurasia Party leader Aleksandr Dugin''. The best description for Dugin would still be (Neo-)Eurasianist, but because this word is descriptive and not emotionally loaded, the creators of this article of course prefer the curse word ''fascist'' used in an inflationary manner. 

As for Pavel Gubarev, then it is also tendentious and outright dishonest to label him as 'a figure of the far-right', while his previous more important affiliation was with the [[Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine]], a hardleft party. All the figures I mentioned here may be thoroughly unpleasant, but really, folks, an encyclopedia should not be written in a primitive style of ''История Всесоюзной Коммунистической Партии (Большевиков): Краткий курс''. Wikipedia can do better than that! [[User:Patriot Donbassa|Patriot Donbassa]] ([[User talk:Patriot Donbassa|talk]]) 10:42, 1 June 2014 (UTC)</blockquote>.

:It is particularly the edit that says, "The Illuminati, Part 3: The Conspiratorial Future". The description says, "While skeptics believe the Illuminati disbanded in the 18th century, conspiracy theorists think the organization still exists and has nearly accomplished its ancient goals.

::Yes I noticed that when I looked at this filter log. The weird thing is, the filter warning specifically said "youtu.be", so I changed it to the full youtube URL and tried again. That's when it blocked the edit. Right after I filed this report and looked at the log and saw it stating the "archive.is" as the problem, I went back to the page to change it, and the text was actually the full url (http://archive.today/w3iQk). In any case I just used a different archive source and replaced that domain altogether. Might be a bug to look into regarding the way Wikipedia software sees that domain.
