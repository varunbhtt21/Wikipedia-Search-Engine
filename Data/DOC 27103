Her first protector, Marc Fournier, was director of the [[Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin]], who introduced her to [[Prince Napoléon Bonaparte|Prince Napoleon]], cousin of [[Napoleon III]].<ref name="Shadowproof" /> Napoleon installed her in a beautiful flat in rue de l'Arcade,<ref name="France Culture" /> close to the [[Champs-Élysées|Avenue des Champs-Elysees]].<ref name="Shadowproof" /> She would host an exclusively male assembly of the Parisian ''[[Man of letters|men of letters]]'': [[Ernest Renan]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Lucien-Anatole Prévost-Paradol|Prévost-Paradol]] and [[Emile de Girardin]].<ref name="Musée d'Orsay">{{cite web |title=Musée d'Orsay: Amaury-Duval Madame de Loynes |url=https://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/recherche/commentaire/commentaire_id/madame-de-loynes-23217.html?no_cache=1 |website=www.musee-orsay.fr |accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Amaury-Duval - Madame de Loynes |url=http://www.lankaart.org/2016/11/amaury-duval-madame-de-loynes.html |website=LANKAART |accessdate=10 March 2019 |language=fr |date=13 December 2016}}</ref>

Through her best friend, actress Josephine Clemence Ennery, nicknamed "Gisette", she met [[Gustave Flaubert]]{{sfn|Baldick|1971|p=237}} and [[Halil Şerif Pasha|Khalil-Bey]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Mystery nude's name uncovered 150 years on |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45637037 |website=BBC |accessdate=10 March 2019 |date=25 September 2018}}</ref> who fell in love with her. From [[Tunis]], where he went to write [[Salammbô]], Flaubert wrote: {{cquote|text=It is not to keep to my promise that I write to you, dear and beautiful neighbor, but because I think of you almost continually! And I have nothing to say to you, nothing else! I swear by your beautiful eyes and hands. [...] In eight days I'm leaving and in three weeks I'll see you again. This is the important thing. With what joy will I rush to your house, and how my heart will beat by pulling your bell! When I am at your feet, on your carpet, we will talk of my journey, if it amuses you. [...] If you knew how I think about your apartment, which contains you, and even the furniture that surrounds you! Have you not since my departure felt, sometimes, like a breath that passed over you? It was something of me, who escaping from my heart, traversing the space, invisibly, and reaching down there! I lived for five weeks with this memory (which is a desire too).  Your image kept me company in loneliness, incessantly. I heard your voice through the sound of the waves and your charming face flutters around me, on the hedges of nopals, in the shade of the palm trees and in the horizon of the mountains. It seems to me that I took away from your dear person a kind of emanation which penetrates me, a fragrance of which I am embalmed, which makes me drunk and intoxicates me. I blame you for occupying so much space in my thoughts. When I want to dream of [[Carthage]], it is the rue de Vendome that represents itself.{{sfn|Gallimard|1980|pp=813-814}} }}

Around 1862, she met Ernest Baroche, son of the Minister of Napoleon III, [[Master of Requests (France)|Master of Petitions]] at the [[Conseil d'État (France)|State Council]] and Director of Foreign Trade at the [[Ministry of Agriculture (France)|Ministry of Agriculture]], who fell in love with her. They would have become engaged but, as Commander of the 12th mobile battalion of the Seine, he was killed in action at the [[Battle of Le Bourget]] on 30 October 1870<ref name="Shadowproof" /> and left her a fortune of 800,000 gold francs (about 2.5 million Euros) and a sugar factory. The director of the factory is retired officer Count Victor Edgar de Loynes.<ref name="bigmammy" />

In 1872, she married de Loynes,{{sfn|Goncourt|Goncourt|1971|p=361}}. This marriage gave her access to high society, but the Count soon left for America, where he disappeared. Although the marriage was only nominal, because her husband's family had opposed their union,<ref name="bigmammy" /> she carried and kept the use of the name and title of Countess de Loynes.{{sfn|Goncourt|Goncourt|1971|p=361}} Her visitors became more prestigious; received every day between five and seven o'clock. The celebrities of the Second Empire give way to those of the nascent Third Republic, a new regime which the Countess de Loynes did not like. Her visitors included [[Georges Clemenceau]], [[Georges de Porto-Riche]], [[Alexandre Dumas fils]], [[Ernest Daudet]], [[Henry Houssaye]], [[Pierre Decourcelle]], and soon many young writers and musicians led by [[Maurice Barrès]], who gives her his two books ''Huit jours chez M. Renan'' (1890) and ''Du sang, de la volupté, et de la mort'' (1894) luxuriously bound by Charles Meunier in 1897.{{sfn|Picard Tajan Ader|1986}} Others included [[Paul Bourget]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Georges Bizet]] and Henri Kowalski.<ref name="bigmammy">{{cite web |title=La Comtesse de Loynes, biographie par Pierre-Robert Leclercq - Bigmammy en ligne |url=http://www.bigmammy.fr/archives/2011/11/20/22730667.html |website=www.bigmammy.fr |accessdate=10 March 2019 |language=fr |date=20 November 2011}}</ref>

Between 1880 and 1885, through [[Arsène Houssaye]], she met the critic [[Jules Lemaître]], who was 15 years younger than her. Under his leadership, she founded, the [[Ligue de la patrie française|League of the French Homeland]] in 1899, and became its first president. Encouraging nationalism, they put their political hopes, like other personalities such as the [[Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart|Duchess of Uzès]], in [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|General Boulanger]] and became passionately [[Dreyfus affair|anti-Dreyfusards]].<ref name="bigmammy" /> This led to a break with some of her friends including Georges Clemenceau, Georges de Porto-Riche and [[Anatole France]]. From then on she received into her home [[Édouard Drumont]], [[Jules Guérin]] and [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Luçay|Henri Rochefort]].<ref name="bigmammy" />

In her latter years she supported the political position of [[Charles Maurras]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Marie-Anne Detourbay, condesa de Loynes |url=http://www.meryvarona.es/marie-anne-detourbay-condesa-de-loynes/ |website=Nombres de mujer |accessdate=10 March 2019 |language=es |date=15 November 2018}}</ref> and shortly before her death on 21 January 1908, Detourbay helped Maurras and [[Léon Daudet]] to found the Royalist newspaper ''L'Action française'' by donating 100,000 gold francs.

The Countess of Loynes was buried in [[Montmartre Cemetery]], alongside her parents.
