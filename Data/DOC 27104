Before 1860, David G. Lett was pastor at the cities leading Black Baptist church, Zoar Church. In March 1860, about 40 parishioners left that church to form Zion Baptist Church led by [[Jesse Freeman Boulden]], with Rev Tansbury leading the old body. Tansbury returned to his previous home in Canada and on December 22, 1861 the two churches combined under Boulden's efforts to form the new church, Olivet Baptist Church, where Boulden served until 1863. Boulden then resigned and [[Richard DeBaptiste]] became its new pastor in August 1863.<ref>Fisher, Miles Mark. The Master's Slave, Elijah John Fisher: A Biography.

The church has been at points the largest African-American church in the United States, and one of the largest Protestant congregations in the nation. The congregation increased greatly in size in the 1920s due to the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when the church provided services and structure to Southern blacks who had relocated to the north, bringing the congregation to 11,000.<ref name="Reich2014">{{cite book|author=Steven Reich|title=The Great Black Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGqEAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA413|date=17 April 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-666-1|pages=413–}}</ref> By the 1940s the congregation numbered 20,000.<ref name="Paris1991">{{cite book|author=Peter J.
