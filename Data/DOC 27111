==Reception==

In a contemporary review, "Chie." of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that this ''Zaotichi'' film was given a big name director [[Satuso Yamamoto]] and a well known actor [[Rentaro Mikuni]] which made the film "inflated [...] which, by comparison with the others, not very entertaining."<ref name="variety-book">{{cite book|title=Variety's Film Reviews 1964-1967|volume=11|publisher=R. R. Bowker|ISBN=0-8352-2790-1|year=1983|at=There are no page numbers in this book. This entry is found under the header "September 6, 1967"}}</ref> 

J. Doyle Wallis, in a review for [[DVD Talk]], wrote that "[t]his film has one of the better plots in the series, the almost [[hippie]] ex-[[samurai]]'s teaching posing as a threat to the [[gangsters]] who prefer the [[village]]rs to lead [[:wikt:debauchery|debauched]] lives. Unfortunately some of the storytelling is sloppy, particularly the side-plot characters who Ichi becomes involved with. Their introductions and back story were told so quickly and incidentally, that when their stories began to get a third act wrap up, I had trouble recalling who they were in the first place."<ref name=dvdtalk>{{cite web|last=Wallis|first=J.
