Historically Chicago had an [[German American|ethnic German population]]. As of the [[2000 U.S. Census]] 15.8% of people in the [[Chicago area]] had German ancestry, and those of German ancestry were the largest ethnic group in 80% of Chicago's suburbs. As of that year those of German ancestry were the largest European ethnic group in Chicago.<ref name=Irvingp65>Irving, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TbLkURD3SesC&pg=PA65 65].</ref>

==19th century==
The first Germans arrived in Chicago in the 1830s.<ref name=Irvingp65/> Germans arrived in the United States as Chicago began to develop in the mid-19th century.<ref name=Harzig>Harzig, Christiane. "[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/512.html Germans]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6PJL8tGZt Archive]). ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]''. Retrieved on May 4, 2014.</ref> 1,000 Germans were in Chicago in 1845.<ref name=Irvingp65/>

In 1848 the first large group of Germans immigrated due to failed revolts in German states. The Germans arriving on or soon after that year became known as the "[[Forty-Eighters]]". Irving Cutler, the author of ''Chicago'', wrote that their true underlying motive to come to the U.S. was economic even though they had to immediately leave Germany due to political issues.<ref name=Irvingp65/> According to Cutler, these Germans did not place importance on religious reasons, and they "arrived much less destitute" compared to Irish immigrants.<ref name=Irvingp65/> The German population increased to 5,073 in 1850,<ref name=Irvingp65/> and that year Germans made up 1/6th of Chicago's population.<ref name=Harzig/>

In 1855 [[Mayor of Chicago]] [[Levi Boone]] declared that on Sundays all beer gardens and saloons will be closed, leading to the [[Lager Beer Riots]].<ref name=Irvingp65/>

There were 22,230 ethnic Germans in Chicago, or 20% of the city's population, in 1860.<ref name=Irvingp65/>

One of the leading newspapers of the region in the late 19th century was the German language [[Illinois Staats-Zeitung]], owned by former [[Cook County Sheriff's Office|Cook County Sheriff]] [[Anton C. Hesing|A.C. Hesing]], who was also the first German-born elected official in Chicago. The paper's chief editors included U.S. Representative [[Lorenzo Brentano]] and Collector of Internal Revenue [[Hermann Raster]]. The Staats-Zeitung was in publication until its support for Germany in [[World War I]] and a subsequent scandal involving the [[American Legion]] caused its failure in 1921.<ref>Carl Wittke, Refugees of Revolution: The German Forty-Eighters in America.

The [[Haymarket Riot]] occurred in 1886.<ref name=Irvingp65/>

The peak of German immigration was 1890.<ref name=Heinen2p7>Heinen and Heinen, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PWBG-0Sa8z8C&pg=PA7 7].</ref>

In 1900 there were 470,000 Chicago residents who had at least one parent born in Germany and/or who were born in Germany themselves. Those of German descent were the largest ethnic group of Chicago from 1850 until the turn of the century.<ref name=Harzig/>

==20th century==
German immigration decreased in the 20th century due to increases in the German economy and new restrictions on immigration.<ref name=Heinen2p7/>

In 1914 there were 191,168 people born in Germany living in Chicago; this was the peak number of German-born people in Chicago.<ref name=Irvingp65/>

In 1920 22% of Chicagoans self-reported as being of German ancestry. The lower numbers were because of a reluctance to report German ancestry due to anti-German sentiment from [[World War I]] and because of reduced immigration from Germany.<ref name=Harzig/>

In the [[World War II]] era anti-Hitler dissidents and [[German Jews]] immigrated to Chicago. In the post-World War II era ethnic Germans expelled from [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Yugoslavia]] arrived in Chicago.<ref name=Heinen2p7/>

In 1980 6% of Chicago's population born outside of the United States was from Germany. After 1980 this percentage decreased.<ref name=Irvingp65/>

==Geography==
Historically the bulk of Chicago's Germans lived in the North Side with the center of the German population being [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]]. In German the North Side was called the "Nord Seite".<ref name=Heinen2p7/>

There were smaller numbers in the South Side that worked mainly in meatpacking. Joseph C. Heinen and Susan Barton Heinen, authors of ''Lost German Chicago'', stated that in the 1970s some "vestiges" of the South Side German community remained but otherwise it had "quickly dispersed" in the 20th century.<ref name=Heinen2p7/>

==Demographics==
By the end of the 19th century, about 35% of the Germans originated from northeast Germany. In the 1880s and 1890s most of Chicago's German immigration originated from the estates in rural northeast Germany in places such as [[Mecklenburg]], [[Pomerania]], and [[Prussia]]. By the end of the 19th century, 25% were from southwest Germany. 17% were from northwest Germany. 12% were from southeast; in the 1830s most immigration came from southwestern Germany. By the end of the 19th century, 11% were from western Germany. Most German immigration in the 1850s and 1860s came from the middle part of the country.<ref name=Harzig/>

By the end of the 19th century, about 55% of Chicago's Germans were Roman Catholic. The Protestant population was smaller. According to Christiane of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', they "were more outspoken on political and community issues."<ref name=Harzig/> There were about 20,000 German Jews in Chicago by 1900.<ref name=Harzig/>

==Institutions==
The [[DANK Haus German American Cultural Center]] is located in [[Lincoln Square, Chicago]]. The [[Goethe-Institut]] Chicago is located in downtown Chicago and offers cultural programs, German language courses and exams. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/chicago|title=Goethe-Institut Chicago - Goethe-Institut USA|website=www.goethe.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>

==Politics==
In the 19th century many Chicago Germans became involved in antislavery abolition movements.<ref name=Irvingp65/> Notable German American abolitionists in Chicago included [[Wilhelm Rapp]] and [[Hermann Raster]].

In the late 19th century Chicago many Germans were involved in anarchist-radical politics. At that time German Americans were the primary leaders of the Socialist Labor Party and by 1890 it was essentially a German-speaking group. German was one of the organization's two official languages used in its meetings. German Americans disproportionately made up those who participated in the 1886 [[Haymarket Riot]].<ref name=Hollip97>Holli, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&pg=PA97 97].</ref>

Several factors caused German American involvement in radical politics to cease by the 20th century. In the 1880s and 1890s the living standards of German Americans had improved, making them better than those in Germany. In addition, agitators and radical emigrant editors stopped coming to Chicago because Bismarck repealed Germany's anti-socialist laws.<ref name=Hollip97/>
