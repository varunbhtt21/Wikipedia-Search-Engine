==History==
A church service was first held in the shed of [[John Kerr (Nelson politician)|John Kerr]]'s father on 4 December 1842. Two of his neighbours, Saxton and Tytler, gave land for a church and vicarage, and the first service was held in the church on 24 December 1843.<ref>{{cite journal |volume=3 |issue=3 |title=Waimea West |url= http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-NHSJ03_03-t1-body1-d7.html |journal=Journal of the Nelson Historical Society Incorporated |location=Nelson |publisher=Nelson Historical Society |date=September 1977 |accessdate=4 May 2014 |pages=21, 27}}</ref> The church was the first church in the [[Nelson Province]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Walrond |first=Carl |title=Nelson places - Richmond and the Waimea Plains |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/29006/st-michaels-church-waimea-west |publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=3 May 2014 |date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="NZHPT 248">{{NZHPT|248|St Michael's Church (Anglican)|4 May 2014}}</ref> The building had an overall length of {{convert|52|ft}} and cost â‚¤105.<ref name="History of St Michael's">{{cite web |title=The History of St Michael's Church |url= http://www.waimeanelsonanglican.org.nz/st-michaels-church.html |publisher=Brightwater Community Anglican Churches |accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>

A building committee decided on building a new church and in May 1866, it appointed [[Thomas Brunner]] as the architect.<ref name="History of St Michael's" /> The foundation stone for the new church was laid on 24 November 1866, and the ceremony was attended by many prominent people: Colonel [[Mathew Richmond]], Sir [[David Monro]], [[Arthur Seymour (politician)|Arthur Seymour]], Brunner as the architect, [[Edward Baigent]], with the service conducted by [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]]. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs Blundell.<ref>{{cite news |title=Laying the Foundation Stone of St Michael's Church Waimea West |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC18661127.2.11 |accessdate=4 May 2014 |newspaper=Colonist |date=27 November 1866 |volume=X |issue=957 |page=2}}</ref> The committee decided on Christmas Day of 1866 that a memorial tablet to Captain Francis H. Blundell was necessary, as he had been one of the driving forces behind the new church building.<ref name="History of St Michael's" /> It was probably New Zealand's first memorial church. Blundell was an immediate neighbour to the church and had died in 1865; he is buried in the church's graveyard on land that he gifted.<ref name="NZHPT 248" /><ref name="History of St Michael's" /> The first service was held in the new church in July 1867.<ref name=Consecration>{{cite news |title=Consecration of St. Michael's Church, Waimea West |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=NENZC18671205.2.11 |accessdate=4 May 2014 |newspaper=Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle |date=5 December 1867 |volume=XXVI |issue=146 |page=4}}</ref> The new [[Anglican Diocese of Nelson|Bishop of Nelson]], [[Andrew Suter]], was due to arrive later in the year, and hence the church was not consecrated until 13 November 1867.<ref name="History of St Michael's" /><ref name=Consecration />

The church community tried to sell the old church, but received no suitable offers. It was used by Mrs Blundell as a [[Sunday school]] until it was blown over in high winds.<ref name="History of St Michael's" />

On 5 April 1984, St Michael's was registered with the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] as a Category I structure with registration number 248.<ref name="NZHPT 248" />

St Michael's is located on Waimea West Road within [[Brightwater]] (also known as Waimea West), just south of the boundary to [[Appleby, New Zealand|Appleby]].<ref>{{cite web |title=St Michael's Waimea West |url= https://maps.google.co.nz/maps/ms?f=q&source=s_q&geocode=&ie=UTF8&hq=st+michaels+waimea+west&hnear=&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=113653719631807350025.0004695882aac3ee27bda&dg=feature |publisher=Google Maps |accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>
