Title : Abu Mansur Mamari
Text : '''Abu Mansur Mamari''' ({{lang-fa|ابومنصور معمری}}) was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] nobleman who served as the personal minister of the [[Samanid]] general [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]]. At an unknown date, the latter wanted to create a Shahnameh ("Book of Kings"), and ordered Abu Mansur Mamari to invite several scholars. They created a [[New Persian]] version of the [[Khwaday-Namag]] in 957, and expanded it with other sources. The book became known as "Shahnama-yi Abu Mansuri" (''the book of kings of Abu Mansuri''). However, only the introduction of the book remains today, which claims that Abu Mansur Mamari was descended from [[Kanadbak]], who served as the ''[[kanarang]]'' of the [[Sasanian]] king [[Khosrau II]]. Not much more is known about Abu Mansur Mamari; he later died in the 10th-century.
