'''''Cakile edentula''''', the '''American searocket''', is a species of the flowering ''[[Cakile]]'' plant. This plant is native to [[North America]].

==Distribution==
''Cakile edentula''  is most commonly found on the beaches and dunes of North America. More commonly, it is found on the East coast of the United States. American sea-rocket is most likely to be found in areas along the coastline. This plant is not a wetland plant, but can occasionally be found in wetland environments. It is also a non-native, invasive species in other parts of the world, especially Japan and Australia.<ref>GoBotany National Science Foundation |2013| Cakile edentula</ref>

==Habitat and Ecology==
''Cakile edentula'' grows on the dunes of coastal beaches, as well as shorelines of freshwater lakes. Well drained, sandy soil is preferred.  It is likely to be found in areas midway up beaches, out of the range of waves and tides, which can destroy individuals, especially through storm events. ''Cakile edentula'' has the life cycle of an annual plant in Northern latitudes. In warmer climates, it survives as a biennial if possible.<ref>M. A. Maun, R. S. Boyd and Lynda Olson |1990| The Biological Flora of Coastal Dunes and Wetlands</ref>
''Cakile edentula''  grows roots more aggressively and intensively if a nearby competitor is sensed. The plant does not react this way if the nearby competitor is kin.<ref>S. A. Dudley, A. L.
