'''''Ornithogalum lebaense''''' is a flowering plant that grows in southwest [[Angola]]. It was discovered on January 2009 by Ernst Jacobus van Jaarsveld.<ref name="van">Van Jaarsveld, E.J. 2010. Ornithogalum lebaense, a new cliffdwelling Ornithogalum (Hyacinthaceae) from southwest Angola (Benguella Province).Herbertia 64: 91â€“103.</ref> The word "''lebaense''" refers to Leba Pass, where the plant lives.<ref name="van" /> ''O. lebaense'' does not have a known common name, most likely because its habitat is not one that is easily accessible by local people. There are three other ''Ornithogalum'' species identified in Angola: ''[[Ornithogalum tenuifolium]]'', ''[[Ornithogalum pulchrum|O. pulchrum]]'' and ''[[Ornithogalum benguellens|O. benguellens]]''.<ref>Figueredo, E & Smith, G.E 2008.

==Distribution==

''Ornithogalum lebaense'' is an obligatory cremnophyte that grows on steep cliffs in the [[Serra de Chela]] [[escarpment]], an Angolan mountain range.<ref name="van" /> ''O. lebaense'' grows 1800 meters above sea level in Leba Pass.<ref name="van" />

==Habitat and ecology==

''Ornithogalum lebaense'' is often found growing with ''Aloe mendesii'', a plant that is also an obligatory cremnophyte of the area.<ref name="van" /> ''O. lebaense'' flowers in the winter and is also winter [[deciduous]].<ref name="van" /> Winters in the subtropical Serra de Chela last from June until August and are mild, without frost. While this plant grows in the wild, it also grows well if cultivated in the right conditions. The plant prefers sandy soil with low mineral content, and organic fertilizer.<ref name="van" /> It does best with no water in the winter.<ref name="van" />

==Morphology==

''O. lebaense'''s bulbs, long leaves; and short, white, cone-shaped [[inflorescence]] grow [[pendent]]. This is the main characteristic which sets ''O. lebaense'' apart from other ''Ornithogalum'' species.<ref name="van" /> Each plant has four or five semi-succulent leaves that curve in a spiral, and one or two inflorescences. The inflorescence is usually between 200 mm and 300 mm long, with clearly visible [[bract]]s. The flowers have a sweet scent, and both the flowers and pollen are white. The stamens are 8 mm long with white filaments. The style matures up to 5 mm long.  The ovary is a yellow-green color. The seeds are black, with a shiny epidermis and an angular shape.<ref name="van" />

==Pollination and dispersion==
''Ornithogalum lebaense'' is pollinated by insects. Its flowers are usually in bloom for thirty to forty-five days, and will abort if they are not fertilized. The seeds are wind-dispersed in the spring, which starts in September. In late spring (November), the plant acquires its [[glaucous]] leaves. Beginning in August (early spring), the fruiting capsules start to ripen, until the black seeds inside are finally wind-dispersed.<ref name="van" />
