The '''Saschiz fortified church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica fortificată din Saschiz}}; {{lang-de|Kirchenburg von Keisd}}) is a [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheran]] [[fortified church]] in [[Saschiz]] (''Keisd''), [[Mureș County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]]. It was built by the [[Germans|ethnic German]] [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community at a time when the area belonged to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Initially [[Roman Catholic]], it became Lutheran following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Together with the surrounding village, the church forms part of the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

==Description==
===Background and church===
[[File:Planul fortificatiei din Saschiz.jpg|thumb|The church plan]]
Construction of a large fortified late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church began in 1493 on the site of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] basilica,<ref name="com">{{ro icon}} [http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/saschiz___keisd/42/ Saschiz/Keisd] at biserici-fortificate.com</ref><ref name="org">{{ro icon}} [http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/saschiz-keisd/ Saschiz/Keisd] at biserici-fortificate.org</ref> and the main structure was completed in 1496.<ref>[[Vasile Drăguț]], ''Dicționar enciclopedic de artă medievală românească'', p.266. Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică, Bucharest, 1976</ref> The church was dedicated to [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen of Hungary]].<ref name="jn"/> A few payments from the authorities at [[Sibiu]] for building the church survive; these date from 1494 to 1525. From 1503 to 1507, the village received a Papal [[indulgence]] upon the request of a parishioner, and was no longer obliged to quarter troops or send provisions to the army of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].<ref name="com"/>

The large structure, built of quarried stone, is a [[hall church]] strengthened by 22 high [[buttress]]es. The [[nave]] is very wide and long, while the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is closed on three sides. A brick defensive level was built above the choir, while there are two such levels above the [[sacristy]]'s vaulted ceiling. These floors are accessed through two small brick towers on the western part of the church.<ref name="com"/> The defensive portion is slightly wider than the hall beneath. The nave ceiling, also vaulted, was rebuilt in 1878. The interior decor is mainly [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], with only the richly decorated choir [[pulpit]] being Gothic. Inscription fragments survive on the exterior walls.<ref name="org"/> Among the church's features are the two arched portals at the north and south sides, the upper windows with their delicate Gothic details, the Baroque altar and its floral decorations made of carved wood, and the 1786 organ.<ref name="jn"/>

===Fortifications and recognition===
The complex was surrounded by a powerful defensive wall, the perimeter of which is today marked by a fence.<ref name="com"/> The only surviving portion is the northern tower, which was fitted with a prominent [[spire]] in 1677,<ref name="org"/> and is located 10 m away from the church. Its multicolored slate roof can be seen from afar; it has twelve dormers (three to a side) and four little towers at the corners.<ref name="jn"/> A nearby hill was once the site of a 14th-century citadel for protecting the peasants, but only ruins survive.<ref name="com"/> It was located 2&nbsp;km away from the village center so that people from nearby places could also shelter there, and was reportedly a gift from a childless woman who willed it to the residents. Legend has it that the hill is haunted by a noose-wielding protective giant who emits ghostly sounds on one night a year.<ref name="org"/> This distance is one reason why the church was later fortified, so that the inhabitants would have readier access to a refuge.<ref name="jn">{{ro icon}} [http://jurnalul.ro/vechiul-site/old-site/arhiva-jurnalul/arhiva-jurnalul/atemporalul-satului-sasesc-la-saschiz-si-darjiu-284878.html "Atemporalul satului săsesc la Saschiz și Dârjiu"], ''Jurnalul Național'', January 18, 2007</ref>

Earthquakes in [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|1977]], [[1986 Vrancea earthquake|1986]] and [[1990 Vrancea earthquakes|1990]] damaged the church and tower, while the site's immediate proximity to [[European route E60]] leaves it vulnerable.<ref name="jn"/> In 1999, Saschiz, together with five other places, was added to the already-listed [[Biertan]] to form the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165 "World Heritage Committee Inscribes 48 New Sites on Heritage List"] at the UNESCO site</ref> Additionally, the church is listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by Romania's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], with the wall and tower being listed as a separate entry, as well as the citadel ruins.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_MS.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Mureş]</ref>
