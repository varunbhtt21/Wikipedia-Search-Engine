'''Esophageal cancer''' (or '''oesophageal cancer''') is [[cancer]] arising from the foodpipe known as the  [[esophagus]] that runs between the throat and the stomach.<ref name=WCR2014/> Symptoms often include [[dysphagia|difficulty in swallowing]] and weight loss.<!--<ref name=Ferri2012/>  --> Other symptoms may include [[odynophagia|pain when swallowing]], a [[hoarseness|hoarse voice]], [[Lymphadenopathy|enlarged lymph nodes]] (glands) around the [[clavicle|collarbone]], a dry cough, and possibly [[hemoptysis|coughing up]] or [[hematemesis|vomiting blood]].<ref name=Ferri2012/>

<!-- Types and causes -->
The two main [[Histopathology|sub-types]] of the disease are esophageal [[squamous-cell carcinoma]] (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the [[developing world]], and esophageal [[adenocarcinoma]] (EAC), which is more common in the [[developed world]].<ref name=WCR2014>{{cite book| author=Montgomery, EA| title=World Cancer Report 2014| date=2014|editor1=Stewart, BW |editor2=Wild, CP | publisher=World Health Organization| isbn=9283204298 | chapter=Oesophageal Cancer | pages=528–543|display-authors=etal}}</ref> A number of less common types also occur.<ref name=WCR2014/> Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the [[squamous epithelium|epithelial cells]] that line the esophagus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelsen|first=David|title=Gastrointestinal oncology: principles and practices|date=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9780781776172|page=4|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=5ULRpwtyxxMC&pg=PA4|edition=2nd}}</ref> Adenocarcinoma arises from [[glandular]] cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already [[Intestinal metaplasia|transformed to intestinal cell type]] (a condition known as [[Barrett's esophagus]]).<ref name=WCR2014/><ref>{{cite book|last=Whittemore|first=edited by David Schottenfeld, Joseph F.

<!-- Diagnosis and Treatment -->
The disease is diagnosed by [[biopsy]] done by an [[endoscope]] (a [[fiberoptic]] camera).<ref name=Sta2013>{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=M|author2=Mariette, C |author3=Haustermans, K |author4=Cervantes, A |author5=Arnold, D |author6= ESMO Guidelines Working, Group |title=Oesophageal cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.|journal=Annals of Oncology|date=Oct 2013|volume=24 Suppl 6|pages=vi51-6|url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/suppl_6/vi51.full|pmid=24078662 |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdt342}}</ref> Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a [[healthy diet]].<ref name=WCR2014/><ref name=Ferri2012/> Treatment is based on the [[cancer staging|cancer's stage]] and location, together with the person's general condition and individual preferences.<!--<ref name=Sta2013/>  --> Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with [[surgery]] alone with the hope of a [[curative care|cure]].<!--<ref name=Sta2013/>  --> In most other cases, [[chemotherapy]] with or without [[radiation therapy]] is used along with surgery.<ref name=Sta2013/> Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.<ref name=WCR2014/> In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, [[palliative care]] is often recommended.<ref name=Sta2013/> Outcomes are related to the extent of the disease and [[Comorbidity|other medical conditions]], but generally tend to be fairly poor, as diagnosis is often late.<ref name=WCR2014/><ref name=Enzinger>{{cite journal |vauthors=Enzinger PC, Mayer RJ |title=Esophageal cancer |journal=N.

<!-- Epidemiology -->
As of 2012, esophageal cancer is the eighth-most common cancer globally with 456,000 new cases during the year.<ref name=WCR2014/> It caused about 400,000 deaths that year, up from 345,000 in 1990.<ref name=WCR2014/><ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|last2=Naghavi|first2=M|last3=Foreman|first3=K|last4=Lim|first4=S|last5=Shibuya|first5=K|last6=Aboyans|first6=V|last7=Abraham|first7=J|last8=Adair|first8=T|last9=Aggarwal|first9=R | displayauthors=8 }}</ref> Rates vary widely between countries, with about half of all cases occurring in China.<!--<ref name=WCR2014/>  --> It is around three times more common in men than in women.<ref name=WCR2014/>
