The '''Hamburg Mountains''' are a [[Mountain range|range]] of the [[New York-New Jersey Highlands]] region of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  The [[Summit (topography)|summit]], reaching a height of {{convert|1473|ft|m|0}}, lies within [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], New Jersey.

==Geography==
The Hamburg Mountains and [[Wawayanda Mountain]] on the east, and [[Pochuck Mountain]] to the west, form the borders of the Vernon Valley, an important farming and mining area of New Jersey drained by Pochuck Creek.

==Geology==
The Hamburg Mountains are part of the [[Reading Prong]] of the [[New England Upland]] subprovince of the [[New England province]] of the [[Appalachian Highlands]].  The rocks that form the Hamburg Mountains are comprised from the same belt that make up other mountains nearby.  This belt, i.e. the Reading Prong, consists of ancient crystalline [[metamorphic rock]]s.  The New England province as a whole, along with the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge province]] further south, are often together referred to as the [[Crystalline Appalachians]].  The Crystalline Appalachians extend as far north as the [[Green Mountains]] of [[Vermont]] and as far south as the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], although a portion of the belt remains below the Earth's surface through part of [[Pennsylvania]].  The Crystalline Appalachians are distinct from the parallel Sedimentary Appalachians which run from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to New York.  The nearby [[Kittatinny Mountains]] are representative of these sedimentary formations.

==History==
An 1834 description read,
{{quote|text='''Hamburg, or Wallkill Mountains''', a local name given to the chain of hills on the [[South Mountain (eastern Pennsylvania)|South mountain]], extending N. E. across the t-ships of [[Byram Township, New Jersey|Byram]] and [[Hardyston Township, New Jersey|Hardiston]], and interlocking with Wawayanda and Pochuck mountain, in [[Vernon Township, New Jersey|Vernon t-ship]]; about 25 miles in length.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_gazetteer_of_the_state_of_New_Jersey.html?id=8VoVAAAAYAAJ |title=A Gazetteer of the State of New Jersey - Thomas F.
