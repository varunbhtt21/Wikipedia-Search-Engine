The '''Prizren Incident''' was a confrontation between German [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) troops advancing into Kosovo and stragglers from the withdrawing [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]]. The shootout took place in the city of [[Prizren]], on 13 June 1999. The German troops killed one armed Serb, and left another seriously wounded. A German soldier was injured, and there were reports of a woman wounded by Serb snipers.<ref name="snp" />

==Background==
On 12 June 1999, two days after the approval of [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) personnel began to arrive in Kosovo to stop further hostilities between ethnic [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]] and to coordinate efforts to secure the distribution of [[humanitarian aid]].<ref>Vaughan Lowe, Adam Roberts, Jennifer Welsh, Dominik Zaum (2008).

===Arrival of the German troops===
In the early hours of 13 June about 100 German soldiers arrived in [[Prizren]] from [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to secure the city for another 600 incoming troop that entered at afternoon from [[Albania]], {{convert|10|mi}} to the west. Earlier, a [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav Army]] outpost at Vrbnica border crossing, recently vacated by 60 soldiers, was looted and vandalized.<ref name="george">"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/prizren061499.htm Happy Throng Assails Lingering Serbs]" by John Ward Anderson and Peter Finn.

==Shooting incident==
As the German troops drove into downtown, along the [[Prizren Bistrica|Bistrica river]], they were met by sniper fire from one of the surrounding hills and some houses; they were also allegedly fired at from a [[Roman Catholic]] church. The soldiers took cover and returned fire. A civilian woman was reportedly wounded by the snipers, while the German troops moved to defensive positions below the hill.<ref name="snp">"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19990614&id=vHpaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1R4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6559,5865079 German troops met by snipers at Prizren]".

At dusk, a yellow [[Zastava Skala]] civilian-type vehicle was seen approaching a German armored carrier outside Hotel Theranda, in the center of the city. The passenger produced an AK-47 and opened fire at the carrier and at bystanders, who fled for safety. The German soldiers in the armored vehicle, supported by a [[Leopard 2 tank]], shot back.<ref name=":0" /> Three paratroopers fired at the car with their [[Heckler & Koch G36]] assault rifles, joined by a [[non-commissioned officer]] with his 9mm pistol and by turret-mounted 7.62mm machine guns.<ref>Russel, Richard Lawrence (2012).''

==Aftermath==
The commander of the KFOR brigade in Prizren, General Fritz von Korff said: "Although we may not have everything under control at present, we have enough presence in the town to believe there will be a safe (Yugoslav) withdrawal." He also warned that Prizren was still a "dangerous place".<ref name="snp" />

Armed Serb civilians set an improvised checkpoint outside the town, but it was largely ignored by the Germans, who passed through it several times. The retreating Yugoslav army personnel also manned a number of checkpoints, in violation of the agreement reached with [[NATO]].<ref name="george" /> More than ten days into the arrival of KFOR troops, turmoil and killings among the civilian population continued to spread, to the point that the German commander imposed a curfew from midnight until 5 a.m.<ref name="la" />
