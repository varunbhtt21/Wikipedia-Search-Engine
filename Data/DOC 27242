:({{Find sources|ChatApp}})
Subject fails [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:PRODUCT]]. Sources fail [[WP:RS]]. A Google failed to yield enough to ring the notability bell. Prod notice was removed without comment or improvement in the article. [[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 02:37, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I was unable to find significant coverage of this app in reliable, independent sources. Current references are not independent and therefore useless for establishing notability.

*'''Delete''': A [[:WP:SPA]] article on a new software product. No [[:WP:RS|evidence]] found to indicate that it meets the [[:WP:NSOFT|notability criteria]]. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 09:41, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Speedy delete''' per [[WP:CSD#G11]]: Unambiguous advertising or promotion. I second the lack of significant coverage in reliable sources independent of subject. [[WP:MILL]] rationale also applies. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D. Czarkoff]] ([[user talk:czarkoff|talk]]•[[Special:Contributions/czarkoff|track]]) 12:46, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
