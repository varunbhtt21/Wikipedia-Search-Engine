*'''Strong keep''' - per [[WP:NRVE]] and [[WP:GNG]]. Topic notability is based upon ''available'' sources, rather than the state of sourcing in articles. Evidence of [[WP:N|notability]] includes, but is not limited to:

*'''Keep''' - The article could stand to be beefed up, but there is significant coverage of the phenomenon. I'd say it meets notability requirements. [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 17:51, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Northamerica1000 who's found alot of sources, Also AFD isn't for clean up solutions.
