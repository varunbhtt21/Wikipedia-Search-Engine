:* Everything looks good. It's new enough. Long enough. Elaborately sourced. However, I'm not too fond of the hook. I think many readers don't know what the Julliard School is or what its significance is. Consequently, it might not be interesting or create the impact this article deserves. So I propose an alt hook:
::'''ALT1''' ... that '''[[Tharanga Goonetilleke]]''' is the first [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] woman to attend the [[Julliard School]], one of the world's leading music schools?

I think this alternative hook will attract more attention. Let me know what you think. Please ping me on my TP when ready. [[User:EtienneDolet|Étienne Dolet]] ([[User talk:EtienneDolet|talk]]) 03:37, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Your proposed alt works for me and I think you are correct about the need for clarification. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 04:01, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] This article needed to be copyedited urgently. In the future, I suggest having another editor provide a peer-review for you before nominating articles to DYK or GA and FA for that matter. At any rate, I did the best I could. As for everything else, it is good to go. '''I support ALT1.''' Nice article.
