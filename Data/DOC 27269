When Lucky Pulpit was a [[weanling]], he was sent to the Tree Top Ranches in [[Parma, Idaho]].

==Racing career==
Lucky Pulpit earned $209,928 in 22 starts.  He began his career by running six races as a two-year-old in 2003, winning two and finishing in the top three in all but one race.<ref name="equibase"/>  He contracted a viral infection at the beginning of his three-year-old season in 2004 which led to permanent respiratory problems. His difficulty breathing affected his ability to train before races, which often meant that his only time on the track was during races.<ref name=Rees8May>{{cite news|last=Rees|first=Jennie|title=California Chrome sire Lucky Pulpit unlucky on track|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/horses/triple/derby/2014/05/02/california-chrome-sire-lucky-pulpit-unlucky-track/8624859/|accessdate=May 8, 2014|newspaper=The Courier-Journal|date=May 2, 2014}}</ref> Nonetheless, he ran seven times as a three-year-old, with his best finish a second place in the grade II [[Santa Catalina Stakes]]. Having run only in California up to that point, he was shipped east in 2005 and ran on midwestern and eastern tracks for the remainder of his career.  He ran eight times in 2005, winning the non-graded Smile Stakes at [[Arlington Park]].  After a second-place finish in an [[allowance race]] at [[Churchill Downs]] in November 2005, he only ran once in August 2006 before retiring, finishing second in the non-graded Sneakbox Stakes at [[Monmouth Park]].<ref name="equibase"/>

==Stud career==
Lucky Pulpit sired seven foal crops. At the time of his death in 2017, he had sired 148 winners from 229 starters and was credited with progeny earnings of $24 million.<ref name="bloodhorse13Feb2017"/> In addition to California Chrome, Lucky Pulpit sired several other stakes winners: Rousing Sermon, who was a California Champion Two-Year-Old Colt; as well as Luckarack, a multiple stakes winner; Gatheratthealter.<ref name=CTBA>{{cite web|title=Lucky Pulpit|url=http://www.ctba.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/stallion-directory/LUCKYPULPIT.pdf |publisher=CTBA|work=California Thoroughbred 2014 Stallion Directory|accessdate=June 4, 2014|format=PDF}}</ref> and You're Late.<ref name="bloodhorse13Feb2017"/>
After California Chrome won the 2014 [[San Felipe Stakes]], Lucky Pulpit's stud fee increased from the 2013 fee of $2,500 to $10,000.<ref name=lintner>{{cite news|last=Lintner|first=Jonathan|title=Report: California Chrome sire’s stud fee quadruples|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/horses/triple/derby/2014/05/05/report-california-chrome-sires-stud-fee-quadruples/8721201/|accessdate=May 8, 2014|newspaper=The Courier-Journal|date=May 5, 2014}}</ref>
