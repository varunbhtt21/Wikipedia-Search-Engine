I'm starting to get leery of including so many Sonics in [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)]]. The fair use rationale for the image is fairly brief, and states that the purpose of this image is "to add a visual description to the Sonic the Hedgehog (character) article." This image adds nothing to the article except another version of the same Sonic in the infobox. This form of Sonic can be adequately conveyed using words alone and with the presence of the other non-free images in the article (i.e. he turns yellow and his eyes turn red). Thus, the image fails [[WP:NFCC#3]]. [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 03:04, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

:::My thinking about the article and magazine covers is that he is not notable as a photographer per se.  We are not going to see his photographs in museum exhibitions.  He is notable because he is very good at taking photos that appear well on magazine covers.  That is why I interpret their use as satisfying [[WP:NFCC#8]].  If his notability was not so dependent on his taking photos for magazine covers (and I think we see why he is when we look at the covers), I would certainly have come down on the side of failing NFCC#8. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 22:15, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
::::His notability doesn't matter when it comes to these photos and our non-free policies.  What matters is there is no sourced critical commentary about the photos.  They are being used purely for identification and eye candy.  Neither image is required for any average reader to understand that he was, in fact, a photographer known for photographing models that end up on covers. The article says that directly. Therefore the files both fail [[WP:NFCC#8]] as they do not have to be seen to be understood. This is the same reason we don't show movie covers on directors or actors articles, cd covers for musicians, etc. '''''[[User:TLSuda|<span style="color:#886699">TLSuda]]'''''</span> ([[User talk:TLSuda|talk]]) 00:44, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::I understand where you are coming from, but when you look at how he poses models (google image using his name), there is a very distinctive style that is captured in the magazine covers. I do a agree that neither image is required, but NFCC#8 uses the term "detrimental," which is less stringent than "required."  When I first saw the images in the article, read the article, then thought about removing them, I thought "That would be a shame."  That's how I came to the opinion that it would be detrimental to delete them. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 07:01, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::You could make the argument that removing any image would be the same. It may be distinctive of his style to take photos like this, once again, that information is not sourced in the article. You keep giving extremely specific reasons as to why you believe it should be kept, but nothing is covered in the article. There has to be critical contextual significance that is sourced that describes this style, and there frankly isn't. Also, the word detrimental, used in this context, means the average reader would not be able to understand the article (or section) and in this case that simply isn't true. You also forgot the first part of WP:NFCC#8 (both parts have to be equally met) "Non-free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers' understanding" since the article only says he took the photos, we don't need to see the images to know he took the photos.  If his style was specifically discussed with sourced commentary, one image might be acceptable. As of right now, the images are just used as identification/eye candy and are not supported by the article.  With respect to WP:NFCC, the article content has to be there first, before it can support a non-free image.

:::::::I could see deleting one of the two images.  The image listed above this one is more representative of his style than this one I would agree. I don't know what the editor intended, but I didn't see the images as just eye candy (though I can see how people could do so).  Both images are not required, but I still do think one (the one listed above this one is preferable) does significantly contribute to understanding. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 17:29, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::Regardless of why you want to keep the image(s), there is still no sourced content in the article that lines with your reasoning for keeping the image.  The photographs/covers are only mentioned in passing. Until the time when the content is added, the images do and will fail [[WP:NFCC]].

Image fails [[WP:NFCC#8]] and [[WP:NFLISTS]] in the article that it is used on. Being that Dungeons and Dragons is a fantasy game where the monsters have seen various reincarnations, I don't believe that this specific drawing is necessary.  I personally think the image could be replaced by any artist's rendition of the monster (as that is all the original image was intended to be) therefore failing WP:NFCC#1 as well.
