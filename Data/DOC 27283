:({{Find sources|The Absolution of ZERO}})
This is a non-notable book that fails [[WP:BKCRIT]].  Google results show no reviews in reliable sources, and there are no citations in the article. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 03:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' An unreferenced article about a non-notable book. I was unable to find any reviews in reliable, independent sources. The creator of the article also wrote an unreferenced biography of the author, and added the author to a list of notable people residing in her home town. That's it. This editor seem to be here for promotional reasons only.

*'''Delete''' per above. I also wasn't able to find anything either. [[User:Tokyogirl79|Tokyogirl79]][[user talk:Tokyogirl79|'''<span style='color: #19197;background-color: #FFFFFF;'>  (｡◕‿◕｡)</span>''']]  04:10, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
