He engaged in postgraduate work at [[New York University]] and attended the six-week Advanced Management Program at [[Harvard Business School]].

While he was a student at the University of Denver, Henderson meet his wife, Donna Baade (1921-2012), 
daughter of the late Alfred and Fern Baade.

Donna Baade Henderson|publisher=''[[The Greenville News]]'', October 29, 2012|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref> The Hendersons had a son, James M. Henderson, Jr., of Greenville and two daughters, Linda H. Lucas and husband Arthur M. Lucas of Atlanta, Georgia, and Debbie H. DeMint and husband [[Jim DeMint]], whom Henderson did not live to see become a Republican U.S. Representative from [[South Carolina's 4th congressional district]] and then [[U.S. Senator]] in 1999 and 2005, respectively.<ref name=bio/><ref name=dbhobit/>

Henderson was a member of Buncombe Street [[United Methodist Church]] in Greenville.<ref name=bio/>

==Advertising career==

His first job in advertising was with [[General Foods]] in [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]] and [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. He was then associated for two years with an advertising agency in Denver. With a $500 loan from his wife, he opened his one-man Henderson Advertising, Inc., in his adopted city of [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]] in northwestern South Carolina. One of Henderson's first major accounts was [[Dow Chemical Company]], formerly [[Texize]], a firm that primarily produced industrial cleaner to [[Textile manufacturing|textile mills]], which were at that time abundant in the Greenville region. Henderson persuaded Greenville businessman Jack Greer, the founder of Texize, to package his cleaner for household use too.<ref name=bio/>  
 
1980, Henderson Advertising became the first agency outside of [[New York City]] or [[Chicago]] to be named "Advertising Agency of the Year" by ''[[Advertising Age]]'' magazine. Jack Callahan, who succeeded Henderson as president and board chairman of Henderson Advertising, recalled: "That's as good as it gets. The man was truly a legend. He is responsible for putting South Carolina and the Southeast on the national agency roster. He established the competitiveness of the advertising business in the Southeast. He was a great leader, a great motivator, a man who stuck to his principles, no matter what. He built a great legacy for us." As the company founder, Henderson had taken the lead in banning [[cigarette]] advertising by the firm.<ref name=bio/>
 
Henderson received many honors in advertising. In 1954, he was named "Young Man of the Year" in Greenville. In 1961, he won the "Silver Medal Award" from the Advertising Federation of America. The Sales and Marketing Club named him "Salesman of the Year". He was a treasurer and regional chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. Henderson was involved in [[Kiwanis International]] and the Greater Greenville [[Chamber of Commerce]]. He promoted the performing arts in Greenville through his work as a board member of [[Spoleto Festival USA]], based in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].<ref name=bio/>
 
Henderson was a board member of the Citizens and Southern National Bank and First Federal Savings and Loan in Greenville. He was a trustee of [[Converse College]] in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], South Carolina, and he served on the advisory board of the College of Commerce and Industry at his alma mater, Clemson University.<ref name=bio/>

==Political activities==

Henderson was assistant [[United States Postmaster General]] under [[Winton M. Blount]] of [[Alabama]] during the administration of [[U.S. President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]]. In that capacity he persuaded the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] and the [[Apollo 11]] [[astronaut]]s to photograph [[Moon|the Moon]] for an image on a postage stamp. More than 140 million moon stamps were sold.<ref name=bio/>

In 1970, Henderson was the unsuccessful Republican [[Candidate|nominee]] for [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]] of South Carolina. He lost to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Earle Morris, Jr.]], of [[Pickens, South Carolina|Pickens]]. Henderson ran on the ticket headed by [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[U.S. Representative]] [[Albert Watson (South Carolina)|Albert Watson]] of [[South Carolina's 2nd congressional district]], who lost the [[general election]] to the Democrat [[John C. West]], the outgoing lieutenant governor, as the state swung to the left in the 1970 elections. Henderson questioned West's rhetoric: Why, he asked, had family income in South Carolina under Democratic state government declined over the previous two decades from 45th to 47th position nationally? Henderson also noted that average wages were higher in [[North Carolina]] or Georgia than in South Carolina.<ref>''The Greenville News'', September 15, 1970</ref> Henderson trailed Watson's total vote by 4,491 (.7 of 1 percent); hence virtually all Republican voters backed their party candidates for governor and lieutenant governor. Henderson received 216,745 votes (45.2 percent); Morris, 254,745 (53.3 percent). An [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] held the remaining 7,320 votes (1.5 percent).<ref>Billy Hathorn, "The Changing Politics of Race: Congressman Albert William Watson and the South Carolina Republican Party, 1965-1970", ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'' Vol. 89 (October 1988), p. 237-238</ref>

Highly critical of Watson's campaign, the ''[[Greenville News]]'' noted that West won support from "every social, racial, and economic sector." It further urged the Republicans to field future candidates in the image of Henderson, rather than Watson.<ref>"Changing Politics of Race", p. 239</ref>

In 1972, with [[Strom Thurmond]] seeking his second full term as a Republican U.S. Senator, Henderson managed the Nixon-[[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] reelection campaign in South Carolina. In that 1972 election, South Carolina led the nation in the percent of registered voters who cast ballots.<ref name=bio/> In the previous 1968 election, Nixon and Agnew had also won the [[electoral vote]]s of South Carolina, when the statewide campaign that year was managed by [[Joseph O. Rogers, Jr.]], of [[Manning, South Carolina|Manning]], a former state representative who had been the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] gubernatorial standard-bearer in 1966, the first serious Republican candidate to seek the governorship in ninety years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.sc.edu/scpc/Rogers.pdf|title=Joseph O. Rogers, Jr., Papers|publisher=library.sc.edu|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

==Later years==

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], Henderson was an early donor to former [[governor of Texas|Governor]] [[John B. Connally, Jr.]], of [[Texas]], who withdrew from consideration after amassing only one delegate in the early portion of the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/elec2/80/elec-GREENVILLE-SC-80.html|title=GREENVILLE, South Carolina (SC) Political Contributions by Individuals|publisher=city-data.com|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

When Henderson retired in 1986 at the age of sixty-five under the compulsory company retirement policy that he had established, the agency had 120 employees and $100 million in advertising billings. It ranked in the top 1 percent of advertising agencies in the Southeast. Though he left the advertising end of the company, he maintained an office in one of the Henderson buildings, from which he engaged thereafter in [[real estate]].<ref name=bio/>
     
Henderson was inducted in 1989 into the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame. In a 1993 interview with  ''[[The Greenville News]]'', Henderson said that as a young man he never doubted he would succeed but that doing so took longer than he had expected.<ref name=bio/>

Henderson died at the age of seventy-four and is interred beside his wife at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Greenville, South Carolina.<ref name=findagrave/>
