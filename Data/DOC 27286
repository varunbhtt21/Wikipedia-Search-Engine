'''Anton Kwiatkowski''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[recording engineer]] and [[record producer]] who began his career in [[England]]. Hundreds of industry-standard-setting productions of mostly classical music and multiple prestigious awards document his considerable contribution to Canadian music and beyond. [[John Arpin]] biographer Robert Popple asserts: "''The Canadian recording industry reaped a windfall with Kwiatkowski's presence.''"<ref name= "Popple">"[[John Arpin]]: Keyboard Virtuoso" by Robert Popple, Toronto: [[Dundurn Press]], 2009, pp. 228-229,<br />
{{ISBN|978-1-55002-866-9}}.</ref><br />

== Beginnings in England: 1969 - 1977 ==
From 1969 to 1977, Kwiatkowski worked as producer/engineer for [[EMI]] in [[London]], England, recording with the [[London Philharmonic]], [[London Symphony Orchestra|London Symphony]], [[Royal Philharmonic]], [[Philharmonia Orchestra|New Philharmonia]], [[English Chamber Orchestra|English Chamber]], [[Hallé Orchestra|Hallé]] and [[Scottish National Orchestra|Scottish National]] Orchestras. Many of the productions during this time, including several [[popular music]] productions, were recorded at EMI's [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref>Evidenced through comprehensive discographies published on various sites such as [[Discogs]] and [[Allmusic]]. Furthermore, [http://www.galarecords.ca Gala Records] refers to Kwiatkowski as "EMI alumnus" in the description of [[:de:Elaine Keillor|Elaine Keillor's]] work [http://www.galarecords.ca/english/descript/s_north.htm "Sounds Of North"].</ref> The 1970s also saw regular collaborations with [[Jazz guitarist]] [[Denny Wright]] for EMI's [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]] record label.<br />

== Work in Canada: CBC 1977 - 1999 ==
In 1977, Kwiatkowski was invited to come to Canada to upgrade the recording quality of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s in-house [[record label]],<ref>[[High Fidelity (magazine)|''High Fidelity'']], 1986, Volume 36, Issues 1-6, p. 140.</ref> where he eventually spent over two decades as a Senior Recording Producer. The CBC's '''SM5000''' label, featuring artists from across Canada, was launched in 1981 to showcase his new recordings, which met with immediate critical success.<ref name= "Popple" /><ref>Joel Flegler, in [[Fanfare (magazine)|''Fanfare'']], 1994, Vol. 17, Issue 6, p. 332.</ref> Since arriving in Canada, Kwiatkowski has worked with the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], and the [[Edmonton Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>"Keeping Score" by Is Horowitz, in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], Feb. 8, 1986, p. 67.</ref><ref>''BLCA Reporter'', published by [http://www.bcla.bc.ca British Columbia Library Association], 1985, Volume 29, p. 54.</ref><ref>''Digital Audio and Compact Disc Review'', 1988, Volume 5, Issues 1-6, p. xvi.</ref> Among [[music industry]] experts and critics, he is widely considered to be one of Canada's leading recording engineers and producers,<ref>"[[Gershwin]]: With A Critical Discography" by [[Edward Jablonski]], New York: [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1988, p.415, {{ISBN|0-306-80847-1}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/opus-emc/ ''Music Magazine''], published by Barrett & Colgrass, 1987, Volumes 10-11, p. 39.</ref><ref Name= "Gramo">"Holst In Toronto" by [[Edward Greenfield]], in [[Gramophone (magazine)|''Gramophone'']], 1986, Volume 64, p. 248.</ref> with [http://www.thewholenote.com Wholenote Magazine] calling him "a celebrity [[tonmeister]]".<ref>Review of [[Caroline Leonardelli]]'s "El Dorado" by Daniel Foley in [http://www.thewholenote.com ''Wholenote Magazine''], January 29, 2009.</ref> In particular, Kwiatkowski receives praise for his sophisticated [[microphone techniques]],<ref name= "Flegler">Joel Flegler in [[Fanfare (magazine)|''Fanfare'']], 1984, Vol. 7, Issues 3-4, p. 255.</ref> his attention to details of [[sound]],<ref>[http://www.harpmusicottawa.com/reviews.html Review of Caroline Léonardelli and Mathew Larkin's "Légendes"] by Frederic Cardin in [[The Music Scene (magazine)|''La Scena Musicale'']], May 2012.</ref> his ability to capture the intricacies of individual instruments,<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/opus-emc/ ''Music Magazine''], published by Barrett & Colgrass, 1985, Volumes 8-9, p. 36.</ref> and his intuition in identifying superior sounding [[acoustic space]]s.<ref name= "Gramo" /> His role in the final quality of productions is acknowledged regularly in ways similar to Flegler:

<blockquote>For quality of sound and soundness of quality-control this ... is in a class with ... industry-standard-setting productions.  I usually don't pay much attention to producers of records in my reviews but since the liner notes of this ... (and others in this "SM5000 Series") credit producer Anton Kwiatkowski's "award-winning" microphone techniques, and the results are so unfailingly excellent as to be thoroughly identifiable with his work, his name deserves mention.<ref name= Flegler /></blockquote>

== Freelance Work: 1981 - Present ==
Kwiatkowski currently works as a [[freelance]] producer/engineer and as such has recorded for [http://www.analekta.com/en/ Analekta], [[Angel Records]] (EMI), [[ASV Records|ASV]], [[BIS Records|BIS]], [[Chandos Records|Chandos]], EBS, [[Fanfare Records|Fanfare]], [[Hungaroton]], [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]], [http://www.ibs.it/cd/reparto/msin/musica-sinfonica.html IBS], [[Imp Records|IMP]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20140504062320/http://www.marquisclassics.com/index.html Marquis], [http://www.openingday.com Opening Day Entertainment], [[Pro Arte Orchestra|Pro Arte]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], Sefel Records, [[Sony Classical]], [[Summit Records|Summit]] and [[Unicorn-Kanchana]]. Popple again:

<blockquote>Kwiatkowski is unquestionably a Canadian recording-engineer star. Kwiatkowski's recordings of John Arpin were released on four labels: Fanfare, Intersound, Sony and Marquis. A later partnership between John and Anton, called Johnathon Productions (their names combined, an Arpin idea), was formed to license material to record labels.<ref name= "Popple" /></blockquote>

Based in [[Toronto]], Kwiatkowski provides remote and in-house studio recording as well as [[digital editing]] and [[music mastering|mastering]] services. He also accommodates audition sessions and re-mastering of older material. Kwiatkowski has received two [[Juno Award]] nominations for '''"Recording Engineer of the Year"''' in [[Juno Awards of 1985|1985]] and [[Juno Awards of 1986|1986]].<br />
