'''Ortwin Hess''' (born 1966) is a German-born theoretical [[physicist]] at Imperial College London (UK), working in condensed matter optics. Bridging condensed matter theory and quantum optics he specialises in [[nanophotonics]], [[plasmon]]ics, metamaterials and semiconductor laser dynamics. Since the late 1980s he has been an author and coauthor of over 300 [[peer-review]]ed articles, the most popular of which, called {{"'}}Trapped rainbow' storage of light in metamaterials", was cited more than 400 times. He pioneered active (gain enhanced) nanoplasmonics and metamaterials with quantum gain and in 2014 he introduced the "stopped-light lasing" principle as a novel route to cavity-free (nano-) lasing and localisation of amplified surface plasmon polaritons,  giving him an [[h-index]] of 33.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0kpZGM8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&pagesize=100|title=Ortwin Hess|publisher=[[Google Scholar]]|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>

Interest in the field of ‘slow’ and ‘stopped’ light arises from the prospect of obtaining much better control over light signals, with extremely nonlinear effects in interactions between light and matter, and optical quantum memories facilitating new architectures to process quantum information.<ref name=journals>{{cite journal|title=Completely Stopped and Dispersionless Light in Plasmonic Waveguides|author1=Tsakmakidis, K.

Recently Hess has started to develop "meta-lasers" and proposed "stopped-light nanolasing". This exploits and unites his competence in nanoplasmonic metamaterials, quantum photonics and semiconductor lasers. Initially the motivation for the work was to compensate dissipative losses in metamaterials by introducing gain.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wuestner, S.|display-authors=4|author2=Pusch, A.|author3=Tsakmakidis, K.
