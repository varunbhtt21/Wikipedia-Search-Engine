''The Pirate Publisher—An International Burlesque that has the Longest Run on Record'', an illustration by '''[[Joseph Ferdinand Keppler]]''' run in ''Puck'' in 1886. It satirizes the then-existing [[copyright]] situation where a publisher could profit by simply taking newly-published works from one country and publishing them in another, without needing to pay the authors.  Amongst the authors depicted are [[Mark Twain]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], [[Émile Zola]], and [[W. S. Gilbert]], who famously premiered ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' in New York in an attempt to gain American copyright, as his previous work ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' had proved so immensely popular that 150 U.S. productions had already appeared.
