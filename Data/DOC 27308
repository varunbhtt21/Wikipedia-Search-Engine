== Career ==

=== Research ===
Molina's interests cut across disciplines and examines the [[Intersectionality|intersections]] of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[culture]], and [[citizenship]]. Molina's interdisciplinary work on [[race and medicine]] has been reviewed positively by scholars in many fields, including history of science, American history, ethnic studies, and sociology. Her scholarship has been described as "an exciting contribution to the growing body of scholarship that knits the history of medicine and public health more tightly into the fabric of the American past..."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=Alan M|author2=Review by|title=Fit to Be Citizens?

=== ''How Race Is Made in America'' ===
In her book ''How Race Is Made in America: Immigration, Citizenship, and the Historical Power of Racial Scripts,'' published by University of California Press in 2013, Molina examines Mexican immigration to the U.S. Focusing on the years between 1924-1965, Molina argues that during this time period an immigration regime emerged that would define racial categories in the U.S., such as [[Mexican Americans|Mexican American]], that are still present and largely influential on the perception of race and ethnicity in society today. ''How Race Is Made in America'' relies on the use of what Molina terms a relational lens and also aims to show that [[Racial scripting|racial scripts]] are easily adopted and adapted to apply to different racial groups. By the term relational lens Molina suggests that “a relational treatment recognizes that race is a mutually constitutive process and thus attends to how, when, where, and to what extent groups intersect. It recognizes that there are limits to examining racialized groups in isolation.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Molina|first=Natalia|title=How Race Is Made in America|date=2013|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0520280083|pages=3}}</ref> Molina's central theory throughout the book, ''racial scripts'', is used “to highlight the way in which the lives of racialized groups are linked across time and space and thereby affect one another, even when they do not directly cross paths,” meaning that "once practices, customs, policies, and laws are directed at one group, they are more readily available and hence easily applied to other groups."<ref>{{cite book|last=Molina|first=Natalia|title=How Race Is Made in America|date=2013|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0520280083|pages=6–7}}</ref>
