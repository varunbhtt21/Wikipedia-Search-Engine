<small>Created by [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]). Self nominated at 03:59, 4 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] The article is well written, created within 5 days of its nomination, inline sourced throughout, with no indication of copyright violations.  The hook is short enough, sourced, and interesting.  It is good to go. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 19:03, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Nomination should not have been given final approval while QPQ review is still outstanding: by definition, it can't be "good to go" until the QPQ is done. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 02:00, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*[[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]], review is done. Thanks. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 17:27, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
