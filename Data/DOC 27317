The '''Southern Arkansas Muleriders softball''' team represents [[Southern Arkansas University]] in [[NCAA Division II]] college softball. SAU has competed in the [[Great American Conference]] (GAC) since 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Great American Conference|url=http://www.greatamericanconference.com/sports/2011/6/21/GAC.aspx|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Upon reorganizing the team in 1999, SAU was a member of the Western Division of the Gulf South Conference until joining the GAC in 2011. The Muleriders play their home games on campus at Lady Mulerider Field.  Jason Anderson is the current head coach.

==History==
Southern Arkansas fielded a softball team as far back as 1930; however, college opponents were difficult to find. Softball has seen some success over the years. Kathryn Smith Brown coached a team to the finals of the AAU Southwest Regional Tournament in 1949.<ref>{{cite book|last=Willis|first=James|title=Southern Arkansas University|year=2009|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|pages=181}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}</ref> In 1980, Margaret Browning lead the Lady Muleriders to their first full conference championship in school history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Downing Inducted to Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame |url=http://muleriderathletics.com/news/2012/8/6/WBB_0806120101.aspx?path=wbball|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref>

In 1999, SAU hired Kevin Blaskowski to restart the SAU softball program after several years of not sponsoring the sport. The program has seen off and on periods of success since reorganizing. Blaskowski's 2003 Lady Muleriders shared the Gulf South Conference Western Division crown. Since reorganizing the team in 1999, the Lady Muleriders have compiled a 378–455 (.454) record.

On May 3, 2014, the Lady Muleriders won the GAC Softball Tournament Championship with 4–0 and 8–0 wins over Southeastern Oklahoma State University.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gallegos |first=Daniel |title=Lady Muleriders offense explodes as they capture the 2014 GAC Softball Championship|url=http://muleriderathletics.com/news/2014/5/3/SB_0503145402.aspx?path=softball|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>  In his three seasons at SAU, Coach Lyon finished with a  90–89 record. On June 27, 2014, Coach Lyon was named the head coach of the [[Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks softball]] team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Corey Lyon Named Head Softball Coach at ULM|url=http://www.ulmwarhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=19000&ATCLID=209530728 |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> On July 2, 2014 Jason Anderson was named the head coach of the Lady Muleriders.

==Dawson Field==
After several years of playing their home games at a city owned park, the Lady Muleriders opened Dawson Field at the Mulerider Softball Complex during the 2014 season. The 2014 season was a special season for the Lady Muleriders. In their first season in the new park, the Lady Muleriders won their first Great American Conference championship. Lady Mulerider Field is a state of the art facility featuring seating for approximately 400 fans and includes covered batting cages for the Lady Muleriders.<ref>http://muleriderathletics.com/sports/2014/4/11/SB_0411145411.aspx?path=softball</ref>
