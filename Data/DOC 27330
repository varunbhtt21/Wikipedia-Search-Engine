I came across this via an [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Absolution of ZERO|AfD]] for her book. The problem here is that I can't really see where she's all that notable. The award sounds good at first, until I found [https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=330190450423365&story_fbid=332042750238135 this], which mentions that Princeton Literary Review reviews books for a fee. That makes me more than a little leery about any awards given out by this group, as it kind of makes me wonder if it's just a money sink type of award where they hand it out to anyone willing to pay for it. There's not really that much out there about the award, which makes it of dubious distinction. From what I can see, the publication has no association with the college by the same name, which doesn't help ease any concerns. I figured that I'd run it through AfD just in case.

*'''Delete'''.  The article is currently laboring under a BLPPROD, but if this gets it deleted faster, I'm all for it.  Note that the article creator has repeatedly removed the BLPPROD without adding any sources, so this AfD template might not stick, either.

:*I have to admit that I am hoping for a snow close a little bit earlier. I'd have speedied it, except that the award would probably give that small assertion of notability that would make it ineligible simply because of the word "Princeton" tacked on to it- which is probably why the magazine chose that name.

*'''Delete''' as non notable person. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 01:39, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': Multiple searches (Google, Highbeam, Questia) are turning up [[:WP:RS|nothing]] to indicate [[:WP:CREATIVE|notability]], nor does the award noted in the article appear to be notable, as highlighted by [[User:Tokyogirl79]].
