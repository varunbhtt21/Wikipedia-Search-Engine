Non-notable corporation that gets almost no Google hits at all.  Note that I have also nominated [[Isaiah M. Williams]], the founder, and [[The Williams Tie Company]], his other company, in separate nominations.  It shouldn't be difficult to find them, as it's a three-for-one combo deal today on non-notable articles.

*'''Delete''' This is a promotional article full of unverifiable claims about a company without a website headed by a 17 year old.

*<s>Probably Delete - appears to not meet [[WP:CORP]] per source searches. The book sources in the article for ''The Keys to Youth Entrepreneurship'' are not accessible, hence the "probably" within my !vote. Who knows, perhaps there's significant coverage in the book, or only passing mentions?</s>[[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 05:31, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
** {{reply to|Northamerica1000}} Well, they were written by the founder, and, as far as I can tell, they are self-published.  At that point, I don't think it really matters how significant the coverage is. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 05:39, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
***Thanks for pointing that out. As the book source is a primary one that doesn't serve to establish notability, I have modified my !vote (below). [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 05:41, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - Per source searches, does not meet [[WP:CORP]] for an article on Wikipedia. Per the above, the book source in the article does not qualify to establish topic notability. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 05:46, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
