'''Art Sherman''' (born February 17, 1937<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.santaanita.com/stable-notes/stable-notes-by-ed-golden-saturday-feb-18-2017/#.WTLNmNwVjIU}}</ref>) is an American [[horse trainer]] and former [[jockey]]. At the age of 77 he became the oldest trainer to win the [[Kentucky Derby]]. He began his career as a stable hand for [[Rex Ellsworth]] and [[Mesh Tenney]].  While working in Ellsworth's barn, he was the exercise rider for the 1955 Kentucky Derby winner [[Swaps (horse)|Swaps]] and 1956 Kentucky Derby entrant [[Terrang]].  In 1957, Sherman became a licensed jockey, enjoying modest success, and began training horses in 1979.  Sherman had trained ten [[Graded stakes race|Graded stakes]] winners and is credited with over 2,100 wins prior to becoming the trainer of [[California Chrome]].  He was hired to train California Chrome in 2013, due to his "old school" training techniques.  Prior to the [[2014 Kentucky Derby]], he had conditioned the horse through four consecutive wins, and California Chrome entered the Derby as the favorite and won.  Two weeks later, California Chrome also won the [[2014 Preakness Stakes]]. Sherman is married and has two sons, Alan and Steve, both in the horse training business.

==Early life==
Art Sherman was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1937.  At the age of seven, his family moved to California.<ref name=NYDaily>{{cite news|title=Art Sherman hopes to win Kentucky Derby with California Chrome|author=Jerry Bossert|date=May 1, 2014|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/sherman-california-dreamin-churchill-downs-article-1.1776323|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>  Sherman became interested in horse racing while working at his father's barber shop when a customer, noticing Sherman was only {{convert|5|ft|2|in|cm|adj=off}}, suggested Sherman become a jockey.<ref name=SacBee />

At age 17, Sherman got a job as stablehand on Rex Ellsworth's ranch.  From Ellsworth and trainer Mesh Tenney, he learned to [[horse management|care for]], [[equestrianism|ride]], and [[horse breeding|breed horses]].<ref name=Hoppert27Apr />  In 1955, he was the exercise rider for Kentucky Derby winner Swaps, who was owned by Ellsworth.<ref name=Hoppert27Apr /><ref name=USAToday />  He rode in the [[Stock car (rail)|train boxcar]] with the horse while traveling from California to Kentucky, sleeping on a bed of straw next to the horse during the four night trip.<ref name=SacBee />  Sherman was also at the 1956 Derby as a stable hand for Ellsworth's horse [[Terrang]], who finished 12th.<ref name=Hoppert27Apr />

Sherman became a licensed jockey in 1957.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kentucky Derby: California Chrome's bid takes trainer back in time|date=May 2, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-05-02/news/chi-kentucky-derby-chrome-20140502_1_santa-anita-derby-kentucky-derby-churchill-downs|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>  His first win was at [[Hollywood Park Racetrack|Hollywood Park]].<ref name=Hoppert27Apr />  In 1959, he won a race in Maryland where then Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] awarded the trophy, attracting national attention.<ref name=SacBee />  The highlight of Sherman's career came when he beat his idol and future Hall of Fame jockey [[Eddie Arcaro]] in a race.  "I'll never forget that because after the race he came by and put his arm around me and said, 'You run a good race, son,'" Sherman recalled.<ref name=Hoppert27Apr />  He won over 2,000 races during his riding career.<ref name=BH3June>{{cite web|author1=Staff|title=Sherman Watches Hero 'Chrome' in Easy Gallop|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/85467/sherman-watches-hero-chrome-in-easy-gallop|publisher=Blood-Horse|accessdate=2014-06-03|date=2014-06-03}}</ref>  After riding for over 21 years, he retired from riding as a jockey and began training horses.<ref name=USAToday>{{cite news|title=Trainer Art Sherman becomes oldest Derby winner|agency=AP|work=USA Today|date=May 3, 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/horseracing/2014/05/03/trainer-art-sherman-becomes-oldest-derby-winner/8676797/|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Sherman met his wife, Faye, on a blind date while riding in Chicago.  Faye was working for the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] at the time, and at first found Sherman's work to be "the most boring thing that's ever been done".<ref name=Hoppert27Apr />  After they were married, she worked in the gift shop at [[Bay Meadows Racetrack]] for 30 years before retiring.  One of Sherman's sons, Alan, works together with his father to train their horses.<ref name=SacBee />  Earlier, Alan worked as a jockey.<ref name=Hoppert27Apr /> Sherman's other son, Steve, is also a trainer, working out of [[Golden Gate Fields]].<ref name=SacBee />  Sherman's first great-grandchild was born in June 2014.<ref name=SacBee /><ref name=Hoppert27Apr />

Sherman owns a home in a north [[San Diego]] retirement community, but says he has no plans to retire. "I wouldn't know what to do with myself," he said. "[Racing] is the only thing I know. It's a great life. I can't wait to get up in the morning".<ref name=SacBee />

==Training career==
Sherman started training race horses in 1979.<ref name=equibase>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=People&searchType=T&eID=1710|title=Art Sherman|accessdate=May 4, 2014|publisher=Equibase}}</ref> Prior to 2014, Sherman had 10 [[Graded stakes race|graded stakes]] winners,<ref name=Equibase2>{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Art Sherman - Graded Stakes Wins|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=StakesListing&searchType=T&eID=1710 |publisher=Equibase |accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref> some of whom, trained in conjunction with his son Alan, were [[Graded stakes race|Grade 1 stakes]] winners.<ref name=USAToday />  These included Lykatill Hill, who won back-to-back Governor's Handicaps at the [[California State Fair]] in 1996 and 1997,<ref name=SacBee /> 2011  [[Clement L.

[[File:California Chrome and Victor Espinoza at 2014 Preakness Stakes.jpg|thumb|With [[California Chrome]] and [[Victor Espinoza]] in the winners circle of the 2014 Preaknes Stakes]]
[[California Chrome]] owners [[DAP Racing|Perry Martin and Steve Coburn]] chose Sherman to train their horse because "he's old school. He's a regular guy&nbsp;... He can spend quality time with every horse."<ref name=SacBee />  In December 2013, California Chrome won the King Glorious Stakes, the final stakes race at [[Hollywood Park Racetrack]], the same track Sherman had his first win as a jockey.<ref name=Hoppert27Apr /> Sherman subsequently led the horse to a four-race winning streak heading into the [[2014 Kentucky Derby]], including a decisive win in the Grade I [[Santa Anita Derby]].  That record made California Chrome the pre-race favorite in the 2014 Kentucky Derby, but there were still many doubters due to the horse's modest pedigree and Sherman's inexperience at the sport's highest stage.<ref name=USAToday />  For Sherman, it was his first horse as trainer in the Derby.<ref name=SacBee>{{cite news|title=Trainer Art Sherman returns to Kentucky Derby 59 years later with race favorite California Chrome|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/04/29/6364835/trainer-art-sherman-returns-to.html|work=Sacramento Bee|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=May 4, 2014|author=Debbie Arrington}}</ref>

Jockey [[Victor Espinoza]] held California Chrome behind the front-runners in the early part of the race, before making his move on the final turn.  California Chrome pulled away from the field, just as Sherman had envisioned it, winning the Derby by 1&nbsp;3/4 lengths.  The win made the 77-year-old Sherman the oldest trainer to win the Kentucky Derby in the history of the race.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=California Chrome Wins 140th Kentucky Derby|author=Beth Harris|agency=AP|publisher=ABC News|date=May 3, 2014|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/california-chrome-wins-140th-kentucky-derby-23578741|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>  Previously, [[Charlie Whittingham]] held the record, training [[Sunday Silence]] to win the 1989 Kentucky Derby at age 76.<ref name=SacBee />

Interviewed after the race, Sherman said "when I went to Swaps' grave the other day I said a little prayer and it came true. I said I hope [California Chrome] is another Swaps."<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|title=California Chrome pulls away for win at Kentucky Derby|author=John Cherwa|date=May 3, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/horseracing/la-sp-kentucky-derby-20140503,0,1362585.story|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}</ref>  He said the win was unlikely to change him because he had "been around a long time" already and added "I'm just the same old Art Sherman, you know – except, I won the Kentucky Derby."<ref name=USAToday />  Sherman then conditioned California Chrome for the remainder of the horse's career in the United States.

==Alan Sherman==

Art Sherman's assistant is his son, Alan, who is also a licensed trainer.<ref name=Brisnet6Apr>{{cite web|title=California Chrome basks in limelight|url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/news/2014/04/06/california-chrome-basks-limelight|work=Kentucky Derby Racing News|publisher=Kentuckyderby.com|accessdate=April 10, 2014|author=Brisnet.com|date=April 6, 2014}}</ref>  Alan was a jockey for three years in the 1980s until, as he put it, "I ate my way out of that job."<!--cite is to <ref name=Hoppert24May/> for this entire paragraph--> As a jockey, he rode in southern California for trainers such as [[Charlie Whittingham]] and won over a million dollars in purse money, while closely observing how his employers trained their horses, anticipating that some day he too would become a trainer.  Rather than run an independent training stable like his brother Steve, Alan has worked with his father since 1991. He does most of the hands-on day-to-day work with California Chrome and stayed with him throughout his Triple Crown travels when Art returned to California to oversee the rest of the stable.<ref name=Hoppert24May>{{cite web|last=Hoppert|first=Melissa|title=In a Father's Footsteps, Chasing a Triple Crown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/sports/for-alan-sherman-california-chromes-constant-companion-a-journey-from-jockey-to-trainer.html?_r=2|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 27, 2014|date=May 24, 2014}}</ref>
