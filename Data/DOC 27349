This is the founder of [[The Williams Tie Company]] and [[The Thundersnow Corporation]], both of which I have nominated for deletion.  Altogether, the three of them receive about 100 Google hits.  I can't see how this guy is notable, despite the prestigious claims made in the article. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 04:37, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
