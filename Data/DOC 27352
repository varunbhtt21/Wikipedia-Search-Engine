'''''Silphium pinnatifidum''''', the '''tansy rosinweed'''<ref>{{PLANTS|id=SIPI2|taxon=Silphium pinnatifidum|accessdate=15 November 2015}}</ref> or '''cutleaf prairie dock''', is a [[species]] of  [[flowering plant]] in the [[Asteraceae|Composite family]]. It is native to the [[Southeastern United States]] where it is found in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee.<ref>[http://www.herbarium.unc.edu/flora.htm Flora of the Southern and Mid-Atlantic States]</ref> Its habitat is [[prairies]], barrens, and [[cedar glades]].<ref name=chester>{{cite book |last=Chester |first=Edward |date=2015 |title=Guide to the Vascular Plants of Tennessee}}</ref>
[[File:Silphium pinnatifidum phyllaries.jpg|thumb|left|Note the large phyllaries often indicative of ''Silphium'']] Because of loss of its fire-dependent habitat, this species is uncommon and is considered vulnerable.<ref name=ns/><ref>[https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/plant-of-the-week/silphium_pinnatifidum.shtml U.S. Forest Service]</ref>

Although most populations are distinct, intermediate populations have been reported between ''Silphium pinnatifidum'' and ''[[Silphium terebinthinaceum]]'', and some botanists consider ''S. pinnatifidum'' only a variety of ''S. terebinthinaceum''.   ''S. pinnatifidum'' was once thought to be a result of hybridization between ''Silphium terebinthinaceum'' and ''[[Silphium laciniatum]]'', although molecular studies have indicated that ''S. pinnatifidum'' is too closely allied to ''S. terebinthinaceum'' for this to be the case.<ref>[http://www.phytoneuron.net/PhytoN-Silphiumhybrid.pdf] Jessee, L.H. and G.
