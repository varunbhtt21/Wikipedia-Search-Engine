==Early life==
Emery lived in Auckland and attended the [[Diocesan School for Girls, Auckland|Diocesan School for Girls]], where she played [[netball]].<ref name=stuff1>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Bronwynn|title=Chubby duckling turns into swan|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/7601339/Chubby-duckling-turns-into-swan|work=Stuff Magazine New Zealand|accessdate=May 3, 2014|date=September 3, 2012}}</ref>
She weighed 95&nbsp;kg, which interfered with her ability to play netball.<ref name=stuff1/>
To improve her physical ability for the sport, she opted to lose weight under a medically supervised plan, losing 36&nbsp;kg over 2 years.<ref name=stuff1/>
She went from a [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) of 29.32, which was close to being classified as "obese", down to a BMI of 18, which puts her slightly below what is considered the healthy range.<ref name=stuff1/>
For comparison, the average BMI in New Zealand was 27 in 2008.<ref name=stuff1/>
The weight lost greatly helped her to become in demand in modeling, but caused her to be criticized by some at her school, for being unhealthy, which she disputes.<ref name=stuff1/>

==Modeling==
Emery was signed up to be a model with Red Eleven modeling agency at age 16.<ref name=chaos1>{{cite web|last=Frechette|first=Amanda|title=Holly Rose Emery is a Rising Star|url=http://www.chaos-mag.com/holly-rose-emery-is-a-rising-star/|work=Chaos Magazine|accessdate=May 3, 2014|date=September 27, 2013}}</ref> 
Emery has modeled in London, Milan, New York, and Paris.<ref name=nzherald1/>
