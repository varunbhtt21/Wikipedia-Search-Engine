'''Krsta Kovačević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Крста Ковачевић}}; 1877—January 30, 1948), known as '''Krsta Trgoviški''' (Крста Трговишки), was a [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian Chetnik commander]] that was active in [[Old Serbia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] during the Macedonian Struggle (1903–08), then participated in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–13) and [[World War I]] (1914–18).

==Early life==
Kovačević was born in the village of [[Trgovište]] in the [[Pčinja District|Pčinja region]], which at the time was administratively part of the [[Preševo]] ''[[kaza]]'' (administrative region) of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (now located in [[Serbia]]). He was a [[blacksmith]] in his birth village until 1900, when he murdered an Ottoman soldier who beat up his younger brother Spiro. He fled to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] where he worked as a labourer on the railways in [[Sofia]].

==IMRO==
Kovačević was soon noticed by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO), which recruited him into the organization. He was initially part of the ''četa'' (band) of general [[Ivan Tsonchev]], where he became best friends with [[Krsto Lazarov Konjushki]], the later IMRO commander of Kumanovo. At the time of the [[Ilinden Uprising]] (1903) he was part of the band of IMRO commander of Skopje, [[Nikola Pushkarov]], at which time he used his experience as a railway worker to blow up the rail near the village of [[Novačani]]. After Pushkarov's withdrawal, Kovačević joined the band of [[Todor Panitsa]] whose band after several unsuccessful skirmishes was forced to take shelter in [[Vranje]], in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. There, Kovačević befriended [[Živojin Rafajlović]], and determined to join the newly self-organized [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]], thus he left the Bulgarian organization which had up until then had many Serbian fighters in its ranks (as there was no self-organized Serbian organization prior to 1904).

==Serbian Organization==
In 1904, Kovačević was awarded the title of ''vojvoda'', and he commanded several notable fighters who later became commanders themselves, such as [[Vojislav Tankosić]] and [[Vojin Popović-Vuk]]. After the [[Young Turk Revolution]] (1908), he lived a peaceful life in Preševo until 1909, when he discovered just in time that the Turks sought to murder him, which made him leave for the woods.

==First Balkan War==
In the [[First Balkan War]] he participated as a ''vojvoda'' in the Chetnik detachment of ''vojvoda'' [[Vojin Popović-Vuk]], his old friend. He participated in the battles of Kumanovo, Mukos and Bakarna Gumna.

==World War I==
Kovačević participated in World War I as well, alongside six of his brothers and cousins. He independently led his band through Albania in 1915–16, and participated in the breakthrough of the [[Salonika Front]].

==Later years==
In 1924 he led a band that pursued the band of Vancho Mihailov and bands of Albanian [[kachaks]]. During the [[German occupation of Serbia]] (1941–44) he lived secretly in [[Leskovac]]. He died in 1948, in Preševo.
