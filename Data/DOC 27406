'''''N'',''N''-Dimethylethylamine''' ('''DMEA'''), sometimes referred to as dimethylethylamine, is an [[organic compound]] with formula {{chemical formula|C|4|H|11|N}}. It is an industrial chemical that is mainly used in foundries as a catalyst for sand core production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dimethylethylamine|url=http://www.basf.com/group/corporate/us/en/brand/N_N_DIMETHYLETHYLAMINE|publisher=BASF The Chemical Company|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>  Dimethylethylamine is a malodorous, volatile liquid at room temperature that is excreted at greater concentrations with larger dietary intake of [[trimethylamine]].<ref name=toxnet>{{cite web|title=N,N-Dimethylethylamine|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+5712|work=Toxnet|publisher=Hazardous Substance Data Bank|accessdate=4 May 2014|quote=The aim was to study the effect of trimethylamine (TMA) on the metabolism of the industrial catalyst N,N-dimethylethylamine to ascertain whether biological monitoring of industrial exposure to N,N-dimethylethylamine is compromised and excretion of the malodorous N,N-dimethylethylamine in sweat and urine is increased by dietary intake of TMA....Although the increased urinary and hidrotic excretion of N,N-dimethylethylamine may contribute to body odor problems, they were primarily due to TMA excretion, which is much the greater.}}</ref>  It has recently been identified as an [[agonist]] of [[TAAR5|human trace amine-associated receptor 5]].<ref name="pmid23393561">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallrabenstein I, Kuklan J, Weber L, Zborala S, Werner M, Altmüller J, Becker C, Schmidt A, Hatt H, Hummel T, Gisselmann G |title=Human trace amine-associated receptor TAAR5 can be activated by trimethylamine |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=e54950 |year=2013 |pmid=23393561 |pmc=3564852 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054950 |url=}}</ref>
