==General==
* ''[[Le Grand Méliès]]'' (1952): The life of Georges Méliès is told in this biodrama, directed by [[Georges Franju]]. André Méliès plays the part of his own father.
* In [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s 1967 film, ''[[La Chinoise]]'', Guillaume ([[Jean-Pierre Léaud]]) prefaces a lecture on current events with a discussion of who, in French cinema, was the true originator of the filming of current events, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière]] brothers or Méliès. Guillaume makes the argument that Méliès, rather than the Lumières, was the true originator of current event films in French cinema.<ref>The Altering Eye: Contemporary International Cinema by Robert Phillip Kolker (Open Book Publishers, 2009) p. 148.</ref>
