Title : CS50
Text : '''CS50''' ('''Computer Science 50''') is an on-campus and online introductory course on [[computer science]] taught at [[Harvard University]] and, as of 2015, [[Yale University]] as well. In 2016, CS50 became available to high school students as an [[AP Computer Science|AP]] course. The course material is available online for free on [[EdX]] with a range of certificates available for a fee. The on-campus version is Harvard's largest class with 800 students, 102 staff and up to 2,200 participants in their regular [[hackathon]]s.<ref name=Pappano>{{cite web|last=Pappano|first=Laura|title=10 Courses With a Twist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/education/edlife/10-courses-with-a-twist.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref><ref name=Farrell>{{cite web|last=Farrell|first=Michael|title=Computer science course fills seats, needs at Harvard|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/11/26/computer-science-course-breaks-stereotypes-and-fills-halls-harvard/7XAXko7O392DiO1nAhp7dL/story.html|publisher=The Boston Globe}}</ref>

== Format ==
CS50 lectures are recorded and uploaded to several services including [[iTunes U]], [[EdX]], and [[YouTube]]. Additional video "walkthroughs" are recorded with professors and volunteer students. Course questions, called problem sets, or "psets" for short, are available in both PDF and HTML format. Students can upload problem set answers, and some questions are graded by automation. Students can also use special software to check their code in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. In 2016, CS50 became the first university course to offer students the possibility to watch all lectures entirely in [[virtual reality]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CS50 Moves Away from Traditional Lectures, Toward Virtual Reality|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/31/CS50-moves-from-lectures/|website=The Crimson|date=2016-08-31|author=Fahs, C.
