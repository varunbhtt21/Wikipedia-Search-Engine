'''DeGaulle Manor''', now '''Crescent City Gates''', is a low-income public housing project in the [[Algiers, New Orleans|Algiers]] section of [[New Orleans]]. The complex had a notorious reputation for crime and was one of the oldest and most troubled housing complexes in the city
before being shut down in 2012. It later became a dumping ground for trash and in 2014, became a work of art as it was transformed into a graffiti display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_7ba63f0a-ea08-5b1f-aaa6-07a69d9ba821.html|title=One-day exhibit turns blight into art|first=DELLA HASSELLE|last=dhasselle@theadvocate.com|website=theadvocate.com|accessdate=17 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812022655/http://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_7ba63f0a-ea08-5b1f-aaa6-07a69d9ba821.html|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdsu.com/article/several-burned-cars-litter-blighted-algiers-complex/3370582|title=Several burned cars litter blighted Algiers complex|first=Blake|last=Hanson|date=6 May 2014|website=wdsu.com|accessdate=17 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812021742/http://www.wdsu.com/article/several-burned-cars-litter-blighted-algiers-complex/3370582|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>https://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2011/04/mother_of_two_found_shot_to_de.html</ref>

==History==
The 450-unit complex opened in 1964 with 12 5-6 story mid-rise buildings on Sandra Drive, known as "Bridge Plaza." The [[Black Panthers]] were the first to move into the apartments along with the African American [[New Orleans Saints]] players. Towards the early 1970's most of the 200 apartments where being leased by the Federal Housing Administration and some where being administered and subsidized by the Red Cross. It later became a low income subsidized section 8 housing complex operated by the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).<ref>{{cite web|title=Woodlands residents struggle with the affordable housing quagmire in New Orleans|url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/out-in-the-cold/Content?oid=1246942|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504225843/http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/out-in-the-cold/Content?oid=1246942|archivedate=2014-05-04|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://jedco.org/files/Market_Study.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801105258/http://jedco.org/files/Market_Study.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}</ref> 
Between 1970 and the present, no owner kept the property for more than seven years; and each time that it changed hands, the new owners made little effort to rectify the many problems that arose under the supervision of the previous owners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brandanodums.com/be/the-history-of-the-site/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926132138/http://brandanodums.com/be/the-history-of-the-site/ |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}</ref> By the mid 1980s only 364 units remained occupied as the rest were abandoned occupied with squatters who would normally burglarize the apartments.<ref>http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives/?p_product=HA-TP&p_theme=histpaper&p_nbid=&p_action=list&p_topdoc=1</ref>

With bad management, the complex fell into terrible conditions with interior walls damaged from water leeks of rusted pipes and broken elevators. Big rats and cockroach infestations were commonplace as well as rotting garbage stacked up in clogged trash in the dumpsters. The balcony railings were rusted as well as the security gates which did not close. 
[[New Orleans Police Department]] enforced extra patrolling around DeGaulle Manor in an effort to reduce the rising drug activity but failed to make any arrests. Due to the high amounts of violent crimes and shootings in and around the apartments, maintenance workers rarely entered afraid they will be mugged or killed. A rash of shootings and killings in 1993 turned the complex into a battle ground.<ref>http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives</ref>

In 1996 HUD razed 39 abandoned townhouse units in a renovation. In December 2000 Woody Koppel, Neal Morris and Mark Schreiner bought the complex for $5 million in hopes of transforming it but many apartments still failed HUD inspections. In 2005 after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck, 135 out of 364 units were vandalized. One hundred families still lived in the apartments until they were evicted on Thanksgiving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2006/11/27/hundreds_face_eviction_in_new_orleans|title=Hundreds Face Eviction in New Orleans|website=democracynow.org|accessdate=17 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930125744/https://www.democracynow.org/2006/11/27/hundreds_face_eviction_in_new_orleans|archivedate=30 September 2017|df=}}</ref> Johnson Properties Group purchased the complex and was able to renovate 160 units.<ref>{{cite web|title=Woodlands Apartments |url=http://www.gibbsconstruction.com/projects/multi-family/woodlands-apartments/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505002652/http://www.gibbsconstruction.com/projects/multi-family/woodlands-apartments/ |archivedate=2014-05-05 |df= }}</ref>

In 2007, [[Common Ground Collective]] bought the property from Johnson Properties Group, renaming it the Crescent City Gates Apartments. Only a portion of the complex was opened at the time and was in poor condition with termites and rodents infesting the apartments. Crescent City Gates is now vacant and will be demolished and replaced by a new sporting complex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noladefender.com/content/curtain-closes-exhibit-be|title=Curtain Closes on Exhibit BE - NOLA DEFENDER|website=www.noladefender.com|accessdate=17 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812055645/http://www.noladefender.com/content/curtain-closes-exhibit-be|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=}}</ref> North of Crescent City Gates were the [[Christopher Homes]], another run-down housing complex torn down in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Officials witness demolition of Algiers public housing complex|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/04/officials_witness_demolition_o.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505005619/http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/04/officials_witness_demolition_o.html|archivedate=2014-05-05|df=}}</ref>

===Louis Dabdoub shooting===
On December 10, 2004, [[NOPD]] Fourth District’s police commander, Capt. Louis Dabdoub, was injured in a shooting near the complex after he stopped a suspected truant. Dabdoub was shot in the leg by a teenager who opened fire on him, police said. Dabdoub fired several shots back, but then the suspect collapsed, got up and then fled into the complex. After the shooting DeGaulle Manor was placed on lockdown while police searched apartments for the suspect who was a suspected member of the [[D-Block Boys]]. The gang had been distributing [[heroin]] out of abandoned apartments in DeGaulle Manor for years until its closing.<ref>http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=TP&p_theme=tp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=Suspect%20arrested%20in%20cop%20shooting%20AND%20date(1/5/2005%20to%201/5/2005)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=1/5/2005%20to%201/5/2005)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Suspect%20arrested%20in%20cop%20shooting)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=_rank_:D&xcal_ranksort=4&xcal_useweights=yes</ref><ref>http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=TP&p_theme=tp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=Police%20commander%20is%20shot%20by%20teen%20AND%20date(12/11/2004%20to%2012/11/2004)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=12/11/2004%20to%2012/11/2004)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Police%20commander%20is%20shot%20by%20teen)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=_rank_:D&xcal_ranksort=4&xcal_useweights=yes</ref>
