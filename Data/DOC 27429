==Name origin==
The name refers to a group of eight men who had been crew on the [[Norman Morrison (ship)|''Norman Morrison]], a [[Hudson's Bay Company]] vessel, who deserted the vessel while it was moored in [[Suquash Harbour]], upon hearing news of gold in the [[Cariboo]].  Two stories relate their demise at the hands of local natives, one saying that the natives had mis-interpreted the ship's captain's offer to pay money per head, which was taken literally and so the men were killed rather than taken captive and returned to the ship.<ref>Vivienne Chadwick, "How the Deserters Got Their Name", Victoria Colonist magazine 13 May 1962, p.2, quote in BC Names</ref>  Another says that HBC representatives at [[Fort Rupert]] had instigated the murders by offering a dead-or-alive reward, though Governor [[Richard Blanshard|Blanshard]] in his report to London about the incident said the incident was "baseless".<ref>''Tales of Conflict'', Chapter 9: Fort Rupert Murders, pp 40-44, by B.A. McKelvie, published by the Vancouver Daily Province, 1949, quoted in BC Names</ref>  The deserters include a James Wishart, whom [[Wishart Island]] and the [[Wishart Peninsula]] are named for, and A. Willoughby, for whom Willoughby Rock, which is off the north side of the Deserters Group, is named for.<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/25494.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Deserters Island"]</ref>
