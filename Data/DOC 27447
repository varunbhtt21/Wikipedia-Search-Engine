The course "Climate Change and Global Warming" {{lang-ko|지구를 식히는 상상력-기후변화 뛰어넘기}} is offered by the [[Kyung Hee University]] in collaboration with the [[Kyung Hee Cyber University]] in Spring 2014.

Topic: Climate Change and Global Warming

United Nations recently reported global greenhouse-gas emissions have risen more rapidly between 2000 and 2010 than in each of the three previous decades. Such climate change is impacting entire planet, raising risk of hunger, floods, and degrees of unforeseen conflicts worldwide. This course explores the possible cause of climate change of our planet Earth. The participants of lecture will be exposed to understanding the connection between human everyday activity and the current warming trend through related learning activities.

Learning environment: OCMOOC / Wikipedia

The learning environment we offer using MOOC ([[Massive Open Online Course]]) is not just another MOOC course. This is OCMOOC course (One Culture MOOC). It is an experimental MOOC course that is specifically designed for people who shares the same cultural background. From this, we hope to study and observe the learning patterns of how people who share the same culture background interact, access, support, collaborate, and share information among each other. Such observational study has significant potential for generating novel insights into learning and critical educational practices of targeted culture and cultural studies in general.

The enrollment for this course is largely opened to Korean populations worldwide but not restricted to anyone. Although lectures are delivered in Korean, multi-language translation script is available through Youtube script translator. This course is offered free, i.e. at no cost for the participants.

The lecture seminar is six-week which will be co-facilitated by 1) Dr. Piotr Konieczny, a Professor of Information Sociology and Wiki Scholar, and 2) Dr. Yoonil Auh, Professor of Instructional and Educational Technology and Faculty of Global Education and Collaboration and research fellows from GloEd institute.

EDITING WIKIPEDIA ACTIVITY

Editing Wikipedia resembles using Microsoft Word and does not require installation of any software - it is done directly from any browser. Editing Wikipedia can be done in two ways:

1) through the new VisualEditor tool and   2) through the classical editing window.   The new VisualEditor tool is recommended, but it is still in beta and occasionally one may find that they still need to use the old method

The following page explains how to use the Visual Editor:

The following pages explain how to use the classical editing window:
* in the form of a game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_Wikipedia_Adventure
* in the form of a more classical training activity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Training/For_students
* in Korean: https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9C%84%ED%82%A4%EB%B0%B1%EA%B3%BC:%EA%B8%B8%EB%9D%BC%EC%9E%A1%EC%9D%B4
