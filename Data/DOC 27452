'''Pavle Mladenović-Jačinski''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Павле Младеновић}}; d. June 16, 1905), known as '''Čiča Pavle''' (Чича Павле; "Uncle Pavle") and '''Pavle Jačinski''', was a [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian Chetnik commander]] active in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] during the [[Macedonian Struggle]].

==Life==
Mladenović was born in the village of [[Jačince]], in the region of [[Ovče Polje]], at the time part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He worked as a peasant in his village and became [[Bulgarian Exarchate|an Exarchist]] at the end of the 19th century. When the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) started assassinating and murdering people who identified as Serbs in the [[Kumanovo]] region, Čiča Pavle took his sons and nephews to the woods and joined the precursor to the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]]. He started guerilla fighting in springtime 1903, as the first Serbian vojvoda, a year before the establishment of the ''Serbian Committee''.<ref>U.

In April 1905 he participated in the [[Battle of Čelopek]] alongside commanders [[Doksim Mihailović]], [[Savatije Milošević]], [[Lazar Kujundžić]], [[Vojislav Tankosić]], [[Aksentije Bacetović]] and [[Borko Paštrović]]. During the battle, he took the Čelopek height and thus prevented the encirclement of the Serbian bands from the Albanian [[bashi-bozuk]]s.<ref>S.

After his death, his son Jaćim Pavlović-Jaćko continued in his father's footsteps, becoming a Serbian vojvode himself.
