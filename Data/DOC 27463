'''Yelü Lihu''' (耶律李胡) (911-960), also named '''Honggu''' (洪古), [[courtesy name]] '''Xiyin''' (奚隱), formally '''Emperor Zhangsu''' (章肅皇帝), was an imperial prince of the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] state.  As the third son of Liao's founding emperor [[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Emperor Taizu]] (Yelü Abaoji) and his wife [[Empress Shulü Ping]], Yelü Lihu served as [[crown prince]] during the reign of his older brother [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Emperor Taizong]] (Yelü Deguang), who was their second son, as Empress Shulü wanted him to be emperor after Emperor Taizong.  However, after Emperor Taizong's death, their older brother [[Yelü Bei]]'s son [[Emperor Shizong of Liao|Yelü Ruan]] was able to defeat Yelü Lihu in battle and take the throne.  Yelü Lihu was put under arrest and later died while under arrest.

== Background ==
Yelü Lihu was born in 911, as the third son of [[Khitan people|Khitan]] chieftain [[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Yelü Abaoji]] and his wife [[Empress Shulü Ping|Shulü Ping]] — after his older brothers [[Yelü Bei]] and [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Yelü Deguang]].<ref name=HL72>''[[History of Liao]]'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷72|vol. 72]].</ref>  Yelü Lihu was Lady Shulü's youngest son, although Yelü Abaoji would later have a younger son, Yelü Yaliguo (耶律牙里果), by a Lady Xiao.<ref>''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:遼史/卷64|vol. 64]].</ref>  (Yelü Abaoji would, in 916, claim the title of emperor, establishing the [[Liao dynasty|Khitan Empire]] (later to be known as Liao), as its Emperor Taizu.)<ref>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷269|vol. 269]].</ref>

In Yelü Lihu's youth, he was said to be brave, strong, and ferocious, but was also cruel.  Even on minor things where people would anger him, he would punish those people by tattooing their faces or by throwing them into fire or water.  There was a time when Emperor Taizu observed his sons sleeping (apparently, together), with Yelü Lihu curled up and sleeping toward the inside.  He commented, "This must be a sign that he is lesser to the others."  There was also a time when it was extremely cold, when he told his sons to go out to fetch firewood.  Yelü Deguang, without being choosy about the kind of wood, grabbed the wood and returned quickly.  Yelü Bei selected the dry wood, bundled it up carefully, and then returned with the wood.  Yelü Lihu did not gather much wood and lost much on the way, and when he returned, he simply left the wood there and stood by.  Emperor Taizu commented, "The oldest is skillful, but the second is more capable.  The youngest is lesser than the others."  However, Empress Shulü favored Yelü Lihu.<ref name=HL72/>

== During Emperor Taizong's reign ==
Emperor Taizu died in 926.  After his death, Empress Shulü diverted the succession away from Yelü Bei, to Yelü Deguang, who took the throne as Emperor Taizong.<ref name=ZZTJ275>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷275|vol. 275]].</ref>  In 930, Emperor Taizong sent Yelü Lihu on an incursion into the territory of Khitan's southern neighbor [[Later Tang]].  Yelü Lihu attacked Later Tang's Huan Prefecture (寰州, in modern [[Shuozhou]], [[Shanxi]]), and returned with many captives.  Emperor Taizong thereafter created him [[crown prince]] and gave him the title of generalissimo of all armies.<ref name=HL72/>  (This designation of Yelü Lihu as crown prince apparently aggravated Yelü Bei further, as it was later that year that Yelü Bei fled to Later Tang.)<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷277|vol. 277]].</ref>  During Emperor Taizong's subsequent campaigns, Yelü Lihu was often put in charge of defending the capital Linhuang (臨潢, in modern [[Chifeng]], [[Inner Mongolia]]).<ref name=HL72/>

In 936, Emperor Taizong launched a campaign to aid the Later Tang general [[Shi Jingtang]] (the brother-in-law of then-Later Tang emperor [[Li Congke]]) to overthrow Later Tang.  The campaign was successful, and Shi's new [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]] replaced Later Tang as the ruling regime in central and northern China.<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷280|vol. 280]].</ref>  Shi remained submissive toward Khitan (whose state was then renamed Liao) and in 938 had his [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]]s [[Feng Dao]] and [[Liu Xu]] visit Liao on a diplomatic mission, offering honorable titles to Emperor Taizong and Empress Dowager Shulü, including honoring Emperor Taizong as "father emperor" while Shi referred to himself as "son emperor."  Shi also often offered gifts to many key Liao generals and nobles, and Yelü Lihu, as crown prince, was the recipient of many of these gifts as well.<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷281|vol. 281]].</ref>  However, after Shi's death, his nephew and successor [[Shi Chonggui]] took a confrontational stance against Liao,<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷283|vol. 283]].</ref> causing Emperor Taizong to launch a major campaign against Later Jin in 946, destroying it.<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷284|vol. 284]].</ref>  During the campaign, Yelü Lihu presumably remained at Linhuang to defend it.

== After Emperor Taizong's reign ==
Emperor Taizong claimed imperial title over China as well, but soon tired of the many rebellions rising up against him throughout the former Later Jin realm.  He began a withdrawal back to Liao proper, but died on the way, near Heng Prefecture (恆州, in modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]).<ref name=ZZTJ286>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷286|vol. 286]].</ref>  As Empress Dowager Shulü had, when Emperor Taizu died, killed many chieftains so that she could bury them with Emperor Taizu,<ref name=ZZTJ275/> many of the Khitan generals feared that she would do the same thing again;<ref name=ZZTJ287>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷287|vol. 287]].</ref> they therefore resolved to support Yelü Bei's son [[Emperor Shizong of Liao|Yelü Ruan]] the Prince of Yongkang as emperor.<ref name=ZZTJ286/>  Yelü Ruan was subsequently able to overpower the ethnically [[Han Chinese]] general [[Zhao Yanshou]] (who had designs on claiming imperial title himself) and take over Heng Prefecture, and then declared himself emperor (as Emperor Shizong).<ref name=ZZTJ287/>

However, knowing that Empress Dowager Shulü had intended for Yelü Lihu to succeed, Emperor Shizong decided to head back north to Liao proper in order to face off against his grandmother.  She sent Yelü Lihu with her army to face Emperor Shizong, but Yelü Lihu was defeated by Emperor Shizong's forward commanders Yelü Anduan (耶律安端, a younger brother of Emperor Taizu) and Yelü Liuge (耶律留哥).  Knowing that her cause was lost, Empress Dowager Shulü accepted the suggestion of the official Yelü Wuzhi (耶律屋質) and negotiated a peace agreement where she accepted Emperor Shizong as emperor.<ref name=HL72/>  Emperor Shizong subsequently had her placed under house arrest at Emperor Taizu's tomb,<ref name=ZZTJ287/> while Yelü Lihu was placed under house arrest at Zu Prefecture (祖州, in modern Chifeng).<ref name=HL72/>

In 960, Yelü Lihu's son Yelü Xiyin (耶律喜隱) plotted a rebellion against then-reigning [[Emperor Muzong of Liao|Emperor Muzong]] (Emperor Taizong's son Yelü Jing).  As a result, both he and Yelü Lihu were arrested and placed in jail.  Yelü Lihu died in jail thereafter (although Yelü Xiyin did not and was subsequently released).<ref name=HL72/><ref name=XZZTJ1>''[[Xu Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:續資治通鑑/卷001|vol. 1]].</ref>
