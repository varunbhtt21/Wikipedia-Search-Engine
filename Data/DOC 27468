'''Rae Edwin Featherstone''' (1907-1987) was an Australian architect best known for serving as staff architect at [[Melbourne University]]. His early work with the firm [[Oakley & Parkes]] influenced his later stylistic approach, which was firmly rooted in an early [[Moderne architecture|modernist]] style. He  worked for [[H. S. Goodhart-Rendel|H S Goodhart-Rendel]] in Europe as Chief Assistant, after which he returned to Australia, working for [[Stephenson_and_Turner|Stephenson & Turner]], and retaining the right to practice on his own. His work on the house Blue Peter (1956) won him national recognition when it was published in the book ''Best Houses in Australia.'' He was then appointed his position of senior lecturer at [[The University of Melbourne]], finally achieving the position of staff architect.  He later consulted for the [[Australian University Commission]].

==Biography==
R.E.Featherstone (b. 1907, Hawthorn, [[Australia]]) began his education at [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]], and later [[Swinburne University of Technology|Swinburne]] and West Melbourne Technical Colleges. He then began his internship with [[Edwin J & C L Ruck]], while  enrolled at [[The University of Melbourne]] for the diploma of Architectural Atelier. Upon completing his qualification, he stayed on at the University as an assistant instructor. He  was employed by the firm [[Oakley & Parkes]] in 1930 and was involved in the design of [[Yule House]](1932). During this period he retained his right to practice outside the firm and designed a residence for C M Werner, 13 Moorakyne Ave, Malvern. In April 1934 he left Oakley & Parkes to pursue an interest in interior decoration and furniture design in Europe. While in Europe, he was employed in the practice of [[H. S. Goodhart-Rendel|H S Goodhart-Rendel]] a position which he held for several years as chief assistant working on cathedrals, hospitals and civic commissions. Upon his return to Melbourne he was employed once more at Oakley & Parkes and worked on the  ANZAC House entry sequence (1938) and Phosphate House (1940). He then transferred to the practice of [[Stephenson_and_Turner|Stephenson & Turner]], working on military and civilian hospitals. After the second world war Featherstone returned to [[The University of Melbourne]] as a lecturer, in charge of a short course of architectural design for returning servicemen. Then in 1947 when the Faculty of Architecture was established he maintained his position of senior lecturer. Three years later he  left on a tour of Europe, America and the U.K. to study post-war building developments. This tour was the basis for his published report "Architectural education in Scandinavia, Western Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/42414323|title=Architectural education in Scandinavia, Western Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States of America|first=Rae|last=Featherstone|date=8 January 2018|publisher=[Melbourne : University of Melbourne|via=Trove}}</ref>  In 1954 the current professor of architecture at [[The University of Melbourne]] left for overseas travel, and Featherstone was appointed Acting Professor of Architecture. He had still retained the right to private practice and designed the house known as "Blue Peter"(1956) which gained national recognition when it was published in Neil Clerehan’s book "The Best Australian Houses".

In December 1957, Featherstone was given the position of staff architect at [[The University of Melbourne]] and worked on notable buildings on the University's Parkville campus, including  the Redmond Barry building and the Raymond Priestley building.<ref name="auto">Lovell Chen Architects & Heritage Consultants, (2010).

Melbourne: Lovell Chen Architects & Heritage Consultants, pp.85.</ref> He retired as the staff architect in 1972 and was given an honorary Master of Philosophy degree.  He  later moved to Canberra where he was a consultant for the Australian Universities Commission; in 1978 he retired and returned once again to Melbourne.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=http://www.builtheritage.com.au/dua_featherstone.html|title=Rae FEATHERSTONE|first=Built Heritage Pty|last=Ltd|website=www.builtheritage.com.au}}</ref>

== Notable projects ==

=== Yule House, 1932 ===
When he first began working in the office of '''Oakley & Parkes''' Featherstone was involved in the design of the [[Yule House]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.builtheritage.com.au/dua_featherstone.html|title=Rae FEATHERSTONE|first=Built Heritage Pty|last=Ltd|website=www.builtheritage.com.au}}</ref> 309-311 [[Little Collins Street, Melbourne|Little Collins Street]]. Built in 1932, Yule House is an exceptional example of [[Streamline Moderne|Moderne]] Architecture in Melbourne, the "first commercial building in Australia to demonstrate the principles of the emerging Moderne style". The significant influence of Yule House can be seen in many of Featherstones projects.<ref>{{cite web|website=www.architecture.com.au|year= 2014|url= http://www.architecture.com.au/docs/default-source/vic-notable-buildings/yule-house.pdf?sfvrsn=0 |title=Yule House|format=PDF|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

=== ANZAC House, 1938 ===
The ANZAC house functions as a library and memorabilia collection for war time diaries, letters and other paraphernalia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkingmelbourne.com/building436_anzac-house.html|title=Anzac House - 4-6 Collins Street, Melbourne. MELBOURNE  [Walking Melbourne Building Information]|first=Sean|last=Fishlock|website=www.walkingmelbourne.com}}</ref> This collection is part of the Victorian Collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://victoriancollections.net.au/organisations/anzac-house-reference-library-and-memorabilia-collection|title=RSL Victoria - Anzac House Reference Library and Memorabilia Collection - Victorian Collections|website=victoriancollections.net.au}}</ref> The building is a [[Georgian Revival|Georgian revival]], [[Palazzo style]] typical of buildings in the early interwar period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;712|title=VHD|website=vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au}}</ref> The majority of the building design was done by Stanley Oaks.  Featherstone’s involvement with this project specifically pertained to the entrance hall and entry facade itself.<ref name="auto1"/>

=== Holiday residence for G Nelson Raymond (Blue Peter), 1956 ===
21 Gulls Way, also known as "Blue Peter" (built prior to the children's show, more likely referring to the [[Blue Peter (flag)|nautical flag]]) gained national recognition when the house was published in ‘Best Australian Houses’ in 1961. Blue peter is a fairly typical example of the more [[Modern architecture|modern]] and exclusive beach houses of the 1950s. The house consists of two interlocking squares and a triangular raised terrace facing the waterfront.<ref name="auto2">Clerehan, N. (1961). Best Australian houses. 1st ed. Melbourne: Cheshire.</ref> The house was open-plan and could sleep 6 people, with spaces serving multiple purposes. The living room was planned around an elaborate stereophonic installation and served as a living area and dining room with a panoramic view onto the bay, and bay doors that opened onto the triangular terrace.<ref name="auto2"/> Unfortunately the house was demolished in November 1991, just prior to the Trust councils classification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;65507|title=VHD|website=vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au}}</ref>

=== Redmond Barry Building, 1959-61 ===
Under his recently appointed position as staff architect of [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne University]] (1957) Featherstone designed North Building in association with Eggleston MacDonald & Secomb.<ref>Lovell Chen Architects & Heritage Consultants, (2010). The University of Melbourne Heritage Documentation Main Campus Building Data Sheets. Melbourne: Lovell Chen Architects & Heritage Consultants, pp.20.</ref> North building, later renamed to the Redmond Barry Building, remains the tallest building on the campus. At twelve storeys high, the landmark tower was constructed in a [[Steel construction|steel structure]] slab and podium style system, consisting of [[shear wall]]s and reinforced concrete columns.

=== Raymond Priestley Building, 1967-70 ===
Raymond Priestley Building is a large University Administration building, used as office and function space. The building was constructed in a similar way to the Redmond Barry building: concrete slabs with reinforced concrete columns and brick shear walls.<ref name="auto"/> Standing eleven storeys high, the five iconic arches branching the building's elevated ground floor undercroft is an example of midcentury Modern Architecture in Melbourne.
