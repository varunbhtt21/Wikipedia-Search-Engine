'''Abbas Bahri''' (1 January 1955 &ndash; 10 January 2016) was a Tunisian mathematician.<ref name="arsco1">{{cite web |url=http://www.arsco.org/detailed/a5bb577c-f054-4f4c-b1ce-02a6644f6031 |title=Fifth Saudi Science conference "An Interview with Professor Abbas Bahri" |publisher=Arsco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504103503/http://www.arsco.org/detailed/a5bb577c-f054-4f4c-b1ce-02a6644f6031 |archivedate=2014-05-04 |df= }}</ref> He was the winner of the [[Fermat Prize]] and the Langevin Prize in mathematics.<ref name="arsco1"/> He was a professor of mathematics at [[Rutgers University]].

He mainly studied the [[calculus of variations]], [[partial differential equation]]s, and [[differential geometry]]. He introduced the method of the critical points at infinity, which is a fundamental step in the calculus of variations.

==Biography==
Bahri received his secondary education in Tunisia and higher education in France. He attended the École Normale Superieure in Paris<ref name="arsco1"/> in 1974, the first Tunisian to do so.

In 1981, he completed his PhD from [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University (University of Paris 6)|Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University]].<ref name="arsco1"/> His dissertation advisor was the French mathematician [[Haïm Brezis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Abbas Bahri|url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18218|website=Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> Afterwards, he was a visiting scientist at the [[University of Chicago]].

In October 1981, Bahri became a lecturer in mathematics at the [[University of Tunis]]. He taught as a lecturer at the [[École Polytechnique]] from 1984 to 1993.<ref>"Abbas Bahri." (n.d.): ''Marquis Biographies Online''. Web. 11 July 2014.</ref> In 1988, he became a tenured professor at Rutgers University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Faculty |publisher=Rutgers University |url=http://mail.math.rutgers.edu/people/index.php?type=faculty&id=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504141727/http://mail.math.rutgers.edu/people/index.php?type=faculty&id=10 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 May 2014 |accessdate=4 May 2014 }}</ref> At Rutgers, he was director of the Center for Nonlinear Analysis from 1988 to 2002.

===Personal life===
He married Diana Nunziante on 20 June 1991.<ref>''Bahri, Abbas''. n.p.: 2014. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''. Web. 11 July 2014.</ref> His wife is from [[Italy]] and they had four children.<ref name="arsco1"/> On 10 January 2016, he died following a long illness at the age of 61.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessnews.com.tn/deces-du-mathematicien-tunisien-abbas-bahri,520,61605,3 |title=Décès du mathématicien tunisien Abbas Bahri |language=French|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10 January 2016 |website=BusinessNews.com.tn |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

==Awards==
In 1989, Bahri won the Fermat Prize for Mathematics, jointly with [[Kenneth Alan Ribet]], for his introduction of new methods in the calculus of variations.
