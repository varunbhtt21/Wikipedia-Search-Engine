'''''Camassia howellii''''', commonly known as '''Howell's camas''', is a species of perennials [[endemic]] to western [[Oregon]].<ref>[https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=42879 Integrated Taxonomic Information System-ITIS Standard Report Page: ''Camassia howellii'']</ref>

Discovered in 1889, ''Camassia howellii'' is now considered to be imperiled due to residential development, mining and grazing.<ref name=nat>NatureServe. 2014.

==Distribution==
[[Image:GetMapGif.gif|left|thumb|Map of distribution]]
'' Camassia howellii'' is found exclusively in the southwestern region of [[Oregon]]. The 12 populations make up a total of 3000 plants. These sites are threatened by human developments. This species is currently under the global conservation status rank G2 Imperiled.<ref>Kartesz, J.T. 1994. A synonymized checklist of the vascular flora of the United States, Canada, and Greenland. 2nd edition. 2 vols. Timber Press, Portland, OR.</ref> Although other species of ''[[Camassia]]'' are still abundant in the Northwest, this one is not in Oregon.

''Camassia howellii'' thrives in wet meadows in serpentine soil. They are found in eastern Oregon where precipitation levels range from 70 to 100 inches per year and temperatures from 40 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit per year. These perennials are late bloomers usually during the month of May and the flowers will wither in the autumn.<ref>Knight, Linda. Seevers, Joan. 1992.

==Description==

''Camassia howellii'' grows from a bulb and has 60&nbsp;cm long basal leaves which range around 4 to 7 per plant.

The plant's inflorescences reach about {{convert|15|to|40|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long which are usually bluish violet. The flowers are actinomorphic made up of five {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} long petals. There can be 100 flowers in a raceme. These flowers sit atop a stem about {{convert|50|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name=nat/> The flowers are radially symmetrical and are composed of five deep bluish violet petals. The petals range from 10 to 20&nbsp;mm long and about 3 to 5&nbsp;mm wide.<ref>Barkley, Theodore. Flora of North America ''Camassia howellii''</ref>  This species is known to bloom in the month of May.

==Uses==
Native Americans and settlers considered ''Camassia howellii'' as an important part of their diet. The city of Camas in Washington and many parts of the Northwestern United States was named after this plant due to its large cultivation and consumption by the Native Americans and first white settlers.

In autumn the bulbs were harvested after the flowers dried up and were boiled or pit-cooked.<ref>Gould, Frank W. '' A Systematic Treatment of the Genus ''Camassia'' Lindl". The University of Notre Dame, Vol.28, No. 3, Nov., 1942, p. 712-742. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2420901</ref> The bulbs were also dried and ground into flour. As the settlers began to expand their territory, they raised cattle which limited the growth of camas in the area.
