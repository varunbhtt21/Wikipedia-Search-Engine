The '''Armed Forces of the Philippines Peacekeeping Operations Center''' is one of the wide support units of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].

It is tasked with the training, deployment, and management of Filipino international peacekeepers throughout the world.<ref name="Ancan 2015">Ancan, Colonel Roberto T and Annanette B Cruz.

The AFP PKOC trains and deploys Filipino peacekeepers from various units of the AFP. It also accommodates the training of peacekeepers from other uniformed services of the [[Philippines]], such as the [[Philippine National Police]], [[Philippine Coast Guard]], [[Bureau of Jail Management and Penology]],<ref>http://www.bjmp.gov.ph/files/MOU_UNPeacekeeping%20Mission.pdf</ref> and the [[Bureau of Fire Protection]]. So far, however, only the AFP and PNP has deployed peacekeepers to UN missions.

[[Benigno Aquino III|President Benigno Aquino III]] ordered the thorough review of all peacekeeping missions that the [[Philippines]] has participated in, or are currently contributing to, to ensure that the welfare of the troops are well taken care of. This came after Filipino peacekeepers assigned to [[UNDOF]] were captured and held by Syrian rebels after conducting a routine patrol.<ref name="interaksyon">{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/63874/pnoy-orders-review-of-all-un-peacekeeping-missions-of-filipino-soldiers-abroad|title=PNoy orders review of all UN peacekeeping missions of Filipino soldiers abroad|publisher=interaksyon.com|accessdate=2014-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425023242/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/63874/pnoy-orders-review-of-all-un-peacekeeping-missions-of-filipino-soldiers-abroad|archive-date=25 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="ap">{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/philippines-wants-better-protection-un-troops|title=Philippines wants better protection for UN troops|publisher=bigstory.ap.org|accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref>

==Female Peacekeepers==
The AFP PKOC conforms to international standards of gender mainstreaming in UN peace support operations (PSOs), by deploying female peacekeepers to as many missions as possible.<ref name="peacewomen">{{cite web|url=http://www.peacewomen.org/news_article.php?id=3135&type=news |title=PHILIPPINES: PHL Pushes For Participation Of Women In UN Peacekeeping - News Library - News &amp; Events - PeaceWomen |publisher=peacewomen.org |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425035952/http://www.peacewomen.org/news_article.php?id=3135&type=news |archivedate=25 April 2014 }}</ref><ref name="inquirer">{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090530-208003/RP-to-send-more-women-peacekeepers |title=RP to send more women peacekeepers  - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=globalnation.inquirer.net |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425034113/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20090530-208003/RP-to-send-more-women-peacekeepers |archivedate=25 April 2014 }}</ref>

Since 2000, female Filipino soldiers have been deployed as contingent troops, their roles usually being administrative or clerical in nature; or as individually deployed peacekeeping force staff (now military staff officers) and military experts on mission.<ref name="Global Kawal.">Balao, Colonel Dante D and Annanette B Cruz-Salazar. [http://koha.nlp.gov.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?bib=486712 ''Global Kawal.''] Quezon City, The Philippines: Armed Forces of the Philippines. 2008. {{ISBN|978-971-92556-3-5}}</ref><ref name="ndcp.edu.ph"/>

In 2000, the AFP sent its first female UN Blue Berets, all enlisted personnel, to UNTAET. Meanwhile, the AFP's first female commissioned officer to be hatted the UN Blue Beret was Major Josephine O Tanzo, Philippine Marines, who was part of the Fifth Philippine Contingent to Liberia.<ref name="National Pride, World Peace."/>

==Notable Filipino UN Blue Berets==
* Lieutenant General [[Jaime de los Santos|Jaime S de los Santos]] AFP
In 2000-01, Lt Gen de los Santos assumed the post of UNTAET Peacekeeping Force Supreme Commander. He led 8,500 personnel from 19 troop-contributing countries (TCCs) in the multidimensional peacekeeping operation that transitioned the Indonesian province of East Timor into the Republic of Timor-Leste.

* Major General [[Natalio C. Ecarma III|Natalio C Ecarma III]] AFP
In 2010-13, Maj Gen Ecarma assumed the post of UNDOF Commander and concurrent Head of Mission. He led 800 personnel from 10 TCCs in the traditional peacekeeping mission that was established to keep the peace between Israel and Syria, particularly in the disputed Golan Heights.

* Lieutenant Colonel Jose L Rancudo, PAF
In 1963, ONUC mission authorities appointed Lt Col Rancudo as Commander of the ONUC Fighter Wing, the UN's first air force. He thus led pilots and air crew from Iran, the Philippines, and Sweden.

* Staff Sergeant Antonio M Batomalaque PA
Part of the First Philippine Contingent to Haiti, Ssg Batomalaque was assigned as the driver of Lt Col Robert Casias, a high-ranking MINUSTAH peacekeeping force staff seconded by the [[US Army|United States Army]]. In April 2005, while inspecting the notorious [[Cité Soleil]] district in the Haïtian capital, [[Port-au-Prince]], Casias and the rest of the MINUSTAH team came under attack by gangsters. Batomalaque swiftly responded by providing covering fire to Casias and other colleagues, in the process sustaining a fatal gunshot wound a few millimeters above the nape. For his display of heroism that cost him his life, Batomalaque was posthumously awarded the US [[Soldier's Medal]]. He is the sole Filipino UN Blue Beret to die by hostile fire.<ref name="ndcp.edu.ph"/>
