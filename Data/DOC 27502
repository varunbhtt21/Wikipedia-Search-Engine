The road to Chemmappily touches Peringottukara and Thriprayar East Nada. Aneswaram Shiva temple and a Mosque are here. During the "Grama pradakshinam" of Thriprayar Thevar at the time of Arattupuzha Devamela, Thevan ran away from Aneswaram Siva, without any sound because Thevar borrowed paddy and coconut from Lord Aneswaram Siva.{{clarify|date=May 2014|who were these people? why is this relevant?}}
