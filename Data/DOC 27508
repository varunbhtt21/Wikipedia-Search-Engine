After Orgasmic left, Fuzati continued with the project with DJ Detect starting 2001. 
 
In 2002, he released his first mixtape titled ''Orgasmic le Toxicologue est secretement amoureux de vous'' where he mixed songs from various artists including Marilyn Manson, Britney Spears, D12 and Busdriver. 2006 saw his first mixtape with Institubes, titled ''The Rise and Rise of Orgasmic'', containing exclusive tracks from Cuizinier, Charly Greane, Para One, Feadz, Omnikrom, Institubes Paris Terror Club etc. He was very much involved with Stunts, being the rap section of the label Institubes.

After appearing on several mixtapes, TTC released their debut album ''Ceci n'est pas un disque'' on Big Dada Recordings. The 2005 ''Bâtards Sensibles'' was a big turning point for TTC and they were signed to French V2 label with Orgasmic as producer.
