The result was    '''keep'''. Obviously the unsourced OR needs to go, but that's not a reason to delete the entire article. [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] <sup>([[User talk:Lankiveil|speak to me]])</sup> 09:06, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep'''{{spaced ndash}} with a significant possibility of a merge to [[Streaking]]. This appears to be a [[WP:SPINOUT]] of the Streaking article, per the "''Main article: Streaking at educational institutions''" link in the Educational institutions section of the Streaking article. Some of the content is sourced to reliable sources, but a great deal of it is not. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 10:57, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
