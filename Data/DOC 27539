The '''Ligier JS9''' was a [[Formula One]] [[racing car]] manufactured and raced by [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] during the [[1978 Formula One season]]. Driven by Frenchman [[Jacques Laffite]], its best finish was third (twice).

==Development==
The JS9 was designed by [[Gérard Ducarouge]] and Michel Beaujon, with Robert Choulet working on aerodynamics.<ref name=Statsf1/> The JS9 had a large rear wing, but did not use the ground effects aerodynamics that was being developed by Lotus and other teams.<ref name="Brown">{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Allen|title=Ligier JS9 car-by-car histories|url=http://www.oldracingcars.com/ligier/js9/|website=oldracingcars.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref> The Hewland TL200 gearbox of the previous year was upgraded to the more lightweight Hewland FGA 6-speed and it continued to use the Matra MS76 V12 engine.<ref name="Brown"/> However development of the V12 ceased during the year which may have affected the results achieved by the car.  A total of two JS9 chassis were built, with the second of these having revised suspension.<ref name=Nye>Nye, 1985, p. 192</ref>

The JS9 was the last Ligier car that used a Matra V12 with the 1979 car being designed around a Cosworth engine.<ref name=Nye>Nye, 1985, p. 192</ref>

==Racing history==
For the [[1978 Formula One season|1978 season]], Ligier continued to run a single entry for [[Jacques Laffite]], the team's regular driver.<ref name=Statsf1/> After completing the first six races of the season with the JS7 and JS7/9 (a hybrid car),<ref name=Nye/> the JS9 made its debut at the [[1978 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]]. Laffite qualified it 10th on the grid and in the race itself finished on the podium in third.  After finishing out of the points for the next three races, he finished third again in [[1978 German Grand Prix|Germany]], this time from seventh on the grid.<ref name=Statsf1/>

With Laffite now driving the second of the two JS9 chassis that had been built,<ref name=Nye/> two further points finishes were achieved, a fifth in [[1978 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]] (having qualified fifth, the best starting position Lafitte achieved with the JS9) and fourth in [[1978 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]]. Laffite enjoyed good reliability, retiring from just one race, the season ending [[1978 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]].<ref name=Statsf1/>
