'''Stella Hume''' (4 October 1882 – 3 January 1954) was an early figure in radio in [[South Australia]].

==Biography==
Stella Hume was born in Victoria. Not much is known of her life until she married Ernest James Hume (1869-1929), in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], a suburb of [[Sydney]] in 1905 and moved with him to [[Adelaide, South Australia]]<ref>Nancy Robinson Whittle, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hume-stella-leonora-harriette-10571/text18775 'Hume, Stella Leonora Harriette (1882–1954)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 4 May 2014</ref> where Ernest Hume was developing a business with his brother [[Walter Reginald Hume]], manufacturing steel and pipes, and eventually inventing patented products.<ref>Australian Academy of Science.

Hume worked in several cultural industries in [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] while raising her four children, including teaching elocution lessons. She was art director of the [[Adelaide Repertory Theatre]], and accomplished music, singing, dancing, sculpture and flower arranging. She was an actress in silent films under the name Leonora Starr.<ref>Nancy Robinson Whittle, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hume-stella-leonora-harriette-10571/text18775 'Hume, Stella Leonora Harriette (1882–1954)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 4 May 2014</ref>

In 1923, the Hume family, led by Stella's sons [[Jack Hume]] and Ernest Hume, Jr., became interested in the new technology of radio transmission and saw in the potential for cultural, social and education opportunities afforded by the technology.<ref>Nancy Robinson Whittle, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hume-stella-leonora-harriette-10571/text18775 'Hume, Stella Leonora Harriette (1882–1954)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 4 May 2014</ref> As a result, they acquired equipment and established a radio studio in their home on Park Terrace (later Greenhill Road) at [[Parkside, South Australia|Parkside]], receiving a permit to broadcast from their home studio. The station became 5 Don N and later 5DN. The station became increasingly popular and went from broadcasting for a few hours per day to continuous broadcasting. Including broadcasting from their home, the family broadcast from the Elder Conservatorium of Music and the University of Adelaide.

Hume was one of the world's first female announcers and programme directors;<ref>Nancy Robinson Whittle, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hume-stella-leonora-harriette-10571/text18775 'Hume, Stella Leonora Harriette (1882–1954)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 4 May 2014</ref> she used the name Miss Leonora Starr as announcer of an elocutionist programme and the name Auntie Stella, for children's programming. Broadcasts from 5DN were broadcast in almost every country in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57040078 |title=CAPABLE RADIO ENGINEER Career of Mr. Ernest Hume, Jun. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=19 April 1928 |accessdate=4 May 2014 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Hume's husband, Ernest James Hume, died in 1929 and Stella Hume moved to Neutral Bay, Sydney. She continued to give occasional radio talks there and patented a four-valve wireless receiver. She became involved in Spiritualism. She moved back to Adelaide in 1939 and then to [[Goulburn, New South Wales]] in the early 1950s and died at Kenmore Mental Hospital in 1954.<ref>Nancy Robinson Whittle, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hume-stella-leonora-harriette-10571/text18775 'Hume, Stella Leonora Harriette (1882–1954)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 4 May 2014</ref>
