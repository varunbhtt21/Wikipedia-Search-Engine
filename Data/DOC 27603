==Controversy==
In September 2015, the county government of Bungoma was audited and it was discovered that the county had spent Kshs 1,093,200 (approximately $10,881) on 10 wheelbarrows for the Bungoma slaughterhouse, suggesting that the wheelbarrows cost Kshs 109,320 ($1,088) each. In response to the outrage sparked by Kenyans over what appeared to be massive waste of taxpayer money by the government, Governor Lusaka said that, "The information that I am getting from the veterinary department is that these are not the ordinary wheelbarrows that we know. These are wheelbarrows that are made of stainless, non-carcinogenic material and are used in the food industry." However, he later said that he had begun investigations and ordered the tender and evaluation committees to justify the purchases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/counties/Uproar-Bungoma-Sh1m-wheelbarrows/-/1107872/2863512/-/ub0xy0/-/index.html |title=Uproar as Bungoma spends Sh1m on wheelbarrows - VIDEO - Daily Nation |access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref>
