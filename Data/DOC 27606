==Background==
Muhammad Khan belonged to khaghzai branch of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] [[Bangash]] tribe. In India they were referred to as ''qaum-i-bangash''. His father, Ain Khan Bangash had migrated from his native lands in the time of Aurangzeb and settled in Mau Rashidabad. Muhammad Khan gained a reputation as one of the most powerful of the Afghan mercenary warriors who inhabited that part of Hindustan, and eventually came to establish the territories that were consolidated into the state of Farrukhabad. The state of Farrukhabad was named after Muhammad Khan's patron the [[Farrukhsiyar|Emperor Farrukhsiyar]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of India Vol.IV |page=353}}</ref> At his death his dominions included the entire Doab from Koil in the North, to Kora in the South, including 
all of Farrukhabad and parts of Cawnpore, Shahjahanpur, Budaun and Aligarh.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.khyber.org/history/a/mohammad_khan_bangash.shtml | title=Mohammad Khan Bangash}}</ref>

In [[Bundelkhand]], [[Chhatrasal]] had rebelled against the [[Mughal Empire]] and established an independent kingdom. In December 1728, a Mughal force led by the distinguished commander Muhammad Khan Bangash defeated him, and imprisoned his family. Chhatrasal had repeatedly sought Bajirao's assistance, but the latter was busy in Malwa at that time.

In March 1729, the Peshwa ([[Bajirao]] Ballad) finally responded to Chhatrasal's request and marched towards Bundelkhand. Chhatrasal also escaped his captivity and joined the Maratha forces. After they marched to [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]], as a result Bangash retreated.<ref name="GSC_2005">{{cite book |author=G.S.Chhabra |title=Advance Study in the History of Modern India (Volume-1: 1707-1803) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UkDi6rVbckoC&pg=PA19 |date=1 January 2005 |publisher=Lotus Press |isbn=978-81-89093-06-8 |pages=19–28 }}</ref>
