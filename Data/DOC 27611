:({{Find sources|Alexa Olvera}})
This article has been deleted as a hoax on the [https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Olvera Spanish] and [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Olvera French] Wikipedias, and the [[WP:SPA|SPA]] author is [[:es:Especial:Contribuciones/Pedorra_Necaxista|indef-blocked]] on his home (Spanish) WP. The only reference provided does not mention the subject, and I find no confirmation by searches. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 08:04, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' No encyclopedic information available, and nothing to verify the subject exists, so notability cannot be established. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 11:19, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - This may be a hoax, borderline CSD#G3.  I found nothing that indicates otherwise.  [[User:Dennis Brown|<b>Dennis&nbsp;Brown</b>]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[User talk:Dennis Brown|2¢]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[WP:WikiProject Editor Retention|<small>WER</small>]] 13:46, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as inadequately sourced, even if not a hoax.  [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] ([[User talk:Robert McClenon|talk]]) 19:49, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Unsourced BLP, if not hoax; sole EL is a dead end. [[User:Miniapolis|'''''<span style="color:navy">Mini</span>''''']][[User_talk:Miniapolis|'''''<span style="color:#8B4513">apolis</span>''''']] 20:55, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Has no sources to back up any of its claims, as a BLP. ~ [[User:Missionedit|Anastasia ]] ([[User talk:Missionedit|talk]]) 00:29, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
