==Managerial career==

Kristjánsson took charge of Icelandic premier league team Fram on 30 June 2004, replacing [[Ion Geolgău]]. The club was bottom of the league when Kristjánsson took over, but eventually the club managed to avoid relegation. Kristjánsson was in charge again for the 2005 season, but left the club after relegation.

On 6 July 2006 Kristjánsson was appointed manager of [[Breiðablik UBK]], finishing the season in 5th place. Over the next few years the club went to become a regular title contender. In 2009 the club won its first big title in history with a win in the Icelandic Cup. The following year the team won the Icelandic Premier League for the first time.

In April 2014 it was announced that Kristjánsson would take over as head coach of [[FC Nordsjælland]] in July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=isl/news/newsid=2095444.html|title=Breidablik's Kristjánsson excited by Nordsjælland|publisher=uefa.com|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> He led the club to a 6th place in his first season as manager. On 15 December he was sacked following a takeover of the club.<ref>[http://fcn.dk/2015/12/fc-nordsjaelland-faar-nye-ejere-og-skifter-cheftraener/ FC Nordsjælland får nye ejere og skifter cheftræner], [[FC Nordsjælland]], 15 December 2015</ref>

In the summer of 2016 he became new manager of [[Randers FC]] in the [[Danish Superliga]]. He managed the club until October 2017, when he left by mutual consent.<ref>[http://sport.tv2.dk/fodbold/2017-10-05-randers-fc-skifter-cheftraener/ Randers FC skifter cheftræner], [[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]], 5 October 2017</ref>
