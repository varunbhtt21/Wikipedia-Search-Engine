As a speedy and a prod were declined, I am nominating this for deletion. It fails [[Wikipedia:ORG]] by a large margin.

This article is confuse, as it starts hinting to the [[Rif War]] against the Spanish-French in the early 1920s led by Abdelkrim, and which wasn't a secessionist movement but rather a resistance movement. (That is the mainstream view in scholarly literature)  

The "Rif Independence Movement" is probably a non-existent organisation (it doesn't even has a serious website, with address, phone number etc, let alone being mentioned in RS). The "Organization of Emerging African States", to which the movement supposedly belongs, is itself non-notable ([https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366&bih=664&tbm=nws&q=%22Organization+of+Emerging+African+States%22&oq=%22Organization+of+Emerging+African+States%22&gs_l=serp.3...3339.5353.0.5583.2.2.0.0.0.0.286.503.2-2.2.0....0...1c.1.42.serp..2.0.0.1dN8P5RLyf0 0 hits in Google news]) and probably not even existent off the web

Outside the (trivial) mention on the "OEAS", the movement does not have a known leader or any mention (even trivial) in any RS. Its [http://rif.livenations.net/ supposed website] is as generic as to suspect an instance of [[WP:HOAX]] [[User:Tachfin|Tachfin]] ([[User talk:Tachfin|talk]]) 08:25, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:'''Addendum''': Also note that the page has been deleted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Rif+Independence+Movement twice before] and its creator  [[user:Rifnation]] received a [[Wikipedia:ORGNAME|causeblock]]. --[[User:Tachfin|Tachfin]] ([[User talk:Tachfin|talk]]) 08:40, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*<s>Keep and improve</s> - I added sources to the article. The topic is based upon a movement and organization that originated in Morocco during the 1920s. In Morocco, the organization was revitalized in 2013. The organization is presently a member of the Organization of Emerging African States (see [http://www.scribd.com/doc/155144338/The-Rif-Independence-Movement-Joins-OEAS]), and it is most certainly not a "hoax".

:::Don't you think that's too light? Where is coverage in RS? --[[User:Tachfin|Tachfin]] ([[User talk:Tachfin|talk]]) 08:40, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
::::See book sources in the article. However, I'm fine with a merge (see below). [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 09:03, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' to [[List of active separatist movements in Africa]]. This would work for me. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 09:02, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' and pick up the other "OEAS" members if they are significant.  All&nbsp;the&nbsp;best: ''[[User:Rich Farmbrough|Rich]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Rich Farmbrough|Farmbrough]]'',&nbsp;<small>12:03,&nbsp;4&nbsp;May&nbsp;2014&nbsp;(UTC).</small><br />
