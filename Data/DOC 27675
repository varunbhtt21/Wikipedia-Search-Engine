* <s>... that although '''[[Harutiun Djangulian]]''' ''(pictured)'' was killed during the [[Armenian Genocide]], he was once sentenced to death earlier in his life?</s>
:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did_you_know_nominations/Tharanga_Goonetilleke]]
<small>Created by [[User:EtienneDolet|EtienneDolet]] ([[User talk:EtienneDolet|talk]]). Self nominated at 08:42, 4 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:*[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] Length and date verified. Offline/Armenian-language sources accepted on good faith. I also was able to check one of the details (Djangulian's means of death) via Google Books. Good to go. - [[User:Biruitorul|Biruitorul]] <small><sup>[[User talk:Biruitorul|Talk]]</sup></small> 13:58, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The first paragraph under [[Kum Kapu demonstration]] needs a cite per [[Wikipedia:Did you know/Supplementary guidelines#Other supplementary rules for the article|Rule D2]].
::*The hook doesn't make sense. Why "although"? If he hadn't been killed, would the death sentence have held? The article says his death sentence was commuted to life in exile. How about:
::*'''ALT1''':<s> ... that '''[[Harutiun Djangulian]]''' ''(pictured)'' launched the 1890 [[Kum Kapu demonstration]] by interrupting [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and reading a declaration of sympathy towards the maltreatment of [[Armenians]] from the altar?</s> [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 22:18, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::{{ping|Yoninah}} I find that hook too long which may not appeal the reader as much. Let's try:
:::*'''ALT2''':<s> ... that '''[[Harutiun Djangulian]]''' ''(pictured)'', a leader of the [[Kum Kapu demonstration]], was arrested and subsequently executed during the [[Armenian Genocide]]?</s>
::::*We have run so many [[Armenian Genocide]] hooks about rape, murder, and genocide over the past few months that ALT2 isn't novel or interesting, IMO. You could shorten ALT 2 ...
::::*'''ALT3''':<s> ... that [[Armenians|Armenian]] activist '''[[Harutiun Djangulian]]''' ''(pictured)'' launched the [[Kum Kapu demonstration]] by stepping on the [[altar]] and interrupting [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]?</s>
::::*... or suggest something else. Please remember about the cite. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 23:49, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::{{ping|Yoninah}} I prefer ALT1 at this point. [[User:EtienneDolet|Étienne Dolet]] ([[User talk:EtienneDolet|talk]]) 04:19, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]] OK, but I can't review my own hook. Could another reviewer sign off on this please? I also added a "citation needed" tag where a paragraph needs a ref. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 10:39, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::*Here's a shorter version of ALT1:
:::::::*'''ALT4''': ... that [[Armenians|Armenian]] activist '''[[Harutiun Djangulian]]''' ''(pictured)'' launched the 1890 [[Kum Kapu demonstration]] by interrupting a mass and reading a declaration from the altar? [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 10:56, 8 May 2014 (UTC) 

[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  I'm fine with ALT4. Reviewer needed. [[User:EtienneDolet|Étienne Dolet]] ([[User talk:EtienneDolet|talk]]) 19:25, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
:* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] Full review '''for ALT4'''. New enough (for 4 May) and long enough. Hook supported by offline citation #6, taken AGF. QPQ OK. Hook image is free. Images in article are free. No problems with disambig links or with external links. As far as I can see, all issues in above discussion are now resolved. This is a worthwhile article; congratulations. Good to go.--[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 14:09, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
