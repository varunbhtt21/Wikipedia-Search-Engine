The '''Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union''' ({{lang-ar|الاتحاد الإسلامي لأجناد الشام}}, ''al-ittihad al-islami li-ajnad al-sham'', "Islamic Union of the Soldiers of the [[Levant]]") was an alliance of Islamist groups that was active in the [[Syrian Civil War]].<ref name=ceip5march/>

==History==
In early November 2013, a large number of Islamist rebel groups in the wider Damascus region announced the formation of the “Greater Damascus Operations Room”, excluding [[Jaysh al-Islam]] and the most radical jihadis [[al-Nusra Front]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].<ref name=ceip4march/> Later that month, five of the larger and most locally well-established groups within in the Operations Room - the al-Habib al-Mustafa Brigades, the Amjad al-Islam Gathering, the Sahaba Brigades and Battalions, the Shabab al-Houda Battalions and the Der al-Asima Brigade - declared the creation of the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union.<ref name=ceip4march/>

On 18 February 2016, its fighters based in eastern [[Ghouta]] announced the "full incorporation" of its fighters into [[al-Rahman Legion]], though reiterating that its fighters based in the western Damascus suburbs of [[Darayya]] and [[Muadamiyat al-Sham|Moadammiyyeh]] as well as in southern Damascus would still operate under the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union banner and were not a part of this merger.<ref name="albinszakola">{{cite web|url=https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/NewsReports/566633-damascus-rebels-merge-amid-jaysh-al-islam-intimidation|title=Damascus rebels merge amid Jaysh al-Islam "intimidation"|author=Albin  Szakola|date=19 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref>

On 26 February 2016, Syrian Army Special Forces killed the second leader of Ajnad al-Sham, Faysal al-Shami ("Abu Malek") after intense clashes in the Darayya Association Quarter.<ref name="leader"/>

On 19 March 2017, its Idlib branch merged with [[Sham Legion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShamLegion/status/843410923545137152|title=فيلق الشام on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> These fighters represented the individuals that left [[Darayya]] and [[Muadamiyat al-Sham|Moadammiyyeh]] between August and October 2016 as part of the evacuation deal to [[Idlib]], thus reducing their presence to two pockets in the [[Damascus Governorate]] and [[Rif Dimashq Governorate]] areas.

After the completion of the [[Beit Jinn offensive]] in January 2018 and the [[Southern Damascus offensive (January–February 2018)|Southern Damascus offensive]] the following month, Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union presence was further reduced to a single pocket on the Southern [[Damascus Governorate]] and its outskirt.

In May 2018, the remaining members [[Southern Damascus offensive (April–May 2018)|evacuated]] to Idlib. Following the evacuation, the groups appeared to cease being active.
