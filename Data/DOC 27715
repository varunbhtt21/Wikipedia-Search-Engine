{{Coord|49.043|-110.703|display=title}}

'''Milk River Natural Area''' is a provincially designated [[protected area]] in the southeastern corner of the province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], approximately 160&nbsp;km south of the city of [[Medicine Hat]]. It lies primarily in the [[Forty Mile County No. 8, Alberta|County of Forty Mile]] with a small portion in southwest [[Cypress County]]. On the [[Alberta Township System]] (ATS) grid it is located in portions of Township 1, Range 5 and 6, and Township 2, Range 6, west of the Fourth Meridian.

At 5,344 ha (13,205 acres), Milk River was designated in June 1987 as an Order-in-Council Natural Area for conservation purposes under the Wilderness Areas, Ecological Reserves, Natural Areas and Heritage Rangelands Act and is Alberta's 100th Natural Area.<ref name=autogenerated5>Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation. Milk River Natural Area. (Online) http://www.albertaparks.ca/milk-river.aspx. Accessed April 9, 2014.</ref> It is owned by the provincial government as Public Land and administered by the Cypress District Office of [[Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation]]. Milk River Natural Area sits on the international border with the [[United States]] with [[Montana]] to the south, and is adjacent to the Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve to the west, with Pinhorn Provincial Grazing Reserve just beyond Kennedy Coulee. Other protected areas nearby include the Onefour Heritage Rangeland, [[Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park]], and [[Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park]]. Access to Milk River Natural Area is challenging due to its remoteness and weather conditions: local roads and trails are impassable during or after wet weather, there is little to no cell phone coverage, and permission must be obtained when crossing grazing lease areas.<ref>Berndt, Darwyn. Resource Management Coordinator, Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation (personal communications April 2014).</ref> However, this has helped maintain the area's relatively undisturbed condition and protected it from significant human impact. [[Canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, and [[Inflatable boat|inflatable rafts]] on float trips occasionally ply the waters of the Milk River through the Natural Area. While "[[Leave No Trace|no-trace]]" camping is permitted, it is not encouraged, and there are no visitor facilities provided.

== Natural and human history ==
Geologically, the Milk River Natural Area is part of the [[Oldman Formation|Oldman]] and [[Foremost Formation|Foremost]] Formations, consisting of [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]], and carbonaceous [[shale]], with isolated occurrences of [[Igneous rock|igneous]] Sweetgrass Hills [[Intrusion|intrusives]].<ref name=autogenerated2>Milk River Watershed Council Canada. 2013.

(personal communications April 2014).</ref> One of only five exposed igneous dikes in the Canadian plains, nicknamed the "Rooster Comb" for its distinctive size and shape, lies in the natural area. The Milk River itself is the only river in Alberta that flows to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], joining the [[Missouri River]] near [[Nashua, Montana]]. Throughout the region lie a multitude of [[Cretaceous]]-era [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s, as well as many archaeological sites, a legacy of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] indigenous people who hunted, gathered, and camped in the area prior to European contact.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Findings of [[projectile point]]s indicate the area has likely been sporadically inhabited since the end of the last [[glacial period|glaciation]].<ref name=autogenerated7 />

== Ecology ==
The Milk River Natural Area is part of the [[Grassland]]s Natural Region, one of six natural regions in Alberta.<ref name=autogenerated11>Natural Regions Committee 2006. Natural Regions and Subregions of Alberta. Compiled by D. J. Downing and W.W. Pettapiece. Government of Alberta. Pub. No. I/005.</ref> Within the Grasslands Region, it is part of the Dry Mixedgrass Natural Subregion, characterized by the most arid conditions in Alberta, with hot summers, cold winters with little snow cover, and high evaporation leaving a large moisture deficit in the growing season.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated11 /> Annual precipitation averages less than 300mm (12 inches). Soils of the area are primarily solonetzic and brown chernozemic.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated12>Powell, G. L. and A. P. Russell. 1991.

Northwestern Naturalist '''72:'''21-26.</ref> At the next sub-level, it is part of the Northwestern Glaciated Plains [[Ecoregion]], the predominant ecoregion throughout the Milk River [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. With its diverse landscape of [[grassland]]s, shrubs, [[badlands]], [[wetland]]s, and [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands, the Milk River Natural Area supports a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species in a relatively small amount of space. Overall, 80% of Alberta's species at risk are concentrated in the Milk River Watershed area as a whole.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Fire is a significant ecological process, with the last large wildfire having occurred in August 2007. It was caused by a lightning strike in Montana and crossed the international border, but was quickly suppressed after burning 125 hectares of the natural area and 38 hectares in neighboring Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> As a relatively large and undisturbed representation of natural mixedgrass containing rare or unique landforms, habitat for focal species, and intact riparian areas, it has been identified as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) with national significance.<ref>Fiera Biological Consulting. 2009. Environmentally Significant Areas, Provincial Update 2009. Report prepared for Alberta Parks, Tourism and Recreation, Parks Division. Edmonton, Alberta.</ref>

== Flora ==
The diverse terrain and soils of the Milk River Natural Area lend themselves to a large variety of plant communities. In the protected area, aside from non-vegetated badlands, the primary vegetation cover is dry mixed grassland, with the dominant species being needle-and-thread (''Hesperostipa comate'') and [[Bouteloua gracilis|blue grama grass]] (''Bouteloua gracilis'').<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated11 /> Other grassland species associated with the area include northern wheat grass (''Agropyron dasystachyum''), [[Pascopyrum|western wheat grass]] (''Pascopyrum smithii''), [[Koeleria macrantha|prairie june grass]] (''Koeleria macrantha''), [[Poa secunda|sandberg bluegrass]] (''Poa sandbergii'') and various sedge species.<ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref>Allen, L. 2013.

Accessed April 13, 2014.</ref> The flood plains surrounding the river contain large stands of [[plains cottonwood]] (''Populus deltoides'') and [[sagebrush]] flats. [[Phlox subulata|Moss phlox]] (''Phlox subulata'') and [[Selaginella densa|prairie selaginella]] (''Selaginella densa'') are common forbs. Complex but often sparse vegetation communities adjusted to harsh conditions exist at the border between coulees and grasslands and feature species such as mosses, lichens, [[Sarcobatus vermiculatus|black greasewood]] (''Sarcobatus vermiculatus''), [[Chrysothamnus nauseosus|rabbitbrush]] (''Chrysothamnus nauseosus''), long-leaved sage, sagebrush (''Artemisia frigida''), and [[Monolepis nuttalliana|povertyweed]] (''Monolepis nuttalliana'').<ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated6>Eastern Slopes Rangeland Seeds Ltd. 2011.

== Fauna ==

=== Amphibians and reptiles ===
With its combination of grassland, riparian habitat, coulees and badlands, the Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve host a variety of amphibians and reptiles, including rare [[northern leopard frog]]s (''Rana pipiens''), listed as threatened in Alberta and both a Canadian species at risk (SARA) and Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) species of special concern, as well as [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnake]] (''Crotalus viridis''), [[Pituophis catenifer sayi|bullsnake]] (''Pituophis catenifer sayi''), [[Heterodon nasicus|western hognose snake]] (''Heterodon nasicus''), [[Chrysemys picta|western painted turtle]] (''Chrysemys picta''), [[Plains Garter Snake|garter snake]] (''Thamnophis radix''), and the nationally and provincially endangered<ref name=autogenerated8>Government of Canada.

=== Birds ===
The natural area, which has been named as an [[Important Bird Area]],<ref name=autogenerated5 /> is studded with cliffs and eroded sandstone badlands that serve as important nesting and foraging habitat to the area's raptors. Important [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] are the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), [[ferruginous hawk]] (''Buteo regalis''), [[prairie falcon]] (''Falco mexicanus''), and [[burrowing owl]] (''Athene cunicularia''), of which the burrowing owl and ferruginous hawk are considered endangered in Alberta, and the prairie falcon, a species of special concern.<ref name=autogenerated9 /><ref>Fish and Wildlife Division. 2008.

Sharp-tailed grouse also appear to be declining in Alberta and are considered a sensitive species due to the increase of land-use conversion to agriculture.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

=== Mammals ===
Until the late 1800s, large herds of [[bison]] grazed the area until they were extirpated by human hunting, and cattle have — to a degree — taken their place as grazers, maintaining the grassland ecosystem in a mix of grazed and ungrazed patches.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> [[Pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra Americana'') and [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus'') are also present on the grasslands along with [[Peromyscus|deer mice]], voles, and Richardson's ground squirrel, an important food source for the ferruginous hawk and occasional burrow host to the burrowing owl.

The badlands area of habitat in the Milk River Natural Area is host to [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus''), listed as sensitive, and [[scorpion]]s (''Paruroctonus boreus'').

=== Fish ===
The area features three rare fish species: the venomous [[stonecat]] (''Noturus flavus''), the only catfish species in Alberta, St. Mary's Sculpin (''Cottus bairdi punctulatus''), and the western silvery minnow (''Hybognathus argyritis'').<ref name=autogenerated3 /> All three are under threatened status in Alberta,<ref name=autogenerated15>Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development. 2012. Species Assessed by Alberta's Endangered Species Conservation Committee: Short List.

Accessed April 8, 2014.</ref> and the western silvery minnow was upgraded to endangered in Canada by COSEWIC in April 2008.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> Their greatest threats are habitat alteration or loss, changes in water flow or drought water levels, increased [[siltation]], elevated water temperatures, surface water extraction, dam construction, and for the western silvery minnow, introduction of predatory fish species.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

=== Invertebrates ===
[[Limenitis weidemeyerii|Weidemeyer's admiral butterfly]] (''Limenitis weidemeyerii'') is only known to exist in Canada within the Milk River watershed,<ref name=autogenerated3 /> as well as the yucca moth mentioned previously.<ref name=autogenerated10>Alberta Sustainable Resource Development and Alberta Conservation Association. 2005.

== Environmental threats and issues ==
Elements of concern to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native species reintroduction, human recreational (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The [[Carduus nutans|nodding thistle weed]] (''Carduus nutans'') was discovered in the area in 2006.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive [[downy brome]] (''Bromus tectorum''), [[Alopecurus arundinaceus|creeping meadow foxtail]] (''Alopecurus arundinaceus''), [[Agropyron cristatum|crested wheatgrass]] (''Agropyron cristatum''), and [[Elaeagnus angustifolia|Russian olive]] (''Elaeagnus angustifolia''). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated6 /> Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, windbreak, and ornamental, reduces [[biodiversity]] of riparian areas.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

== Management ==
Once belonging to the Lost River Ranch lease, the land that now comprises the Milk River Natural Area was grazed infrequently and was therefore deleted from the grazing lease under the Public Lands Act in 1978 and 1979.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Some resource exploration has occurred over the years and several wells were drilled but have subsequently been abandoned. [[Coal]] was also briefly mined but due to the area's remoteness was also abandoned. The Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve were established with the intent "to protect and maintain the ecological and aesthetic character of a representative example of the Mixed Grassland Natural Region with minimal human interference;" specifically, protecting ecological diversity and processes, native species and habitats, rare and significant natural features, recreation, education, and scientific research.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Management interference is intended to be minimal and "let nature take its course" wherever possible, while managing some ecological processes such as fires and controlled grazing. A balance of grazing regimes is important to maintain the combination of short and medium grasses defining the dry mixedgrass natural subregion. Cattle do not graze in the same way as the now-extirpated bison did, but have been used to simulate natural processes.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Grazing management maintains the grassland ecosystem in its climax state, but overgrazing must be avoided to prevent soil [[erosion]] and loss of biodiversity.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> Rangeland health assessments aid this goal by periodically evaluating the area's ecosystem health, including measuring factors such as grazing intensity, weed occurrence, species composition, site stability, and soil and plant health. The 2011 rangeland survey concluded that the Milk River Natural Area overall is in excellent health and meeting its management goals, and that plant community health and grazing management were found to be far exceeding provincial standards.<ref name=autogenerated6 />

Fires have historically been a vital component of the grassland ecosystem, but pose a threat to human life and property. In the Milk River Natural Area, management policy is suppression of wildfires, with prescribed controlled burns allowed for ecosystem maintenance purposes to manage the grassland in its climax state.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> Campfires are permitted but discouraged. Following the 2007 wildfire, inventories were conducted which showed an increase in species richness<ref name=autogenerated6 /> and also good recovery of native species with little invasion of exotics.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Invasive weed species that have been found in the area, such as nodding thistle, are being controlled by spot spraying and hand picking. Larger species like the Russian olive are cut down and spot-treated.

Recreational vehicle use also bears monitoring, as [[all-terrain vehicles]] (ATV's) and larger vehicles can damage streambeds and tear up fragile vegetation. Public vehicles are prohibited south and west of the existing trail system and from the river bottom and badlands areas, and from the ecological reserve altogether, except for management purposes and fire protection, or education and non-destructive research.<ref name=autogenerated7 />

In addition to the Milk River itself being an occasional destination for paddle sports, other recreational uses of the area include hunting and camping, which bring their own potential impacts on the environment and the area's species at risk. Fire especially is a risk from unattended campfires. Close approach by humans to ferruginous hawk nests will flush them and can eventually cause nest abandonment.<ref>Keeley, W. H., and M. J. Bechard. 2011. Flushing distances of ferruginous hawks nesting in rural and exurban New Mexico. Journal of Wildlife Management '''75:'''1034-1039.</ref><ref>White, C. M., and T. L. Thurow. 1985. Reproduction of ferruginous hawks exposed to controlled disturbance. The Condor '''87:'''14-22.</ref> Hunting and/or ammunition restrictions could reduce lead poisoning in golden eagles, possibly caused by ingesting [[lead]] shot in their prey.<ref>Wayland, M., and T. Bollinger. 1999. Lead exposure and poisoning in bald eagles and golden eagles in the Canadian prairie provinces. Environmental Pollution '''104:'''341-350.</ref>

Reintroduction of extirpated native species, such as the swift fox, is another issue that must be balanced with the needs and tolerances of existing species. Other extirpated species that formerly occupied the grasslands were the [[bison]] (''Bison bison''), [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') and [[grizzly bear]] (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), which may not be feasible to reintroduce due to cost and potential conflict with humans. Educational and scientific pursuits require guidelines and permits to protect the landscape from inadvertent damage such as collection of rare species or archaeological samples. Extraction of natural resources such as minerals, gas, oil, and coal are incompatible with the management intent of the protected area, as are linear developments such as roads, pipelines and power lines. As such, only freehold areas may be explored for resource extraction, and no new linear developments are planned;<ref name=autogenerated7 /> however, construction of a viewing area is being considered to limit and concentrate public access to an approved and controlled area.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Fencing and signage, used for public safety and resource protection, are also kept to a minimum.<ref name=autogenerated7 />

Currently, the human population of the Milk River watershed area — already rural with a population density of under .5 persons per square kilometer — is decreasing due to factors such as an aging population, the decline of small-scale farming, loss of community services such as hospitals and schools, and lack of job opportunities.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> This lack of population pressure, along with the inaccessibility of the Milk River Natural Area and the management plan followed by Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation, helps to maintain the ecological integrity of the protected area.
