This appears to be about some place. Normally I don't nominate these articles for deletion (in fact, I'm reluctant to nominate this one), as I believe that populated places are notable, but the article is so poorly written it's better to [[WP:TNT|just start all over]].

*'''KEEP''' The article is actually about a populated place and it isn't so big that it can't be tidied and made better.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 09:19, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - as above. This is clearly a real settlement, which is all that needs to be demonstrated. Doubtless there are paper sources. Nom's initial reluctance to nominate was correct!  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Eustachiusz|contribs]]) 15:39, 21 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
