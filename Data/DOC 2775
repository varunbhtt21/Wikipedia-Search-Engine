;Military Division
;For Gallantry
*Able Seaman George Willet Harrison. ''Citation:'' "On the occasion of a bad accident that occurred on board [[HMS Hood|H.M.S. ''Hood'']] at Portsmouth on the 15th February, 1930, when Dockyard workmen were engaged in opening up for inspection the starboard after bulge compartments, a Shipwright named Langford entered through the manhole into a compartment contaminated with carbon monoxide and was overcome and collapsed. He was alive when brought out but died without recovering consciousness. As soon as the alarm was given a rescue party entered the bulge, but found great difficulty in locating Langford owing to the very bad atmosphere and the absence of effective lighting. The party had gas-masks but these were ineffective against carbon monoxide gas. Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, Able Seaman Harrison made his way through successive compartments and at great personal risk, continued his search and, with assistance, eventually brought Langford out. On being brought out, Harrison himself was in a state of collapse."
