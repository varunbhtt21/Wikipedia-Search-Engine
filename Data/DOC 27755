'''''Achtste-groepers huilen niet''''' (English: ''Eighth Graders Don't Cry'', also known as ''Kule Kidz Gråter Ikke'', ''Cool Kids Don't Cry'') is a 1999 Dutch children's book by [[Jacques Vriens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=En av vinterens store norske barnefilmer handler om kreftsyke Anja (12|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/10/23/kultur/barnefilm/kule_kidz_grater_ikke/katarine_launing/film/29927446/|publisher=Dag Bladet|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> The book was first published in September 1999 as ''Achtste-groepers huilen niet'' and has since been translated into Norwegian and German.

==Synopsis==
Akki is a happy-go-lucky sixth grader that's obsessed with soccer, her friends, and the upcoming school trip. She's known for being tough and always up for a challenge, so when Akki is diagnosed with [[leukemia]] she refuses to let it slow her down. Her classmates are in shock, but Akki refuses to allow them to treat her as if she were broken. As time passes it becomes clear that her illness is very far progressed and it becomes harder for Akki to do everything she wants to do in the time she has left.

==Background==
Vriens, who formerly worked as a schoolteacher, drew inspiration for the book from one of his students named Anke, who suffered from [[leukemia]].<ref name=NRK>{{cite web|title=Forteller historien om virkelighetens "Anja"|url=http://www.nrk.no/kultur/litteratur/skrev-bok-om-virkelighetens-_anja_-1.11461116|publisher=NRK|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> One of his students joked that he should write about Anke, to which the girl eagerly agreed. After she died in 1991 Vriens had difficulty approaching the subject matter, but Anke's mother encouraged him to write the book.<ref name=NRK /> It took him several times before he could begin writing, as the story was deeply personal to him and he would grow sad when he knew that the book's main character of Akki would have to die.<ref name=NRK /> To distance himself from the work, Vriens changed the name of the book's main character and made Akki's teacher female instead of male.<ref name=NRK />

==Adaptations==
''Achtste-groepers huilen niet'' has been adapted for the screen twice. The first adaptation was the 2012 Dutch film ''[[Achtste Groepers Huilen Niet]]'', which starred Hanna Obbeek as the main character of Akkie. It was nominated for several awards and won a 2012 ''[[Golden Film|Golden Film Award]]'', a 2012 ''[[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calf Audience Award]]'', and the 2012 ''[[Rembrandt Award]] for Best Dutch Youth Film''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wederom prijzen voor ‘Achtste-Groepers Huilen Niet’|url=http://www.nbf.nl/2013/02/11/wederom-prijzen-voor-%E2%80%98achtste-groepers-huilen-niet/|publisher=NBF|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ACHTSTE-GROEPERS HUILEN NIET |url=http://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/over-nff/filmprijzen/gouden-films/achtste-groepers-huilen-niet/ |publisher=Nederlands Film Festival |accessdate=4 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504143307/http://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/over-nff/filmprijzen/gouden-films/achtste-groepers-huilen-niet/ |archivedate=4 May 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rembrandt Awards winnaar is ‘Alles Is Familie’|url=http://radio.nl/778247/rembrandt-awards-winnaar-is-alles-is-familie|publisher=Radio.nl|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> The second adaptation was the 2014 Norwegian ''[[Kule Kidz Gråter Ikke]]'', which was also a remake of the 2012 Dutch film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sørensen|first=Britt|title=Bøller i blodet|url=http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/Boller-i-blodet-3035847.html|publisher=Bergens Tidende|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>
