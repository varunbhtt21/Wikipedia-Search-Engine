The A-38 was a large [[iceberg]] that split from the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]] in [[Antarctica]] in 1998. The iceberg, more than 144&nbsp;km long and 48&nbsp;km wide, was the largest iceberg that had been observed in a decade.<ref name="IOTD">{{cite web|title=The A38-B Iceberg Splits|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=4423|accessdate=24 April 2014|author=[[NASA]]|date=April 24, 2004}}</ref>

==Split of A-38B==
By October 22, 1998, A-38B had started to break off the original iceberg. The pieces drifted about {{convert|1500|nmi|km}} north to around [[South Georgia Island]] in the South Atlantic. On April 12, 2004, the A-38B iceberg was about {{convert|25|nmi|km}} long. The next time [[Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer|MODIS]] flew over the iceberg on 15 April, A-38B had broken in half. By 17-18 April, the eastern half of the iceberg had moved quickly north and turned west. The western half of the iceberg seemed to stay in place. Another section of the A-38 iceberg, A-39D, was covered in meltwater ponds as it drifted past South Georgia Island in late January 2004, the height of the summer in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name="IOTD" />
