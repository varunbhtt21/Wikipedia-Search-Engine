Title : Ngong Road
Text : '''Ngong Road''' is a major [[road]] in [[Kenya]] that links the city of [[Nairobi]] to [[Ngong, Kenya|Ngong]] town. It runs from the Nairobi [[central business district]] all the way to the [[Ngong Stadium]], passing by major places in Nairobi and Ngong such as the [[Kenyatta National Hospital]], [[The Junction (shopping mall)|The Junction Mall]], the Lang'ata Road roundabout in [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]] and the [[Ngong Market]].

The road is currently a standard [[carriageway]] with two traffic lanes, but the [[Government of Kenya|Kenyan government]] plans to turn the road into a four-lane [[dual carriageway]] by February 2015, with financing from the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]], at a cost of [[Kenya shilling|Ksh.]] 1.68 billion (approx. [[United States dollar|US$]]19.35 million, [[Pound sterling|£]]11.47 million or [[Euro|€]]13.95 million),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanbuilding.com/index.php/ngong-road-dual-carriage-way-project-widening-of-ngong-road|title=Ngong Road Dual-Carriage Way Project: Widening of Ngong Road|publisher=AfricanBuilding.com|accessdate=4 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504140421/http://www.africanbuilding.com/index.php/ngong-road-dual-carriage-way-project-widening-of-ngong-road|archivedate=4 May 2014|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionkenya.com/2545/ngong-road-expansion/|title=Ngong Road expansion project to start soon|author=Miriam Kirote|publisher=ConstructionKenya.com |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> as part the [[Kenya Vision 2030|Vision 2030]] project.
