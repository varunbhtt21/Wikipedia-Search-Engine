The article provides no information regarding the principal photography of the film. It's a [[WP:TOOSOON]] case. [[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 09:52, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' and allow improvements to this article through regular editing. I wrote [[WP:NYF|WP:TOOSOON]] and an adressable lack of content is a reason to [[WP:SOFIXIT|add and improve]] such, not delete (See: [[WP:WIP]], [[WP:IMPROVE]], [[WP:SURMOUNTABLE]] and [[WP:UGLY]]]).  Rather thana "delete", a possible '''redirect''' is a consideration for a '''very''' short while to director [[Abhishek Kapoor]] where policy and guideline instruct that this sourcable topic may be discussed. And not having begun filming is NOT a reason to delete a topic if notability [[WP:GNG|per guideline]] can still be determined. We look at available sources and decide if coverage of production as instructed in [[WP:NFF|WP:NFF (paragraph 3)]] is met. This one may be a very close call to some, but [[WP:GNG]] is our basis for notability ss supported by [[WP:SPECULATION|policy]].[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/aditya-roy-kapur-in-fitoor-opposite-katrina-kaif/1/319872.html ''India Today''] [http://www.mid-day.com/articles/katrina-kaif-aditya-roy-kapurs-film-fitoor-shelved/15084053 ''Mid-Day'']  [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Katrina-Adityas-film-Fitoor-shelved/articleshow/30155256.cms ''Times of India'']  [http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/no-fitoor-for-sushant-singh-rajput/1/316585.html ''India Today'']  [http://www.indiaglitz.com/aditya-roy-kapoor-puts-end-to-fitoor-rumours-hindi-news-103622 ''India Glitz'']  [http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/why-was-katrina-kaif-aditya-roy-kapur-starrer-fitoor-shelved/ ''Bollywood Life'']  [http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-aditya-roy-kapur-katrina-kaif-to-pair-up-for-fitoor-1907698 ''DNA'']  [http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/katrina-kaif-aditya-roy-kapur-to-play-desi-estella-pip-in-fitoor-436328 ''NDTV'']  [http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/has-aditya-roy-kapur-replaced-sushant-singh-rajput-in-fitoor/ ''Bollywood Life'']  [http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-aditya-kapoor-to-replace-abhishek-kapoors-protege-sushant-singh-rajput-in-fitoor-1905081 ''DNA'']   Thanks, '''[[User:MichaelQSchmidt|<font color="blue">Schmidt, </font>]]''' ''[[User talk:MichaelQSchmidt|<sup><small>Michael Q.</small></sup>]]'' 07:42, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

:'''Keep''' - My personal view of [[WP:TOOSOON]] is in-line with [[User:MichaelQSchmidt|Schmidt's]]. Not sure if the film as gone into principal shooting yet, but its coverage in reliable sources makes it pass [[WP:GNG]] in my eyes. <b>~<i><font color="#07517C">[[User:SuperHamster|Super]]</font></i><font color="#6FA23B">[[User:SuperHamster|Hamster]]</font></b> <small>[[User talk:SuperHamster|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/SuperHamster|Contribs]]</small> 22:44, 18 May 2014 (UTC)
