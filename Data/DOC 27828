Jacob van der Kerckhoven is believed to have started his career as a painter of landscapes and genre scenes. He soon developed a successful career as a specialist painter of fruit still lifes, hunting still lifes, game still lifes and scenes of animals.<ref name=rkd/>  He had a particular interest in scenes and still lifes of fowl.<ref name=pit/> He created his personal repertoire of small animals, including ducks, turkeys and even guinea pigs, accompanied by vegetables, fruits, vegetables and other popular foods, of great simplicity.

His work shows the influence of the Flemish and Italian schools of still life painting.  From his Flemish training he retained an accurate precision in the description of details and qualities, both in animals and fruits or other foods. The Italian influence reveals itself in the bright Italian light, which he often tempered by the use of [[chiaroscuro]].  He painted large and ambitious compositions similar to those he had seen in the workshops of Antwerp and in the studio of his master Fyt while at the same time developing a personal language of almost naive charm.

Some of his compositions are in the very dynamic Flemish Baroque style of still life painting.  An example of this is ''[[: File:Jacob van der Kerckhoven - Birds and Beasts.jpg|The Battle of the birds and beasts]]'' (Collection of [[Burghley House]], Lincolnshire, England), which represents a dynamic whirlwind of violence.  At the same time he produced peaceful compositions, such as the ''[[:File:Jacob van der Kerckhoven - Still life of birds and fruit.jpg|Still life of birds and fruit]]'' (Auctioned at Setdart Subastas).  His compositions use zigzags to create dynamic effects, while objects accumulate without any clear form.<ref name=span/> 

Jacob van der Kerckhoven moved away from Fyt's style and developed a personal manner characterized by analytical drawing and brilliant colour. He used very oily paint and was highly skilled in rendering the play of reflections. His works shows stylistic links with Michelangelo Cerquozzi and Michele Pace del Campidoglio.  Contact with the work of [[Giovanni Battista Ruoppolo]] and also with Joseph Heintz the younger are reflected in his still-life paintings with fish as well as in the ''[[:File:Jacob van der Kerckhoven - Self-portrait.jpg|Self-portrait]]'' ([[Uffizi]], Florence), a rare example of his figure painting. There exist doubt as to whether certain works (such as the ''Still life with fruit'', [[Lower Saxony State Museum]], Hannover) were painted by him or by [[Giuseppe Recco]].<ref name=pit/>
