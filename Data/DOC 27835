===PSSA results history===
[[Pennsylvania System of School Assessment]]s, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]]. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/state_academic_standards/19721 |title=State Academic Standards |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2014}}</ref>

In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/state_assessment_system/20965 |title=State Assessment System |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2014}}</ref>

'''Science in Motion''' Milton Area High School took advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.<ref>The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012</ref> The program is provided locally by faculty at [[Susquehanna University]].

The class of 2016 must earn: English 4 credits, Math 4 credits, Science 4 credits, Social Studies 3 credits, Health 0.5 credit, Computer 0.5 credit, Career Exploration 0.5 credit, Physical Education 2 credits, Arts and Humanities 2 credits, Interdisciplinary Studies 2 credits and Electives 5.5 credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milton.k12.pa.us/services/guidance/pdf/9th_gr_2011-2012_course_descriptions.pdf |title=Milton Area School District student course selection handbook 2011-12 |author=Milton Area School District Administration |year=2011 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Prior to the changes, seniors needed 28 credits to graduate.  Before that in 2010, graduation required a total number of 25.5 credits earned within a four-year sequence consisting of ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades.
