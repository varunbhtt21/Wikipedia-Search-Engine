'''Ferries McDonald Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] located in the gazetted locality of [[Monarto South, South Australia|Monarto South]] about {{convert|10|km}} south-west of [[Murray Bridge, South Australia|Murray Bridge]].<ref name="HuttonConnors1999">{{cite book|author1=Drew Hutton|author2=Libby Connors|title=History of the Australian Environment Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlsbib7EN4AC&pg=PA73|date=13 April 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45686-9|pages=73–}}</ref> It covers an area of 845 hectares<ref name="Vaughn Wilson">Vaughn Wilson.

Ferries McDonald Conservation Park is open to the public. Walking trails and [[bird watching]] opportunities are the main attractions for visitors.<ref name="auto1">Trevor. (2006).

==History==
Much of the land surrounding the current park was cleared years ago for agriculture,<ref name="auto">Ark, Conservation. (2014). Monarto Restoration Project. Retrieved 25/04/2014, 2014</ref> but a few rocky outcrops, not suitable for farming practices, preserved fragments of the original vegetation.

==Ecology==
Ferries McDonald Conservation Park is part of what once was a vast area of mallee bushland during [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] times.<ref name="auto"/> Located on the Murray plains, a variety of native shrubs make up the majority of the ‘open scrub’ habitat<ref name="Gillam 2011">Gillam S D editor.

Bird species include the [[White-plumed honeyeater]], Yellow Plumed Honeyeater, Fairy wrens, thornbills, robins, lorikeets, Galahs, Mallee Ringnecks and Red Wattlebirds.<ref name="auto1"/> Smaller terrestrial species such as the Bilby and Bush Stone-curlew however are now missing due to extensive fox and feral cat predation. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Among the variety of insect life are tenebrionid beetles,<ref name="Board1979">{{cite book|author=South Australia.

===Malleefowl===
A focus within the park has been the protection of the Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata), a native bird species that originally inhabited much of the natural mallee environment. Malleefowl are easy prey for common predators such as foxes and feral cats and are now only found at a handful of sites across Australia, including Ferries McDonald (CP). Malleefowl are listed as vulnerable nationally but are critically endangered in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.<ref name="Benshemesh">Benshemesh, J. (2007). National Recovery Plan for Malleefowl. Department for Environment and Heritage, South Australia.</ref> Ferries McDonald Conservation Park is home to a small population of Malleefowl that is closely monitored by the National Malleefowl Recovery Team (NMRT) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Biological surveys of the area reveal fluctuating records of sightings and mound activity from year to year.<ref name="auto2">National Melleefowl Recovery Team. (2013). Retrieved 3/5/2014, from http://malleefowl.net.au/index.html</ref> Combined efforts between the National Malleefowl Recovery Team (NMRT) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) track Malleefowl progress as well as protect and manage multiple aspects of the park. Practices include fire management, revegetation and feral control.

Zoos South Australia (SA) has previously been granted permission to collect Malleefowl eggs from Ferries McDonald Conservation Park with the intention to produce a breeding population of Malleefowl fit enough for release into areas of remnant mallee habitat within the region.

==Flora==
In addition to native animal species, Ferries McDonald Conservation Park is home to a variety of rare and endangered plant species.<ref>Department for Environment and Heritage. (2007).

Participants: Bickerton, D., Croft, T., Jury, T., Lang, P., Prescott, A., Quarmby, J. and Smith, K., Adelaide.</ref> Resin Wattle (Acacia rhetinocarpa) is a compact, resinous spreading shrub that grows up to 2 metres in height with bright yellow flowers. It is endemic to South Australia and is only found in a few locations across the state including three populations in Ferries McDonald CP.<ref name="auto3">Government of South Australia. (2012). Ferries McDonald Road Redevelopment. Construction Environmental Management Plan, 4</ref>

==Fire Management==
Areas of vast Mallee bushland are prone to wildfire. .<ref name="auto2"/> The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), with the help of volunteer groups, carry out operations within Ferries McDonald Conservation Park and the surrounding region aimed at minimising the fuel load and subsequently the risk of a bushfire. Techniques include the manual removal of excess vegetation, firebreaks, prescribed burning and mulching.<ref>[http://www.murrayvalleystandard.com.au/story/3819806/prescribed-burn-off-at-ferries-mcdonald-conservation-park/ "Prescribed burn-off at Ferries McDonald Conservation Park"]. ''Murray Valley Standard'', 30 Mar 2016</ref>

==Invasive species==
Like most parts of the Australian landscape, Ferries McDonald Conservation Park has populations of introduced species, including feral cats, foxes and rabbits.<ref name="auto4">Moseby, K.E. (2011). Predation determines the outcome of 10 reintroduction attempts in arid South Australia Biological Conservation, Volume 144 (Issue 12), 2863 - 2872.</ref> Ferries McDonald (CP) in not fenced to keep out these species. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources practices baiting programs that aim to eradicate pest species within the Murray Darling Basin.
