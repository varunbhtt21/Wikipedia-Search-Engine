|[[Wilton Bridge]]

!{{Grade I colour}}|{{sort|a|I}}
|
|An exceptionally fine stone bridge. In 1597 an Act was passed authorising its construction. It was completed within the next 2 years. 5 semicircular arches each with 3 ribs. Massive cutwaters on each side carried up and splayed back from the outer angle at parapet level forming semi-hexagonal refuges. At the point where the splay dies out is a moulded string which is mitred and carried up to the angle against the spandrils of the arches and then mitred and carried across to form a label above the arches. The voussoirs of the arches are chamfered and joggled and have various masons' marks. On upstream side the bridge has been widened but now the parapet has gone and been replaced by a wooden handrail. South East approach to bridge has been rebuilt in ashlar with 2 flights of stone steps to the river bank. The sundial, formerly in one of the refuges has gone and only the base of the pedestal remains.
