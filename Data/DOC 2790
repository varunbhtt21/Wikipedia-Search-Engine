A nice and helpful user. He is an active editor on Malayalam (ml) Wikipedia since 2007 (Never stopped editing since!). He has been doing a lot of research for writing articles which are of local importance to Malayalam speaking people. He welcomes new users and patiently answers all their queries. Many of the active editors of today have been helped by him in the past. 

He is simply awesome!

''' Support'''
*I know Sugeesh since the day he started editing. One of the key thing I want to point out is the extreme care and extension he is giving to the potential wikipedians among newbies. Let it be welcoming new userസ് or giving first Barn Star to new user or in guiding the new user he was (and is) always supportive. Many of the current active users benefited much from his timely encouragement and help. Above all these he is an active wikipedian from 2007. --[[User:Shijualex|Shijualex]] ([[User talk:Shijualex|talk]]) 16:49, 22 June 2013 (UTC)

I would be hard-pressed to find a more dedicated Wikipedian than Kudpung. The sheer amount of work he has put in to RfA reform easily numbers in the thousands of hours. His work with [[WP:NPP]] and [[WP:Page Curation]] is similarly extensive—spanning multiple years, providing input and feedback to the engineering team to make improvements and more. His contributions as an [[WP:WOA|online ambassador]] and [[WP:OTRS|volunteer responder]] show another facet of his dedication. Kudpung has shown a great devotion to this project we call Wikipedia.

'''Why is this user awesome? '''
A consistent contributor who never fades from the task, and despite being challenged on several topics this editor keeps cool and discusses points fairly and democratically. His work on WikiProject Boxing to produce a notability guide in a volatile sport deserves a 'hats off' alone. One of the good guys.

Nominated by: Steve Marr

'''Why is this user awesome? '''
I would like to nominate Yunshui for some merchandise giveaway in recognition for their assistance to me, just a regular user of Wikipedia and unknown to Yunshui at the time. My son was born recently and Yunshui helped me recreate your homepage at the time of his birth as a momento which took a fair amount of work for a complete stranger. The gesture of Yunshui putting this effort in means more then the page itself in some ways. It also underlined to me what a great organisation you have here, maintained by the type of good people I hope my son becomes. I have already made a donation to your org in recognition of this but believe Yunshui should receive something too.

== [[Wikipedia:User:Mkdw|Mkdw]] ==

Nominated by: anonymous

'''Why is this user awesome? '''

I contacted Mkdw to enquire why my Wikipedia page had been deleted. I had mistakenly done so thinking they had deleted my article. 

Mkdw was very polite and explained that my article was deleted by another administrator and in fact they were only performing a functionary role as the decision for deletion had been made at a deletion discussion. 

This editor then went further to review the article and looked over some sources I provided them and they determined the subject was in fact notable and an article was appropriate. They assisted me in getting my draft to a state where it met the notability guidelines and it was reviewed and approved by another editor.

This was my first attempt at an article and I was very frustrated. Mkdw showed me Wikipedia was a productive place and that there were helpful people there willing to listen to reason and not hastily delete people's hard work.

I nominate Einar aka Carptrash as Editor of the Week. In early Dec I contacted him about editing the Post Office Murals article which he had started back in Dec 2011. As is the way of things here at WP we began to collaborate on a new artcle, the List of United States post office murals. We both immersed ourselves into creating the article and had a wonderful time. I learned many new things from "Carp" and know I will learn many more as we both expand articles related to "The List". I was searching for something more formidable and long-lasting to do as an editor and, with his sharing and input and mentoring, I have found my "niche". Thank you, Einar, for the 285 articles you have created. ```Buster Seven Talk 15:11, 4 January 2015 (UTC)

'''Why is this user awesome? ''' [[w:User:OccultZone|OccultZone]] was [[w:Special:Diff/646178010|awarded]] the [[w:WP:EOTW|editor of the week award]] by [[w:WP:RETENTION|WikiProjext Editor Retention]] on the English Wikipedia for the week beginning 1 Febuary 2015. The original nomination statement:

"I nominate OccultZone as Editor of the Week for their numerous edits in gnome-y, background maintenance edits. With over 167.000 edits in less than a year and a half, more than half of which are in article-space, OccultZone is one of Wikipedia's most prolific editors. S/he often sits down and, for hours on end, makes large batches of edits at a time in background maintenance areas that most editors would not have the patience to try. In the last week alone, OccultZone has rated over 600 articles and shaved off more than 400 errors in Category:CS1 errors: missing author or editor. OccultZone is one of Wikipedia's most dedicated and prized editors."

Long term Czech Wikisource editor (& admin & bureaucrat) with **tremendous** amount of digitized works added. While scanning, OCRing and proofreading them, he finds many unusual words in Czech which he submits to Wiktionary too. On Wiktionary, he often links back to Wikisource with quotes for given entry. Such interproject work connecting projects together tightly is highly, highly unusual in the Czech community. Check his contributions on other projects as well (ie. Wikipedia, Wikiquote).
