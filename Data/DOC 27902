The '''ATS D6''' was a [[Formula One]] [[racing car]] manufactured and raced by the [[ATS (wheels)|Team ATS]] during the [[1983 Formula One season]]. It was powered by the [[BMW M12]]/13 4-cylinder turbocharged engine but the team failed to score any points.

==Development==
The D6 was designed by [[Gustav Brunner]], who based the chassis around a carbon-fibre monocoque. To replace the previous year's Cosworth DFV V8, team owner [[Günter Schmid]] arranged a supply of [[BMW M12]]/13 4-cylinder turbocharged engines. A total of three chassis were built during the year.<ref name=Nye>Nye, 1985, pp. 164–165</ref> The D6 was trendsetting in the way that its chassis was shaped aerodynamically at the front end so that separate bodywork was no longer needed. In the years to follow this design philosophy became the standard in Formula One; [[McLaren]] was one of the last top teams to adopt it in 1992 on the [[McLaren MP4/7A|MP4/7A]].

==Racing history==
After running two entries the previous season, for 1983 ATS reverted to a single entry driven by German [[Manfred Winkelhock]]. Winkelhock usually qualified well but the team suffered poor reliability. Schmid, a notoriously autocratic and difficult team owner, made a number of management decisions which impacted on the team's results.<ref name=Nye/>

In qualifying, Winkelhock was often in the top ten on the grid. His best qualifying performance was seventh which he achieved three times, at the [[1983 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], [[1983 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian]] and the [[1983 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]] respectively. However, he finished only four races, the best of these being the [[1983 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]] where he placed 8th.<ref name=Statsf1/>
