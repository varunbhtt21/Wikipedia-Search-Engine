'''Malka Rokeach''' ({{lang-he|מלכה רוקח}}) was the first ''[[rebbetzin]]'' of the [[Hasidic]] [[Hasidic dynasty|dynasty]] of [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]]. She was the wife of [[Rabbi]] [[Sholom Rokeach]], the first ''[[rebbe]]'' of Belz, and the mother of the second ''rebbe'' of the dynasty, Rabbi [[Yehoshua Rokeach]]. She was directly involved in the ongoings in her husband's court.

==Life==
She was born in 1780 to Rabbi Yissachar Dov Ramraz of [[Sokal]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and Rebbetzin Chana Rachel (née Tisminitzer), a great-granddaughter of Rabbi [[Zechariah Mendel ben Aryeh Leib of Cracow]], author of ''[[Ba'er Hetev]]'' on ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' and ''[[Choshen Mishpat]]''.<ref name="ami40">{{cite journal|last=Preschel Herzog|first=Pearl|date=Sep 12, 2012|journal=[[Ami (magazine)|Ami Living]]|issue=87|page=40}}</ref>

Malka married her first-cousin, Rabbi Sholom Rokeach, son of Rabbi Elazar Rokeach and Rebbetzin Rivka Henna Ramraz, her father's sister. They had five sons and two daughters.<ref name="ami40"/>

Rabbi Sholom considered Malka as his partner in his [[Torah study]] and in all of his spiritual endeavors. He said that when he took it upon himself to remain awake one thousand nights to study Torah, Malka stood at his side to ensure that his candle remained lit so that he shouldn't have to interrupt his Torah study.

Malka died in September 1853 (8 [[Elul]], 5613 [[Anno Mundi|A.M.]])<ref>{{cite journal|last=Preschel Herzog|first=Pearl|date=Sep 12, 2012|journal=Ami Living|issue=87|page=43}}</ref> and was buried in [[Belz]]. Each year on the day of her ''[[yahrzeit]]'', 8 Elul, Belzer Hasidim continue to light [[Yahrzeit candle|candle]]s in her memory. The [[girls' school]]s of the Belzer Hasidim are named in her honor.

Her brother was the father-in-law of Rabbi [[Yechezkel Shraga Halberstam]], in the latter's fourth marriage.
