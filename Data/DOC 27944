Title : Getting out stakes
Text : {{Orphan|date=August 2014}}

The '''Getting out stakes''' is a slang term in British and Irish [[horse race]] betting, referring to the last race of the day. [[Gambler]]s who have not won money on other races try to recoup or reduce their losses by betting on the last race at long [[odds]].

Although mostly a slang term, bookmakers themselves have named races as such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/racing/racecards/12-03-2014/kempton-park/racecard/607194/getting-out-stakes-at-cheltenham-handicap|date=12 March 2014|title=Getting out stakes at Cheltenham Handicap|work=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishracing.com/result?race=&prc=022&prd=201403121815|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=5 May 2014|work=irishracing.com|title=Race Result Kempton Wed, 12th Mar, 2014}}</ref>
