This person may not meet the notability threshold for Wikipedia; of the references in the article, the majority are self-published or closely connected to the subject. The [[WP:ADVERT]], COI and autobiography problems don't help either. [[User:Justlettersandnumbers|Justlettersandnumbers]] ([[User talk:Justlettersandnumbers|talk]]) 11:10, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''keep'''  There are 30 citations here. Even if ''some'' of them could be said to have some self interest, firstly that is no reason to remove them (it's a reason to not ''rely'' on them, which is different), secondly there are still adequate cites that do meet [[WP:RS]] to pass [[WP:N]]. 
: Yet again. ''not all'' sources are required to meet our highest standards. We can use other sources ''in addition''. [[User:Andy Dingley|Andy Dingley]] ([[User talk:Andy Dingley|talk]]) 19:44, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' &mdash; (agree with the above, plus...) some of these sources are of an unusually high prominence for notability to come into question; i.e. major newspapers and magazines; it's also worth noting that the references provided span a number of years, indicating protracted notability. It's appropriate that we are cautious of any autobiographical or promotional elements, but that should encourage clean-up rather than be used to justify deletion of an article whose subject otherwise meets [[WP:GNG]] and is verifiable. &ndash; [[User:kierant|<font color="#006600">Kieran T</font>]] <sup>''(''[[User talk:kierant|''<font color="#006600">talk</font>'']]'')''</sup> 12:45, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
