*'''Keep''' - While it has neologism-like elements due to being a relatively recently-coined term, at this time it's also a topic that has received significant coverage in reliable sources, thus passing [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:NTEMP]]. Source examples include:

*'''Keep''' - the article could stand to be beefed up, but I see extensive coverage. Meets notability. [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 17:45, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''.  It's unintuitive, but this really is a notable neologism used by reliable sources.  I find it difficult to believe that adult, professional journalists would use such a stupid word, but they do.  I even found a [[Flemish]] [http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140502_01090343 newspaper] that uses the term!  With such international acceptance, I think this is a clear keep.

*'''Comment'''.  I've expanded the article.  It's not a featured article, but I think it makes a much better case for notability now. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 23:30, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
