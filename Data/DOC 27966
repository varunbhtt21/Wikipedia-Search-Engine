Non-notable boxer - no title fights.  Only real claim is he looks like another boxer. [[User:PRehse|Peter Rehse]] ([[User talk:PRehse|talk]]) 11:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' He doesn't meet [[WP:NBOX]].  Most of the sources are simply routine sports reporting.  There are some mentions of him as a "top prospect", but being a prospect means one is not yet notable but may become so.

*'''Delete''' Fails NBOX and reporting is routine.  Reads more like a tribute to a young man who died early, but [[WP:NOTMEMORIAL]]. [[User:Mdtemp|Mdtemp]] ([[User talk:Mdtemp|talk]]) 18:27, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
