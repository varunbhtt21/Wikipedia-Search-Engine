The site is at the end of a deer park owned by Merton College, and it has earthworks which were probably formerly a medieval hunting lodge. The [[Bonesgate Stream]] runs along the western edge. The long established woodland is mainly oak and hazel, and the varied ground flora include bluebell, wood anemone and wood sedge. There are breeding birds such as jay, great spotted woodpecker and song thrush.<ref name=GIGL/><ref name=LGO>{{cite web|url=http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.asp?ID=KIN008|title=Castle Hill Local Nature Reserve|publisher=London Parks and Gardens Trust|accessdate= 4 May 2014}}</ref>
