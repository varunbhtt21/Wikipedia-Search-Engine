'''Fred Hill''' (1909 – 1984) was a British activist who protested against the compulsory wearing of [[Motorcycle helmets|crash helmets]] on [[motorcycles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mag-uk.org/en/aboutmag/a6325|title=Motorcycle Action Group|website=www.mag-uk.org|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref>

Hill was born in [[Yorkshire]] in 1909. During [[World War II]] he was a motorcycle [[despatch rider]]. He later became a [[school teacher]] and taught [[mathematics]]. He died 10 February 1984 in London's [[Pentonville Prison]], aged 74.

Hill's campaign against the UK compulsory wearing of motorcycle helmets law intensified in 1976 after the [[Sikh]] community gained an exemption from the law. He made many speeches about [[equal treatment]]. He said that if one community did not have to wear helmets then nobody should have to, although he rarely made direct reference to the [[Dastar#Helmet_exemption|Sikhs' exemption]] and denied being [[racist]].<ref>http://www.gurmat.info/sms/smspublications/theturbanvictory/chapter3/

Hill was frequently arrested for riding without wearing a helmet, including when on [[Demonstration (protest)|demos]]. He, consequently, accumulated a large number of [[Summons|summonses]]. It was his refusal to pay the fines, rather than the helmetless riding offences, that led to his imprisonment, the charges being the more serious one of "[[Contempt of Court]]". Although he was always polite to the authorities that pursued and imprisoned him, Hill was unimpressed by people in high [[Social position|positions]], and was never [[Intimidation|intimidated]] by them. On one occasion a woman [[magistrate]] was endeavouring to chastise Hill for breaking the law, to which criticism, Hill, implicitly referring to [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and the [[Suffragette|female emancipation movement]], replied, "if it hadn't been for a woman breaking the law, you wouldn't be sitting there now madam".

Besides enduring many prison sentences, Hill supported the anti-helmet law campaign organised by the [[Motorcycle Action Group]] (MAG) and attended many of their demos, at which he made speeches. Despite his age, Hill would ride considerable distances for which purpose he traded in his [[moped]] for a 250 [[Honda]]. No matter how far he had travelled or how bad the weather conditions were he always rode home the same day after a demo for his wife’s sake, and declined offers of accommodation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wadmag.mag-uk.org/fred_hill.htm|title=Who was FRED HILL|website=wadmag.mag-uk.org|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref>

Hill was sentenced to a total of 31 prison sentences between 1976 and 1984. It was during Hill's 31st prison sentence that he suffered a [[heart attack]] and subsequently died while serving 2 months in London's Pentonville Prison. An [[inquiry]], held to establish whether Hill's treatment had contributed to his death, found no evidence for this.

Memorial rides continue annually across the UK, allowing riders to show their gratitude and respect for Hill.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-17002668|title=Fred Hill memorial ride by Motorcycle Action Group|date=2012-02-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.okehampton-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=733&headline=Riding%20in%20memory%20of%20Fred&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2011|title=Riding in memory of Fred|work=Okehampton Times|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en}}</ref>
