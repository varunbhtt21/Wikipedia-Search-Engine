:''The following is an archived discussion of the DYK nomination of the article below. <span style="color:red">'''Please do not modify this page.'''</span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|this nomination's talk page]], [[Talk:{{SUBPAGENAME}}|the article's talk page]] or [[Wikipedia talk:Did you know]]), unless there is consensus to re-open the discussion at this page. '''No further edits should be made to this page'''.''

At time of nomination, article was not new nor 5x expanded, and was ineligible.  Never transcluded to [[T:TDYK]] but would have failed.  More than a year later, it is still not eligible as an expansion for where it was a month before nomination.  No reason to keep it open.  The result was '''rejected.'''
