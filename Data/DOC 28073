Gill at [[Ahmednagar]] with the designation of 'B' Tank Regiment which was changed on 15 July 1989 to 51 Armoured Regiment . <ref name="Nath2009"/> The first Colonel of the Regiment was Lt Gen S.S. Mehta, [[AVSM]] and Bar, [[Vishisht Seva Medal|VSM]].<ref name="Nath2009"/>

Soon after raising, on the assassination of [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the regiment was involved in aid to civil authorities when it was deployed in [[Karnal District]]. It was also involved in internal security duties during [[Operation Rakshak|Operation Rakshak II]]<ref name="Nath2009"/>

The regiment has a nickname "the Unicorn" on account of its cap badge.<ref name="Nath2009"/>

==Cap badge==
The cap badge of the regiment is a unicorn head which was suggested by Lt Col NJS Pannu. The mythical beast finds mention in Indian historical texts, and represents "purity' and "closeness to God''. The initial badge showed a unicorn head facing to the right but the design was considered unsatisfactory and it was replaced with a unicorn head facing the left in silhouette. The head rests on a scroll inscribed with the words "51 KAVACHIT REGIMENT" (meaning 51st Armoured Regiment) in [[Devanagari]] script.<ref name="Nath2009"/>

The shoulder title consists of the numeral "51" in brass.<ref name="Nath2009"/>
