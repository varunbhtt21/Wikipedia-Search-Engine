The '''Belluno Treasure''' is an important [[Lombards|Lombardic]] hoard found at [[Belluno]], [[Italy]] in the nineteenth century that has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1897.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=29497&plaA=29497-3-1 British Museum Collection]</ref></blockquote>

==Discovery==
The hoard was apparently found in a grave near the town of Belluno in the province of [[Veneto]], northern [[Italy]]. Dating to the late 6th or early 7th centuries AD, the rich grave group probably belonged to a female member of the [[Lombards|Lombardic]] court. It was later purchased by the curator and philanthropist [[Augustus Franks]], who bequeathed it to the British Museum in 1897.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/b/gold_and_garnet_disc_brooch.aspx British Museum  Highlights]</ref></blockquote>

==Description==
The Belluno Treasure is largely composed of gold and gem-encrusted jewellery. The style of decoration from the hoard reflect contemporary fashions in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. It includes two gold cross pendants (one with punched ornamentation), a  gold and garnet [[cloisonn√©]] disc brooch, a finger-ring, a gold pin with a terminus in the form of a hand (which may have once held a [[pearl]]), and gold beads.
