Title : 2014 New Caledonian legislative election
Text : {{Politics of New Caledonia}}

'''Legislative elections''' were held in [[New Caledonia]] on 11 May 2014.<ref>http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/new-caledonia/5275/independence-movement-launches-unity-ticket/</ref> The result was a victory for the three anti-independence parties ([[Caledonia Together]], [[The Rally–UMP|Front for Unity]] and [[Union for Caledonia in France]]), which together won 29 of the 54 seats (48.85% of the votes, 53.7% of the seats) in the [[Congress of New Caledonia]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-12/an-new-caledonia-elections/5445380 New Caledonia elections: French loyalists win, independence supporters gain ground] ABC, 12 May 2014</ref>

==Electoral system==
Voters elected 87 members to the assemblies of the [[Administrative divisions of New Caledonia|three provinces of New Caledonia]]. In turn, 54 also become members of the Congress. Voting was restricted to people on the Special Roll, which excluded people who moved to New Caledonia after 1988.<ref name=RZNI1/>

A total of 17 parties registered to contest the elections.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/242357/17-party-lists-to-contest-new-caledonia-provincial-elections 17 party lists to contest New Caledonia provincial elections] Radio New Zealand International, 23 April 2014</ref>

==Campaign==
The main issue at stake in the elections was independence from France. The elected Congress would be responsible for taking decisions on moving towards independence, as agreed in the [[Nouméa Accord]], and an [[independence referendum]] will be held during the term of this Congress if there is a three-fifths majority in favour of holding one.<ref name=RZNI1/> However, in the lead up to the elections, the pro-independence [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front]] claimed that around 6,700 people on the Special Roll had moved to New Caledonia after 1988, and that 2,000 people who should have been on the Special Roll and were eligible to vote in the Territorial elections were not, the two figures equating to around 7% of registered voters.<ref name=RZNI1>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/french-magistrates-to-resolve-new-caledonia-electoral-issues/1272608 French magistrates to resolve New Caledonia electoral issues] Radio New Zealand International, 28 February 2014</ref> In response, anti-independence groups claimed that 4,000 [[Kanak people|Kanaks]] should be removed from the electoral roll,<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-28/an-kanak-voters-list-faulty/5290230 New Caledonia Congress President Roch Wamytam raises electoral roll concerns ahead of independence moves] ABC, 28 February 2014</ref> and that taking the issue to court would threaten a return to violence.<ref name=RZNI2/>

A television debate was planned to discuss the electoral roll issue, but was cancelled at the last minute.<ref name=RZNI2>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/241433/televised-new-caledonia-election-debate-cancelled Televised New Caledonia election debate cancelled] Radio New Zealand International, 11 April 2014</ref> The [[United Nations]] sent a delegation to the territory in March 2014 to look into the controversy around the electoral lists, and to ensure that the Accords were upheld.<ref name=IB>[http://www.islandsbusiness.com/2014/4/politics/un-sends-mission-to-new-caledonia/ UN sends mission to New Caledonia] Islands Business, April 2014</ref> Although the French government approved the UN delegation, the anti-independence Union for New Caledonia within France and [[Caledonia Together]] opposed their presence.<ref name=IB/>
