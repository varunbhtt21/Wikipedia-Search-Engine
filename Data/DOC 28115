Forced Afd. PROD was deleted, and does not qualify for an A7 as it's a film. Fails [[WP:MOVIE|the notability guideline for films,]] has not achieved significant coverage in secondary sources. [[User:Tutelary|Tutelary]] ([[User talk:Tutelary|talk]]) 12:52, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as per nominated. --[[User:Clarkcj12|Clarkcj12]] ([[User talk:Clarkcj12|talk]]) 20:38, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I can't find anything in English and a search for sources using the Ukranian name doesn't really bring up anything. Of course I know that Google isn't exactly the greatest, but there does seem to be a dearth of sources as a whole. Barring anyone finding more coverage, this will be a delete on my end.

*'''Usefy''' for now back to [[User talk:Сергій.Я|its author]] without prejudice as a draft. It is quite unlikely that we will have scads of English coverage for this [[Cinema of Ukraine|Ukranian]] film. We can allow return once [[WP:NF]] can be met.

*'''Comment''':  ok with userification.  A very quick check of Ukrainian sources didn't give me any bites to suggest notability, though i saw a few brief mentions of it.--'''[[User:Milowent|Milowent]]''' • <small><sup style="position:relative">[[Special:Contributions/Milowent|has]]<span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-3.2ex;*left:-5.5ex;">[[User talk:Milowent|spoken]]</span></sup></small> 03:48, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
