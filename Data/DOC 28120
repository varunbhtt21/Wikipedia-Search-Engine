The almshouses were originally  built on [[Richmond Hill, London|Richmond Hill]]. By the 19th century they had become dilapidated. They were rebuilt in 1851 in The Vineyard, Richmond next to [[Queen Elizabeth's Almshouses, Richmond|Queen Elizabeth's Almshouses]] and the front arch and gateway from the previous site are believed to have been incorporated in the rebuilding.<ref name="Charities" /> The new site was provided by James Ewing, owner of the neighbouring [[Downe House, Richmond Hill]]. He also paid for their rebuilding,<ref name="Vineyard">{{cite web | url=http://www.thevineyardrichmond.info/bishop-duppa%27s-almshouses.html | title=Bishop Duppa's Almshouses: Timeline |  work=The Vineyard, Richmond: An Online History for residents, their families and friends | accessdate=4 May 2014 | author=Stephen Orr}}</ref> in white brick to a [[Jacobethan|Jacobean design]] by Thomas Little,<ref name="Pevsner">{{cite book | title=[[The Buildings of England]] – London 2: South | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | author=[[Bridget Cherry]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]| year=1983 | location=London | page=531 | isbn=0 14 0710 47 7}}</ref> receiving the old almshouse site in exchange.<ref name="Vineyard"/>
