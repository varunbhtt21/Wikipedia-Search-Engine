The '''Marlborough by-election''' of '''1970''' was a by-election for the electorate of [[Marlborough (New Zealand electorate)|Marlborough]], held on 21 February 1970<ref>''New Zealand Official Yearbook 1970'' p1137</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Wood |first= G. A. |title= Ministers and Members in the New Zealand Parliament |edition= 2 |origyear= 1987 |year= 1996 |publisher= University of Otago Press |location= Dunedin |isbn= 1 877133 00 0 |oclc= |page=113}}</ref> during the [[30th New Zealand Parliament]].

==Background==
The by-election resulted from the death of [[Tom Shand]] on 11 December 1969, only 12 days after he (and the government) had been re-elected on 29 November; and the new National candidate was defeated by the greatest swing against a government since the [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 general election]], in what was a largely rural electorate generally regarded a safe [[New Zealand National Party|National]] seat. Tom Shand had held the seat from 1946, when he defeated Labour’s [[Edwin Meachen]].

The defeated National candidate Anthony Shand was the son of the previous member, and there was some criticism of him for frequent "butting-in" during a combined television broadcast appearance for all the candidates on Wednesday 17 February.<ref>{{cite news |title= Marlborough By-election |newspaper=The Dominion |page= 3 |first = |last= |date= 20 February 1970 }}</ref>

The vote for Tom Shand had been close in [[1966 New Zealand general election|1966]]. [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] only decided that the seat was winnable in January, and sent in two MPs [[Arthur Faulkner]] and [[Colin Moyle]] to organise the campaign. Labour’s candidate [[Ian Brooks]] was local; he was a senior clerk in the [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]] manual telephone exchange and also had a small farm. The seat was largely rural, but Brooks polled particularly well in Picton, and well in the other two population centres, [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and [[Kaikoura]]. The election-night margin to Labour of 1131 was so great that the final result was not expected to change when special votes, which generally tended to go to National, were counted.<ref>{{cite news |url= |title= Labour wins Marlborough By-election | work=[[The Dominion (Wellington)|The Dominion]] |page= 3 |first =  |last= |date= 23 February 1970}}</ref> There were 32 informal votes.<ref>{{cite book |ref = harv |last = Norton |first = Clifford |title = New Zealand Parliamentary Election Results 1946-1987: Occasional Publications No 1, Department of Political Science |year = 1988 |publisher = Victoria University of Wellington |location = Wellington |isbn = 0-475-11200-8 |pages=274, 410}}</ref>
 
[[George Chapman (party president)|George Chapman]] was the Wellington [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] chairman. He heard reports that all was not well in the campaign, the party was in deep trouble, and that Labour was making an all-out effort. But he found that party president Ned Holt was complacent about the by-election; saying that everything was in order, and that in any case National's majority in Marlborough was big enough to absorb any setback. But on by-election night Labour inflicted a stunning defeat on National, reducing the Government majority from six to four, and shaking party confidence. Chapman became the leader for change in the organisation, resulting in his nomination for party president in 1971, although he did not become president until 1973.<ref>{{cite book |last= Chapman |first= George |title= The Years of Lightning |authorlink=George Chapman (party president)  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1980 |publisher= AH & AW Reed |location= Wellington |isbn= 0-589-01346-7 |oclc= |pages= 44–45}}</ref>
