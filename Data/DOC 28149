==History==
The name Englewood was first adopted in September 1930 as the name of a [[post office]] and steamer landing.  The post office name in the area was moved across the cove to the community of [[Beaver Cove, British Columbia|Beaver Cove]] in 1958.<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/38117.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Beaver Cove (community)"]</ref>  By 1967 the [[British Columbia Forest Service|BC Forest Service]] informed the provincial names office that only a 10-man logging camp remained at the site.  But 1984, a sailing guide commented that its wharves and buildings were in ruin.  The name and accompanying designation as a community 

Englewood as a name is a derivation of the local sawmill company's name, Wood & English Logging company.  The name survives today as that of the [[Englewood Railway]], the last logging railroad operating in North America, which runs from Beaver Cove to Vernon camp for a total length of 84 milles.<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/51438.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Englewood (community)"]</ref>
