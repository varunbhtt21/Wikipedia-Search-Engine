Title : Locale ('Ndrangheta)
Text : A '''locale''' (translated as "local" or "place"), is the main local organizational unit of the [['Ndrangheta]] with [[jurisdiction]] over criminal activities in an entire town or an area in a large urban center.<ref name=paoli29>Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qX5NfHTWzS0C&pg=PA29 pp. 29-30]</ref><ref name=nicaso1>Nicaso & Danesi, ''Made Men'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=5fEQAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA23 p. 23]</ref>

A ''locale'' is usually made up by one ''[['ndrina]]'' (in the case of a small town) or several '' 'ndrine'', if more than one '' 'ndrina'' operates in the same town. In the case of larger cities a local may rule over a certain area or neighbourhood of the city.<ref name=nicaso1/> In some contexts a '' 'ndrina'' is more powerful than the ''locale'' on which they formally depend.<ref name=paoli29/>

Each ''locale'' has a boss with authority over members' life and death, a ''capo locale'', usually the [[capobastone]] of a 'ndrina.<ref name=nicaso1/> It has at least 49 members and besides the ''capo locale'', there is the ''contabile '' (accountant) who handles the finances - commonly called ''la bacinella'' or ''la valigetta'' (briefcase) - and a ''crimine'' that oversees the illegal activity. All three form a [[triumvirate]] called the ''Copiata''.<ref name=rep>{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/07/14/news/la_cupola_della_ndrangheta-5572170/ Il Crimine, i mastri, le 'ndrine; ecco la Cupola modello Cosa nostra], La Repubblica, July 14, 2010</ref> A ''locale'' is often subdivided into two divisions: the ''società minore'' (the "minor" or lower society) and the ''società maggiore'' ("major" or higher society). The minor is submissive to the major.<ref name=nicaso1/><ref name=paoli47>Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qX5NfHTWzS0C&pg=PA47 pp. 47-48]</ref>

The ''locale'' of [[San Luca]] has a historical preeminence. Every new group or ''locale'' must obtain its authorization to operate and every group belonging to the 'Ndrangheta "still has to deposit a small percentage of illicit proceeds to the ''principale'' of San Luca in recognition of the latter's primordial supremacy."<ref name=paoli29/>
