Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''keep'''. The gist of the deletion rationale is summarized by [[WP:TNT]]; however, there is consensus here that the subject is notable, and enough editing has been done for the nominator to be satisfied.

<s>Subject is likely notable, however the article is so poorly written that it does not meet encyclopedic standards and would need to be rewritten from scratch to bring it up to snuff. (Note: This is not intended as a slam on the author for whom I suspect English is not their native language.) Additionally the article cites no sources which is highly problematic considering it contains lots of highly negative claims about living persons. A possible redirect target might be the extensive coverage of the scandals and legal troubles in [[Ehud Olmert]]. In the end though this particular article is just not salvageable. Time to break out the [[TNT]].</s> [[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 13:28, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as so badly written there is no way to keep it by copyediting. --[[User:Dthomsen8|DThomsen8]] ([[User talk:Dthomsen8|talk]]) 13:55, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Clearly notable and the verdict is now sourced. Whether this stuff created (I suspect) by machine translation is unsalvagable is another matter.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 17:53, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

...Make that '''Keep'''. The article has a sound structure, I've beaten out some of the lumps, it is by no means unsalvageable. There are plenty of sources.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 20:34, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Withdrawing nom''' Based on extreme makeover by [[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]]. Well done. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 13:07, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Notable and important topic. [[User:Marokwitz|Marokwitz]] ([[User talk:Marokwitz|talk]]) 06:09, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Needs a lot of editing, but it's certainly a notable topic. --[[User:FeldBum|FeldBum]] ([[User talk:FeldBum|talk]]) 14:40, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
