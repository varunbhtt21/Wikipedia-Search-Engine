'''''Epitome of Illusions''''' is the third studio album by the Norwegian [[symphonic black metal]] band [[Limbonic Art]] released in 1998 on Nocturnal Art Productions. The album itself is composed of rerecorded material from the band's pre-label demos, so it can be considered both as a studio and a compilation album, although Morfeus said in an interview that it is not a full release.<ref>http://www.mortemzine.net/show.php?id=864</ref>
