As a cardiologist Khaykin specializes in the implantation of [[pacemaker]]s, [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] (ICDs), [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]] (CRT), laser lead extraction and ablation of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, among other cardiac services.<ref name="Atrial">{{Cite web |url=http://www.jafib.com/index.php?cont=epanel&start=28 |title=Doctors Panel |publisher=Journal of Atrial Fibrilation}}</ref><ref name="Hamilton">{{Cite web |title=Subscriber invites world to watch leading-edge cardiac procedure |date=12 January 2012 |first=Natalie |last=Hamilton |url=http://www.hiroc.com/News-Media/News/NewsItems/Subscriber-invites-world-to-watch-leading-edge-car.aspx}}</ref>

Khaykin and a fellow electrophysiologist, Atul Verma, were the first cardiologists in Canada to use "a revolutionary technology that makes it easier to connect with human tissue when guiding catheters into the heart to treat problem areas, reducing patient risk while improving outcomes".<ref name="Can">{{Cite web |url=http://www.canhealth.com/News1700.html |title=Southlake first with new arrhythmia treatment |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The technology takes "precise electrical measurements at the tip of a cardiac catheter, providing cardiac specialists with both numbers and a visual display so they know when good tip-to-tissue contact is made".<ref name="Can"/>

==Patents==
* Khaykin, along with Gal Hayam, Limor Elran and Aharon Turgeman, invented and holds a patent for an ''Automated analysis of complex fractionated electrograms'', a "method for mapping abnormal electrical activity" in the heart. The method is able to identify and analyze complex fractionated electrograms (CFEs).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/yaariv-khaykin |title=Patents by Inventor Yaariv Khaykin |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>
