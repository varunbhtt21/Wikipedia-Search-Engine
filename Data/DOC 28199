He [[Absolution|absolved]] condemned victims,<ref name="Don Bosco" /> usually in secret, but at least once in front of everyone at the moment of mass execution.<ref name="Wysocki">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdim.pl/en/edukacja/zasoby-edukacyjne/teksty/50-wiadectwa-byych-winiow/449-wieslawwysocki-i |title=Świadectwa życia religijnego więźniów obozów koncentracyjnych |trans-title=Examples of Religious Devotion of Concentration Camp Victims (Part I and II) |publisher=Centre of Dialog and Prayer in Oświęcim (Centrum Dialogu i Modlitwy CDiM Oświęcim) |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2014 |author=Wiesław Jan Wysocki |work=Sakramenty w obozie |quote=''Translation from Polish:'' Confessions had to be secret... it was extremely rare (..) that those condemned to death for an escape attempt had received absolution by Father Józef Kowalski in front of everyone (he died on 4 August 1942) ''Original:'' Spowiedzi obozowe musiały być ukryte... zgoła wyjątkowo, (..) skazanym na śmierć za ucieczkę z obozu w momencie egzekucji na oczach wszystkich udzielił absolucji ks.

At one roll call, he was ordered by [[Schutzstaffel]] Gerhard Palitzsch to trample upon his [[rosary]] when he was discovered with it. Kowalski refused. As punishment, he was assigned to a penal company.  In his last letter to his parents, Józef wrote:{{quote|Do not worry about me; I am in God's hands. I want to assure you that I feel His help at every step. Despite the present situation, I am happy and completely at peace.<ref name="SQPN" />}}

On July 3, 1942, he was mocked, ridiculed and severely beaten by the guards for being a priest. The same night, his oppressors pulled him out of his barracks, gravely beat him outside and possibly drowned him. Kowalski's body was found the next day and burned with others.<ref name="Don Bosco-Kowalski" /><ref name="Don Bosco" /> He was 31 years of age.<ref name="Neville">{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/223387833/Jozef-Joseph-Kowalski-by-Victor-Rodrigues |title=Joseph (Józef) Kowalski.
