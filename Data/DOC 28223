==Biography==
===Coaching career===
Walsh began his coaching career as a student assistant coach at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton]]. Upon graduation, Walsh was hired as an assistant at [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] where he spent two seasons until he moved on to the University of San Diego, where he was an assistant coach for one season.

From 1998 to 2005, Walsh was an assistant coach under [[Tim Welsh]] at [[Providence College]], marking the second time he'd work with Welsh, as he did at Iona.

In 2005, Walsh accepted the job at Division III [[Rhode Island College]], replacing [[Jack Perri]]. In his nine seasons at RIC, Walsh led the Anchormen to eight NCAA Tournament appearances, including the Sweet 16 three times, and the Elite Eight once. Walsh was 204-63 at RIC.

In May 2014, Walsh became the head coach of the Maine Black Bears, becoming the 21st head coach in school history, replacing [[Ted Woodward]].

On March 5, 2018, Walsh and Maine parted ways, ending his tenure with the Black Bears. In his four seasons with Maine, Walsh recorded a 24–100 record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goblackbears.com/news/2018/3/5/barron-named-umaine-mens-basketball-head-coach-following-walshs-decision-not-to-extend-contract.aspx|title=Barron named UMaine men’s basketball head coach following Walsh’s decision not to extend contract - Maine, University of|website=Maine, University of}}</ref>
