'''Alain Mucchielli''' (born October 3, 1947, in [[Toulon]]) is a [[France|French]] [[biochemist]] and [[public health]] physician.

==Biography==
In 1975 Mucchielli obtained a [[PhD]] with a thesis on [[food irradiation]] at the [[Lille]] [[Institut Pasteur]] in collaboration with the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|CEA]] [[Cadarache]] Research Centre. After joining the [[Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale]] in 1977, his work focused on [[alpha-fetoprotein]] in [[Nice]], France, and the [[trophoblast]] [[antigens]] in the Blond McIndoe Centre for Transplantation Biology, [[East Grinstead]], England. In 1981, he obtained a [[Medical doctor|MD]] with a thesis on antibody transfer from mother to fetus in the [[University of Nice]].

In 1984, he engaged in street work. In 1987, along with seven other doctors, he co-founded a [[Red Cross]] Volunteer Centre for [[homeless people]].<ref>{{fr icon}} [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97480144/f5.item Présence Croix-Rouge : Vie et bonté]</ref> Difficulties faced by people in this center committed him in [[harm reduction]], and he organized in the early 1990s a medical care network for [[intravenous drug users]].<ref>{{fr icon}} G. Decrouy et al., « ''L’exclusion sociale dans les Alpes-Maritimes, V.I.H., drogue, délinquance, précarité : enquêtes sur le terrain'' », Paris, Éditions L'Harmattan, 1997, 312 p.</ref> 
 
This network supported about 500 drug users in the south of France from 1990 to 1997, and, since 1993, it provided substitution treatment for drug users suffering very difficult conditions.<ref>[http://bdoc.ofdt.fr/pmb/opac_css/index.php?lvl=author_see&id=5287 French Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]</ref>
 
In 1997, in [[Paris]], he was "awarded the [[Harm Reduction International#Awards|National Rolleston Award]] … for his advocacy of harm reduction in the face of opposition and doubt and for his efforts to bring about changes in Nice, a city badly affected by the problems arising from drug use and HIV".<ref>[http://www.fichier-pdf.fr/2012/11/25/alain-mucchielli-1997-national-rolleston-award/ 1997 National Rolleston Award]</ref>
 
In 2000, he was director of [[SAMU Social]] in Nice,<ref>Trajectoires de la précarité professionnelle et sociale en région PACA, [http://www.dros-paca.org/fr/les-colloques-du-dros/les-colloques-du-dros-detail/article/colloque-du-10-octobre-20/ Colloque DROS PACA 2006]</ref> which he held until he retired in 2009.
