His highest cited paper is "Construction of a genetic linkage map in man using restriction fragment length polymorphisms" at 9,898 times, according to [[Google Scholar]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=Mark+Skolnick&btnG= |title=Mark Skolnick |publisher=scholar.google.com |accessdate=December 26, 2017}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
He was born in 1946 in [[Temple, Texas]] and earned his B.A. at [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1968 and a Ph.D at [[Stanford University]] in 1975.<ref name="Utah">{{Cite web |url=https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=1035960 |title=Mark H. Skolnick |publisher=utah.edu |accessdate=December 26, 2017}}</ref> His father taught a clinical post graduate course in psychoanalysis at [[Stanford]], where Skolnick was introduced to the bright Stanford academics at a very young age. “It got put into my head pretty early on that medicine was interesting,” says Skolnick, “but it might be more interesting to be an academic than a doctor. I’m not sure I would have wanted to just focus on seeing ill people.”<ref name="auto">Davies, K., White, M. (1996). Breakthrough, The Race to Find the Breast Cancer Gene. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. {{ISBN|0471120251}}</ref>
Skolnick was very good at math but his parents also played a very significant role cultivating his interest in science and in societal causes. “I think I was driven a lot by actually wanting to do something of lasting social significance,” he said.<ref name="auto"/>  At the age of fourteen he wanted to be a world health doctor, although his early talents were  most visible in mathematics.

He studied economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], focusing on demography and anthropology.  He was mostly interested in quantitative problems. He continued his graduate studies in demography in the same university and his ambition was to link these fields with genetics, studying individuals in a population, rather than large population trends.  As he says, “The way you study individuals is in [[Genealogy|pedigrees]], by linking fertility, mortality, migration-parameters for single individuals.”<ref name="auto"/>

He received his PhD from Stanford University in 1975. He then moved to the [[University of Utah]] where he began working in collaboration with the Departments of Medical Informatics, Biology, Cardiology and Genetics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Skolnick, Mark H., Ph.D.: History of the Health Sciences|url=https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=1035960|website=Marriott Library Collections|publisher=Spencer S. Eccles Health Sciences Library, University of Utah|accessdate=21 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>

He directed the group that cloned the breast cancer susceptibility gene, [[BRCA1]]; found the full-length sequence of BRCA2.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dnalc.org/view/15718-Mark-Skolnick.html |title=Mark Skolnick |publisher=dnalc.org |accessdate=December 26, 2017}}</ref>

== Discovery of BRCAl and BRCA2 genes ==

Connecting Demography with Genetics: According to Skolnick, "the first scientific step in my search of the BRCA gene arose from my interest in [[demography]], the study of human populations. The standard wisdom in the 1960s was that this was small field that should be studied with in the contrast of sociology or economics."<ref name="auto1">Skolnick, M.  Declaration of Mark Skolnick.UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.No.09 Civ.4515 (RWS)</ref> He used the demography and applied to genetics and studied individual in multi-generational families.

Secondly, he formed familial cancer screenings clinic. Skolnick and his colleagues used this clinic to study a number of people in different families with different types of cancers.  As Skolnick states, “ This resources was a key to our success”<ref name="auto1"/> in finding the BRCA genes.

Finally, Skolnick and his group developed a method called [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs)]] for [[Gene mapping|genetic mapping]] which was also a significant resource for human genome project.  After that point on his group focused on this technique and started to map and clone genes that caused diseases.  The first gene they cloned successfully using this RFLPs was of [[Alport syndrome|Alport Syndrome]]. This technique was one of many later used for the discovery of BRCA.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=1686077 | pmid=6247908 | volume=32 | title=Construction of a genetic linkage map in man using restriction fragment length polymorphisms | date=May 1980 | journal=Am.

== Awards ==
* Skolnick was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Medical Informatics Association]] in 1990.<ref name="Utah"/>
* In 1994, ''The New York Times'' acknowledged him as "leader of the team that successfully identified the gene for breast cancer." Said ''The New York Times'': "No one is more surprised and gratified than Dr. Mark H. Skolnick of the University of Utah, whose team plucked the gene from a crowded stretch of [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]] and out of the grasp of 12 other teams that had thrown hats and hopes into the ring."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Angier |first1=Natalie |title=Fierce Competition Marked Fervid Race For Cancer Gene |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/20/science/fierce-competition-marked-fervid-race-for-cancer-gene.html |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=New York Times |date=September 20, 1994}}</ref>
