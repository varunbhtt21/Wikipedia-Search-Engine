'''''Mükemmel''''' (''Perfect'') is the eleventh studio album by Turkish singer [[Hande Yener]]. It was released on 2 June 2014 by Poll Production. After working with [[Sinan Akçıl]] on her three previous studio albums, Yener ended her friendship with Akçıl and after it became evident that the two would not work together on any projects again, in May 2013 she released the new single "Ya Ya Ya Ya", which was written by Berksan. Following the single's release, she began working on her new studio album, and after years she took new songs from Altan Çetin with whom she had worked on a number of her early albums. Alongside Çetin, Mert Ekren and Volga Tamöz joined the album's personnel as songwriters.

''Mükemmel'' is a [[Pop music|pop]] album with elements of [[electronic music]]. After "searching for an ambitious name", Yener eventually titled the album after one of the songs in the track list. While the album's release date was changed several times, the final delay happened following the death of hundreds of miners due to the [[Soma mine disaster]]. Due to the huge number of songs in the album, it was decided that it should be released as a two-disc edition. Yener also performed new versions of the songs "Bir Köşede Yalnız" and "Kış Masalı" for the album, both of which were previously released and performed by [[Ajda Pekkan]] and [[Sezen Aksu]] respectively. On the song "Unutanlar Gibi", Mehmet Erdem appeared as the featuring artist. "O Kadın Gitti" was the only song in the album that was written by Yener herself. [[Music journalism|Music critics]] wrote generally positive reviews for the album and praised the "innovation and experimental works" in it.

''Mükemmel'' ranked third on D&R's Best-Selling list in Turkey and, according to [[MÜ-YAP]], it sold more than 50,000 copies. Three separate music videos were released for the songs "Alt Dudak", "Naber" and "Hani Bana", the first of which ranked second on [[Türkçe Top 20]], while the second one rose to the third position on the chart. ''Mükemmel'' received the Best Album award at the Golden Objective Awards organized by the Magazin Journalists Association. In April 2015, the album was again released under the title ''Sebastian + Mükemmel''. It was a three-disc edition, the first of which contained Yener's new single "Sebastian" and three other songs which she had performed for other albums. Many of the songs in the album were later included in Yener's compilation album ''İki Deli'', which was released in December 2015. To promote the album, Yener appeared on various television programs and went on a concert tour known as [[Sebastian 2015 Tour]].

== Music and visuals ==
''Mükemmel'' is a [[Pop music|pop]] album with elements of [[electronic music]].<ref name="kibris"/><ref name="yavuz"/> In Yener's words "It's a complete mix. It contains both Hande Yener's romantic songs, and songs that resemble my old works. The songs that have an electronic effect are a lot of fun. I just wanted an album to impress everyone. I didn't want it to have one style. We included songs with elements of [[rock and roll]], [[R&B]], [[reggae]]."<ref name="kibris"/> As they did not want to choose between the songs that had already been prepared for the album, the company released all of the pieces in a two-disc edition.<ref name="kibris"/> The album contains fourteen songs, two [[Cover version|cover]]s and six [[remix]]es. Five remixes were prepared for the song "Alt Dudak",<ref name="sadi"/> which is the opening piece in both of the discs and was described by Sadi Tirak as an "awesome hit". The song "Herkes Yoluna" is one of the songs on the first disc and was described by Yavuz Hakan Tok as the "album's most powerful hit". "Unutanlar Gibi" was released as a duet between Yener and Mehmet Erdem. Out of the album's two cover songs, the first one was included in the album's first disc, and was a cover of Sezen Aksu's song "Kış Masalı" from her album ''Sezen Aksu Söylüyor'' (1989) (Its name was changed to "Bir Kış Masalı" in the album). The second cover, "Bir Köşede Yalnız", was included in the second disc and was originally performed by [[Ajda Pekkan]] for her album ''Süper Star 2'' (1979). The song "Karar Ver", inspired by the pop songs of the 1980s, was described by critics as the album's best song.<ref name="yavuz"/><ref name="cem"/> The second disc begins by the song "Hani Bana", written and composed by Mert Ekren. "Alt Dudak", "Hani Bana" and the other piece composed by Erken, "Naber", which includes a melody with syllabic [[Prosody (music)|prosody]],<ref name="yavuz"/> are the songs for which separate music videos were made and released. The song "Mükemmel" was created after Yener and her team spent time in the studio looking for an ambitious name for the album they were preparing.<ref name="kibris"/> The only song in the album that was written by Yener herself is "O Kadın Gitti".

On the album's cover, which was taken by Tayfun Çetinkaya, Yener wore a golden gilded outfit and posed with her yellow hair. In one of the album's promotional concerts in Bursa, she wore the same outfit and her weight gain became a subject of many tabloid news. Later, ''[[Akşam]]'' reported that the outfit was similar to the one used by [[Rihanna]] in the music video for her song "[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]" (''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'', 2009).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/magazin/life/olay-kiyafeti-rihanna-giymis/haber-317723|title=Olay kıyafeti Rihanna giymiş!|newspaper=Akşam|first=Erçin|last=Dağ Eysen|date=22 June 2014|accessdate=22 June 2014}}</ref> Yavuz Hakan Tok criticized the album's cover and photographs by saying that "Yener's messy and sloppy image, which was intended to be different and frivolous, turned out to be funny and meaningless". He also wrote that the album booklet could be much more ambitious.<ref name="yavuz"/>

== Critical reception ==
''Mükemmel'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Some critics praised Yener's innovations in this album.

He also wrote that Yener seemed to have stopped moving on "the curve of decline on which she had stuck for years".<ref name="yavuz">{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatmuzik.com/2014/06/yavuz-hakan-tok-hande-yener-mukemmel.html|title=Mükemmel'i MEEEE-RAAAK-EEEET-TİK|publisher=Hayat Müzik|first=Yavuz Hakan|last=Tok|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=28 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823111550/http://www.hayatmuzik.com/2014/06/yavuz-hakan-tok-hande-yener-mukemmel.html|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref>
