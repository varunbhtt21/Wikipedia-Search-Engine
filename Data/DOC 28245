===[[Walt Disney]]===

:<small>''Nominator(s): [[User:Forbidden User|Forbidden User]] ([[User talk:Forbidden User|talk]]) 14:07, 4 May 2014 (UTC)''</small>

This article is about Walt Disney, a founder of [[Walt Disney Company]], and more than that, the founder of a new era of entertainment. Throughout his life, he has made tremendous contributions to the world by providing refreshing forms of entertainment. That's why the page is made. I believe it meets the [[featured article|featured articles criteria]], details as follows:
#For '''writing quality''',
:*It is ''very fluently and extensively written'', polished by lots of editors, having received great peer reviews.
:*It is ''well-researched and comprehensive'',detailed covering his whole life with abundant evidence.
:*It does not one-sidedly praise Walt Disney for his great achievements, instead it also mentions the fact he is a chain smoker and he had dow:nfalls in career, as well as constructive criticisms towards him. However, it fairly elaborated on the fact, not trying to cover up thses bits of his life.
#For '''style guideline''',
:*It has ''detailed'' and ''clear'' section-headings, as well as an adequately substantial table of contents which is concise, comparable to other encyclopedias. The main way it categorisis its rich contents is by the timeline of his life, and inside are further divisions by the nature of events, etc. I personaaly find it very convenient, especially when trying to find information about a particular period in his life or specific events.
#For '''media''', it contains rich images on his life events, which all come from reliable sources without copyright infringement. 
#For '''length''', it is long as it is ''extensively'' written, yet it stays on Walt himself, not going off to his enterprise,[[Walt Disney Company]]. It has no nonsense in it, and summarising of vast information is well-done.
I hope this article will be featured, for enhancing the quality of [[Wikipedia]] as well as honouring this great creator of a world of imaginations.[[User:Forbidden User|Forbidden User]] ([[User talk:Forbidden User|talk]]) 14:07, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' – [https://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=Walt_Disney As far as I can see], you don't even feature on the contributions page.  Looking at your user page, you only joined a few days ago, so I should think it highly unlikely that you have fully prepared this for FAC.

*'''Strong oppose/suggest withdrawal'''; this article isn't even at GA status, and with good reason: there are, for example, numerous unsourced statements, unreliable sources (e.g. Island Net, IMDB), and instances of poor organization.

:so, you guys wanna say that I couldnt nominate a page as FA unless I am a major contributor? And btw, this is nothing spammy, Im serious in this, so do not leave spams calling meaningful words 'spams'[[User:Forbidden User|Forbidden User]] ([[User talk:Forbidden User|talk]]) 11:12, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::That's generally how FAC works, yes; you should've really read the criteria beforehand.  If you intend to nominate an article at FAC which you have had no prior interest in, then you could have at least let the major contributors know. Then it would have been up to the delegates to allow it.  For all you know, the major contributors may have been intending to bring Disney to FAC themselves.

:::Thanks a lot. I think I should inform them on the talk page and let them get their preparation or perhaps improvements needed. I think there will be a decision soon. However, please do leave comments for us to improve! [[User:Forbidden User|Forbidden User]] ([[User talk:Forbidden User|talk]]) 16:47, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::::I suggest you open a [[WP:PR|peer review]] in that case.  [[User:Cassianto|<span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Cassianto</span>]][[User_talk:Cassianto|<sup>talk</sup>]]  17:49, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per above. '''[[User:Jj98|JJ98]]''' ([[User talk:Jj98|Talk]]) 21:27, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:[[User:Jj98|JJ98]] please leave some comments on how to improve the page. I fell that it will help not only this article, but wikipedia as a whole![[User:Forbidden User|Forbidden User]] ([[User talk:Forbidden User|talk]]) 06:47, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::Just because I want look as [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] as an FA example. I would suggest to add a [[WP:Good article]], but it isn't since there are few ciation needed tags and several paragraphs like "1955–1966: Theme parks and beyond" and "Legacy: 1967–present" are unsorced.

:::Thanks a lot. We will take this into account. Good luck editing![[User:Forbidden User|Forbidden User]] ([[User talk:Forbidden User|talk]]) 07:25, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
