==Etymology==
Kokish is an adaptation of ''k'wagis'', meaning "notched beach", the name of a former village at the mouth of the river.  Another meaning given by artist and chief [[Mungo Martin]] is that Kokish is a corruption of the [[Kwak'wala]] word, ''Gwegis'', for "place where river spreads".<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/25642.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Kokish River"]</ref>
