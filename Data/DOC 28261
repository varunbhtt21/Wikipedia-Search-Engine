Title : Sir Joseph Hoare, 1st Baronet
Text : '''Sir Joseph Hoare, 1st Baronet''' (25 December 1707 – 24 December 1801) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] politician.

Hoare was the son of [[Edward Hoare (politician)|Edward Hoare]], the Member of Parliament for Cork, and Grace Burton. His family had settled in Ireland during the early part of the seventeenth century.<ref>John Burke, ''A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire'', Volume 1 (H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1832), 615.</ref>

Hoare was educated in law and practised as a barrister in Ireland. He was elected to the [[Irish House of Commons]] as the MP for [[Askeaton (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Askeaton]] in 1761. He held the office for an unusually long period of time, sitting until 1800, when the seat was disenfranchised following the [[Acts of Union 1800]] when the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was dissolved. He was created a [[baronet]], of Annabella in the [[Baronetage of Ireland]] on 10 December 1784.<ref>John Burke, ''A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire'', Volume 1 (H. Colburn and R. Bentley, 1832), 615.</ref> He passionately opposed the union between the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and spoke at length against it in the House of Commons, despite being ninety years old at the time. He died shortly thereafter.

He married Catherine Somerville, the daughter of [[Sir James Somerville, 1st Baronet]]. Together they had four children. He was succeeded by his only son, [[Sir Edward Hoare, 2nd Baronet|Edward]].<ref>John Burke, ''A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire'', Volume 1 (H.
