==Colors==
-    The Colours of the Regt are '''Red and Green'''. In the strict martial sense, these colours when seen in unison depict the traditional Verey Light success signal of '''“Red over Green”''' which signifies victory in battle. In a generic sense, Red is the traditional cavalry colour signifying supreme sacrifice while Green stands for the basic desire for peace, harmony, and well being of all ranks of the Regt. Seen together, the colours signify the '''Regt’s prep for the supreme sacrifice when called upon to do so, from a basic stance of peace, harmony and well-being.''' These colours adorn the flag of the Regt.

==Cap Badge==
.   The Regt badge was designed by '''Lt Gen (then Maj) AB Shivane,PVSM, AVSM, VSM, ADC.''' It symbolises an amalgamation of tradition and modernity. The cavalry heritage is represented by two pennants interposed at the centre with a horseshoe; and modernity is depicted by the hull of a T-72 M1 below the horseshoe. A scroll below this carries the word '''“DIGVIJAY”''' in Devnagri script.

The shoulder title consists of the numeral '''"50"''' in brass.
