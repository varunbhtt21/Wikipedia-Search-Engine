'''Geoma Records''' is a British [[independent record label]] which was founded by George David in 2013.

==History==

Geoma Records was founded in Spring 2013 as a label name for a social media based dance release for the song "Feel My Rhythm" by [[Viralites]]. The single, released digitally only, managed to secure a midweek Number 40 chart position in the UK chart and an end of week number 92. The single only had 24 hours of only social media promotion to generate all the sales secured. Shortly after they were invited to work with another label where they were responsible for the management of a new boyband known as [[M.A.D]]. M.A.D managed to secure a Number 37 chart position with their debut release "Toyboy"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/2013-11-09/ |title=Official Charts Company &#124;  |publisher=officialcharts.com |date=2013-11-09 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref> after just 10 weeks together as band. Further on the label released a follow up single called "Fame & TV" which peaked at number 32 in the official chart,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/2014-03-01/ |title=Official Charts Company &#124;  |publisher=officialcharts.com |date=2014-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref> although the single did hit number 26 in the Scottish Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/22/2014-03-01/ |title=Official Charts Company &#124;  |publisher=officialcharts.com |date=2014-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref>
