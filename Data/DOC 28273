==Description and history==
The Moore Parish House and Library is located in Steuben's village center, on the south side of Village Road, between the town's triangular green and [[United States Route 1]].  It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboarded exterior, and a foundation that is part stone and part poured concrete.  It consists of an original portion, roughly five bays wide, that was built in 1911, and a two-bay extension added to the right in 2007.  The roof of the original portion has deep overhanging eaves with exposed rafter ends in the Craftsman style, and a complex pattern of window layout.  A gabled entry projects near the center of this section, with a porch supported by round columns sheltering an entry with flanking sidelight windows.  To the left of the entrance are row of stepped fixed-pane windows, marking the presence of a staircase.  The interior includes an auditorium with stage, smaller meeting spaces, and two rooms used by the local historical society, in addition to the library facilities.<ref name=NRHP/>

The original portion of the building was completed in July 1911 and publicly dedicated a month later.  The building was a gift to the town of native son Henry Dyer Moore, a businessman active in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]].  It has served the town since then as its public library, and as a community meeting space.<ref name=NRHP/>  The building was enlarged in 2007 to provide additional meeting spaces and code-compliant access facilities; the architect was Sam Woodward.<ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=http://www.moorelibrary.org/about.shtml|title=About the Moore Library|publisher=Moore Library|accessdate=2015-11-21}}</ref>
