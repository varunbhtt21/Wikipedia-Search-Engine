''Summary:'' Not much to report this week. The same post-Easter celebrations (4/20, Earth Day) were popular again this year, except last year we were still reeling from the [[Boston Marathon bombing|Boston Marathon bombing]]. Now Americans have the triumph of their countryman [[Meb Keflezighi]] to reflect on instead.

For the week of April 20 to 26, the 25 most popular articles on Wikipedia, as determined from the report of the [[User:West.andrew.g/Popular pages|5,000 most viewed pages]], were:

|[[File:Snoop Dogg 2012.jpg|left|100x100px]]
|This year [[Easter Sunday]] coincided with [[4/20]], the potheads' celebration, and ubertoker Snoop Dogg marked the date both with a sell-out concert  at the [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] and a video of a "real Easter bunny" posted on [[Instagram]]. Those two together, may be enough to explain his massive one-day surge a day later, or may not, but I'm not about to dis Snoop Dogg.

|It's hard to remember these days, under the onslaught of bunnies, chocolate eggs and marshmallow peeps, that Easter, not Christmas, is the most sacred date of the Christian calendar. Doubtless a lot of people learned that this week, along with some fairly eye-raising information about the events it actually celebrates.

||[[File:Amazon.com-Logo.svg|left|100x100px]] 
|This article has been veering wildly (and suspiciously) around the view graph for several weeks, but at least now its presence on the list has a reason: [[Amazon Fire TV]] is a digital streaming device to watch online content on a HDTV. How it distinguishes itself from the three or four other such devices currently on the market is a matter of some dispute.

|[[File:UCSC 420 celebration.jpg|left|100x100px]]
| This curious "holiday", which falls on April 20 (for obvious reasons) refers to the mysterious number 420 and its long link to marijuana usage. While it may not quite be to cannabis what [[Oktoberfest]] is to beer, it no doubt aspires to be.

|It's not surprising that this was released in foreign markets before its home territory; the original ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' made $822 million worldwide, with the domestic and international grosses split roughly 50/50. The rebooted ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (film)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (this film's predecessor) made $752 million worldwide, but with international grosses now comprising 2/3 the total. This radical shift in Hollywood's biosphere has taken place in just a decade, and it is already altering hunting strategies, for good or ill; even after just two weeks overseas, this movie has already made $132 million.

|[[Saint Patrick]] is the patron saint of Ireland because he converted the Irish to Christianity. [[Saint Andrew]] is the patron saint of Scotland because his relics were supposedly transported there 1000 years ago. [[Saint David]] is the patron saint of [[Wales]] because he was a local boy made good. [[Saint George]] is the patron saint of England because... reasons. It says something about the English attitude towards religion that their chosen patron saint was a [[Palestinian]] who died centuries before their country even existed and is mostly famous for [[Saint George and the Dragon|doing something fictional]]. Still, with the rise of Celtic regional nationalism, his flag has become ever more popular in England, as is his [[saint's day]], which falls this week and got a [[Google Doodle]].

|Massive one-day  spike on April 22 for the popular image-sharing site. Doesn't look artificial but with no immediately obvious rationale it's essentially impossible for me to determine why it happened.
|}

* Number of views needed to reach Top 25 this week: 225,448. Last week: 277,266.

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:West.andrew.g/Popular_pages&oldid=605990825 The revision] of [[WP:5000]] containing the data used to create this list.

*'''Almosts''':	[[List of Arrow episodes]] (224,622 views); [[Indian general election, 2014]] (222,626 views);  [[2 States (film)]] (217,613 views) 

==Exclusions==

* This list excludes the Wikipedia main page, non-article pages (such as redlinks), and anomalous entries (such as DDoS attacks or likely automated views). Please keep in mind that the explanations given for these articles' popularity are, fundamentally, guesses. Just because I can't find a reason for an article to be included doesn't mean there isn't one; conversely, just  because a plausible reason is found for a view spike, that doesn't mean it wasn't due to a bot. 

*There are a number of articles that reappear frequently in the top 25 for no determined reason, and have been excluded as likely being due to automated views. Please feel free to discuss any removal on the talk page if you wish.

** [[Java]]/[[JOP]]: Since both of these articles are tied (verbally at least) to the [[Java (programming language)|programming language]], it seems likely that this is a bot searching for that. 
** [[IPv6]]: I have to face facts; I allowed this into the top 25 for months as it is the kind of issue that would appeal to web denizens (ala [[Bitcoin]]) but its insane popularity is just too high explain by human interest alone. It's getting help. 
** [[Ddd]]: Hello? Spambot here. Just checking in. 
** [[History of Bălţi]]: There is simply no logical way to explain the sudden rise of this hyper-obscure article except as the result of a traffic-checking botnet, ala [[cat anatomy]]
** [[Alive]]/[[Alive!]]: Links to disambigs with no apparent reason for being. 
** [[Lycos]]: The geriatric web portal is back. Just when I was saying goodbye to [[Climategate]]. 
**[[Automobile]]: This has been splurging itself all over the view chart for weeks at random. Human beings don't behave this way.

*Specific exclusions this week:

**[[Cotinine]]: suspiciously even two-day spike for this nicotine metabolite. 
**[[Hi-hat]] Rock music instruments have a habit of being pushed by bots on this list (see [[Acoustic Electric Guitar]]- yes the capitals are included).
**[[GARCH]]: One day spike; link to a redirect; no corresponding bump for the main article. Yep. This is fake alright. 
** [[List of Bollywood films of 2013]]: This one caught me off guard; a massive, one day spike for ''last'' year's movie list. There could be any number of reasons for it, but the fact that it was one day only suggests it was inflated. 
** [[Canal+]]: Well, they show ''Game of Thrones'' in Spain. Other than that, ''Eh?''.
