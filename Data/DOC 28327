*'''Delete''' as a duplication of [[Live album]]. The stuff about pseudo-live recordings seems trivial and is unsourced.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 16:44, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as per above. --[[User:Clarkcj12|Clarkcj12]] ([[User talk:Clarkcj12|talk]]) 20:35, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
