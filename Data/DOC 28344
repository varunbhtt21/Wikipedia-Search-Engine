'''''The Queen Is in the Factory''''' ({{lang-tr|Kraliçe Fabrika'da}}) is a 2008 Turkish [[drama film]], directed by Ali Kemal Güven, which follows the lives of homosexual young living together in the underbelly of Istanbul. The film didn't get distribution for various reasons.

==Plot==
Yagmur (Dicle Kartal) is a young woman with very strict boundaries. She lives in Istanbul and works as a fashion editor. Yagmur doesn't accept the fact that her brother Bulut (Cagri Aslan) is gay. Bulut, wishing to be a play writer someday created himself a world in his home where he can play Andy Warhol. And he named it Factory.

Life is a struggle for these two high-class children. While Yagmur is fighting against her boyfriends (Fatih Gunaydin) marriage expectations, Bulut is trying to fall in step with his boyfriends life (Senol demir). While these two different relationships have their own battles trying to survive in some way, a death will change everything.
