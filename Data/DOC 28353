==Accident==

Direct cause of the accident was passing signal at danger ([[signal passed at danger|SPAD]]) by Tadeusz Mościcki, engineer of [[Polish State Railways]]' ''Silesia Express'' no. 41008 from [[Praha hlavní nádraží|Prague Central Station]] to [[Warszawa Wschodnia]] railway station in a mist with very low visibility and overrode the last carriage of [[Szklarska Poręba]]-Warszawa Wschodnia PKP's stopping train no.6114.

Second train was travelling at 12 mph (17 km/h) while Mościcki was driving his 120-tonnes electric locomotive series [[ET22]] no. 1054 at nearly 75 mph (120 km/h).

From circa 80 passengers travelling in the last carriage of Szklarska's train, [[telescoping (railway)|telescoped]] by ''Silesia's'' locomotive, 15 were killed at the moment of collision and one gravely injured person died later in hospital. 43 people were injured.

==Aftermath==

Two commissions: one from Scientific Railroading Institute and Regional Laboratory of Automatic and another formed by members of National Labour Inspectorate never ruled with 100% certainty whether Mościcki passing signal at danger indeed or it was malfunction of [[Railway signal|signal]]ling.

According to engineer of Szklarska's train block signal no.94 shown a red aspect which order to stop and proceed after two minutes with maximum speed of 13 mph (20 km/h). Mościcki stated during all legal case that the same block signal shown green aspect. There was no [[Automatic Train Protection|ATP]]-like system on PKP at that time.

''Silesia's'' driver was found not guilty of the accident because of lack of evidence that signal had a red aspect ("all stop" signal) which would inform that there would be a train on preceding rail block ("in dubio pro reo" rule – "when in doubt, for the accused"). He never returned to work in PKP.
