[[Allmusic]] critic Stewart Mason described "Precious" as Hynde's "true calling card."<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|title=Precious|author=Mason, S.|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/precious-mt0000290221|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>   [[Allmusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] praised [[James Honeyman-Scott]]'s "phased, treated guitar" playing for how it supplements the "pounding [[rhythm]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Pretenders|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine, S.T.]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pretenders-mw0000387388|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>  Music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] described the lyrics as a "strafing stream of syllables" mixing "speed rap, [[jive talk]], baby babble," and the song as "punk scat, all hiccoughs, vocal tics, gasps and feral growls, weirdly poised between love and hate, oral sensuality and [[staccato]], stabbing aggression."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll|author=[[Simon Reynolds|Reynolds, S.]]|page=239|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn= 9780674802735}}</ref> 

Mason notes that the music of "Precious" maintains some restraint, but still sounds more threatening than other songs which sound angrier.<ref name=allmusic/>  The climax of "Precious" comes when Hynde sings the line "But not me, baby, I'm too precious/Fuck off!"<ref name=allmusic/>  ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' critic Charles Aaron noted that Hynde's singing this line "over whipsaw guitars" made it clear that Hynde "was more than a bewitching pout."<ref>{{cite news|title=The 50 Greatest Bands|page=74|author=Aaron, C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qK2SnZnMMaoC&pg=PA74&dq=precious+pretenders&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TP-YU6CJOaO-sQSXiYLADg&ved=0CCIQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&q=precious%20pretenders&f=false|date=February 2002|accessdate=2014-06-11|newspaper=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic Ken Tucker noted that he gets "startled and shivery when Hynde rejects a would-be lothario" with this line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pretenders |author=Tucker, K. |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pretenders2/albums/album/259325/review/5945712/the_pretenders |date=April 17, 1980 |accessdate=2014-06-11 |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107032528/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pretenders2/albums/album/259325/review/5945712/the_pretenders |archivedate=November 7, 2007 }}</ref>  According to Mason, the restraint until that point makes this climax "more explosive."<ref name=allmusic/>  According to ''Rolling Stone'' critic Bud Scoppa, the line was actually supposed to be "But not me, baby, I'm too precious/I had to fuck off" but Hynde swallowed the words "I had to."<ref name=rs>{{cite web|title=Pretenders |author=Scoppa, B. |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/259325/review/6561334/thepretenders |date=November 11, 2004 |accessdate=2014-06-11 |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207135357/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/259325/review/6561334/thepretenders |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}</ref>  Scoppa also notes the "fearlessness" with which Hynde sings this line.<ref name=rs/>  Ariel Swartley wrote in ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' about the cathartic effect of this line for women in dance clubs:  

<blockquote>Dozens of women, otherwise amicably engaged with partners, would stop short and mouth along with Hynde's switchblade-sharp delivery of her famous "Fuck off" line. (Predictably, there were men on the same dance floor bemoaning Hynde's "macho" stance, so different from the women they knew.  ''Hmmm''.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Girls! Live!

Mr. Stress, referenced in the line "Now [[Howard the Duck]] and Mr. Stress both stayed", is the stage name of the Cleveland blues musician Bill Miller.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blues Legend Returns to the Heights|author=Henke, James|url=http://www.mrstress.net/Stress_HeightsObserver.pdf|publisher=Heights Observer|accessdate=2014-08-21}}</ref> Hynde briefly became a member of the Mr. Stress Blues Band, but Miller felt that Hynde's interest in original rock music didn't fit in with what Miller wanted to do, which was traditional blues. In an interview, Miller claimed that he told Hynde she would "probably have to go to Europe to get anyone to listen to you."<ref>{{cite web|title=Bluesman Miller's gigs prove stresses won't slow him down|author=Petcovic, John|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2011/07/bluesman_millers_gigs_prove_st.html|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=2014-08-21}}</ref>
