Patton, with [[Thomas Hinds]] and [[William Lattimore]], had made their way up the [[Pearl River (Mississippiâ€“Louisiana)|Pearl River]] in 1820 in search of a suitable location.<ref>{{cite web | title = Mississippi: The WPA Guide to the Magnolia State | publisher = Viking Press | date = 1938 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C4VQ8viRWvYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 210, 211 }}</ref>

Patton was described in 1880 as:
<blockquote>One of the leading men of his day, of great personal popularity.  He resided in Winchester, then a beautiful village, which he made a center of political influence, second only to Natchez. Judge [[Powhatan Ellis]] and Judge [[John Black (U.S. Senator)|John Black]], who both became U.S. Senators, commenced life there under his auspices, as did several other prominent men.  He was a man of courtly manners, a fine writer and impressive speaker; was elected Lieutenant-Governor and would have attained the highest honor of the State, but for his premature death.<ref>{{cite book | last = Claiborne | first = John Francis Hamtramck | title = Mississippi, as a Province, Territory and State: With Biographical Notices of Eminent Citizens | publisher = Power & Barksdale | year = 1880 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cH8TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 356}}</ref></blockquote>
