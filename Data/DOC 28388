:* ''Comment'': Translated from the corresponding article [[:de:Anatol (Schauspiel)]] on the German Wikipedia
<small>Created by [[User:FireflySixtySeven|FireflySixtySeven]] ([[User talk:FireflySixtySeven|talk]]), [[User:Huon|Huon]] ([[User talk:Huon|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:FireflySixtySeven|FireflySixtySeven]] ([[User talk:FireflySixtySeven|talk]]) at 15:09, 4 May 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] Long enough, new enough, and there is no problem with the infranken.de citation for the hook (which is interesting), but that  inline citation is the only one in the whole article. By a tradition here (one I disapprove of, but no matter) we allow the plot to cite itself, but before we can approve this new article for DYK the other sections of the page do need citations throughout, the list of reliable sources given at the end does not do the trick. (''NB'' I have not checked the quality of the translation yet, will do that if the citations are added.) [[User:Moonraker|Moonraker]] ([[User talk:Moonraker|talk]]) 16:54, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

::: Hello {{u|Moonraker}}, I have now added some inline citations, would you please have a look at it again? Thanks. [[User:FireflySixtySeven|FireflySixtySeven]] ([[User talk:FireflySixtySeven|talk]]) 05:06, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Thank you {{u|FireflySixtySeven}}, the citations for the non-plot sections are all right. I found the translation a little clumsy at points (for instance, ''treu'' means "faithful" here, rather than "true", which sounds archaic in that meaning), but I found no major faults. Image is free, so this is ready to go. [[User:Moonraker|Moonraker]] ([[User talk:Moonraker|talk]]) 14:45, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
