The family moved to [[Wales]] and he was educated at [[Stanwell School|Penarth County School]]. He left school at 17 in 1938 and became a civil servant in the Lord Chancellor's Department. Shortly afterwards he joined a territorial battalion of the [[Welsh Regiment]], went to camp in August 1939, and did not return to civil life for over seven years. He spent the first two and a half years of military service in various parts of the UK including [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], and the next four and a half in various parts of the [[Middle East]] which he reached via [[Cape Town]] and [[Aden]]. He returned to the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]] in 1946 and rapidly became in turn an executive officer in the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and an officer of Customs and Excise (his pre-War ambition). A year later, in 1949, he left to accept a place at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], where within two years he was awarded first class in both Parts I and II of the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Geographical]] [[Tripos]].<ref name="RoSoEd">[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/coppock_john.pdf Obituary] by the Royal Society of Edinburgh</ref>

==Career and later life==
After a year as a research student in Cambridge, reading widely and continuing his practice of sampling senior undergraduate courses in other disciplines, he was  appointed to the staff of the Geography Department of [[University College London]], where he remained for fifteen years, as Assistant Lecturer (1950–52), Lecturer (1952–64) and Reader (1964–65). In 1963-64 he also spent a year as visiting senior lecturer in the Department of Geography in the [[University of Ibadan]] in [[Nigeria]].<ref name="RoSoEd" />

Coppock was appointed as the first [[Ogilvie Professor of Human Geography|Ogilvie Professor of Geography]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1965. This professorship is named after [[Alan G. Ogilvie]], a figure who was key to setting up the department. Coppock taught a range of courses in [[economic geography]], [[rural planning]], [[agricultural geography]] and the regional geography of [[Scotland]].  He also initiated the [[Master of Science|MSc]] Course in [[Geographical Information Systems]], the first of its kind in the world. During which time he worked closely with the government advising them on issues of agriculture, tourism, census data and Scottish affairs - introducing a variety of [[cartography]] and [[geographic information systems]]. Through the [[International Geographical Union]], he also advised the [[Canada|Canadian]] government.

Retirement from the Ogilvie Chair in 1986 was followed immediately by his appointment as Secretary and Treasurer of the [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland]], serving until his death in 2000. He also became Chairman of the [[Field Studies Council|Scottish Field Studies Council]] and played a major role in raising half a million pounds for a major development at the field centre at [[Kindrogan House]] in [[Perthshire]] which was appropriately named the Coppock Building in May 1995 when opened by HRH [[The Princess Royal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst8032.html|title=Kindrogan Field Centre from The Gazetteer for Scotland|website=www.scottish-places.info}}</ref>
