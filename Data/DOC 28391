# It's new.
# It's long enough
# It seems reasonably policy compliant though the paraphrasing of the Herman source seems dangerously close at times. 

# The hook is long at 181 chars but within the limit.
# The hook doesn't do much for me but seems reasonably accurate.

# There's a QPQ.
# The image seems to be out of copyright due to its age and seems reasonably clear as a small thumbnail.

[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] So, that's a pass.  ''[[Mazel tov]]''. [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 16:42, 10 May 2014 (UTC) 
:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] "Dangerously close" paraphrasing is not acceptable. It appears that the page creator has copied the Herman source sentence by sentence and then changed around a few words in each sentence. It would be better to rewrite the section in your own words.
:*'''Source''':
:*<blockquote>The third of the seven children of Michael Marks and Miriam (Maduro Peixotto) Davis, Alice Davis Menken was born on August 4, 1870, in New York City. Descended from several prominent European Sephardi families, she was also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution on her mother’s side. Her family was closely tied to Manhattan’s Spanish and Portuguese synagogue of New York City (Shearith Israel). Alice was the great-granddaughter of one of its earliest cantors, Moses Levi Maduro Peixotto. She married Mortimer Morange Menken, an attorney, on October 17, 1893. They had a son, Harold Davis Menken, in 1895.</blockquote>

:*There are also far too many redlinks in the article. If you're not planning on creating these pages in the near future, could you remove them? Thanks, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 21:10, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
{{ping|Yoninah}} No, that's not what I did, but you're entitled to your theory. That comparison is also only the first paragraph, which mostly consists of facts ([[WP:LIMITED]]). The rest are mixed from multiple sources, but there was only one online source on her early life for the mentioned paragraph. But since you're asking, I've obfuscated the information out of its logical order so as to make 100% certain it doesn't resemble its source. I haven't seen a policy against numerous, valid redlinks, but I'm happy to be wrong about that. I'm planning to expand them out eventually.
