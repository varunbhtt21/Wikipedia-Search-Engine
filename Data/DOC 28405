He was pragmatic in his politics, supporting the British authorities while they were in control and transferring his loyalties to the Americans after [[George Rogers Clark]] seized control of the region. In 1779, he was named a [[justice of the peace]] for the district. However, the new government was not able to maintain order and, around the end of 1779, he moved to St. Louis, then under [[Spain|Spanish]] control. His business prospered and he became one of the wealthiest and most influential persons in the area. Control of the [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] territory later passed to France, who [[Louisiana Purchase|sold it to the United States]] in 1803. Cerré died in St. Louis two years later at the age of 70.<ref name=cdob/>

His daughter Marie-Anne married [[Pierre-Louis Panet]], a Montreal notary, and his daughter Marie-Thérèse married [[Auguste Chouteau]], founder of St. Louis.<ref name=cdob/> His youngest daughter Julia married Antoine Pierre Soulard, the king's surveyor for the upper Louisiana territory.<ref name=lion/>
