'''Breton costume''' is the style of clothing worn by the [[Breton people|Bretons]] (people in [[Brittany]], the Celtic region of France) as formal wear or festive clothing. Everyday versions are less varied, although some are decorated according to profession or location.

Since the late twentieth century, the traditional dress is almost always worn during special religious events ([[Pardon (ceremony)|pardons]]) and cultural events involving [[Celtic Circle]]s; leading to the "Breton costume" becoming "[[folk costume]]"  of the region.
