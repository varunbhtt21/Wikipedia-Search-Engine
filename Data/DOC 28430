====Subcellular localization====
[[File:CXorf66 Nuclear Localization Signals.png|thumb|Figure V. CXorf66 Nuclear Localization Signals Across Homologs]]
Using [[PSORT]] II, there is a [[Nuclear localization sequence|nuclear localization signal]] of PYKKKHL at 268aa.<ref name="PSORT">{{cite web | url = http://psort.hgc.jp/ | title = PSORT II | author = Paul Horton | publisher=Psort.hgc.jp|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref> This signal can be seen to be conserved in fellow primate species; however, is not present in other mammals. In addition to this, following SDSC's Biology Workbench's SAPS kNN-Prediction, the CXorf66 protein for humans and the mouse homolog have a 47.8% likelihood to end up in the nuclear region of a cell. For more distant homologs, like Bos taurus, that do not have nuclear localization signals however, CXorf66 has a 34.8% likelihood to end up in the extracellular, including cell wall region, or plasma membrane regions.<ref name="SDSC"/><ref name="PSORT"/> To view several homologs and their nuclear localization signals, see '''Figure V'''.

==Homology==
CXorf66 has no known [[paralogs]] in humans; however CXorf66 has conserved homologs throughout the [[Mammalia]] kingdom. Highly conserved in primates, a noticeable rapid evolution has been spotted for CXorf66, see '''Figure VI''', explaining the greater number of [[orthologs]] in mammals, rather than in invertebrates, birds, and reptiles.<ref name="BLAST">{{cite web | url = http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi | title = BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool | work = Conserved Domain Database | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate =2015-03-11  }}</ref>
