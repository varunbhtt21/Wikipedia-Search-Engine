Title : Nagapattinam Port
Text : '''Nagapattinam Port''' (''nākappaṭṭi<u>n</u>am'', previously spelt '''Nagapatnam''' or '''Negapatam''') is a port in the South Indian town of [[Nagapattinam]] in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is a natural port located in the shores of [[Bay of Bengal]]. The port came to prominence during the period of [[Medieval Cholas]] (9th −12th century CE) and served as their important port for commerce and east bound naval expeditions.

Nagapattinam was settled by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and, later, the Dutch under whom it served as the capital of [[Dutch Coromandel]] from 1660 to 1781 CE. In November 1781, the town was conquered by the [[British East India Company]]. The port was an important port for the colonial empires until Thoothukudi port became the primary port in the [[Coramandel]].

The port came to prominence during the period of [[Medieval Cholas]] (9th −12th century CE) and served as their important port for commerce and east bound naval expeditions.

In the early 16th century the Portuguese started commercial contacts with the town through the port and established a commercial centre in 1554 CE. The Portuguese also conducted missionary enterprise in the town.{{sfn|Francis|2002|p=139}} In 1658, the Dutch established an agreement between King Vijaya Nayakkar of Thanjavur on 5 January 1662. Ten villages were transferred from the Portuguese to the Dutch – Nagapattinam Port, Puthur, Muttam, Poruvalancheri, Anthanappettai, Karureppankadu, AzhingiMangalam, Sangamangalam, Thiruthinamangalam, Manjakollai, Nariyankudi. As per agreement between the first Maratta King Egoji of Thanjavur and the Dutch, Naagapattinam and surrounding villages were handed over to the Dutch on 30 December 1676. In 1690, the capital of [[Dutch Coromandel]] changed from [[Pulicat]] to Nagapattinam.{{sfn|Francis|2002|p=139}}

This town fell into the hands of the British in 1781 after the two naval battles between British and French fleets were fought off the coast of Negapatam, as it was then known: the [[Battle of Negapatam (1758)|first in 1758]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)|second in 1782]] as part of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The town was [[Siege of Negapatam|taken by the British]] from the Dutch in 1781 (who had been [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|formally brought into the war]] in 1780).{{sfn|Francis|2002|p=136}} When the Dutch and British [[Treaty of Paris (1784)|reached a peace agreement in 1784]], Nagapattinam was formally ceded to the British. 277 villages with Nagore as the headquarters were handed over to the [[East India Company]].

From 1799 to 1845 CE Nagapttinam was the headquarters of Tanjore district.{{sfn|Francis|2002|p=161}} The town remained one of the chief ports to the [[Madras Presidency]]. The port suffered decline after the inclusion of [[Tranquebar]] and [[Tuticorin]] ports. The port was one of the ports severely affected by the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].{{sfn|About the town|2011}}{{sfn|Nagapattinam Municipality features|2011}}{{sfn|Nagapattinam district profile|2011}}{{sfn|Nagapattinam district local administration|2011}}
