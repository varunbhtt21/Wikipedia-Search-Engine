In a rematch of a regular season meeting which had been won 86-60 by Florida in Gainesville, the Gators survived 25 points and 12 rebounds from Buckeyes center [[Greg Oden]] with stellar play from guards [[Lee Humphrey]] and [[Taurean Green]] with inside contributions coming from [[Al Horford]] (18 points) and tourney Most Outstanding Player [[Corey Brewer]]. [[Billy Donovan]] became the third-youngest coach (at age 41) to win two titles. Only Bob Knight (at Indiana) and [[University of San Francisco|San Francisco]]'s [[Phil Woolpert]] both won two titles at the age of 40.

The Gators are the first team ever to hold the NCAA Division I college football and basketball titles in the same academic year (2006–07) and calendar year (2006 and 2007). Coincidentally, Florida also beat Ohio State (by a score of 41–14) in the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|College Football Championship]], the first time in college sports history that identical matchups and results have occurred in both football and basketball championships. This was also the first time in NCAA D-I men's basketball history that exactly the same starting five were able to win back-to-back titles ([[Joakim Noah]], [[Corey Brewer]], [[Lee Humphrey]], [[Al Horford]], [[Taurean Green]]). Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA Tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47. Humphrey surpassed [[Bobby Hurley]]'s record of 42.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=274000063|title=Florida becomes first team in 15 years to repeat; Brewer is MOP|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>
