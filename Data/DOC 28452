'''Cerro Summit''' (el. 8,042&nbsp;ft.) is a [[mountain pass]] in the [[Colorado|State of Colorado]], located about 14 miles east of [[Montrose, Colorado]]. It divides the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Cimarron River (Gunnison River)|Cimmaron River]] to the east and the [[Uncompahgre River]] to the west, both of which eventually flow into the [[Gunnison River]].

The summit is traversed by [[U.S. Route 50 in Colorado|U.S. Route 50]].  Until 1949, Cerro Summit was part of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad's]] Black Canyon line which ran between [[Gunnison, Colorado|Gunnison]] and Montrose.<ref>http://www.drgw.net/info/BlackCanyon</ref> When constructed in 1882, the route was originally part of the D&RGW's [[transcontinental line]] to [[Salt Lake City]] and remained so until more direct routes were built in the early 20th Century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cure/learn/historyculture/railroad.htm|title=Narrow Gauge Railroad Through Black Canyon - Curecanti National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref> 

Although [[Grade (slope)|grades]] on [[U.S. 50]] are gentle, the former rail line over Cerro Summit had a [[ruling gradient]] of 4% or 1 in 25 and it was not uncommon for most freight trains to require a [[Bank engine|banker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blackstonemodels.com/new/c19/c19history.php|title=Blackstone Models|website=blackstonemodels.com|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>

Since 2015, Cerro Summit has been home to the Cerro Summit Recreation Area, an [[Open space reserve|open space]] managed by the City of Montrose which features a network of hiking trails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.montrosepress.com/news/outdoors/go-explore-the-cerro-summit-trails/article_df22ebec-26c2-11e5-a37b-d3554018ffa1.html|title=Go explore the Cerro Summit trails|last=Brandt|first=Laurie|work=Montrose Daily Press|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en}}</ref>
