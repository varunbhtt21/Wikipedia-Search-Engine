'''Miss France''' (foaled 23 March 2011) is an Irish-bred, French-trained [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse. In May 2014 she won the [[1000 Guineas]].

==Background==
Miss France is a bay filly with no white [[Horse markings|markings]], bred in Ireland by Dayton Investments. She was sired by Dansili, whose other progeny have included [[Harbinger (horse)|Harbinger]], [[The Fugue]], [[Dank (horse)|Dank]] and [[Rail Link (horse)|Rail Link]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?horse_id=503875&popup=1&tab=stud |title=Dansili Stud Record |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> Her dam, Miss Tahiti, was a top-class racemare who won the [[Group races|Group One]] [[Prix Marcel Boussac]] in 1995.

==Racing career==

===2013: two-year-old season===
Miss France began her racing career at [[Deauville Racecourse]] on 1 August when she finished ninth of the ten runners in a [[maiden race]] over 1200 metres. On 31 August she started [[Fractional odds|5.3/1]] second favourite for a race over 1600 metres at [[Chantilly Racecourse]]. Ridden by [[Maxime Guyon]], she accelerated clear of her opponents in the last 200 metres to win by one and a quarter [[Horse length|lengths]] from Indonesienne, a filly who went on to win the Prix Marcel Boussac.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=586618&r_date=2013-08-31&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Prix de la Mare aux Oiseaux result |publisher=[[Racing Post]] |date=31 August 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref> Four weeks after her win at Chantilly, Miss France was sent to England to contest the Group Three [[Oh So Sharp Stakes]] over seven furlongs at [[Newmarket Racecourse]]. She was ridden by [[Mickael Barzalona]] and started 7/2 second favourite in a nine runner field. After being restrained at the back of the field he moved forward to take the lead inside the final furlong and prevailed by a head from Lightning Thunder, despite appearing to idle in the closing stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=586423&r_date=2013-09-27&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Oh So Sharp Stakes result |publisher=Racing Post |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref>

===2014: three-year-old season===
On her first appearance as a three-year-old, Miss France started 8/5 favourite for the Group Three [[Prix Imprudence]] over 1400 metres at [[Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse]] on 3 April. She never looked likely to win and finished sixth of the ten runners behind the [[Francois Doumen]]-trained outsider Xcellence. On 4 May Miss France started the 7/1 third favourite for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Ridden by Guyon, she took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off a late challenge from Lighting Thunder to win by a neck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/27277337 |title=BBC Sport - 1,000 Guineas: Miss France triumphs at Newmarket |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=4 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref>

On 15 June, the filly was moved up in distance for the [[Prix de Diane]] over 2100 metres at Chantilly. Guyon struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight before finishing strongly to dead-heat for fifth place, one and three quarter lengths behind the winner [[Avenir Certain]]. In August, Miss France finished second behind her stable companion Esoterique in the Group One [[Prix Rothschild]] at Deauville, with the British-trained favourite [[Integral (horse)|Integral]] in third place. In October, Miss France returned to Newmarket for the Group One [[Sun Chariot Stakes]] in which she was one of four 7/2 co-favourites alongside Fintry, Esoterique and Integral. She raced in third place for most of the way before finishing second, a length behind Integral.

===2015: four-year-old season===
After an absence of more than ten months, Miss France returned to the track in the Listed Prix de la Cochere at Longchamp on 6 September and finished second of the nine runners, a short neck behind the three-year-old winner Sonnerie.
