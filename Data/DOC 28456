The '''Banna people''', (also referred to as '''Bena''') are an ethnic group in [[Ethiopia]]. They live in an area around [[Chari Mountain]] near [[Kako Town]] and a savanna area near [[Dimeka]]. They speak [[Hamer-Banna]], which they share substantially with the [[Hamer language|Hamer]]. According to the 2007 census, they number about 27,000. They engage primarily in agriculture and supplement this by pastoralism, hunting, and gathering. They are mainly Muslim, however, several thousand are Christian, and they have their own king. <ref>''Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia''; by David H. Shinn, Thomas P. Ofcansky, p. 69</ref>
