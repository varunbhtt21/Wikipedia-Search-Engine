For all the claims of Wikipedia bringing the world's knowledge to all who want it, it seems that the human race most wants a tabloid newspaper; a quick source for TV listings, pop culture facts, celebrity gossip and, above all, scandalâ€”with some nice juicy racism thrown in too. 

'''For the full top 25 list, see [[WP:TOP25]]. See [[Wikipedia:Top 25 Report#Exclusions|this section]] for an explanation for any exclusions.'''

For the week of 27 April to 3 May, the ten most popular articles on Wikipedia, as determined from the report of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:West.andrew.g/Popular_pages&oldid=606987560 5,000 most viewed pages], were:

|What's more likely to generate watercooler conversation than a racist outburst by a privileged aged white guy? A ''nonsensical'' racist outburst. If one does not wish to "associate with black people", as he put it, owning a basketball team is probably not the way to go. And if he doesn't want black people "brought to his games," one wonders how he deals with his team's roster, which currently consists of 12 black individuals and two Caucasians. He's been banned from the NBA, though that is unlikely to affect his revenue stream.

|For a sequel to a reboot no one asked for, this movie is proving very popular with the public; after finally opening in its home territory, it scored $35 million on its first day, on top of $155 million it has already earned overseas. It's not surprising that this was released in foreign markets before its home territory; the original ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' made $822 million worldwide, with the domestic and international grosses split roughly 50/50. The rebooted ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (film)|Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (this film's predecessor) made $752 million worldwide, but with international grosses now comprising 2/3 the total. This radical shift in Hollywood's biosphere has taken place in just a decade, and it is already altering hunting strategies, for good or ill.

|Much loved and respected actor who passed away on 29 April. Although he played the quintessential well'ard Cockney in films like ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' and ''[[Mona Lisa (film)|Mona Lisa]]'', Hoskins was perhaps ironically best known for playing the American PI pastiche [[Eddie Valiant]] in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

|This article has been veering wildly (and suspiciously) around the view graph for several weeks, but at least now its presence on the list has a reason: [[Amazon Fire TV]]; a digital streaming device to watch online content on a HDTV. How it distinguishes itself from the three or four other such devices currently on the market is a matter of some dispute.

|[[Marvel Comics]]' monster-man, to whom [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[Swamp Thing]], debuting 18 months later, would bear an uncanny resemblance, got some press after it was revealed he would appear in an upcoming episode of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D]]''.

| The [[Colombia]]n singer with the famously swiveling hips had a number of encounters with the media this week; between being the subject of a popular [[Reddit]] thread, being upstaged by [[Ariana Grande]] at the [[iHeartRadio Music Awards]] (see below), and posting a photo of her adorable toddler Milan on her [[Twitter]] feed, she's certainly made a splash amongst the cyber-chatterati, whether she intended to or not.
