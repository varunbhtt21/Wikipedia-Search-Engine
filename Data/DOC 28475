==Life and career==
Mario Beaulieu was born in 1959 in [[Sherbrooke]]; at age 4, his family moved to [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]].

Bealieu was the president of the [[Parti Québécois]]'s [[riding association]] in Montreal Centre from 1997 to 2002 and was an unsuccessful Bloc Québécois candidate in the [[1997 Canadian federal election|1997 federal election]], losing to federal cabinet minister [[Pierre Pettigrew]] in [[Papineau—Saint-Denis]]. He has been a long-time advocate for strengthening measures requiring the predominance of the French language in Québec, as well as for [[Quebec independence]].

===Bloc Québécois leader===
In April 2014, he declared his candidacy for the [[2014 Bloc Québécois leadership election|leadership of the Bloc Québécois]] and received the endorsement of the executive of the Bloc's youth wing,<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite web|last=Pilon-Larose|first=Hugo|title=Mario Beaulieu se présente à la direction du Bloc québécois|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/politique-canadienne/201404/28/01-4761682-mario-beaulieu-se-presente-a-la-direction-du-bloc-quebecois.php|publisher=La Presse|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Plusieurs jeunes bloquistes signent une lettre d'appui à André Bellavance|url=https://www.lanouvelle.net/plusieurs-jeunes-bloquistes-signent-une-lettre-dappui-a-andre-bellavance/|accessdate=June 4, 2018|newspaper=La Nouvelle Union|date=May 1, 2014}}</ref> former Parti Québécois legislative members [[Bernard Landry]] and [[Pierre Curzi]], and the former president of the [[Mouvement Desjardins]], Claude Béland.<ref>http://journalmetro.com/actualites/national/508144/chefferie-du-bloc-les-candidats-devoilent-leurs-appuis/</ref>  Beaulieu, viewed as a "hardline" sovereigntist, promised to prioritize achieving Quebec independence above everything else.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mario Beaulieu named new Bloc Québécois leader|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mario-beaulieu-named-new-bloc-qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois-leader-1.2675800|accessdate=June 14, 2014|date=June 14, 2014}}</ref> On June 14, 2014, he defeated BQ Member of Parliament [[André Bellavance]] for the Bloc leadership with 53.5% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloc Quebecois chooses Mario Beaulieu as new leader as federal party rebuilds|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/national/Canadian+Press+NewsAlert+Bloc+Quebecois+chooses+Mario/9939839/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140615101206/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/national/Canadian+Press+NewsAlert+Bloc+Quebecois+chooses+Mario/9939839/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 15, 2014|accessdate=June 14, 2014|work=Vancouver Sun|date=June 14, 2014}}</ref> Beaulieu took office as Bloc leader at the party's convention on June 25, 2014.

Shortly after his election, Beaulieu attracted controversy from within the party due to statements in his acceptance speech associated with the [[Front de libération du Québec]] and separate statements seemingly critical about the past leaders of the party, which drew criticism from former [[Bloc Québécois]] leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] and resulted in two party members announcing their intentions to leave the party.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bloc Québécois members quit over new leader Mario Beaulieu|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bloc-qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois-members-quit-over-new-leader-mario-beaulieu-1.2676343|accessdate=June 15, 2014|work=CBC News|date=June 15, 2014}}</ref> In the weeks following his election, a number of riding executive members quit the party to protest Beaulieu's leadership and a number of individuals who had been considering running for the party in the next election removed themselves from consideration.<ref name=fortin>{{cite news|title=Bloc Quebecois MP quits to sit as independent, says new leader is trying to radicalize the party|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/08/12/bloc-quebecois-mp-quits-to-sit-as-independent-says-new-leader-is-trying-to-radicalize-the-party/|work=National Post|date=August 12, 2014}}</ref> On August 12, 2014, the party's parliamentary caucus was reduced to 3 MPs after House Leader [[Jean-François Fortin (politician)|Jean-François Fortin]] quit the party to sit as an Independent MP. Fortin accused Beaulieu of "pushing a unidimensional, intransigent agenda that lacks rigour has put an end to the credibility established by (former leaders) Gilles Duceppe and followed up by Daniel Paillé, two leaders who merit great respect."<ref name=fortin/> On August 25, 2014, [[André Bellavance]], who had lost to Beaulieu in the leadership vote also resigned, reducing the Bloc to two MPs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Another Bloc MP quits party, leaving only two in Parliament|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/bloc-quebecois-mp-quits-party-pq-left-with-just-two-sitting-mps/article20191190/|accessdate=August 25, 2014|work=Globe and Mail|date=August 25, 2014}}</ref>  Bellavance told a press conference, in regards to Beaulieu: "His vision and orientation for the Bloc are diametrically opposed to mine.

===Return of Duceppe===
With the party languishing as it was about to enter the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], Beaulieu entered into discussions with former party leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] in hopes of saving the Bloc from extinction. On June 10, 2015, Beaulieu and Duceppe jointly announced that Gilles Duceppe would be returning to lead the party into the election campaign while Beaulieu would relinquish the leadership but remain party president.<ref name=back>{{cite news|title=illes Duceppe returns to lead Bloc Quebecois|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/gilles-duceppe-returns-to-lead-bloc-quebecois-1.2415002?hootPostID=062f4530d523c353466cfe09a9478b52|accessdate=June 10, 2015|work=CTV News|date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The party executive agreed on June 9, 2015, to split the positions of president and party leader in order to facilitate Duceppe's return. The changes were ratified by the party's general council on July 1.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gilles Duceppe announces return to Bloc Québécois leadership|work=CBC News|date=June 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/canada/montreal/gilles-duceppe-officially-named-leader-of-bloc-qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois-1.3135046</ref>

===2015 election===
In the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]], Beaulieu was elected in the riding of [[La Pointe-de-l'Île]], the only Bloc MP elected on the island of Montreal. The party returned 10 MPs, but fell short of [[official party status]].

===Return to Bloc Québécois leadership===
Beaulieu was one of three Bloc MPs who initially supported [[Martine Ouellet]]'s leadership during a [[caucus revolt]] and remained with the Bloc caucus when seven MPs resigned on February 28, 2018 to sit as Independents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Allard|first1=Clement|title=Seven of 10 Bloc Quebecois MPs quit over Martine Ouellet’s leadership|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/seven-of-10-bloc-quebecois-mps-quit-over-martine-ouellets-leadership/article38144355/|accessdate=February 28, 2018|work=The Globe and Mail|agency=The Canadian Press|date=February 28, 2018}}</ref> He later became critical of her leadership and campaigned for her removal for an upcoming leadership review, whilst staying in caucus. Beaulieu was named interim leader after Ouellet resigned over losing a party referendum on her leadership.

On August 22, 2018, he ceded the party presidency to Yves Perron as part of an agreement to reunite the party following the conflict over Martine Oulette's leadership. Beaulieu is to continue as interim leader, however, until a leadership election is held in 2019.<ref>https://www.lechodemaskinonge.com/yves-perron-a-la-presidence-du-bloc-quebecois/</ref><ref>https://www.lenouvelliste.ca/actualites/yves-perron-elu-president-du-bloc-1abc4c462b941b71a476f320c37dee02</ref> On January 17, 2019, he was succeeded as party leader by [[Yves-François Blanchet]].<ref name="BlanchetWins">{{cite web|title=Yves-François Blanchet becomes Bloc Québécois leader|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/yves-fran-ois-blanchet-new-bloc-leader-1.4981556|publisher=CBC News |accessdate=January 17, 2019|date=January 17, 2019}}</ref>
