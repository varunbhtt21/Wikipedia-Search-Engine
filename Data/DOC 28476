== Plot ==
[[Kosovo]], 1999. As the civil war between Serbs and Albanians rages, hatred has replaced tolerance, and towns are brutally divided along ethnic lines. The young Serbian widow Danica ([[Zrinka Cvitešić]]) lives with her two sons Vlado (Andrija Nikčević) and Danilo (Miloš Mesarović) in a predominantly Serbian community close to a small town which the River Ibar divides into an Albanian and a Serbian section. The death of Danica's husband at the hands of the Albanians has left profound traces in the family. Little Danilo has not spoken a word since, and Vlado has become a hooky-playing loner who dreams of owning a bright blue bicycle. In order to be able to afford it, he dives into the Ibar every day to catch fish which the kiosk owner buys from him for a few coins. In spite of the war, everyone in the community strives to lead normal lives. But one day, Danica returns from town to find a seriously injured Kosovo-Albanian soldier, Ramiz ([[Mišel Matičević]]), in her house. Though aware that he is on the run from the Serbian militia, Danica takes Ramiz in and nurses him...
