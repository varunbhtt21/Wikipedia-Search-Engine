But that doesn't negate the way Offerman’s honest Americanist attitude regularly leads to laughs and insight."<ref>{{cite web |title=Sundance Review: Nick Offerman Uncovers the Real America In 'American Ham'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-nick-offerman-uncovers-the-real-america-in-american-ham|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref>
