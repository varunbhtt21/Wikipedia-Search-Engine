* <s>... that before entering politics, the British [[Member of Parliament]] '''[[Ayscoghe Boucherett]]''' was a friend of the artist [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]], whose painting ''The Children of Ayscoghe Boucherett'' ''(pictured)'' is now held in the [[Louvre]], Paris?</s>

:* ''Comment'': After creating this article, User:Voceditenore, who reviewed it in AfC, suggested that I look at nominating a hook for DYK. I think that this is quite an interesting part of the article and seemed to me like a possible DYK hook (though, I have never done this before).

:* I've tweaked the wording a bit: 
:*'''ALT1''' ... that before entering politics, British [[Member of Parliament]] '''[[Ayscoghe Boucherett]]''' became friends with Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]], whose painting ''The Children of Ayscoghe Boucherett'' ''(pictured)'' is now held in [[The Louvre]]?

::*That seems okay to me; it flows better than my attempt and also removes any suggestion that Boucherett was a friend of Sir Thomas' only until he became MP ("before entering politics ... was a friend of the artist").  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Noswall59|Noswall59]] ([[User talk:Noswall59|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Noswall59|contribs]]) 18:07, 5 May 2014 (UTC)</span></small> 

:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] This article is new enough and long enough. I understand this is the nominator's first DYK so no QPQ review needs to be done. The ALT1 hook reads more smoothly and is well cited and the image is in the public domain. Most of the references are offline but I detected no policy issues with the online ones.
