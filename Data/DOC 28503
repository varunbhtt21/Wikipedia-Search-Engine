'''Nicholas the Pilgrim''' ({{lang-it|Nicola il Pellegrino}}; 1075 – 2 June 1094), sometimes '''Nicholas of Trani''', is a [[saint]] of the [[Roman Catholic]] church.

He was born in [[Steiri]] in [[Boeotia]], [[Greece]], where his solitary life as a shepherd led him to contemplative spirituality, as part of which he developed the constant repetition of the phrase ''[[Kyrie Eleison]].'' This brought him conflict and aggression in populated places, and he suffered much oppression.<ref name=Archd>Archdiocese of Trani, Barletta, Bisceglie and Nazareth (publ.), 2004: ''San Nicola il Pellegrino: Atti, testimonianze e liturgie in occasione dei festeggiamenti del IX centenario della sua morte. 10 anni dopo''. Trani</ref>

He died while on [[pilgrimage]] in [[Apulia]], where he is venerated particularly in [[Trani]]. [[Trani Cathedral]] is dedicated to him, and he is the patron saint of the city.<ref>[http://www.santiebeati.it/Detailed/90618.html Santiebeati.it: San Nicola il Pellegrino]</ref>

His feast day is 2 June.<ref name=LATIN/> The annual procession through Trani in his honour is held in the last week of July.<ref name=Archd /> In Orthodox tradition he is regarded as a [[Foolishness for Christ|Fool-for-Christ]].<ref name=LATIN/><ref>{{el icon}} "Άγιος Νικόλαος ο Προσκυνητής ο δια Χριστόν σαλός."
