|title=Etu |accessdate=3 May 2014 |publisher=Flores Bangkit}}</ref> There are no precise rules such as how many rounds the fighters have to complete.<ref name = "ref5"/> The Etu fight will be stopped if one of the fighters has fallen or shed blood.<ref name = "ref5"/> Each fight in this form of ceremonial boxing can usually go on for five minutes, depending on each of the fighters' strength.<ref name = "ref5"/> The referees are called ''Seka''.<ref name = "ref5"/><ref name = "ref4">{{cite web|url=http://www.terapung.com/2013/03/ritual-tinju-adat-di-nagekeo-adalah.html

There are usually 3 ''sekas'' in the game.<ref name = "ref5"/> Besides referees, there are also officials known as ''sike'' whose job is to control the fighters from beating their opponents excessively.<ref name = "ref5"/> The ''Sikes'' can easily control the fighters by pulling the cloth that the fighters wear around their waist.<ref name = "ref5"/> There are also officials called ''pai etu'' or ''bobo etu''.<ref name = "ref5"/> These officials are 3-4 men whose job is to find the next fighters to fight among men who are watching around the arena.<ref name = "ref5"/> Those who intend to join the Etu can also directly report to the ''pai etu'' and they will set a fighting schedule for them.<ref name = "ref5"/> Another official is called the ceremony guard or ''mandor adat'' whose job is to make sure that no one outside the arena can interfere the fight going on in the arena.<ref name = "ref5"/> 
Women are also involved in the ceremony.<ref name = "ref5"/> However, they do not join in the etu fight but they are involved in the ''dio'', a musical group to support the fighters.<ref name = "ref5"/>
Every time after finishing a fight, the fighters embrace each other as a symbol of brotherhood and sportsmanship.<ref name = "ref5"/> They are strongly forbidden to bear vengeance and fight outside the arena after the etu.<ref name = "ref5"/> Otherwise, people believe that they will be struck with bad luck and catastrophe.<ref name = "ref5"/> People also believe that the wounds of the fighters can be easily healed.<ref name = "ref5"/> The wounded ones are directly delivered to the head of the tribe, with one touch of medication, the fighters' wounds' can magically be healed<ref name = "ref5"/>
