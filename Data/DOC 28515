McGowan was the editor and publisher of the ''Appleton Press'', the ''Swift County Monitor-News'' and three other weekly newspapers in Minnesota. The Appleton Press was then a well written and well thought out small town newspaper that reported on the intimate details of local life, such as a visit by a citizen's out of town relative.  A selection of his columns spanning those newspapers<ref>[http://mcgowans.org/pubs/cubscorner/ The Cub's Corner: A Collection of a Country Editor's Columns]</ref> relate samples of his writing.  On the occasion of his 80th birthday, he wrote a biographic article<ref>[http://mcgowans.org/pubs/family/Dadstory/Contents.html Born to be a Newspaperman]</ref> on his life growing up in a local newspaper family, his schooling, working with his father, traveling with the US Navy, and raising a family. 

McGowan served on the [[Blue Earth County, Minnesota]] Planning Board and the Appleton, Minnesota Library Board. From 1959 until 1967, McGowan served in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. His nephew [[Rick Nolan]] also served in the Minnesota Legislature and six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. His son [[Martin James McGowan III]] graduated in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966.
