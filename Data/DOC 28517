Title : Sara Holmsten
Text : {{Orphan|date=October 2014}}
'''Sara Holmsten''' (1715–1795) was a Swedish memoirist and member of the [[Moravian Church]].

Sara Holmsten was the daughter of a farmer in [[Åland]], and the devastation wrought by the Russian army during the [[Great Nordic War]] reduced her to [[beggary]]. She later supported herself as a domestic and factory worker in [[Stockholm]], before she became a member of the Moravian church in Stockholm in the 1750s, where she worked for the leading members of the congregation.

In accordance with the custom of the members of the Moravian Church at the time, she wrote her autobiography. Her autobiography from 1787 is regarded as being among the most historically interesting of contemporary Swedish works of that kind.
