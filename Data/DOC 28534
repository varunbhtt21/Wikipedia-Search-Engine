:* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] New enough, long enough, well referenced. As most sources are offline or subscription only, I am unable to check them, but I've verified his existence in online sources and Google book hits. QPQ done. Offline hook ref AGF and cited inline. I added "University of Nottingham Professor" to the hook to give readers some idea of who we're talking about. Good to go.
