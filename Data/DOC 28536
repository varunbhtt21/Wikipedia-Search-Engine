==College career==
In September 2010, Parks enrolled in a computer course at [[National University (Philippines)|National University]] in [[Manila]] with the hopes of playing for the [[NU Bulldogs]] in 2011.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100915034304/http://www.inquirer.net/sports/articles/NU-Bulldogs-acquire-Parks-and-sonRay.html NU Bulldogs acquire Parks and son Ray]</ref> Since Parks came from a foreign high school, he had to sit out one year before the 2011 season, which prevented him from winning Rookie of the Year as he would no longer be considered a fresh graduate.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/273001/passing-the-torch-bobby-ray-parks-one-name-two-dominant-players/story/</ref> Needless to say, he  still qualified for the MVP award, which he eventually won during his first [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] (UAAP) season with the Bulldogs, as Parks averaged 20.0 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.1 blocks and 1.1 steals per game and was named the Most Valuable Player of seasons [[UAAP Season 74|74]] and [[UAAP Season 75|75]].<ref name=bartholomew_09012015/>
