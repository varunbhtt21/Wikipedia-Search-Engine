Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
|Description = Cover art for [[Moog Konttinen|Moogetmoogs]] single Kolmen minuutin muna (cover version of [[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman–Turner Overdrive song)]]).
|Source = '''Original publication''': Cover of the single "Kolmen minuutin muna".<br/>
'''Immediate source:''' http://www.perunamaa.net/sarjakuvarock/moog/galleria/levyt/muna.html
|Date = 1991
|Author = Moogetmoogs / Poko Records
|Article = You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman–Turner Overdrive song)
|Purpose = Section. The image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary of the work for which it serves as cover art. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. This image identifies the product of the different recording of the same song. Use for this purpose does not compete with the purposes of the original artwork, namely the artist's providing graphic design services to music concerns and in turn marketing music to the public.
|Replaceability = As musical cover art, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the music would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary. Using a different image would be misleading as to the identity of the work.
|Minimality = Information about the cover versions of "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet" will be included in the main article about the song. This image will be used in the portion about the cover version.
|Commercial = The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original cover. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable as artwork on pirate versions or other uses that would compete with the commercial purpose of the original artwork.
