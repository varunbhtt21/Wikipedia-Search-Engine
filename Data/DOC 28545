Article deleted in 2013 via PROD, but restored by request at [[WP:REFUND]] with the claim that "there is a resurgence of interest". However, I see no evidence of that. The band has just one album released in 1994. The assertion of notability in the article is enough to ward off [[WP:CSD#A7]] speedy deletion, but without evidence that the band meets any of the criteria in [[WP:BAND]], the article is likely not a keeper here. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 16:42, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Strong delete''' Clearly fails [[WP:NMUSIC]] - regardless of supposed "resurgence".  Should have stayed deleted <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User talk:DangerousPanda|<font style="color:#ffffff;background:black;"> the panda </font><font style="color:#000000;background:white;"> ₯’</font>]]</span></small> 20:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*:I agree. This AFD is really just procedural: because it was deleted via a prod, the article can be restored by anyone's request on [[WP:REFUND]]. It's equivalent to removing the prod tag to prevent deletion in the first place. Therefore I restored it as requested, but immediately took it to AFD. The person who requested restoration now has a week to provide evidence for the "resurgence of interest" sufficiently to demonstrate notability. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 03:30, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
