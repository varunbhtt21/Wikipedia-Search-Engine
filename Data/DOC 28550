According to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine critic Erik Himmelsbach, "Hymn to Her" is one of the songs presenting "traditional pop sentiments" which Hynde and the Pretenders mixed in with their more vitriolic work.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pretenders: Viva El Amor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQRXCTo-FtUC&pg=PA162 |date=August 1999 |author=Himmelsbach, E. |accessdate=2014-06-10 |page=162 |newspaper=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref>  ''Spin'' critic Brian Cullman described it as a "hymn to the [[eternal feminine]]."<ref name=spin/>  The Maiden, Mother and Chrone that are mentioned in the song are Archetypes of the collective unconscious, specific psychological imaging of the major psychological transitions women undergo over a lifetime.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archetype|date=2018-12-15|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Archetype&oldid=873821392|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> ''The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism'' interprets the song as containing [[modern Paganism|pagan]] themes.<ref name=witchcraft>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism |pages=170, 172 |editor=Rabinovitch, S. |editor2=Lewis, J. |year=2004 |publisher=Citadel Press |isbn=9780806524078}}</ref>  Though the Archetypes of the collective unconscious are not limited to religious belief. Vic Garbarini of ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' magazine suggested that a theme of the song is Hynde "trying to listen to that part of [herself] where all [her] songs come from."<ref name=spy>{{cite news |title=The Annotated Chrissie |newspaper=[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]] |author=Garbarini, V. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTXxn2wDUtwC&pg=PA15 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |date=May 1987 |page=15 }}</ref>  Greenwald considers it "a timeless love song about a life-long love."<ref name=allmusic/>  According to Greenwald, the [[melody]] combines [[folk music]] and [[gospel music]] elements.<ref name=allmusic/>

Cullman evaluated "Hymn to Her" as "a stunner" which combines "the spirit behind '[[The Mists of Avalon]]' with the beauty of [[Sandy Denny]]'s best work."<ref name=spin/>  Greenwald particularly praised the lyrics, Hynde's delivery, and the [[refrain]].<ref name=allmusic/>  [[Ira Robbins]] and Delvin Neugebauer of ''[[Trouser Press]]'' described "Hymn To Her" as a "haunting [[ballad]]" that was one of the few worthy songs on ''Get Close''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pretenders |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=pretenders |author=[[Ira Robbins|Robbins, I.]] & Neugebauer, D. |work=[[Trouser Press]] |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>  Author Barbara O'Dair described it as "glorious" and "spine-tingling" and "the best thing" on ''Get Close''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trouble Girls: The ''Rolling Stone'' Book of Women in Rock |author=O'Dair, B. |page=306 |year=1996 |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780679768746 }}</ref>  ''The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism'' called it "enchanting."<ref name=witchcraft/>
