'''Thomas Ignatius McCarthy, LRIBA''' (born 31 January 1880, died 13 Feb 1951) was an architect based in [[Coalville]], [[Leicestershire]].

Early in the twentieth century, Thomas Ignatius McCarthy set up a practice as a surveyor and architect in Coalville, which was a partnership shared with Henry Collings (1880 - 1960). Collings was responsible for the design of the Coalville Clock Tower war memorial - a building admired by Pevsner.
