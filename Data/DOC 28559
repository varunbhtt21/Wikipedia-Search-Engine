==Background==

Dr. Adrianne Wadewitz was an influential member of the Wikipedia community who died suddenly in April 2014. This loss has deeply affected Wikipedia and the academic world. Her work is recognized internationally as helping to encourage more women to contribute to Wikipedia to tackle the [[m:gender gap|gender gap]] and [[systemic bias]] in its content. Wadewitz was one of the first academics to bring Wikipedia into the classroom as part of the [[Wikipedia:Education program|Wikipedia Education Program]], working with her students to improve Wikipedia instead of writing traditional term papers. At the time of her death, she was Mellon Digital Scholarship Fellow at [[Occidental College]]. She had over 50,000 edits and wrote numerous featured and good articles, including [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].
