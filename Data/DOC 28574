The '''Fortress of Bashtovë''' ({{lang-sq|Kalaja e Bashtovës}}) is a medieval [[quadrangular castle|quadrangular fortress]] located close to the outflow of the [[Shkumbin|Shkumbin River]] into the [[Adriatic Sea]] in Central [[Albania]]. It is part of the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania##Tentative list|tentative list]] of Albania in order to qualify for inclusion in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] list.<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=The Castle of Bashtova|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6259/|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}</ref>

The fortress is built on a fertile flat ground east of the mouth of the [[Shkumbin|Shkumbin River]]. The ruins are located some {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the village of [[Vilë-Boshtovë]] in [[Tirana County]]. By air, it is {{convert|36|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Fier]],
{{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} northwest of [[Lushnjë]], {{convert|15|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Kavajë]] and {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Tirana]]. 

Previously in the [[Middle Ages]], the region of Boshtovë was known as a trade harbor and otherwise centre for the export of grains.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Pettifer|title=Albania & Kosovo – Blue Guide|date=2001|publisher=A & C Black|location=London|isbn=0713650168|language=English}}</ref> The origin of the fortress has been for some time a matter of dispute among historians. The initial fortress was constructed during the time when the region was part of the [[Venetian Empire]] as according to Gjerak Karaiskaj.<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[Ministry of Tourism and Environment (Albania)|Ministry of Tourism, Culture, Youth and Sports of Albania]]|title=Kalaja e Bashtovës, Kavajë|url=http://www.mtkrs.gov.al/web/Kalaja_e_Bashtoves_Kavaje_1028_1.php|website=mtkrs.gov.al|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102051943/http://www.mtkrs.gov.al/web/Kalaja_e_Bashtoves_Kavaje_1028_1.php|archivedate=20 May 2012|language=Albanian}}</ref> However, [[Alain Ducellier]] has asserted that the Venetians have built over an existing former structure, which dates back to the 6th century, when the area was under the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the [[Justinian dynasty]].<ref name=Karaiskaj>{{cite web|last=Karaiskaj|first=Gjerak|title=Kështjella e Bashtovës, pages 5-6|url=http://www.mtkrs.gov.al/web/Kalaja_e_Bashtoves_Kavaje_1028_1.php|publisher=Monumentet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102051943/http://www.mtkrs.gov.al/web/Kalaja_e_Bashtoves_Kavaje_1028_1.php|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}</ref> 

The fortress is a rectangular structure oriented to the north-south direction. There are three entrances, from which there still are well-preserved archaeological traces they were placed at the northern, western and eastern walls. The walls are {{convert|9|m|ft|0}} high and comprise a roughly {{convert|60|by|90|m|ft}} interior. In the north and east, there stands round towers each of them {{convert|12|m|ft}} high.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Oliver Gilkes|title=Albanian – An Archaeological Guide|date=2013|publisher=I. B.
