'''Umedalen skulpturpark''' is an art exhibition and a [[sculpture garden]] in [[Umeå]] in [[Sweden]].

==History==
An art exhibition was arranged in [[Umedalen]] for the first time in 1994 and it is now a permanent exhibition in a sculpture garden at the previous Umedalen hospital precinct.<ref name=us>[http://www.umedalenskulptur.se/us/ Umedalen sculpture's web site], retrieved 4 May 2014</ref>

The property company Balticgruppen (The Baltic Group), together with Art Gallery Galleri Sandström Andersson, in 1987 bought the uncommissioned [[psychiatric hospital]] Umedalen, around 20 stone houses in a park, by the [[Västerbotten County Council]]. Sweden's largest art gallery has been built around the historic buildings that were previously used as the hospital.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/sweden/10609165/2014-Capital-of-Culture-highlights-of-Umea-Sweden.html 2014 Capital of Culture: highlights of Umeå, Sweden], Telegraph, retrieved 6 May 2014</ref> Balticgruppen has purchased 44 sculptures, which now form the permanent exhibition in the sculpture park.<ref name=us/>
