*'''Strong Keep''' This nomination appears to be among a series of attempts to delete articles with which the nom disagrees. Broadly, it looks like a pattern of disruptive editing by an agenda oriented account engaged in some sort of intra-Islamic factional edit war. This is being addressed by a number of editors and Admins. The nom is currently blocked for two weeks for persistent edit warring. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 14:42, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. COI of nom maybe, but I can't see any sources. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 22:38, 6 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Delete''' Regardless of the intent of the nominator, this article fails [[WP:GNG]]. I considered nominating it myself months ago after removing a lot of unsourced rubbish, but it slipped my mind. The only reliable source we can get - there are a few more - mention that the subject of this article was the son of a notable religious figure. Notability is not inherited per [[WP:NRV]], and there's no reason for this article to exist. [[User:MezzoMezzo|MezzoMezzo]] ([[User talk:MezzoMezzo|talk]]) 03:52, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
