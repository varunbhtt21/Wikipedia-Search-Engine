Another [[WP:Content forking|fork]]. Look, I made a proposal to split off the events of the insurgency on the talk page at [[Talk:Donetsk People's Republic#Split proposal and drafts]]. Consensus was clearly against it, as you'll see if you read there. However, now we have another lone cowboy out to make more forks, without discussion, and disregarding consensus. This article should be deleted immediately.

*'''Neutral''' - the creation of this article was intended to help the community to differentiate the "Donetsk insurgency" (warfare) and the "Donetsk Republic" (a disputed political entity). The community is up to decide whether the insurgency and the Republic is the same thing or not.[[User:Greyshark09|'''''GreyShark''''']] ([[User talk:Greyshark09|''dibra'']]) 17:12, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:Yes, I agreed, as you will see in my original proposal at that talk page. However, the community consensus was clearly against it, as demonstrated in the requested move, and also in the discussion about my proposal. It is the responsibility of editors to read prior discussions on the matter, before unilaterally going against those discussions.

::Sorry for missing it, but it also seems the discussion was quiet short, i think some one has to invite all participants of prior discussion here to summarize.[[User:Greyshark09|'''''GreyShark''''']] ([[User talk:Greyshark09|''dibra'']]) 17:17, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' (and merge content from [[Draft:Donetsk crisis]]) - military conflict and disputed entity should have separate articles.

::That would require splitting off content from Donetsk People's Republic. You saw the talk page discussion. Consensus was against it.

*'''Delete''' - until we have consensus to split the DPR article, which has been an ongoing discussion --'''[[User:Lvivske|Львівське]]''' <small>([[User talk:Lvivske|говорити]])</small> 21:15, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Change to a redirect'''.  It is a redundant content fork.  [[WP:REDUNDANTFORK]].--[[User:Toddy1|Toddy1]] ([[User talk:Toddy1|talk]]) 21:30, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per Lvivske. No consensus to split this article off. Currently replicating the pro-Russian unrest main article. <span style="display:inline-block;padding:0 .5em;line-height:1.25em;border:1px solid #CAD4E7; font-family:'Lucida Grande'; -moz-border-radius: 3px; -webkit-border-radius: 3px; border-radius: 3px; background:#ECEEF5;">[[User talk:DDima|§]] [[User:DDima|DDima]]</span> 01:48, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' for now, then re-discuss a split and maybe there will be a better consensus next time. [[User:Fitzcarmalan|Fitzcarmalan]] ([[User talk:Fitzcarmalan|talk]]) 12:42, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' as per Toddy1. For now, it can be subsumed under [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]]. --[[User:Franz Brod|Franz Brod]] ([[User talk:Franz Brod|talk]]) 22:25, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

*Don't we already have this in the article "Pro-Rusian Unrest in Ukraine" which explains what is happening in the donetsk oblast (province), so i think this article should be merged or deleted. --[[User:Arbutus the tree|Arbutus the tree]] ([[User talk:Arbutus the tree|talk]]) 23:39, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
