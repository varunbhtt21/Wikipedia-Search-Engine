The '''Toucheng Old Street''' ({{zh|c=頭城老街|p=Tóuchéng Lǎojiē}}) is a street in [[Toucheng, Yilan|Toucheng Township]], [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]], [[Taiwan]].

==Name==
Toucheng means ''First Town'' literally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tourism.e-land.gov.tw/eng/index.php?code=list&ids=63&member_myshare_act=dosearch_detail&mid=290 |title=Yilan tourism_English > Themed Trips > Culture & Arts |publisher=Tourism.e-land.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref>

==History==
'''Toucheng Old Street''' was used to be known as '''Touwei Street''' ({{zh|c=頭圍街}}) in early times. It was established during the [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing Dynasty rule]]. The area around the street used to be an important trading district with the booming river and harbor transportation sector, especially the Wushih and Touwei Harbors.

The decline in this area started with the 1878 flood which affected Wushih Harbor. An [[United States|American]] ship sank and subsequently blocked the entrance of the harbor in 1883. Although the harbor function was partially moved to Toucheng Harbor, the harbor was also flooded in 1924. With also the completion of highways and railway, especially the opening of [[Hsuehshan Tunnel]], as well as the shifting of business center elsewhere, make this old street lost its fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sixstar.moc.gov.tw/eng-2011/caseStudyAction.do?method=doDetail&&engId=18 |title=Taiwan Community Platform ::: MINISTRY OF CULTURE 文化部 台灣社區通 |publisher=Sixstar.moc.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref>
