==Trade and investment==
According to Indonesian Ministry of Trade, the bilateral trade between Indonesia and Kazakhstan in 2012 reached US$63,156 million, a  90,5% increase compared to 2011 figure of US$33,153 million. The trade balance in 2012 was in favour to Kazakhstan that recorded US$46 million surplus over Indonesia.<ref name="DetikKaz"/> The two countries will boost investment and trade, specifically in the wheat, cotton and rubber industries, as well as in the production and exploration of oil. One of which, a joint venture to produce tires in Kazakhstan with a value of investment of US$100 million.<ref name="JPKaz2"/> There is also plan to build Indonesian [[instant noodle]] factory in Kazakhstan, since Indonesia is one of the world largest producer and consumer of instant noodle and experienced in this industry, while Kazakhstan is one of the largest [[wheat]] producer in the region, which will render the supply and production process more cheap and practical. This is an opportunity for Indonesian instant noodle brands to penetrate Central Asian, Russian, and even European markets.<ref name="AntaraKaz">{{cite web | title=Kazakhstan tertarik mie instan produksi Indonesia | url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/393595/kazakhstan-tertarik-mie-instan-produksi-indonesia | author=Panca Hari Prabowo | date=September 2, 2013 | publisher=Antara News | language=Indonesian | accessdate=May 4, 2014 }}</ref> This practice has been done by Indonesian instant noodle brand [[Indomie]] that invested in Nigeria.
