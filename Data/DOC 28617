== Biography ==
Shaikh Abdul Latif was follower of the [[Naqshbandi]] sufi sect so Muhammad Zaman learned [[Quran]] and [[Sufi]] teachings from his father. Then he was sent to [[Thatta]] to study further in the Madrassa of Shaikh Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi who was a follower of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].<ref name=maqoolat/> During this time he met Khawaja Abul Masakin,<ref name="sindh_govt">{{cite web|url= http://www.sindh.gov.pk/dpt/usharzakaat/khwajazaman.htm|title= HAZRAT KHAWJA MUHAMMAD ZAMAN , LUARI SHARIF}}</ref> who was a sufi saint and a follower of the Sirhandi saints, and left the madrassa of Muhammad Sadiq Naqshbandi to start sufi training under Abul Masakin from whom he later earneded the title of Sultan Al Aoliya (Master of Sufis). After some time Abul Masakin appointed him his successor and himself went to [[Mecca]] for Hajj  where he died shortly afterwards.<ref name=maqoolat/> Muhammad Zaman then started  preaching [[sufism]], training people in the path of divine love.<ref name=mayaar>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MaayarSalikan-e-tariqatsindhiTranslation/00426_Maayar-Salikan-Tariqat-sd#page/n646/mode/2up |title=Mayaar-e-Salikeen |last1=Qani'i Thatwi |first1=Mir Ali Sher |date=2010 |website= archives.org |accessdate=June 5, 2014}}</ref> By this time he was a complete [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]]. Later, Muhammad Zaman moved to his home town Luari and continued his preachings, where he attracted masses of people around him.<ref name=zulfiqar/><ref name="sindh_govt"/><ref name=tufatulkiram>{{cite web|url =https://archive.org/stream/Tuhfat-ul-kiramurduTranslation/00444_Tuhfat-ul-Kiram-ur#page/n593/mode/2up |title = Tuhfat-ul-kiramurduTranslation|last = Rizvi |first = Akhtar |accessdate= 4 May 2014}}</ref>

[[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]], a sufi poet himself, once came to Luari to meet Muhammad Zaman.<ref name="Jotwani">Jotwani Motilal: ''Sufis of Sindh''. Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, 1986, {{ISBN|81-230-0508-3}}, ({{Google books|xvgADgAAQBAJ|page=105}}).</ref> After the meeting Latif is said to have repeatedly recited this verse in praise of Muhammad Zaman:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|

I am speechless to recount their glorious tale.<ref name= Jotwani/><ref name=Abyat>{{cite web |url =https://archive.org/stream/SharahAbyatSindhi/00325_SHARAH-ABYAT-SINDHI#page/n82/mode/2up |title = SharahAbyatSindhi|last = Girhori |first = Shaykh Abul-Rahim |accessdate= 4 May 2014}}</ref>}}

He died on January 6, 1775 AD (Dhul-Qadh 4, 1188 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]]), and his tomb is in Luari, Sindh.<ref name=tufatulkiram /><ref name=Makhdoom>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MakhdoomAbdulRahimGirhorisindhiABiography/Girhori#page/n30/mode/2up |title=Makhdoom Abdul Rahim Garhori |last1=Qaboolai |first1=Taj Muhammad |date=2000 |website= archives.org |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref>

== Poetry ==
Muhammad Zaman was also a [[sufi poet]].<ref name="Ansari1992">{{cite book |last= Ansari |first= S. F. D. |date= 1992 |title= Sufi Saints and State Power: The Pirs of Sind, 1843-1947 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= 22 |isbn= 0521405300}}</ref> Though he is said to have said hundreds of poems but only 85 have been available in written form.  A collection of these poems is ''Abyat Sindhi'' (Sindhi poems). [[Faqir Abdul Raheem Garhori|Shaikh Abdul Rahim Garhori]], one of his disciples,<ref name="Schimmel1974">{{cite book |last= Schimmel |first= A. |date= 1974 |title= Sindhi literature (A history of Indian literature) |location= Wiesbaden|publisher= Otto Harrassowitz |page= 20 |isbn= 978-3447015608}}</ref><ref name=Kalam>{{cite web |url =https://archive.org/stream/KalamGirhoriSindhi_201304/Kalam-Girhori-sindhi#page/n15/mode/2up |title = Kalam-e-Garhori|last = Daudpoto |first = Umar bin Muhammad |date=1995 |accessdate= 5 June 2014}}</ref> has written a comprehensive commentary and explanation of these poems, called ''Sharah Abyat Sindhi''. They reflect deep mysteries of sufism and general common sense.<ref name=maqoolat/> Though he was a Naqshbandi and all Naqshbandi sufis follow [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat-ash-Shuhūd]] he seems to have merged Wahdat-ash-Shuhūd and [[Sufi metaphysics|Wahdat-al-Wujūd]] in his poetry.<ref name=Tuhfa/> He says:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
سرتيون سٽ ڪپاھ ماريو م منصور کي
ٿي ترڪيب تباھ وحدت وايُ وات مِ
|
O friends! do not kill [[Mansoor Al Hallaj|Mansoor]] as yarn is nothing else but cotton itself in modified form
When assemblage is gone, there is no difference between two and one will definitely shout of the unity of existence.<ref name=Abyat/>}}

This implies that claim of Mansoor ''Ana-al-Haqq'' (I am God : Haqq is a name of God in Islam) was not pointless as he had discovered the fact that his existence and that of universe was nothing but the manifestation of God's attributes, as yarn is nothing but cotton, therefore Mansoor should not be killed. At some other point he says in favour of Shuhūd:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
پاڻي لھر پسڻ مِ برابر ٿيا
ڪي اتي يُ اڙيا ڪي لنگھي مقصد مڙيا
|
Water and waves seem to be one thing, not two
Some thought it is the reality while some perceived non existence of waves on their own.<ref name=Abyat/>}}

Means waves have no real existence of their own and are merely movement in water, in the same way, while the universe does not have its own existence, it is not the same as God. But generally it is considered that he was neither on side of Wahdat-al-Shuhūd completely nor in complete favour of Wahdat-al-Wujūd, instead he combined both ideologies to show that the differences in between them were merely of words and not real.<ref name=Tuhfa>{{cite web |url =https://archive.org/stream/TuhfaLawariSharifsindhi/00381_TUHFA-LAWARI-SHARIF#page/n50/mode/2up |title = Tuhfa Luwari|last = Girami |first = Ghulam Muhammad |date=1974 |accessdate= 30 May 2014}}</ref>
