'''Selma Stern-Täubler''' (born 24 July 1890, [[Kippenheim]], Germany – died 17 August 1981, [[Basel]]) was one of the first women to become a professional historian in Germany,<ref>{{cite journal|last=G.P.Z.|title=To Our Readers|journal=American Jewish Archives Journal|year=2006|volume=58|issue=1&2|pages=vii-x|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/2006_58_01_02_ztor.pdf}}</ref> and the author of a seven-volume work (3,740 pages) ''The Prussian State and the Jews'', her [[opus magnum]].

==Life==
Selma Stern grew up in an upper-middle-class Jewish family; her father was a physician. In 1901 the family moved to [[Baden-Baden]]. In 1904 she was the first girl to attend the ''Großherzogliches Badisches [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]'', a boys highschool, from which she graduated in 1908. She studied history, philosophy and [[philology]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]], but left after three semesters and graduated at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in 1913 on [[Anacharsis Cloots]]. In 1914 she moved to Frankfurt to live with her mother and sister and started a career in German-Jewish history on a freelance basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=HTy5GsUWgO0C&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=Selma+Stern+married+Taubler&source=bl&ots=okYav9CExt&sig=An_AZ_Xwmy-0VjBIa867ReVkUUc&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Selma%20Stern%20&f=false|title=Female, Jewish, and Educated: The Lives of Central European University Women|first=Harriet Pass|last=Freidenreich|date=21 June 2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Shortly after the founding of the ''[[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums|Akademie für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]'' in Berlin in 1919, Stern accepted an invitation to become one of its research fellows in 1920.<ref>In 1921, there were 63 full-time and 45 part-time students enrolled in the "Hochschule".</ref> There, she began work on the first two volumes of ''Der preussische Staat und die Juden'', a study of Jewry under [[Frederick William I of Prussia]], published in 1925. In 1927, Stern received her doctorate and married the director and founder of the academy, the historian [[Eugen Täubler]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/courtjewacontrib027906mbp#page/n17/mode/2up The Court Jew A Contribution To The History Of The Period Of Absolutism In Central Europe by Selma Stern]</ref> In 1936 the Täublers moved to England in an attempt to move the academy, but returned to Germany a year later.

In 1938 one of the volumes was ready to be published by the [[Schocken Books|Schocken Verlag]], but due to Nazi policy all the stock, including her manuscript and many documents were burned during [[Kristallnacht]]. Stern was not allowed to visit any public libraries or archives, but got help from several scholars to finish her work. In the introduction of ''Der preussische Staat und die Juden'' Stern mentions that one copy, dealing with the Jews under [[Frederick the Great]], was saved by an anonymous female employee of Schocken publishing company, who came to their apartment in [[Charlottenburg]] at the end of November, 1938.

In 1941, Stern and Täubler fled to the United States, crossing the Atlantic on the last boat before the USA entered the Second World War. (She was allowed by the Nazis to take the only surviving copy with her.) First they lived in New York; from 1947-1955, she was in charge of Jewish-American Archives at [[Hebrew Union College]]-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, where she worked as an archivist.<ref>{{cite news|title=Selma Stern-Täubler Is Dead; A Specialist on German Jews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/19/obituaries/selma-stern-taubler-is-dead-a-specialist-on-german-jews.html|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 19, 1981}}</ref> Stern became a widow in 1953 without having children. In 1955 she retired and was involved in founding the [[Leo Baeck Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Selma Stern-Taeubler (1890-1981)|url=http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=121491|publisher=Leo Baeck Institute|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>

In 1960 Stern moved to Basel, where her sister lived. Between 1961 and 1972 she published ''Der preußische Staat und die Juden'', carefully referenced. Topics covered include quotas of Jews or Jewish families ([[Schutzjude]]n), bank ownership, the minting activities by the [[court Jews]] [[Veitel Heine Ephraim]] and [[Daniel Itzig]] and their trade in silver and debased coins during and after the Seven Years' War, interest, taxes and fees. In 1974 a complete index was published with the help of three co-workers.<ref>[https://books.google.ru/books?id=A5NDT63DlZQC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&dq=Der+preußische+Staat+und+die+Juden.+Mohr,+Tübingen&source=bl&ots=g5Vzca7yqt&sig=XyfLhHICN8eb4JFAKnLyWaIsq7w&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdpvPo_IXXAhWKblAKHWAkAX0Q6AEINjAE#v=onepage&q=Der%20preu%C3%9Fische%20Staat%20und%20die%20Juden.%20Mohr%2C%20T%C3%BCbingen&f=false  Der preussische Staat und die Juden, Band 1;Band 3 von Selma Stern]</ref> Stern obviously like the quoting "What man understands he is able to withstand", which she used more than once in the introduction of her books.
