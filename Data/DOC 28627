:({{Find sources|The Byzantine Patriarchal See and Orthodox Church of Hungary}})
I am 100% certain that this page refers to a group that is either a hoax or a way to swindle people of their money. From the very name of this supposedly Orthodox communion, to the improbable claims it makes, this article stinks to heaven. Where should I begin? An Orthodox Church founded in arch-Catholic Hungary? Patriarchs no-one has ever heard of, since the 19th century no less? No mention of communion with other Orthodox churches, but nevertheless a dozen "exarchs" in other Orthodox countries? The term "Byzantine Patriarch", that only an ignoramus would even consider using as an official title? Ruritanian terms like "Byzantine Titular Patriarch of Lisbon" or "Military Exarch of the Military Episcopate", or the inclusion of military orders, something totally alien to any Orthodox church? The complete absence of any secondary or tertiary sources, or indeed the absence of any information on the web, barring the one page already listed with all its dubious claims? This "church" sounds and reads like something badly made up by someone with a rudimentary knowledge of the Orthodox Church, but with ample access to Wikipedia articles on ecclesiastical offices.

*'''Delete''' as astonishingly non-notable, I can't remember the last time Google gave so few hits.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 18:55, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as a hoax, per user Constantine's analysis. Purports to be somehow connected to "Eastern Christianity", yet those branches were formed in antiquity and are not so numerous. Nothing in the article, most especially references to military orders, is unlike anything resembling any such branch. Historical and geographic derivations also impossible, untenable, ridiculous. No religious connections whatever are mentioned other than titles, the most prominent of which is western. Absurd.

*'''Delete''' I generally have a low bar for churches where notability is concerned, but the only Google hits were the home page of this alleged church, this article and two other mentions on other Wikipedia articles that refer back to this one. This is likely one of the innumerable vegante churches that rarely comprise more than one or two parishes. Sometimes they are just a website with someone claiming apostolic succession. In any event it hugely fails [[WP:NRV]]. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 21:18, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Please Do Not Delete'''. Dr. Matyas Exarch Puskas Clark has forwarded the following email message: Please cite Our Government files as IRS Church Registration, Byzantine Greek Church Filing AD 1960 Patriarch of Hungary ERDELY Transylvania Carpathia Filing AD 1960 Imperial Patriarch of Czernowitz Registered AD 1986 Military and Hospitallar Order of St Lazarus of Jerusalem Reg. 1986, Byzantine Union Church Reg. 1994 Matyas Exarch. Thank you. [[User:Istvan1|Istvan1]] ([[User talk:Istvan1|talk]]) 19:34, 4 May 2014 (EDT)
*:If this is not a hoax, you will have to provide more than tax registration to prove notability. Notoriety as a hoax does not count either. [[User:Evensteven|Evensteven]] ([[User talk:Evensteven|talk]]) 02:52, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as not notable hoax. I´m sure, that whole existence of this "church" is only virtual,and only reason for this is selling self-styled chivalric orders.--[[User:Yopie|Yopie]] ([[User talk:Yopie|talk]]) 11:19, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete:''' it is obviously a hoax (who created the list of the patriarchs had no knowledge of Hungarian names and titles). [[User:Borsoka|Borsoka]] ([[User talk:Borsoka|talk]]) 14:13, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
