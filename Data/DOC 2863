*'''Delete''' per nom, entirely unnecessary. I live in Hungary and get a combination of google.hu, google.co.uk, and google.com, as it tries to work out what I am up to: but I still get the same search results after a bit. There is no need for this. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 01:19, 7 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per [[WP:REDLINK]]. The only thing the target page says about Australia is that Google has scanned Australian books. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]], those ~300 people are probably looking for information on Google's operations in Australia.

*I really need to write this up as an essay, but this is what I call a condescending redirect. It is likely—I would say ''very'' likely— that a reader searching for "Google Australia" knows what Google is. We can be reasonably certain he or she wants to know about what Google does in Australia. Given that we have (next to) nothing to say about that topic, are we really satisfying their needs? If they just wanted to know about Google generally, they wouldn't use a more specific search term. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 22:35, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::{{Ping|BDD}} If that essay gets created, or if you find a consensus-supported guideline stating this, let me know: my "keep" vote is based solely on the fact that similar redirects exist ([[WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS]]), but would be happy to change my stance based on a different consensus-driven decision/precedent (and also nominate the other redirects I mentioned ... for deletion).

*'''Delete''' (next to) no information about this topic. Deleting the redirect will save people wasting their time looking for it. [[User:Siuenti|Siuenti]] ([[User talk:Siuenti|talk]]) 23:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. {{u|BDD}}, I would call redirects like this ''deceptive redirects'' rather than condescending. ([[WP:DECEPTIVE]] is free....) The argument that deleting this will "hinder massive numbers of people" completely fails to consider that a redirect that does not deliver on the promise of its name is, in fact, a hindrance. I would much rather see a message saying "no such article" than be deceived by the false promise of a search result leading to an article that tells me nothing at all about what I was expecting to see. — [[User:Scott|'''<span style="color:#000">Scott</span>''']] <span style="color:#900">•</span> [[User talk:Scott|''<span style="color:#000">talk</span>'']] 20:01, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::"Deceptive" is a good way of putting it too. I just imagine these redirects like [[reference interview]]s:
:::'''Reader''': Excuse me, do you have any information on Google Australia?
:::'''Wikipedia''': Yes, of course. Here's information on [[Google]].
:::'''Reader''': Yeah, but all this says about Australia is that Google scanned books there. What else does Google do in Australia?
:::'''Wikipedia''': [''No response''.]
:::'''Reader''': Um, I mean... thanks.
::If we're coming up with a typology of problematic redirects, I'd think there are deceptive redirects which aren't necessarily condescending, so perhaps condescending redirects could be thought of as a subset. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 20:27, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::@{{u|BDD}}: This imaginary dialog goes against the usage of this redirect: [[Terence Tao]], [[List of Google hoaxes and easter eggs]], [[Eureka Prizes]], [[Yodel Australia]] and [[Androidland]]. Given that view count of these pages is orders of magnitude higher then of this redirect, I would not count on noticable amount of inbound traffic off-site. So far you are trying to underserve real users to provide questionable benefit to imaginary reader. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.

:::::Then that content should be covered at the target page, or expanded into its own. It's beside the point of whether the redirect is functional now. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 21:27, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::::@{{u|BDD}}: These 5 pages basicly say that Google did something via its Australian office (training of personnel, financing, fake holiday announcement). They point at [[Google]] without misleading anyone. Also note: [[Google]] is frequently viewed and frequently edited article; any potential encyclopedic content about Australian office of Google is more likely to land at [[Google]] rather at (rather obscure) [[Google Australia]]. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.

*<small>([[Help:Edit conflict|edit conflict]])</small> '''Delete''' per [[User:BDD|BDD]]. The aforementioned point above about how this redirect is misleading is rather sound and has more encyclopedic value than keeping several misleading redirects. I'd honestly add the additional redirects I mentioned to this RFD, as well as [[Google Pakistan]] and [[Google pakistan]], but I'll leave that for another RFD.

::Yes, I think it is misleading, which is ''perhaps'' [[WP:RFD#DELETE]] #2, but perhaps I am interpreting that a little too broadly. Isn't it also covered by [[WP:RFD#DELETE]] #10?
::Incidentally, I was thinking yesterday when walking home it would be nice if the search engine would allow one to exclude certain pages (or terms), in particular so that one could exclude a particular redirect so as to see what would come up if it didn't exist. Someone will probably tell me that facility already exists. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 08:37, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

I nominated this for speedy, declined as plausible. With a small 'd' in disambiguation it would at least look like a normal redirect, but capital D doesn't fit naming conventions. It is also not useful - the dab is at Auburn Middle School and no need for [[WP:INTDABLINK]], which would use a small d anyway. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 20:41, 29 March 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' for purely technical reasons. Per the nominator's rationale ... yes, this redirect really should have qualified for [[WP:CSD#G6|CSD G6]]. [[User:Steel1943|<span style="color: #2F4F4F;">'''''Steel1943'''''</span>]] ([[User talk:Steel1943|talk]]) 21:52, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' Solely for technical reasons; now that we have the proper DAB up, this is duplicative. <font face="Myriad Web">'''[[User:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:royalblue4">Nate</span>]]''' <span style="color:dark blue">•</span> <small>''([[User_talk:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:darkgoldenrod">chatter</span>]])''</small></font> 23:28, 29 March 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Sorry, I'm unwilling to delete just about any redirect that only differs in capitalization from a legitimate title or redirect. I know it requires some of that RfD doublethink, but while this redirect shouldn't've been created, now that it has, it shouldn't be deleted either. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 17:44, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' Small d or big D, it doesn't meet [[WP:INTDABLINK]], so wouldn't be a legitimate redirect that only differs in capitalisation. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 18:16, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
:::[[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]], pardon the very delayed response, but you're assuming "legitimate redirect" means one that would be used (properly) in a wikilink. Many redirects are kept which would not fall under that category. When I say this redirect is legitimate, I mostly mean that it is not misleading or confusing. Any reader using this search term (especially with a case-sensitive method such as a direct URL) will go exactly where he or she intends. Generally, redirects need to be problematic or harmful to be deleted. I just don't see how that's the case here. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 16:59, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' what? Theres only one auburn middle school. Makes no sense to have it [[User:Nedgreiner|Nedgreiner]] ([[User talk:Nedgreiner|talk]]) 19:01, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
**The main dab page at [[Auburn Middle School]] lists two. [[User:Ansh666|ansh]]''[[User talk:Ansh666|666]]'' 23:59, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' <s>both [[Auburn Middle School]] and</s> [[Auburn Middle School (Disambiguation)]]. Please see my updated rationale in response to BDD's request for clarification. <s>The former is a bad page that does not adhere to the [[WP:DAB|disambiguation]] policy and the latter is redirect to a page that must not exist.</s> Best regards, [[User:Codename Lisa|Codename Lisa]] ([[User talk:Codename Lisa|talk]]) 22:22, 1 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' [[User:Codename Lisa]], if you want to delete the dab (which is valid and entries meet [[MOS:DABMENTION]]), AfD would be the venue, as your prod was declined due to [[MOS:DABMENTION]] (which I assume, from your above comments, you didn't read). [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 17:33, 4 April 2014 (UTC)
**Hi, Boleyn. If you compare the date and time on my comment above with the date and time of my PROD, you can see for yourself that your "which I assume" statement is wrong. Oh, and by the way, you and I both know that compliance with DABMENTION is required but is not enough. If not that, you and I both know that starting an AfD in this stage on my part is akin to requesting my username to be changed to Codename Pain in the Stomach.

*Also, [[User:Codename Lisa|Codename Lisa]], could you clarify your position? You said the redirect should be deleted because the target page shouldn't exist. If the target article were deleted, the redirect would automatically be deleted as a G8. As long as we do have the target page, do you still think the redirect should be deleted? Or should your vote be seen as conditional? --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 20:11, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:*Thanks for asking. Taken alone, the nominator's nomination is valid. This redirect is akin to creating a <nowiki>[[Bill Gates (human)]]</nowiki> redirect for [[:Bill Gates]] article, although per [[WP:DAB]], same reasoning does not apply to [[:Auburn Middle School (disambiguation)]]. In fact, because the latter exists, there is more reason to delete the former as search engine would find the latter even when the former is given.

::Now, why didn't I say all this in the original message? Well, I didn't expect that the deletion of [[Auburn Middle School]] would be contested. Best regards, [[User:Codename Lisa|Codename Lisa]] ([[User talk:Codename Lisa|talk]]) 21:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' [[Auburn Middle School (disambiguation)]] already exists. This is for [[WP:INTDABLINK]] for a formulaic redirect. If the redirect doesn't follow the formulaic recommendation, it isn't useful. It will never be autogenerated by the disambiguation hatnotes, it isn't the format the bots use to distinguish the formulaic redirects apart.  -- [[Special:Contributions/65.94.171.206|65.94.171.206]] ([[User talk:65.94.171.206|talk]]) 04:41, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

::Since when do naming conventions apply to redirects? --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 16:38, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Er... If we don't, why do we have a bot roaming around and changing links like <nowiki>[[ambiguous X]]</nowiki> to <nowiki>[[ambiguous X (disambiguation)|ambiguous X]]</nowiki>? Maybe [[User:Anomie]] could kindly shed a light on this. Then again, this first time I wanted to make a disambiguation page, User:FleetCommand warned me not a capitalize the "D" because in his case, the dab page was renamed without leaving a redirect behind. Best regards, [[User:Codename Lisa|Codename Lisa]] ([[User talk:Codename Lisa|talk]]) 16:54, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
::::This sort of redirect doesn't hinder the work of bots like that. I still find this discussion quite bizarre. I can't think of another time that a redirect that differs from an uncontroversial one only by the capitalization of one letter has attracted serious support for deletion at RfD. There are many appeals to naming conventions and the like here, which suggest that we're really not discussing the right question. The relevant ones are: is this redirect harmful? Will it take readers where they want to go? --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 17:00, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:::: As far as I know, we ''don't'' have a bot that changes <nowiki>[[ambiguous X]]</nowiki> to <nowiki>[[ambiguous X (disambiguation)|ambiguous X]]</nowiki> (or vice versa), and I can't think why one would have been approved to do that.

*'''Comment''' This title was originally created as a duplicate article for the then-upcoming film [[Thalaivaa]], and ''Thalapathy Thalapthy'' is the name of a song from that film. ''Ilayathalapathy'' (obviously containing the name of this redirect) is also in the title of a few of the references, [[Ilayathalapathy]] redirects to [[Vijay (actor)]], the star of ''Thalaivaa''.

Redirect from misspelling of the name of historical flavor of [[Tor (anonymity network)#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]] – [[Portable Tor]]. The typo (missing space between the words) doesn't seem plausible, and hit count at [http://stats.grok.se/en/201403/PortableTor noise level] suggests that the name is not used off site. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.

*'''Keep'''. Just because there is no space in the official term doesn't mean that this redirect isn't useful. Unless there comes a time where there is another subject that can be referred to as the term with no space, this redirect serves its intended purpose.

**Judging on stats it serves no purpose at all. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D. Czarkoff]] ([[user talk:czarkoff|talk]]•[[Special:Contributions/czarkoff|track]]) 19:11, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::*Typos/incorrect spacing terms almost always serve a useful purpose, regardless of traffic levels. Unless the redirect's title is completely misleading (which this one is not), it could be useful to someone.

*'''Keep''': [[WP:CHEAP]] plus [[Portable Tor]] exists and has the same target.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  02:47, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
