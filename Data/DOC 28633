The '''Lunar CATALYST''' ('''Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown''') initiative is an attempt by [[NASA]] to encourage the development of robotic lunar landers that can be integrated with United States commercial launch capabilities to deliver payloads to the lunar surface.<ref name=techport>

NASA aims to build on its partnerships with the U.S. commercial space industry that are developing new spacecraft and rockets capable of delivering cargo (and soon, astronauts) to low Earth orbit. Recognizing United States industry's interest in reaching and exploring the Moon, the Agency has competitively selected three partners to spur commercial cargo transportation capabilities to the surface of the Moon.

The hope is commercial robotic lunar lander capabilities will address emerging demand by private customers who wish to conduct activities on the Moon and could also enable new science and exploration missions of interest to the larger scientific and academic communities.

Currently the Lunar CATALYST initiative has signed three no-funds-exchanged [[Space Act Agreement]] (SAA) partnerships with U.S. private sector entities.<ref name=techport /><ref name=LCAT_20140504_01>

NASA has published that it and other space agencies have plans to launch almost two dozen robotic missions in the next decade (starting 2017) that commercial lunar transportation capabilities may be able to bid for.<ref name="LCAT_20171031" />

==Initiative overview==

Lunar CATALYST is operated under the Advanced Exploration Systems Division of NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. The three companies Astrobotic Technology, Masten Space Systems and Moon Express are being offered SAA but will not receiving any funds.<ref name=techport /> They will negotiate with the space agency for a partnership to exchange technical expertise and help promote the private space sector.<ref name=LCAT_20140504_02>

On November 1, 2016 NASA issued a Request for Information (RFI) about possible small lunar surface payloads that can be delivered to the Moon's surface in the 2017-2020 time-frame using U.S. commercial lunar cargo transportation service providers. Of particular interest were payloads that address NASA's strategic objectives including filling one or more of NASA's lunar exploration Strategic Knowledge Gaps (SKGs).<ref name="SOl20161101">

{{Asof |2017 |11}} NASA reports that during the first 3 years the CATALYST partners, working with NASA engineers, have advanced their lander and mission designs through end-to-end mission simulations and subsystems tests, as well as engine hot-fire tests and tethered flight demonstrations. All 3 companies have incorporated NASA's Core Flight System software into their machines.<ref name="LCAT_20171031" />

{{Asof |2018 |5}} NASA has issued a Request for Proposals for [[Commercial Lunar Payload Services]] (CLPS) to deliver payloads to the Moon. NASA several contracts for CLPS services will be awarded during the next decade. Missions to the lunar surface expected to begin in 2019.<ref name="NASA_Moon_Plans">
