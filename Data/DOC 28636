==Biography==
Lautier was born in [[New Iberia, Louisiana]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40854742/|title=The World Today|last=|first=|date=May 19, 1962|website=The Pittsburgh Courier|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> in 1897 and raised in New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/archives/scurlock/about_the_scurlocks/notables/Lautier.htm|title=Archives Center {{!}} Portraits of a City: The Scurlock Photographic Studio, Lautier, Louis R., d. 1962|last=|first=|date=2005-04-12|website=Smithsonian National Museum of American History (NMAH)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}</ref> He attended Straight College (later [[Dillard University]]) in New Orleans, [[Morris Brown College]] in [[Atlanta]], from which he received an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] and an honorary [[LL.D.]], and studied at [[Howard Law School]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] employed him as a legal [[stenographer]] and at the same time he also reported for various African American newspapers.<ref>''Washington Post'', May 8, 1962.</ref>   His reporting focused largely on [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in Washington and the federal government.

In 1945, Lautier became Washington correspondent for the [[National Negro Publishers Association]], which provided news stories to the black press. He covered [[White House press conference]]s but could not get a Congressional press pass. The [[Standing Committee of Correspondents]], a group of reporters that decided on credentials for the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] and [[U.S. House|House]] press galleries, rejected his application because his client papers were mostly weeklies and the press gallery admitted only reporters for daily papers. In 1947, Lautier took his case to the [[Senate Rules Committee]], whose chairman, Illinois Senator [[C. Wayland Brooks]], ordered the gallery to admit him. Lautier became the first black reporter in the press galleries since the 1870s.<ref>Donald A. Ritchie, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=34TdilvGdE0C&dq Reporting from Washington: The History of the Washington Press Corps]'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 36-37.</ref>

He became a member of the White House Correspondents Association in 1951 and began attending their annual dinners two years later. In 1955, Lautier applied for membership in the [[National Press Club]]. Division within the membership was so intense that Press Club held its only referendum on admitting him. He was approved by a vote of 377 to 281.<ref>Gil Klein, ''Reliable Sources: 100 Years at the National Press Club'' (Turner Publishing, 2008), pp. 62-65.</ref>

Lautier retired from the NNPA in 1961 to become special assistant to the chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] and to write a column, "Looking at the Record," which the RNC distributed to the black press. He died of a heart attack on May 6, 1962.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34TdilvGdE0C&vq|title=Reporting from Washington: The History of the Washington Press Corps|last=Ritchie|first=Donald A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=0195346327|location=New York, NY|pages=45}}</ref>
