The '''Bao-Tavera Dam Complex''' refers to two earth-filled [[embankment dam]]s located about {{Convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] in [[Santiago Province (Dominican Republic)|Santiago Province]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]. The '''Bao Dam''' on the [[Bao River]] is {{Convert|113|m|ft|abbr=on}} and withholds a reservoir with a maximum storage capacity of {{Convert|280000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}. It is the second tallest dam in the country behind the [[Monci√≥n Dam]]. The '''Tavera Dam''', about {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Bao Dam, on the river [[Yaque del Norte]] is {{Convert|82|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and has a reservoir with a capacity of {{Convert|170000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}. A {{Convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} canal connects each reservoir, making them a complex. The purpose of the complex is to provide [[municipal water]], water for [[irrigation]] and to generate [[hydroelectric]] power. Water from the Tavera Reservoir is piped downstream to the Tavera Hydroelectric Plant which is situated on the right bank of the Bao River before it meets the Yaque del Norte River. The power station contains two 48 [[watt|MW]] [[Francis turbine]]-generators for an installed capacity of 96 MW. Construction on the Tavera Dam began in September 1969 and it was completed on 27 September 1973. The Bao Dam was completed in 1981. The power station was upgraded from 80 MW to 96 MW in 1992.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arqhys.com/construccion/complejo-tavera-bao.html | title=Complex Tavera-Bao | publisher=Arqhys Architecture | accessdate=24 April 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hidroelectrica.gob.do/Central.aspx?IDCentral=11 | publisher=Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company | accessdate=24 April 2014 | title=Data Plant: Tavera | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/dams/index.stm | title=Aquastat - Dams in the Dominican Republic | publisher=UNFAO | accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>
