The '''Valea Viilor fortified church''' ({{lang-ro|Biserica fortificată din Valea Viilor}}; {{lang-de|Kirchenburg von Wurmloch}}) is a [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheran]] [[fortified church]] in [[Valea Viilor]] (''Wurmloch''), [[Sibiu County]], in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]]. It was built by the [[Germans|ethnic German]] [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community at a time when the area belonged to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Initially [[Roman Catholic]], it became Lutheran following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Together with the surrounding village, the church forms part of the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

===Background and church===
There is evidence to suggest that an earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church existed in the village, as remnants could formerly be seen beneath the floor of the [[sacristy]]. This building is believed to have been 10 m long, less than half the length of the present church. The latter, in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style and dedicated to [[Saint Peter]],<ref name="dragut">[[Vasile Drăguț]], ''Arta gotică în România'', p.127. Editura Meridiane, Bucharest, 1979</ref> was begun in the 14th century. The small [[nave]] has a vaulted ceiling with a complex network of ribs, which rest on seven pairs of poles attached to the walls. The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] has a ceiling of the same type.<ref name="com"/> Built in 1528, the [[pulpit]] was produced in a period of transition from Gothic to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]].<ref name="org"/>

The church underwent modifications at the beginning of the 16th century: a defensive level featuring parapets was added atop the nave, while towers were built next to the north and south entrances. Next to each of these was a small round tower with a spiral staircase that reached the fortified level. A third tower, near the buttress at the southwest end of the nave, provided access to the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]],<ref name="com"/> itself fitted with numerous and varied defense mechanisms. The choir was rebuilt as a three-story brick defensive tower with walls 1.5 m thick. A fourth level, which juts out slightly atop a row of [[corbel]]s and is supported by arches built between the [[buttress]]es, has a [[Timber framing|timber frame]] [[parapet]]. The altar painting was executed in 1779 by an artist from [[Sighișoara]].<ref name="org"/>

===Fortifications and recognition===
A single oval fortification,<ref name="com"/> constructed around 1500 and equipped with a [[battlement]] resting on brick arches,<ref name="org"/> surrounds the church. Access is through an arched passage beneath the [[gate tower]] on the western side. This could be closed with a [[portcullis]] that had a grille of wood strengthened by iron.<ref name="com">{{ro icon}} [http://www.biserici-fortificate.com/locations/valea_viilor___wurmloch/19/ Valea Viilor/Wurmloch] at biserici-fortificate.com</ref><ref name="org">{{ro icon}} [http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/valea-viilor-wurmloch/ Valea Viilor/Wurmloch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504204639/http://biserici-fortificate.org/ro/valea-viilor-wurmloch/ |date=2014-05-04 }} at biserici-fortificate.org</ref> Three [[bastion]]s survive, each facing one of the [[cardinal points]]. The walls reach 6–7 m in height; they have both parapets and [[embrasure]]s supported by corbels.<ref name="com"/>

In 1999, Valea Viilor, together with five other places, was added to the already-listed [[Biertan]] to form the [[villages with fortified churches in Transylvania]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/165 "World Heritage Committee Inscribes 48 New Sites on Heritage List"] at the UNESCO site</ref> Additionally, the church is listed as a [[Monument istoric|historic monument]] by Romania's [[Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs]], with the wall and bastions being listed as a separate entry.<ref>{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20190217084918/http://www.patrimoniu.ro/images/LMI/LMI-2010_SB.pdf Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Judeţul Sibiu]</ref>
