An article that would belong in main space, except that there's already another article on the same topic with the same content in its history (and that is already facing a [[WP:PROD|prod]]). [[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 00:12, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - [[WP:STALEDRAFT]]. One copy of this unsourced material is enough, or perhaps still too many.  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 00:05, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Spdy delete'''. Both pages were created by the same editor. --[[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 02:28, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
