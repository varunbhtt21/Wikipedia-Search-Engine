:* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] Size of prose, creation date, hook etc. all check. However in the article the hook information seems a copyvio of the linked source [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008JE003291/abstract]. Should there be some more thorough copyvio check before giving the okay? --[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 15:11, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Graeme Bartlett, there is no doubt this article needs copy editing, but not enough to reject it.  Because of the dabs tag, I went in to correct and found an extreme amount of over linking.  I corrected some, but got tired (really tired) and left the last over linked paragraph for you to see what I'm talking about. As I was checking for over linking, I found some tedious repetition of words/phrases within the same sentence.  This article is not lengthy, but it needs copy editing. I don't know about the copyvio, because I didn't check for that. [[User:Maile66|â€” Maile ]] ([[User talk:Maile66|talk]]) 14:26, 26 April 2014 (UTC)    
:*This will have to be done again as our author has done another draft and moved it to [[Geodynamics of Mars]], so I have redirected it.  Though I have having trouble with edit conflicts, I should be able to sort his out. [[User:Graeme Bartlett|Graeme Bartlett]] ([[User talk:Graeme Bartlett|talk]]) 20:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::*I have changed the nomination  to the new "merged" article at [[Geodynamics of Mars]].  However it still has plenty of copied text so once I clean this out I will ask for a renewed assessment. This one is even bigger and newer. [[User:Graeme Bartlett|Graeme Bartlett]] ([[User talk:Graeme Bartlett|talk]]) 08:31, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] {{Reply to|Graeme Bartlett}} No one has worked on this article since your last comment. Are you still hoping to get back to this? [[User:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist]] ([[User talk:RockMagnetist|talk]]) 16:51, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*I was thinking of giving up on this one, as it needs a lot of work! [[User:Graeme Bartlett|Graeme Bartlett]] ([[User talk:Graeme Bartlett|talk]]) 21:55, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] Found one definite copyvio. I suspect that there are others because the text alternates between highly technical language and writing of a very low quality with abundant misspellings and other style problems. I suspect that one figure, [[:File:Stagnant_lid_convection.jpg]], may be a scan of a published figure (the text looks like typewriter text, not computer-generated text). The content is almost all taken from primary sources (see [[WP:PRIMARY]]), and not organized in a way that suggests much understanding on the part of the contributors. Nothing short of a complete rewrite, starting with secondary sources such as ''Geodynamics'' by Turcotte and Schubert, would make this suitable for DYK.
