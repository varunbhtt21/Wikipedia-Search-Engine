'''Tongan Crip Gang''', or '''TCG''' is a street gang that is a subset of the [[Crips]] gang. The gang is active in the U.S. states of [[California]], [[Utah]] and others, as well as a presence in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]]. Tongan Crip Gang members are primarily of [[Pacific Islander]] descent, mainly [[Tongan American|Tongan]].

==History==

During the 1970s and 1980s, many Pacific Islanders moved into the high crime-rate areas in [[Los Angeles County]], California. There, Samoan and Tongan Americans formed their own gangs during the 1970s. Many of the TCG members moved from California to the [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] area in the 1980s, and distributed the gang set there.<ref name=ap>[http://www.adn.com/2014/04/23/3438157/court-shooting-sheds-light-on.html Court shooting sheds light on 'Tongan Crips', a gang with Alaska ties] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425040908/http://www.adn.com/2014/04/23/3438157/court-shooting-sheds-light-on.html |date=2014-04-25 }}, Associated Press, April 23, 2014.</ref><ref name=ap2>[http://www.localnews8.com/news/court-shooting-sheds-light-on-tongan-crips-gang/25623280 Court shooting sheds light on 'Tongan Crips'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233719/http://www.localnews8.com/news/court-shooting-sheds-light-on-tongan-crips-gang/25623280 |date=2014-04-26 }}, Associated Press, April 23, 2014.</ref>
