The '''Hatillo Dam''' is an earth and rock-filled [[embankment dam]] on the [[Yuna River]] about {{Convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Cotuí]] in [[Sánchez Ramírez Province]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]. With a storage capacity of {{Convert|710000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}, the dam's reservoir is the largest in the country. The purpose of the dam is to produce [[hydroelectric]] power, provide water for irrigation and to control floods. The power station is located at the base of the dam and contains a single 8 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generator. Construction on the dam began in August 1977 and it was completed in 1984.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arqhys.com/construccion/hatillo-presa.html | title=Presa Hatillo | publisher=Arqhys Architecture | accessdate=24 April 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ansaldoksa.com/Data/Jeddah22072006/Reference%20List%2020067.pdf | title=Reference List | publisher=Ansaldoksa | accessdate=24 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424032959/http://ansaldoksa.com/Data/Jeddah22072006/Reference%20List%2020067.pdf | archivedate=24 April 2014 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hidroelectrica.gob.do/Central.aspx?IDCentral=8 | publisher=Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company | accessdate=24 April 2014 | title=Data Plant: Hatillo | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/dams/index.stm | title=Aquastat - Dams in the Dominican Republic | publisher=UNFAO | accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>
