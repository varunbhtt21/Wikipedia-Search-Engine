* ... that the foreman of a [[grand jury]] which he oversaw complained that Judge '''[[William H. Barnes (jurist)|William H. Barnes]]''' ''(pictured)'' was exerting inappropriate influence on witnesses?
:* '''ALT1''':... that [[Arizona Territory|Arizona Territorial]] Supreme Court Justice '''[[William H. Barnes (jurist)|William H. Barnes]]''' ''(pictured)'' once issued a ruling that "the court ought not to issue the writ unless it is prepared to enforce [it]"?
:* '''ALT2''':... that the official reason Arizona Territorial Supreme Court Justice '''[[William H. Barnes (jurist)|William H. Barnes]]''' ''(pictured)'' was dismissed was that he was accepting a salary from [[Arizona Territory]]?
:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/Steve Glasson]]
:* ''Comment'': Request this be run on May 11 (125th anniversary of the [[Wham Paymaster Robbery]]).  Barnes was the judge which oversaw the grand jury investigation into the case.

:* <s>'''Concern''' Main hook fails NPOV - "was exerting inappropriate influence on witnesses," takes disputed accusations as facts. [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] ([[User talk:Hipocrite|talk]]) 15:29, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</s>
::* Misread the hook. [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] ([[User talk:Hipocrite|talk]]) 17:13, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::Suggest change in hook to 
::* '''ALT3'''...that the foreman of a [[grand jury]] in the [[Wham Paymaster Robbery]] case complained that presiding '''[[William H. Barnes (jurist)|William H. Barnes]]''' ''(pictured)'' was exerting inappropriate influence on government witnesses?

::Still under 200 characters. Shows the case, which I think adds interest. Also, exertion of influence on government witnesses, as was claimed, showed he was favoring the defense. Details are in the article and in the citation. Original hook is ok if must be shorter or if preferred by nominator/author.

::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]]. Article was new within five days of nomination. Prose portion is long enough. Meets core policies: neutral article, cites sources and has inline citations, no evidence of copyright violations - many of the citations and references are before 1923 and many are verifiable through links; assume good faith with the other sources; no evidence of close paraphrasing or plagiarism. Hook is short enough and meets formatting guidelines. I am not opposed to the shorter originally proposed hook, but as I note, I think a longer hook as I proposed might be more attractive. Hook fact is interesting, deals with a long-deceased person, is neutral, accurate, can be verified as such by the citation which is available on line. QPQ satisfied. Image is from Wikimedia Commons, copyright (1916) has expired, thumbnail version is ok for attachment. Note request that this run on anniversary of the robbery - May 11. Ready to go as far as I am concerned. [[User:Donner60|Donner60]] ([[User talk:Donner60|talk]]) 03:42, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:::If the promoter prefers ALT3, I have no objection.  The shorter proposed hook was written to avoid multiple links to the robbery appearing on the Main page at the same time.  The robbery is currently scheduled to appear at [[Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/May 11]]. --''[[User: Allen3|Allen3]]''&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:Allen3|talk]]</sup> 08:00, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
