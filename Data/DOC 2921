* claimed as self-made in 2014. The subject is 76 and all images I can see online of him recently have him with a goatee, much less hair, and looking significantly older. I suspect this is someone else's image from a while ago. See him now in http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/03/15/cl_slide-92c3939bb6b234d4557aa5e8e324dd061e9261b6-s6-c30.jpg [[User:Peripitus |Peripitus]] [[User talk:Peripitus|(Talk)]] 00:49, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

* Hi Peripitus, this photo was taken by the subject's spouse, and she just let me know now that it was taken in '''1991''', not 2014. That accounts for the difference in the subject's appearance. His wife requested that the photo be put up on the Charles Lloyd wiki page, and accordingly released it. Does that help? [[User:Ropeadoper|Ropeadoper]] ([[User talk:Ropeadoper|talk]]) 19:07, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|Ropeadoper}} that makes it clearer. What you need then is to follow the process at [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] to verify and permanently record this copyright release  - [[User:Peripitus |Peripitus]] [[User talk:Peripitus|(Talk)]] 22:51, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

* Thanks very much. I've gone in and updated the year of the photo to 1991, as well as the license, to GNU Free Documentation. [[User:Ropeadoper|Ropeadoper]] ([[User talk:Ropeadoper|talk]]) 16:37, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
