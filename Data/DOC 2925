'''''Kryptodrakon''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[Pterodactyloidea|pterodactyloid]] [[pterosaur]] from the [[Middle Jurassic|Middle]]–[[Late Jurassic]] boundary of [[China]], with an age of approximately 162.7 million years.<ref name="Andres2014" /> It is known from a single [[type species]], '''''Kryptodrakon progenitor'''''. When it was named in 2014, ''Kryptodrakon'' was the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basalmost]] and oldest pterodactyloid known.<ref name="Andres2014">{{cite journal |author1=Andres, B. |author2=Clark, J. |author3=Xu, X. |year=2014 |title=The Earliest Pterodactyloid and the Origin of the Group |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume= 24|issue= |pages= 1011–6|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.030 |pmid=24768054}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.usf.edu/article/templates/?a=6251&z=123 |title=International Scientific Team Discovers, Names Oldest Pterodactyloid Species |first=Vickie |last=Chachere |date=April 24, 2014 |work=USF News }}</ref>

==Discovery and naming==
In 2001, pterosaur bones were discovered in [[Xinjiang]] by Chris Sloan. The bones were first identified as those of a [[theropod]]; [[palaeontologist]] [[James Clark (palaeontologist)|James Clark]] later recognized their pterosaurian nature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/04/140424-pterodactyl-pterosaur-china-oldest-science-animals/ |title=Meet Kryptodrakon: Oldest Known Pterodactyl Found in China |first=Christine |last=Dell'Amore |date=April 24, 2014 |work=National Geographic, Daily News }}</ref>

In 2014, [[Brian Andres]], Clark and [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]] named and described the type species ''Kryptodrakon progenitor''. The generic name means ''hidden dragon'' from Greek κρυπτός, ''kryptos'' (''hidden''), and δράκων, ''drakon'' (''dragon''). The name alludes to the film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''progenitor'' means ''ancestor'' or ''founder of a family'' in [[Latin]], and refers to the animal's status as the most basal member of the [[Pterodactyloidea]].<ref name="Andres2014" />

The [[holotype]], '''IVPP V18184''', was uncovered in a layer of the [[Shishugou Formation]] dating from the [[Callovian]]–[[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] and having a minimum age of 161 million years. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains fragments of both wings including the right fourth metacarpal, parts of the shoulder girdle and the second sacral vertebra. The bones were not articulated but were discovered in a small area of thirty square centimetres, at a considerable distance from other fossil remains, and thus likely represent a single individual. The bones were largely preserved three-dimensionally, without strong compression. The holotype probably was an adult individual.<ref name="Andres2014" />

==Description==
''Kryptodrakon'' has an estimated [[wingspan]] of {{convert|1.47|m|ft}}. Its fourth [[metacarpal]] is relatively slender and elongated, a strong indication that ''Kryptodrakon'' is a pterodactyloid. The fourth metacarpal has a minimum length of 72.2 millimetres, while the [[humerus]] has an estimated length of between 75 and 86 millimetres. These relative proportions are within the range of pterodactyloids. The radius shows an [[autapomorphy]]: it possesses an extra lump on the front outer lower side. The skeleton shows no signs of pneumatisation.<ref name="Andres2014" />

==Phylogeny==
The main author performed a [[cladistic]] analysis, the most extensive ever published about the Pterosauria and providing clade definitions for most pterosaur groups previously undefined. The analysis showed that ''Kryptodrakon'' is the [[sister species]] of all other known [[Pterodactyloidea]], together forming the [[Lophocratia]], and thus the basalmost pterodactyloid known, if Pterodactyloidea is defined ''[[sensu]]'' Padian 2004 as containing those species possessing a metacarpal with at least 80% of the length of the [[humerus]], [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to ''[[Pterodactylus]]''. The species is about five million years older than the oldest pterodactyloids previously discovered. A supposedly older pterodactyloid, a partial jaw referred to the group [[Ctenochasmatidae]], had been described from the [[Middle Jurassic]] of the UK.<ref>Buffetaut, E. and Jeffrey, P. (2012). "A ctenochasmatid pterosaur from the Stonesfield Slate (Bathonian, Middle Jurassic) of Oxfordshire, England." ''Geological Magazine'', (advance online publication) {{doi|10.1017/S0016756811001154}}</ref> However, this specimen probably represents a [[teleosaurid]] stem-crocodilian instead of a pterosaur.<ref name="Andres2014" />

==Paleobiology==
''Kryptodrakon'' lived in a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] or in-land habitat, far from the coast. Andres ''et al'' (2014) saw this as an indication that the Pterodactyloidea had a terrestrial origin. The relatively short wings of ''Kryptodrakon'' confirm this hypothesis, as long-winged species of modern birds and long-winged [[pterosaurs]] tend to live at the coast and short-winged species tend to inhabit [[forest]]s, as was shown by a study published as part of the describing article.<ref name="Andres2014" />
