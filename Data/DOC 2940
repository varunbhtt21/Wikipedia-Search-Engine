'''Rupert Vivian de Renzy Worker''' (15 April 1896, in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] – 23 April 1989, in [[Napier, New Zealand]]) played [[first-class cricket]] in New Zealand between 1914 and 1929.

==Early career==
Worker made his first-class debut when he played one match for [[Auckland cricket team|Auckland]] in the 1914–15 season. After graduating from [[University of Auckland|Auckland University College]] he became a schoolmaster. While teaching at [[Christchurch Boys' High School]]<ref>[http://www.thebookshelf.auckland.ac.nz/docs/Kiwi/kiwi_016_01.pdf ''The Kiwi: The Magazine of Auckland University College'', July 1921, p. 22.] Retrieved 20 April 2014.</ref> he appeared for [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury]], playing his first game as an opening batsman in the 1919–20 season. He was the outstanding batsman in [[Christchurch]] club cricket in 1919-20, scoring 609 runs at an average of 76.12 for West Christchurch. Nobody else score more than 400 runs.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cricket averages |journal=Sun |date=15 March 1920 |page=2 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200315.2.5.2}}</ref>

He became a regular player in the Canterbury side, but his achievements to the end of the 1922–23 season were modest: in 12 first-class matches he had made 510 runs at 22.17,<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/16/16941/f_Batting_by_Season.html Rupert Worker batting by season]</ref> with a top score of 65 (in an opening partnership of 208 with [[Roger Blunt]]) against [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in 1922–23.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/10/10665.html Canterbury v MCC 1922–23]</ref>

==Plunket Shield record==
Worker transferred to [[Otago Boys' High School]] and began playing for Otago.<ref>''[[New Zealand Truth]]'', 28 February 1925, p. 11.</ref> He began the 1923–24 [[Plunket Shield]] season with 172 and 16 against Canterbury,<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/11/11024.html Canterbury v Otago 1923–24]</ref> then scored 93 and 34 against Auckland.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/11/11037.html Auckland v Otago 1923–24]</ref>

In the final match, against [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]] at [[Carisbrook]], 1905 runs were scored over five days – which is still the seventh-highest aggregate in the history of first-class cricket<ref>[http://www.blackcaps.co.nz/uploadGallery/NZC_museum/NZCM-Sum-Aut-10-11.pdf New Zealand Cricket Museum Summer-Autumn 2010–11 newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209173546/http://www.blackcaps.co.nz/uploadGallery/NZC_museum/NZCM-Sum-Aut-10-11.pdf |date=9 February 2013 }} Retrieved 20 April 2014.</ref> – and Worker set the record for most runs in a Plunket Shield season. Wellington batted first and made 560, and Otago replied with 385, Worker scoring 106 and making an opening partnership of 154 in 76 minutes with [[James Shepherd (New Zealand cricketer)|James Shepherd]].<ref>[[Dick Brittenden|R.T. Brittenden]], ''Great Days in New Zealand Cricket'', A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1958, p. 49.</ref> When Wellington made 465 in their second innings their opening batsman [[Syd Hiddleston]] scored 150 to set a new Plunket Shield record of 505 runs in a season. The next day Worker made 94, putting on 155 with Shepherd in 85 minutes,<ref>Brittenden, ''Great Days in New Zealand Cricket'', p. 51.</ref> and beating Hiddleston's record by 10 runs,<ref>Brittenden, ''New Zealand Cricketers'', A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1961, p. 86.</ref> but Otago, needing 641 to win, were dismissed for 495.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/11/11042.html Otago v Wellington 1923–24]</ref> Hiddleston reclaimed the record in the 1925–26 season, when he made 537 runs.<ref>Brittenden, ''New Zealand Cricketers'', p. 86.</ref>

After the Plunket Shield season ended, a [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales team]] played two matches against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]. Worker made 8 and 37 for New Zealand in the first match, and a [[Pair (cricket)|pair]] in the second.

==Later career==
In 1924–25 Worker made 205 runs in the Plunket Shield at an average of 41.00<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/3/Plunket_Shield_1924-25/Batting_by_Average.html Plunket Shield batting averages 1924–25]</ref> and played both matches for New Zealand against [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]], scoring 33, 34, 55 and 6.

He toured [[New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 1925-26|Australia with a New Zealand side in 1925–26]], playing all four matches, but finished seventh in both aggregates and averages, with 195 runs at 27.85.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/0/New_Zealand_in_Australia_1925-26/f_New_Zealanders_Batting.html New Zealanders in Australia 1925–26 batting averages]</ref>

He transferred to Wellington in 1926, playing three matches in 1926–27, two in 1927–28, and one each in 1928–29 and 1929–30. His success was modest, apart from his one match in 1928–29, when he made 151 and 73, top-scoring in each innings, and Wellington beat Auckland by 37 runs.<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/12/12955.html Auckland v Wellington 1928–29]</ref>

[[Dick Brittenden]] described Worker as "a most brisk and businesslike man in nearly everything he did", and a batsman who made most of his runs on the leg side.<ref>Brittenden, ''Great Days in New Zealand Cricket'', p. 47.</ref>
