Title : Municipal government of King, Ontario
Text : The '''municipal government of [[King, Ontario]]''' consists of the [[mayor]] and six [[councillor]]s who are elected to office during the [[municipal elections in Ontario]] or who are acclaimed to office because their candidacy is unopposed. It also includes civic staff responsible for the operational affairs of the township.

==Wards==
[[File:King, Ontario EN.svg|thumb|right|The six wards of King. The varying shades of each colour represent the polling areas for that ward.]]

A [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]] system was proposed by [[William Hodgson (Canadian politician)|William Hodgson]] during a speech he delivered at the township's electoral nomination meeting on 20 November 1961.{{sfn|Newmarket Era & Express|1961}}

The municipality is subdivided into six geopolitical wards.{{sfn|Township of King: Ward map}} Ward 1 encompasses the region east of [[Keele Street]] and west of [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]], from the township's southern boundary to 19th Sideroad in the north.{{sfn|Township of King: Ward map}} This includes the eastern portion of [[King City, Ontario|King City]], and the communities of Eversley, [[Snowball, Ontario|Snowball]], and [[Temperanceville, Ontario|Temperanceville]]. Ward 2 extends from [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]] in the east to 10th concession in the west, from the township's southern boundary to 15th sideroad in the north.{{sfn|Township of King: Ward map}} It includes the communities of [[King Creek, Ontario|King Creek]], [[Laskay, Ontario|Laskay]], [[Nobleton, Ontario|Nobleton]], and [[Strange, Ontario|Strange]]. Ward 3 covers all the western portion of the township, from its western border to the 10th concession, and also all the area east of Highway 400 that lies north of the 15th Sideroad and south of the 18th Sideroad.{{sfn|Township of King: Ward map}} The communities of [[Hammertown, Ontario|Hammertown]], [[Happy Valley, King, Ontario|Happy Valley]], Holly Park, Linton, and New Scotland are located in ward 3.

Ward 4 consists of the area east of the 10th concession and west of Highway 400, north of the 18th sideroad, and south the northern boundary of the township at its western end and of [[Ontario Highway 9|Highway 9]] at its eastern end.{{sfn|Township of King: Ward map}} It includes the communities of [[Lloydtown, Ontario|Lloydtown]], [[Pottageville, Ontario|Pottageville]], and [[Schomberg, Ontario|Schomberg]]. Ward 5 extends from the township's southern boundary to 19th Sideroad in the north, between Highway 400 in the west and Keele Street in the east.{{sfn|Township of King: Ward map}} The western portion of King City and the communities of [[Kettleby, Ontario|Kettleby]] and [[Kinghorn, Ontario|Kinghorn]] are located in ward 5. The northeastern portion of the township, north of Highway 9 west of Highway 400, and north of the 19th Sideroad east of Highway 400, is in ward 6.{{sfn|Township of King: Ward map}} It includes the communities of [[Ansnorveldt, Ontario|Ansnorveldt]] and [[Glenville, Ontario|Glenville]].

==Council==
The council of the township includes the mayor and six councillors. The mayor is Steve Pelligrini, and the councillors are Jordan Cescolini (ward 1), David Boyd (ward 2), Jakob Schneider (ward 3), Bill Cober (ward 4), Debbie Schaefer (ward 5), and Avia Eek (ward 6).{{sfn|Wang|2018}}

Upon election, the mayor automatically becomes a councillor for [[York Regional Council]], its only representative from King.{{sfn||York Region: Council}} This automatic representation of an elected individual to a second council is known as a [[double direct election]].{{sfn||York Region: Council}}

==Elections==
During municipal elections, electors cast ballots for candidate councillors and school board trustees representing their ward. Each year, the municipal government sets aside approximately $30,000 of revenues to allocate toward the cost of the municipal election.{{sfn|Pavilons|2014b}}

In the 1800s, many elections were resolved by acclamation as candidates often had no opposition; the [[Newmarket Era]] issue of 16 December 1887 stated that "King Township usually elects by acclamation" when discussing the impending election of January 1888{{sfn|Newmarket Era|16 December 1887}} for which the reeve and 3rd deputy reeve were acclaimed.{{sfn|Newmarket Era|30 December 1887}}

In 1873, a third deputy reeve was added to King Council as a result of a population increase, and specifically the number of properties on the tax roll.{{sfn|Newmarket Era|December 1873}} In the December 1962 municipal election, the electorate voted in favour of increasing councillor terms from one year to two years.{{sfn|Newmarket Era & Express|1962}}

The creation of the [[Regional Municipality of York]] and the reorganization of its constituent municipalities in 1971 resulted in the abolition of the positions of reeve and deputy reeve, and created the position of mayor.{{sfn|Lott|1970|p=1}}

In 1910, the township electorate rejected a [[local option]], voting in favour of the measure 741–515 but short of attaining the required 60% overall vote to pass the measure by 13 votes.{{sfn|Newmarket Era|1910}} In 1912, there was a 126–34 vote in favour of a local option.{{sfn|Newmarket Era|1912}}

In the late 1930s, the council passed an election bylaw under which terms councillors elected or acclaimed to office would hold that office for two years.{{sfn|Newmarket Era|November 1940}} It first applied to the December 1940 election, for which no candidate was opposed and all were elected by acclamation.{{sfn|Newmarket Era|November 1940}}

===School board trustees===

Separate public school trustees represent the [[York Catholic District School Board]] (YCDSB) or the French immersion [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]] (CSDCCS).

The elected trustee of the YRDSB represents all wards in King and Aurora.{{sfn|York Region District School Board}} The schools represented in King by this trustee are [[King City Secondary School]], King City Public School, Kettleby Public School, Nobleton Public School, and Schomberg Public School.{{sfn|York Region District School Board}}

==Municipal office==
In 1952, the township's municipal office was located in Nobleton.{{sfn|Newmarket Era & Express|1952}} In 1956, council purchased land west of [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]] on which to construct a municipal office building.{{sfn|Newmarket Era & Express|1956}}

The Township offices were moved to the King City Plaza, a [[strip mall]] purchased by the municipal government in the 1990s which also has several business tenants. In 2013, the township purchased the disused former Holy Name Catholic Elementary School building and adjacent {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land from the [[York Catholic District School Board]] for $2.95 million.{{sfn|Pavilons|2013}} In 2016, township planning staff announced that the {{convert|360|m2|sqft}} school building would be redesigned for use as office space for the township, for community and non-profit groups, and to house a satellite office for the [[York Regional Police]].{{sfn|Pavilons|February 2016}} In May 2016, the Police Services Board of [[York Regional Police]] approved the King City [[Police substation|substation]] and announced that a 20-year lease would be executed for use of about {{convert|280|m2|sqft}} of space in the building.{{sfn|Gismondi|2016}}

The school building was demolished during mid 2016.{{sfn|Pavilons|July 2016}} In June 2016, township staff announced the construction of a {{convert|4050|m2|sqft}} structure on the site at a cost of about $15 million,{{sfn|Pavilons|June 2016}} updated to {{convert|4150|m2|sqft}} and $21.5 million in late 2016.{{sfn|Pavilons|December 2016}} Of that cost, $13.1 million was for construction, and the remainder for associated charges, including moving municipal staff from the previous offices.{{sfn|Wang: October 2018}} It includes a {{convert|6000|sqft|m2}} public-use gymnasium.{{sfn|Wang: October 2018}} The capital project was partially financed by selling the strip mall for $10.75 million, with the remainder obtained from a $4 million [[debenture]], $4.5 million from the infrastructure [[reserve (accounting)|reserve fund]], $1.5 million from development charges, and a $1 million capital contribution from the [[Regional Municipality of York]].{{sfn|Wang: October 2018}}{{sfn|Pavilons|December 2016}} The facility has a [[geothermal heat pump]] system, and [[charging station]]s for [[electric vehicle]]s.{{sfn|Pavilons|July 2016}}

In December 2018, the new municipal building was opened for the inaugural session of a new council following the [[2018 York Region municipal elections|2018 municipal elections]].{{sfn|Pavilons|December 2018}} The preceding council had approved the $40,000 purchase of ''Steel Gorgeous'', an iron horse sculpture created by Kendall McCulloch, for installation at the municipal office.{{sfn|Pavilons|November 2018}} The sculpture had been lent by the artist to [[Caledon Equestrian Park]] in [[Palgrave, Ontario|Palgrave]] for the [[Equestrian at the 2015 Pan American Games|equestrian events]] during the [[2015 Pan American Games]].{{sfn|Pavilons|November 2018}}
