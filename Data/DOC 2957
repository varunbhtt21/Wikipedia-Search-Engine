*'''Keep''' - How is the primary transit system of [[Caen]], including being the operator of the [[Caen Guided Light Transit]], non-notable?  The [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transports_en_commun_de_Caen French Wikipedia article] is much more extensive with government sources dating back to the 1950s because it's the primary transit system in Caen.  The article of the main transit system in an equivalently populated metro area in the US, say [[Des Moines, Iowa]], would never be considered for AfD.  <s>Might this be a case of [[WP:BIAS|systemic bias]]?</s>--[[User:Oakshade|Oakshade]] ([[User talk:Oakshade|talk]]) 22:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - A stub article should not be confused with the importance of the subject matter. This is not a minor bus company it is a public transit operator. [[User:Secondarywaltz|Secondarywaltz]] ([[User talk:Secondarywaltz|talk]]) 04:24, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
