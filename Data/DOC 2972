'''William Greenwood''' (1875 – 19 August 1925) was Conservative MP for [[Stockport (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockport]] from 1920 to 1925. He was first elected in the [[1920 Stockport by-election]], and was re-elected in the General Elections of [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]], [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]] and [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]]. He died in office, causing the [[1925 Stockport by-election]].

In 1920, he made a significant contribution to the purchase price of [[The Towers (Manchester)|"The Towers"]] in [[Didsbury]], [[Manchester]], to be used as the research centre for the British Cotton Industry Research Association, and asked that the building be named after his daughter, so the facility became known as the [[Shirley Institute]].<ref name=unk>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/511/conservation_areas/924/didsbury_st_james_conservation_area/2|title=Didsbury St James Conservation Area|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=2017-09-13}}</ref>
