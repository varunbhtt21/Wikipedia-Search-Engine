The '''Zaza Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Zaza River]] about {{Convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Sancti Spíritus]] in [[Sancti Spíritus Province]], [[Cuba]]. The dam was completed in 1972 with the primary purpose of irrigation but it also supports a small [[hydroelectric]] power station. The dam's reservoir, [[Zaza Reservoir]], has a storage capacity of {{Convert|1020000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}, making it the largest in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/dams/index.stm | title=Aquastat - Dams in Cuba | publisher=UNFAO | accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> Beginning in the 1990s, the Chinese government helped plan and install the hydroelectric power station. It contains two 1.35 MW [[Kaplan turbine]]-generators. The first was commissioned in October 2008, the second in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.industcards.com/hydro-cuba.htm | title=Hydroelectric Plants in Cuba | publisher=IndustCards | accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>
