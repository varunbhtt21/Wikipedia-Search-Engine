''Recognizing'' further that voluntary contributions from Member States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, private foundations and interested individuals, as called for by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1850 (LVI) of 16 May 1974, would help significantly to promote the goals and objectives of the International Women's Year,
