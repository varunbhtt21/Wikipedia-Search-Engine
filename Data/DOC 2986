The '''Sayre City Park''' is a public park located along historic [[U.S. Route 66 in Oklahoma|U.S. Route 66]] on the south end of [[Sayre, Oklahoma|Sayre]], [[Oklahoma]]. The park formally opened in 1940; however, the land had been owned by the city and used informally as a park for several years prior. The [[Works Progress Administration]] built the park's structures according to plans designed by J.N. Willis. The park's bathhouse and swimming pool, the dominant features of the park, have a [[Pueblo Revival architecture|Pueblo Revival]] design with ornamental [[viga (architecture)|viga]]s. Other park features include a [[miniature golf]] course, a [[gazebo]], and [[tennis court]]s. The park attracted both locals and travelers on Route 66, who regularly camped in the park. A local business district also developed around the park, primarily to serve tourists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cassity|first=Michael|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Sayre City Park|url={{NRHP url|id=04000127}} |format= PDF |publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 24, 2014|date=December 9, 2003}} {{NRHP url|id=04000127|title=Accompanied by photos|photos=y}} (PDF).</ref>
