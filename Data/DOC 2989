==History==

In 1879, copper was discovered in the White Knob Mountains near current day [[Mackay, Idaho]]. White Knob began as a mining town in this new Alder Creek Mining District.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mine Hill|url=http://www.mackayidaho.com/mackayminehilltour.asp|publisher=Mackay City Hall|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The [[electric railway of the White Knob Copper Co.]] and subsequently an aerial cable tramway were used to transport the ore from White Knob to the smelter at the railway station in Mackay. The town was home to a school, a general store, and post office. The mine closed in 1928 prompting the decline of the town as more residents were living in Mackay. The school was closed in 1932.

In 1999 the Mackay Historical Preservation Committee was formed and secured a $250,000 award toward preserving the White Knob and Mine Hill site. They have since reinforced the tram towers, restored the Shay Railroad Trestle, restored several buildings, and installed informative signs and markers along an established trail.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dianna|first=Troyer|title=Preservation Pays Off Again|url=http://www.ruralite.org/archive/2006/09/c-30%20pp%204-5%20september_2006.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=Ruralite|date=September 2006}}</ref>
