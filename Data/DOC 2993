== Reception ==
''[[The Indian Express]]'' said, "For a film that is a director's first, ''Aval Mella Sirithaal'' seemed, initially, to be passable. The action was staged with a degree of conviction. But slowly, and alas, surely, the film got mired in its contradictions and rhetoric, and the approach to the climax was nothing if not absurd."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Krishnaswamy |first=N. |date=January 15, 1988 |title=Questions |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=P9oYG7HA76QC&dat=19880115&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |journal=''[[The Indian Express]]'' |pages= 5}}</ref>
