Whilst I believe the creator had all good intentions, this article is fundamentally incorrect, as there has not been serfdom in Norway for nearly 1,000 years. Furthermore, the content is partly inaccurate and partly original research. ('can be a way of defining' etc.) [[User:NaMo18|No More 18]] ([[User talk:NaMo18|talk]]) 01:03, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as [[WP:OR]]. The article admits "they were not actually in serfdom by European standards". [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 03:28, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''<s>Delete</s>''' primarily as fundamentally incorrect information. I happen to possess literature on the topic, I remembered today, and I might write a new article. However, I do not have the sufficient amount of time nowadays. I believe the deletion proposal should be considered independently of this.

*<s>'''Keep''' and rename!  The article itself is not that bad and can be improved.  The title is and always has been cringe-worthy.  Change it to, for example, [[Norwegian lower class (or peasant/s) farmers from c. 1750]] or tenant farmers.</s>  The article [[Norway]] is probably too long to add this content to, and this bit of history is important.  --[[User:Hordaland|Hordaland]] ([[User talk:Hordaland|talk]]) 03:29, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete after merging''' any important bits into [[History of Norway#Denmark–Norway]] (where our non-serfs are called [[Smallholding|smallholders]], but "smallholders" apparently own(ed) their own land!) and/or into [[Tenant farmer#Scandinavia]].  --[[User:Hordaland|Hordaland]] ([[User talk:Hordaland|talk]]) 04:48, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::Deleting after merging is often a bad idea for multi-author articles, because normally, the attribution of text to authors is done via the edit history, which deletion breaks.

*Someone who types "Norwegian serfdom" in the search box may be looking for the material we cover under one of Hordaland's suggested targets, but "serfdom" often relates to the late Dark Ages or early Mediaeval periods, so they're probably looking for material we cover under [[thrall]].  I suspect that the right outcome here is quite complex.  We'd want a [[WP:SMERGE|selective merge]] as Hordaland suggests, but instead of deleting the title, we'd want to replace it with a disambiguation page listing the possible alternatives.  Maintain the history under the disambiguation page to deal with the [[WP:CWW|attribution issues]] that 109.77.169.184 describes.—[[User:S Marshall|<font face="Verdana" color="Maroon">'''S Marshall'''</font>]] <small>[[User talk:S Marshall|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/S Marshall|C]]</small> 10:59, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Dab pages do not exist to present alternatives, only 100% genuine Norwegian serfs. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 03:41, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
:* Yes, thrall. There are two ways of translating the English word 'serfdom' into Norwegian: ''livegenskap'' (compare with German ''Leibeigenschaft'') is used about serfdom in non-Nordic countries, while ''trelldom'' refers to Viking-age and Medieval serfdom/slavery in Nordic countries. Thus, a redirect to [[Thrall]] might not be incorrect. On the other hand, Norway, Sweden etc. had independent jurisdictions etc. regarding thralldom. This demands either separate articles or separate sections of an article. I believe the name of a kept or re-created article should be [[Serfdom in Norway]] (not [[Norwegian serfdom]]), [[Thralls in Norway]] or similar.
