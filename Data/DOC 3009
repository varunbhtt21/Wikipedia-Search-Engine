Title : Weakly holomorphic modular form
Text : {{distinguish|almost holomorphic modular form|nearly holomorphic modular form}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''weakly holomorphic modular form''' is similar to a holomorphic modular form, except that it is allowed to have poles at cusps. Examples include [[modular function]]s and [[modular form]]s.

==Definition==

To simplify notation this section does the level 1 case; the extension to higher levels is straightforward. 

A level 1 weakly holomorphic modular form is a function ''f'' on the upper half plane with the properties:
*''f'' transforms like a modular form: <math>f((a\tau+b)/(c\tau+d)) = (c\tau+d)^kf(\tau)</math> for some integer ''k'' called the '''weight''', for any elements of SL<sub>2</sub>('''Z''').
*As a function of ''q''=e<sup>2π''i''τ</sup>, ''f'' is given by a Laurent series whose radius of convergence is ''1'' (so ''f'' is holomorphic on the upper half plane and meromorphic at the cusps).

==Examples==

The ring of level 1 modular forms is generated by the Eisenstein series ''E''<sub>4</sub> and ''E''<sub>6</sub> (which generate the ring of holomorphic modular forms) together with the inverse 1/Δ of the [[modular discriminant]].

Any weakly holomorphic modular form of any level can be written as a quotient of two holomorphic modular forms. However not every quotient of two holomorphic modular forms is a weakly holomorphic modular form, as it may have poles in the upper half plane.
