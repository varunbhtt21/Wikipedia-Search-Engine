The '''Nelson Schoolhouse''' is a historic school building at 7 Nelson Common Road in [[Nelson, New Hampshire]], United States. It was built in 1838, funded by the citizens of the town's #1 school district in part through district levies and in part through subscriptions. The ground floor was used for classes, and the second floor was a large space usable for public functions. The building is a 2-1/2 story structure, built of red brick laid in [[stretcher bond]]. It has a pair of doorways in the main facade, each topped by a four-light [[transom (architectural)|transom]] window, with a single long granite [[lintel]] stone above both entrances. There are two sash windows on the second level, offset from the doorways toward the sides of the building, and there is a centered pointed-arch window near the point of the gable. The building is topped by a small wooden tower with an open belfry and a shallow-pitch pyramidal roof.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=73000251}}|title=NRHP nomination for Nelson Schoolhouse|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>
