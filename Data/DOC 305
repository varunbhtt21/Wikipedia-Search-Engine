Working hard as he tries to impress, Ramon unknowingly digs the graveyard of three victims of injustice whose [[Ghost|souls]] begin to haunt and possess Ramon's body for vengeance; thus ruining his courtship and eventual relationship with Anna. Meanwhile, to prove the purest of his intentions, Ramon needs to stand up for Anna against her father Don Demetrio ([[Joey Marquez]]) who is a syndicate leader. But because of Ramon's cowardice, this comes as a major challenge, on top of the disturbance brought by the three ghosts headed by Anastacio "Chemerut" Balbitero, Jr. ([[John Lapus]]). As Ramon tries to solve the mystery behind these hauntings, he discovers that ghosts are trying to revenge against Don Demetrio. Ramon, in able to save himself from the possession was compelled to work with the ghosts who are seeking for justice.
