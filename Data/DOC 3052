Wikipedia is not a directory, and it's hard to find references on this because feature names tend to vary. [[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] [[User talk:Jasper Deng|(talk)]] 01:33, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''': This article is not a directory of IRC services, it is a comparison of their history and feature set, much like many other "Comparison of" articles on Wikipedia. Very few feature names actually vary between services, defacto standards have evolved during the past 20 years they have been developed and in use, generic terms/explanations have been used in column headings where a concise name is lacking. The data has been sourced from other similar comparison tables found on the web, the various projects websites, documentation or occasionally source code.

** See [[WP:OSE]]; you can't use the existence of other articles to justify it (arguably [[Comparison of Internet Relay Chat daemons]] can be deleted too but it's slightly better-sourced). Directories are usually comparative in nature. And no sources are cited. Also, there's not enough reliable sources specifically on comparing services daemons (the Anope one comes closest, but it's not enough to meet [[WP:GNG]]).--[[User:Jasper Deng|Jasper Deng]] [[User talk:Jasper Deng|(talk)]] 03:37, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''. Lots of noise, no signal. The comparisons made are primarily technical comparisons (C versus C++) or other trivia such as the date a project started. If it were to be kept, the information should be selected in a way that could assist a nontechnical user in selecting one service over another. -[[User:Sigeng|Sigeng]] ([[User talk:Sigeng|talk]]) 08:22, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per lack of substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. Interesting, but seems like a directory. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 03:25, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' unless trimmed to notable services only. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 02:33, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
