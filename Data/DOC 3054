== Another Heartbleed question ==

From what I understand, the designer(s) wanted a way for servers to check if the other party is alive. The most obvious implementation would be:

Server A - ''Are you alive?''

Server B - ''Yes, I heard you'' 

Yet the conversation seems to be:

Server A - ''Just checking if you didn't die yet. Can you say "Chicken"?''

Server B - ''Chicken''

The [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520 RFC] says that it was designed to overcome the following limitation: "The only mechanism available at the DTLS layer to figure out if a peer is still alive is a costly renegotiation, particularly when the application uses unidirectional traffic.  Furthermore, DTLS needs to perform path MTU (PMTU) discovery but has no specific message type to realize it without affecting the transfer of user messages."

Just "Yes, I'm alive" seems to be enough for this purpose. Why did they decide to ask the other side to echo a string in the first place? Are there other protocols that have implemented a heartbeat message that uses a "challenge-response" method like this, possibly making sure it's not a faulty router replying? Especially when the "challenge" is to reply with the exact same string instead of, for instance, a checksum of that string? [[User:Joepnl|Joepnl]] ([[User talk:Joepnl|talk]]) 00:11, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:DTLS is [[Datagram TLS]], and [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7558227 people have argued] that arbitrary payloads could have uses there (see sagemode's post in that thread especially). It was also added to the far more widely used TLS-without-the-D because, hey, why not. -- [[User:BenRG|BenRG]] ([[User talk:BenRG|talk]]) 01:10, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

== stop-frame animation and morphing ==

My 17-year-old daughter wants to make a video using stop-frame animation of [[Lego]] people. She is wondering if it would be faster to shoot fewer frames and use [[morphing]] software to go from one frame to the next.

Second, I think either approach will be very time-consuming.  How long do you think it would take per second of video produced?  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 03:02, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:Whether morphing is quicker would depend on the speed of the computer versus the speed for each change in position.  If only one figure is moving, that ought to be quick to adjust, versus say, having an entire football field move.  And you can only do so much morphing, perhaps every other frame, or it will start to look bad.  You also have to put some thought into which positions you show when doing morphing.  While walking, for example, you would want to capture the right foot all the way forward, and the left foot all the way forward, because morphing will never move it farther than what you have captured.  If you just capture a figure standing at one position, then standing at another, the morphed version would have him slide from one position to the other, not walk.

:How long it takes will also depend on the frame rate.  At 10 frames per second it would look "jumpy" but might only take 10 minutes to film a second, if she can adjust the scene in a minute. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 03:11, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:: I was telling her that it might take an hour to produce 1 second, all things considered.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 04:08, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

::: I'm not exactly [[Pixar]] here, but I have a quad-core i7 and two quad-core i5s.  I saw morphing done at [[Comdex]] in 1994, when the Pentium was new.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 04:33, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

::::Also, one advantage of morphing is that you don't need to be there while the computer works.  If you can set up a job to morph between all your captured frames overnight, it really doesn't matter if it takes all night.  (If you don't need the computer for other things, you could even run morphing software 24/7.) 

::::Unfortunately, it  may be time consuming to define which point in one frame corresponds to which point in the new frame.  It would be nice if the morphing software itself could figure out that his left elbow in one frame goes with his left elbow in the next frame, but I'm not sure if it can do that yet, reliably (especially if the arm goes straight in one frame and the elbow "disappears").  I would expect that each joint would need to be so defined.  [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 10:40, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

::::: She wants to do a scene from [[Of Mice and Men]] that way for extra credit in literature class (which she doesn't really need).  I told her that could take 100 hours or more.  She doesn't believe me.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 18:51, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::I always estimate ''at least'' one minute of [[video editing]] for each second of final film ''for normal film projects.''  If you include ''shooting'', things start going up from there.  If you add visual effects - even stop-motion - things get ''incredibly'' time-consuming.  You can see why professional stop-motion studios - like [[Wallace_and_Gromit#Stop-motion_technique|Wallace and Gromit]], by [[Aardman Animations]], estimatedly required about 10 to 24 hours ''per each second of stop-motion footage'' - as much as one hour ''per frame.''  Naturally, your project complexity is lower than a major motion-picture, but you should still not under-estimate the effort, the time, and particularly pay attention to the workload that is non-parallelizable.  [[User:Nimur|Nimur]] ([[User talk:Nimur|talk]]) 19:34, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::: For what she wants to do I'm thinking about 1 minute per frame.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 20:13, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::::Might I suggest the final scene, where George tells Lennie to think of rabbits, then shoots him ?  Very little motion takes place, yet it's quite dramatic, so could give you a lot of bang for the buck.  You might need to check if such portrayals of violence are OK with the school, though.  I suggest showing them from behind, so you wouldn't see their mouths moving, to reduce the workload dramatically.  The sounds of barking dogs from the search party would add to the effect.  She could show George slowly raising the gun, and could cut to black, just hearing the sound of the gunshot, at the end. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 04:36, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::::: she has a scene in mind, and it might be that one, since she demonstrated a arm moving down.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 04:39, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

::::::::::OK, but you might want to check with her, as she may have a far more ambitious scene (or treatment of that scene) in mind, and might then get discouraged when she sees all the work that's required in order to do it justice.  She could also have him raise and lower the gun a couple times, as if he can't quite force himself to do it.  This would have the practical benefit of reusing the same frames, so she'd get more motion per frame.  [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 07:29, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:If you are looking for software tools, I suggest "key frame" or "key framing" is a better description that "morphing", e.g. [[Key_frame#As_applied_to_motion]]. As others have discussed above, it's not necessarily clear which way will be faster, there are too many variables and decisions. But, if you use some software to fill in between the key frames, then she'll learn another cool technique at the same time :) [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 16:13, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

== ASCII code of ″ ? ==

For instance, the article [[Eiffel Tower]] gives the tower's coordinates, aka 48°51′29.6″N 2°17′40.2″ or (in the 2nd page, when you've clicked the coordinates) 48° 51′ 29.6″ N, 2° 17′ 40.2″ E . My question is : what is the ASCII code '''and''' the Excel code of this character: ″ = a kind of quotation mark (the one I've got on  my PC is " which is not the same).

In Excel, my problem is: when I use the function =CODE(″) I get 63 as the answer but when I reverse it, =CAR(63) gives ? and not ″ . Thanks in advance. [[Special:Contributions/178.199.181.217|178.199.181.217]] ([[User talk:178.199.181.217|talk]]) 16:07, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:I believe the double quote is as close as you will get in 7-bit ASCII codes.  Some 8-bit ASCII code pages use character 211 as the closing double quote (with a different character for the opening double quote), so that might work.  

:I assume you meant CHAR(63), and I guess the problem is that it's using the returned character as a string terminator, which confuses things.  Are you forming a string like this: 

 PRINT CHAR(63) 

:?  If so, try wrapping single quotes around it, like this: 

 PRINT ' // CHAR(63) // '

:or maybe this: 

 PRINT "'" // CHAR(63) // "'" 

:(Fortran syntax, but hopefully similar to Excel).  To specify a different character, you'd likely need to go to [[Unicode]] instead of ASCII.  Does Excel support Unicode ?  [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 16:20, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

::The characters referenced are the [[prime (symbol)|prime]] (&prime;) and double prime (&Prime;) represented as [[Unicode]] values 2032 and 2033 (hex) or 8242 and 8243 (decimal).  There is no direct equivalents in the 128 character [[ASCII]] character set, so the single and double quotes are commonly used as substitutes.  In Excel 2013, these characters can be inserted in an expression as <code>=UNICHAR(8242)</code> or <code>=UNICHAR(8243)</code>.  The codes themselves can be extracted as <code>=UNICODE("′")</code> or <code>=UNICODE("″")</code>.  (The latter string literal is a double quote, double prime, double quote sequence.)  Earlier versions of Excel do not support the <code>UNICHAR()</code> and <code>UNICODE()</code> functions, but you can still paste unicode characters into a quoted string.  The <code>CHAR()</code> function only supports 8-bit characters. Any other characters are first converted to the [[question mark]], which is why <code>=CODE("″")</code> yields a 63. -- [[User:Tcncv|<font style="color:maroon;">'''''Tom&nbsp;N'''''</font>]]&nbsp;<small>[[User talk:Tcncv|talk]]/[[Special:Contributions/Tcncv|contrib]]</small> 18:12, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

There are Wikipedia articles linked from most printable Unicode punctiation: in this case, the info you want is at [[″]] which redirects to [[prime (symbol)]]. [[Special:Contributions/70.36.142.114|70.36.142.114]] ([[User talk:70.36.142.114|talk]]) 04:50, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:Thanks for all your comments. '''ALT-8243''' in Word writes the searched "double prime" - great ! - but ALT-8243 does '''not''' work here with the Wikipedia editor and that does not work in Excel either. The function UNICAR is not available in my Excel 2007 but seems to come with Excel 2013.

== export list of people categorized by some criteria ==

Hi,
In the previous century Michel Gauquelin created statistics relating people occupation and their zodiac sign.
He did this manually, without a computer and Internet.
Now we have a wiki and all these data are here.
So I'm looking for a way (bot/script) that can export the list of people categorized by their occupation or other criteria + their birth date.
I will import this in excel which will calculate the zodiac sign and will draw a nice graphs.
Any idea will be good for me.
Thanks in advance!

:I can't directly answer your question but, rather than reinvent the wheel, you should know there are lots of astrological databases out there already (for example [http://www.astrotheme.com/astrology_database.php this one], and an astrological forum might be able to recommend one suited to your requirements.--[[User:Shantavira|Shantavira]]|[[User talk:Shantavira|<sup>feed me</sup>]] 08:48, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

: You should also know that a birth date alone gives a less than accurate position of the Sun (for it's the Sun, not the Moon or any of the planets, that people talk about when they say "zodiac sign".  The Sun is indeed important, but it's by no means the only factor).  On a certain day every month, the Sun moves from one sign to the next, and without knowing the precise time and location of a child's birth, it's not generally possible to say which sign the Sun was in at the moment of birth.  People often fudge this by talking about cusps, and say a child born on the changeover day (or even 1 or 2 days either side) has characteristics of both signs.  That's a little like saying the number 1 operates much like the number 2 because they're close together.  Very scientific, not.  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 00:22, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

== How to really remove [[Savings Bull]] ==

A friend of mine got the malware Savings Bull installed on her computer either from installing Skype or visiting a travel website.  I have uninstalled it for her and cleaned it from her browsers and uninstalled every program that shows as installed on her computer this year, but it keeps coming back.  I followed the online instructions that said to use a command prompt to look for associated files, but was not able to identify any.  Does anyone have advice where to look at this point?  I rand these instructions, but found nothing I could figure out should be removed at the regedit step: [http://blog.qisupport.com/remove-savings-bull-filter-remove-pesky-adware/ http://blog.qisupport.com/remove-savings-bull-filter-remove-pesky-adware/] Thanks.

:One thing to watch out for is Chrome auto-syncing settings. My wife accidentally installed something she shouldn't have a few days ago, and cleaned it up right away, but some of the less dangerous bits like the home page and search provider change got synced to her account. After logging back in, the settings came back, including on her android tablet. It was easy enough to clean up, but at first it made it look like the infection had come back on her PC even though it was only the browser settings.

:What OS is she running? If she has Windows 8, then a system reset is simple and will almost certainly clear it up, but she'll have to reinstall her programs. All of her files will be safe.

*It's Windows Vista. She doesn't use anything other than her browser and a printer.  She's an 85 y/o travel agent so her needs are simple.  The problem seems to have happened when her d-in-law installed skype.  She always does the automatic install and imports a load of crap.  Can I do a system reset for her without any risks? [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 17:58, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

::System reset is a Windows 8 feature that makes restoring the OS to its original state without hurting files very simple. Vista doesn't have something like that, but the system probably has a recovery partition that can be used to reinstall the whole system. There is usually some way to tell the system to boot to it at startup, but it varies from system to system. I would just back up any files she needs to a flash drive and try to figure out how to reinstall. The malware can probably be removed some other way, but it probably isn't worth the time to figure it out, especially since it doesn't sound like it will take much to get the fresh system working how she needs it. Just make sure to run Windows Update once you're done.
