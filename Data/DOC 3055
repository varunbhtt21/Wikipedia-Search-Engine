::There's no accounting for the quirks of English. But consider this: The term "arrest" means to stop.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=arrest&searchmode=none] It occurs to me that the term "arrest" in any context usually refers to a sudden or swift action - like it's either beating or it isn't. In the case of the heart, if it stops beating it's pretty obvious just from listening to the chest. The brain doesn't "beat" like the heart does. It requires medical equipment to detect its activity, or lack thereof. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 07:46, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

*"Cardiac arrest" means that the heart suddenly stops pumping blood, but in almost every case the individual muscle fibers continue to contract for a while.  What happens is that they lose their global synchrony, resulting in [[fibrillation]].  The most directly analogous phenomenon in the brain is an [[epileptic seizure]].  Those are rarely fatal, though, because they eventually end and don't cause the heart to stop.  Breathing may stop for a while, but it usually resumes after the seizure ends.

== The end of LADEE ==

From [http://www.ibtimes.com/nasa-ladee-spacecraft-rests-pieces-far-side-moon-following-planned-crash-1573894 IB Times]: "Before LADEE crashed into the lunar surface, the spacecraft reached speeds of 3,600 miles per hour,  and it most likely broke apart before impact."

What could cause [[LADEE]] to break up before impact?  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 05:24, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:I can think of two reasons why a plunging satellite might break up, but neither seems strong enough on the  Moon to have that effect:

:1) Hitting the atmosphere.  The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, so even at 3600 mph, this doesn't seem likely to cause it to break up, to me, even considering that the satellite isn't designed to withstand re-entry.

:2) Tidal effects.  Here the near side of the object is pulled more than the far side.  This caused [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] to break up before it hit Jupiter.  But, the Moon's gravity is far less than Jupiter's, so this seems unlikely. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 07:18, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

::: Yes, but it had been orbiting only about 1 mile above the surface for a while, without breaking up.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 08:20, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:I think it's just an error by the IB Times. The [http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasa-completes-ladee-mission-with-planned-impact-on-moons-surface/ NASA press release] says it broke up "during impact". -- [[User:BenRG|BenRG]] ([[User talk:BenRG|talk]]) 08:05, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:::But what would cause it to rotate so quickly ?  If it hit the Earth's atmosphere, I could see it, but the Moon's atmosphere seems to thin.  Or perhaps if all the remaining fuel was burned in one maneuvering rocket, that might cause this effect, but why would it do this ?   I suppose if the reason it was crashing was that one of the station-keeping rockets had failed, then you might expect something like that (firing the remaining rockets constantly in an attempt to maintain orbit, and spinning rapidly as a result).  However, in this case, I don't think that happened.  [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 17:11, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

== Nodal loads on shear and moment diagrams ==

How do you represent nodal loads on shear and moment diagrams. As far as I know, these diagrams, always start and end at 0. So if for example, a simply supported beam has a uniform load on it but also a nodal load on 1 support. How do you factor this in?  If I simply draw the uniform load on the diagrams and  then put in the nodal load, the diagrams wouldn't end at 0 and hence the beam wouldn't be in equilibrium.

== Do I need to perform a HIV test? ==

For more than a year, I have been having my hair cut at a nearby barber shop (around 10+ times). The barber always cuts my chin when shaving, maybe because my beard is hard. He used his fingers cleaning the blood, and I did not notice it until recently. I have 2 flus, 1 at the time being, and 1 long ago I cannot remember. 3 months ago I had a muscle pain in my left leg which lasted for nearly 2 months. I felt extreme pain when I stretched my leg or performed a high kick. Currently it has not fully gone, but is negligible. I am 25, healthy. I don't care much about the flus, but the leg pain was really unusual.

Although I got cut many times, I know the risk is very small. The number of HIV infected people going to the same barber shop is small, the number of people getting cut is small, the chance between 2 bleeding people is small. But I am still worry about my unusual leg pain. Are there many causes for such pain? I do not really want to take a HIV test because of the discriminations. People here consider only those with social issues (drug, have sex with prostitutes, etc...) are vulnerable to the disease and need such kind of test. -- [[Special:Contributions/222.252.79.24|222.252.79.24]] ([[User talk:222.252.79.24|talk]]) 14:39, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

Other relatives, including my parents, did not give him any concerns. No treatment was given, and he died when he was at my age, 5 years after the infection. Sad story.

== Location of the big bang and size of the universe ==

The observable universe is centred on Earth and it's unknown how big the universe is with some saying that it's infinite. I have a couple of questions, though I imagine you guys will have to correct me on a lot.

I see in the news every so often that new and improved telescopes have revealed how the very early universe took shape after the big bang. Does that mean in the observable universe we can see or almost see the location of the big bang and the very first galaxies?

The universe was only 630 million years old when [[GRB 090423]] exploded and it took 13 billion years for that light to reach us. Similar to the above question, since we know GRB's location and how long is ago it exploded (relevant because everything is moving away from the big bang), doesn't that give us some clue as to the size of the universe and the location of the big bang? And would the location of the big bang be the centre of the universe, roughly, as everything in the universes exploded outwards from that location? Thanks, [[Special:Contributions/92.16.58.122|92.16.58.122]] ([[User talk:92.16.58.122|talk]]) 18:15, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

I know that the universe was just a small ball then it got much larger when the big bang occurred, like a balloon, so my question of location is whether the small ball expanded uniformly and so our knowledge of the early galaxies mean we know where the centre is and the length of time it took for that light to reach us mean we can guess the size of the universe. [[Special:Contributions/92.16.58.122|92.16.58.122]] ([[User talk:92.16.58.122|talk]]) 18:35, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:The usual analogy used for the young is to imagine the universe as the ''surface'' of a balloon. Draw a load of galaxies on a deflated balloon, then inflate it. The galaxies move further apart, but none of them are the centre. There is no location where the big bang started. The galaxies are not expanding away from the centre, they are expanding away from each other. There is no centre. The big bang wasn't an explosion of matter into space: it is the beginning of time and space as we know it, and space expands like the surface of a balloon. 

:This is exactly the right question for you to ask, to find out more about [[the big bang]]. So, well done. [[Special:Contributions/86.146.28.229|86.146.28.229]] ([[User talk:86.146.28.229|talk]]) 19:12, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
::I see, thanks. So does GRB 090423's (former) location give us some clue as to the size of the universe? I imagine at 630 million years, the universe was much closer together/smaller than it is now.

:::Not necessarily. We have some sense for the size of the [[observable universe]], which includes ALL parts of the universe we can get ANY information about. Since the universe is actually larger than what we can observe, and by definition what we cannot observe we have no information about, we can only speculate about the actual size of the entire universe. You may find good reading at [[Universe#Size, age, contents, structure, and laws]] and [[Shape of the universe]].

:The crucial point is that the universe is (or seems to be) [[Cosmological principle|homogeneous]]. This implies that there's no place where the big bang happened, and relics of the big bang (such as the [[CMBR]]) fill the universe uniformly. The matter that emitted the CMBR that we see now is now a certain distance away, and in that sense we're seeing faraway objects when we see the CMBR, but if we were somewhere else in the universe we would see similar CMBR from a different set of objects at the appropriate distance from that location. -- [[User:BenRG|BenRG]] ([[User talk:BenRG|talk]]) 01:08, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:(EC) The closest thing to the [[Big Bang]] that it's possible to see is the [[last scattering surface]], which existed around the time of the [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], about 378,000 years after the [[Big Bang]].  It isn't possible to see anything that existed earlier than that time because before that time, the universe <strike>was so dense that it</strike> was opaque.  The light from that last scattering surface is called the [[cosmic microwave background]], which we can still detect.  But the cosmic microwave background comes to us from all directions equally, instead of coming from one particular direction, due to the [[Hubble expansion|expansion of the universe]] being an [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of space itself]], not an expansion of the universe into previously empty space outside of the universe.  I.e., there is no direction that points toward the Big Bang, except that if you count time as a "direction", then the direction that points toward the Big Bang is "backwards in time".  That perspective of "backwards in time" being very much like a "direction" is a standard perspective in Einstein's [[theory of relativity]].

::"Dense" isn't quite the right word; as per the name "recombination", the universe was ''hot'' enough prior to that time that it was a plasma and thus (more) opaque to radiation.  ([[Pressure ionization]] does occur, but not at densities 10<sup>-20</sup> that of water like at recombination.)  --[[User:Tardis|Tardis]] ([[User talk:Tardis|talk]]) 02:37, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:Yes, any object with a lower average [[density]] than [[seawater]] (about 1.025 [[gram]]s per [[liter|milliliter]]) will float.  The [[volume]] used in determining that "average density" includes any volume of air that's unable to be replaced by water; see [[Archimedes' principle]] and [[buoyancy]].

:::An interesting variation on the OPs question (and possibly what they meant to ask): is there anything that will sink in water but not ultimately come to rest on the seafloor? I.e., something that will stop falling at a certain point and just sort of float about 20,000 feet down (or whatever). The answer to that question is also yes, and buoyancy is again the reason.

::::The density of [[seawater]] is only a few percent more at the floor of the ocean than at the surface, due to the low [[Properties of water#Compressibility|compressibility of water]], so the large majority of objects will either sink to the ocean floor or float.  But yes, there do exist objects that have a density within the necessary range to maintain an intermediate elevation.  For objects in or around that density range, the [[compressibility]] of the object would be an important consideration, too, i.e., the density of the object is going to change some depending on how deep it is, too, due to the pressure of the surrounding water.

:I interpreted this Q differently: "Is there any living sea creature, which, when dead, won't eventually sink to the ocean floor ?".  In this case I'd say that the decomposition process will eventually reduce the organism to microscopic floating particles and a portion which sinks, such as bones.
