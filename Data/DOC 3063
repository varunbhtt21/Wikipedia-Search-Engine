== make the list ==

I have a question concerning the phrase "make the list" in the following sentence: "Jonah Berger monitored the most e-mailed stories produced by the New York Times for six months and found that positive stories were more likely to make the list than negative ones." I wonder what the phrase exactly means. A lot of thanks!  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/1.202.187.153|1.202.187.153]] ([[User talk:1.202.187.153|talk]]) 00:55, 18 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:It means that, on the list of the most emailed stories produced by the New York Times, there are more positive stories than negative ones.  If something ''makes'' the list, it means it is on said list.  If it does not ''make'' the list, it isn't on it.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 00:59, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
::Are you familiar with the idea of "making" in the sense of reaching a goal?  If not, see [[:wikt:make|Wiktionary's entry for "make"]], point 14.  Just as the person saying the quotation "made it" to Cincinnati, Berger's stories "made it" to the list.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 05:25, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I believe sense 19(c) of ''make'' in the Merriam-Webster dictionary online [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/make] is what the OP is looking for. The example with Cincinatti is slightly different and corresponds to sense 19(a), from which the other senses are likely descended. I would probably say that stories made it "onto the list" rather than "to the list" as Nyttend does. 
:::19(a): reach, attain <''made'' port before the storm> —often used with ''it'' <you'll never ''make'' it that far>
:::(b) :  to gain the rank of <''make'' major>
:::(c) :  to gain a place on or in <''make'' the team> <the story ''made'' the papers>

== Triplets of triplets ==

How would one commonly refer to the plural equivalent of "pairs of twins" for triplets (as in humans born in [[multiple birth]]s). Since "triplets" normally could mean sets of three, but in this context actually means the individuals, it probably won't work. Does one have to use something generic like "sets" or "groups", or is there another way of saying it? ---[[User:Sluzzelin|Sluzzelin]] [[User talk:Sluzzelin|<small>talk</small>]] 06:17, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

:"Sets of triplets" is the usual expression. See, for example, [[list of people with the most children]].--[[User:Shantavira|Shantavira]]|[[User talk:Shantavira|<sup>feed me</sup>]] 07:27, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

::Anytime a multiple birth happens, the "group" may be referred to as a "set". Set of twins, set of triplets, etc. There are cases of women giving birth to more than one set of twins at the same time. More than one set of triplets at a time, I haven't heard of, but I guess it's possible. [[User:OttawaAC|OttawaAC]] ([[User talk:OttawaAC|talk]]) 07:34, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

::::I take it you mean more than one set of ''[[identical twins]]'' at the same time, since, if 4 were born at the same time, each pair would be [[fraternal twins]]. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 12:50, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Unless you're asking whether a "trio of triplets" would work? Or a "quartet of quadruplets"? [[User:OttawaAC|OttawaAC]] ([[User talk:OttawaAC|talk]]) 07:38, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

::::Or a "triad of triplets".  "Threefold" might work in some context, too: "She had a threefold set of triplets". [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 12:53, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

:::By "more than one set of twins at the same time" do you mean two identical pairs that are fraternal to each other, or what? —[[User:Tamfang|Tamfang]] ([[User talk:Tamfang|talk]]) 09:12, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

: One could facetiously say ''batches''. —[[User:Tamfang|Tamfang]] ([[User talk:Tamfang|talk]]) 09:11, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

::<small>[[Alfonso Bedoya|I don' have to show you any stinking batches!]] [[User:Deor|Deor]] ([[User talk:Deor|talk]]) 12:23, 18 April 2014 (UTC)</small>

::<small>It's even funnier (for humans) if you call each one a litter: "She had three litters of triplets".  Of course, with other animals, that's not so uncommon. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 12:47, 18 April 2014 (UTC) </small>

:Thank you, all. I was actually thinking of applying it to completely unrelated sets of triplets. Such as counting the groups showing up at a triplet get-together, or comparing how many trios of triplets have been successful through various fields of entertainment. Thank you for the trio and threefold suggestions, which I couldn't come up with, but I guess writing a "tr___ of triplets" or a "thr____ of triplets" is too alliterative/redundant. Thanks for the zoology and farming suggestions too, but I would never use those myself. I have a friend who invariably wraps her curiosity about other women's pregnancy in phrases which might be translated as "When's she finally gonna drop?" (as in meaning #27 of [[:wikt:drop#Verb|"drop" (verb)]]) ("Wänn wirft sie ändlich?"). It's ok for her, but not for me :-) ---[[User:Sluzzelin|Sluzzelin]] [[User talk:Sluzzelin|<small>talk</small>]] 17:11, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::: <small> Oh, indeed.  Where were my manners?  I'm sure your well-received suggestion would exponentially increase my chance of earning brownie points.  Or getting my face slapped.

== Correct word ==

This question is somewhat related to the question immediately above.  Quite coincidentally, I had planned on asking this question even before seeing the above question.  Is there a generic term for a child (or adult) who is a member of a multiple birth (for example, a twin, a triplet, etc.)?  Let's say that Person A is one of a set of twins; Person B is one of a set of triplets; and Person C is one of a set of quadruplets.  Is there a correct word that would fill in this sentence?  ''A, B, and C are __________s.''  I am looking for one word (a noun), as opposed to some variation of a phrase such as "individuals from multiple births".   In other words, if a room were filled with a bunch of twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc., we could say that the room is filled with __________s.  What is that generic word for such a group?  Thanks.   [[User:Joseph A. Spadaro|Joseph A. Spadaro]] ([[User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro|talk]]) 23:05, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

:The lead of our [[Twin]] article says that "the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is ''multiple''" (and cites a Web page that uses the word so), though I can't say I've ever heard that term used in the wild. [[User:Deor|Deor]] ([[User talk:Deor|talk]]) 23:11, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

::I'd add a bit more: "multiple birth siblings", although that sounds like it could include their singleton sibs, too. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 02:14, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:::To me, that would imply that they are related to each other. The question clearly implies that they need not be. In my experience (nothing much) the usual trick if you are writing a long enough article is just to coin a term, when confronted with any quirky situation. Otherwise, like here, you can use the official (but unknown) term. But keep coming up with these interesting questions ;) [[User:It&#39;s Been Emotional|IBE]] ([[User talk:It&#39;s Been Emotional|talk]]) 10:02, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

::::: Thanks.  Yes, my inquisitive nature does lend to some interesting/quirky questions at times.   Thanks.   [[User:Joseph A. Spadaro|Joseph A. Spadaro]] ([[User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro|talk]]) 15:03, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

::::[One of a] litter, or ''litter-mates''.--[[User:Jeffro77|<span style='color:#365F91'>'''Jeffro'''</span><span style='color:#FFC000'>''77''</span>]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 11:35, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

::::: Those also imply that they are siblings.  I was more concerned in my original question about a room full of strangers.  They would be called __________s.  Like, for example, let's say that there was a convention of twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc.  Thanks.   [[User:Joseph A. Spadaro|Joseph A. Spadaro]] ([[User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro|talk]]) 18:19, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks, all!   [[User:Joseph A. Spadaro|Joseph A. Spadaro]] ([[User talk:Joseph A. Spadaro|talk]]) 15:03, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

== "And" at the beginning of a paragraph ==

Sometimes I find the conjunction "and" is put at the beginning of a paragraph. I am not sure about the usage of it. Could anyone explain this point for me? Thank you.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/1.202.187.153|1.202.187.153]] ([[User talk:1.202.187.153|talk]]) 23:46, 18 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:It's not clear what you are asking. Are you looking for somebody to tell you that this is, or isn't "correct"? Or are you having problems understanding what is meant? ---[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 00:01, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

: ''[[And did those feet in ancient time]]'' is a well-known example.  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 00:07, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
::An 'initial conjunction' used to begin a sentence is grammatically fine. A bit of an unusual rhetorical flourish, but there's nothing incorrect about its use. [[User:OttawaAC|OttawaAC]] ([[User talk:OttawaAC|talk]]) 00:30, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Some of my English teachers said there was. Doesn't mean I think the same way. I know I use "And" at the start of sentences. Haven't observed myself using it at the start of paragraphs, but maybe I do. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 00:42, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:The conjunction "and" corresponds to the adverb "also".  The conjunction "or" corresponds to the adverb "alternatively".  The conjunction "but" corresponds to the adverb "however".  The conjunction "so" corresponds to the adverb "consequently".  See [[Wikipedia:Reference desk/Archives/Language/2012 December 31#So]].

:Here's an example of how I might use it:

::"I will show the 5 reasons why..."

::"First..."

::"Then..."

::"Also..."

::"And..."

::"Finally..."

:So, I just might use it as an alternative to "Also", to avoid repetition. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 01:03, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

----
In ancient Hebrew, starting a sentence with ''wə-'' "and/but" is very common.  There are even special verb forms consisting of a coalescence of clause initial "and" + following verb (common since default word order is VSO) which have somewhat different meanings than ordinary verbs...
