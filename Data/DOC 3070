== In the expanded [[Star Wars]] Universe, Did Han ever find out Luke was/is Vader's son in the novels/comics?  ==
When he found Luke's heritage did he stop calling him kid? [[User:Venustar84|Venustar84]] ([[User talk:Venustar84|talk]]) 00:20, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:He finds out in the canonical first trilogy, IIRC, during ''[[The Return of the Jedi]]''.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 01:08, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

::I don't think that's correct is it ? It's been a while since I watched the movies, but didn't it go more like:<br />

::1: Luke tells Leia "I have to go and confront Darth Vader, because he's my father, and there is still good within him."
::2: At the end of the movie, Leia tells Han about Luke: "of course I love him... he's my brother".

::But as far as we know, no-one has actually told Han that Darth Vader was the father ?

::( "Wait a moment, lady... your dad FROZE ME. IN CARBONITE. AND HANDED ME OVER TO JABBA THE HUT." )<br />

::I haven't read any of the Expanded Universe, so can't comment on that... :)

:Not sure about the movies, but I'm pretty sure Everyone has full knowledge in the [[Timothy Zahn]] novels, which were originally intended to be the "offical" episodes 7-9. If you like star wars, I highly recommend them. Way better than a lot of trite fiction that was later licensed.

== "after the button" in poker ==

What does "after the button" mean in [[Texas hold 'em]]?  It is not in [[Poker terms]].  Does it mean after the dealer button has moved?  After it gets to the player?  Something else?  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 02:11, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:The putative dealer in a casino game of hold'em has a button (basically a white, circular disc) with the word "dealer" on it in front of them (the actual cards are dealt by a card dealer at the table who works for the casino, the players don't actually deal the cards themselves.)  The dealer button represents who ''would'' be dealing if the players were actually dealing the cards themselves.  The person who gets dealt to first is (to the button's left) is said to be "after the button".  On the opening bet, this is the "small blind" and on subsequent rounds (assuming no one folds) this would be the person to act first.  Acting first is a disadvantageous position, and the strategies for betting when you are "after the button" are different than they would be once you've seen a few other players act.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 02:54, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
::Jayron's 100% correct. After-the-button is the first small blind, and also the player who has the least knowledge for that hand, and thus, at a statistical disadvantage. [[User:Shadowjams|Shadowjams]] ([[User talk:Shadowjams|talk]]) 03:54, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
::: Thanks both of you.  I think it would be good to add the term to [[poker terms]] and link to it from the Hold 'em article, and others that use it.  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] <sup>[[User talk:Bubba73|You talkin' to me?]]</sup> 04:07, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

== Baseball ==

What's the fewest known times that the losing side's bats touched the ball in a [[perfect game]]? [[User:Sagittarian Milky Way|Sagittarian Milky Way]] ([[User talk:Sagittarian Milky Way|talk]]) 05:35, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:Are you including foul balls, or just batted balls resulting in outs? And be aware that play-by-play detail does not exist for all the perfect games. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 07:45, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
::Including foul balls. [[User:Sagittarian Milky Way|Sagittarian Milky Way]] ([[User talk:Sagittarian Milky Way|talk]]) 08:43, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Well, I've seen a pitch-by-pitch for Larsen's perfect game in 1956, but I can't find it on the internet. Pitch counts exist for most of the perfect games, but that's not sufficient, as you would need to know what happened on every pitch. And it's possible that some of the high-strikeout games (like 20) actually have fewer bat-touches-ball events than a perfect game might. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 10:06, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

== marisa tomei ==

was she born in 1974 or not as noted on your page...was she only 10 years old when she appeared in her first movie in 1984?...will you correct this or not???  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.117.109.184|68.117.109.184]] ([[User talk:68.117.109.184|talk]]) 11:41, 18 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:I've reverted the edit by User:Kevinschaffer that changed the DOB, as there are several references to her life before 1974 in the article.  You could have done that yourself, you know.  [[User:Rojomoke|Rojomoke]] ([[User talk:Rojomoke|talk]]) 11:49, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
