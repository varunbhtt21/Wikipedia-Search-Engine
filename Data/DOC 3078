Searle X Waldron's design proposal was for 2 spaces that are connected by cultural facilities that covers about 30,000sqm.

Their work was exhibited in National Design Centre, [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Anexxe – Art Gallery of Ballarat|date = January 2012|journal = Architecture Australia}}</ref>

=== Art Gallery of Ballarat Annexe ===
Searle X Waldron was commissioned by the City Of [[Ballarat]] and the [[Art Gallery of Ballarat]], the project had completed construction in 2011. The brief for the project was to expand on the existing heritage listed structure of The [[Art Gallery of Ballarat]] and create a suitable space to be used for conduction of Lectures, [[Workshops]], [[Art installation]]s, and Community Functions. Its design also caters for the option to facilitate private functions which operate independently from the other [[Art gallery|gallery]] spaces.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/an-odd-yet-wonderful-space-20121129-2aiid.html|title=An Odd Yet Wonderful Space|last=Clark|first=Justine|date=30 November 2012|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref>

The project combines the attributes of three specific structures – Public hall for Mix programs, [[Verandah]] as a transitional space and a [[Bandstand]] as an Event Space. By incorporating these three ideas in one flexible space Searle X Waldron have designed a building which has multiple uses and has become a focal point for public addresses in the [[City of Ballarat]]. The project was awarded the 2011 Award for Public Architecture and the Colorbond Award for Steel Architecture from the Victorian Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/826651283|title=Inspire : Australian National Architecture Awards 2012|date=2012|publisher=Australian Institute of Architects & Reveal Books|others=Stübe, Katarina., Parken, David., Australian Institute of Architects.|isbn=9780980612363|edition=1st limited|location=Manuka, A.C.T.|oclc=826651283}}</ref>
