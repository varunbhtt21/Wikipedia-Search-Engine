== File I uploaded but cannot find ==

I uploaded a picture and did not use it right away. I had wikipedia open in two separate browsers, one of which had the picture links and the other of which had the articles I was uploading into. 

I closed the picture links browser and later found the article I wanted to upload the picture into but I can no longer find the link. I have previously tried to upload the same picture twice and had it rejected as a duplicate. 

I would like to find the link to the other picture. I have tried looking in my uploads and contributions and it does not appear since I did not actually copy the link into an article. What can be done?  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Feddacheenee|Feddacheenee]] ([[User talk:Feddacheenee|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Feddacheenee|contribs]]) 01:13, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Search within articles belonging to a WikiProject ==

Is there any way to search within articles belonging to a particular WikiProject?  For example, could I find all articles containing the word "stem" whose talk pages belong to [[:Category:WikiProject Fungi articles]]? ([[WP:CATSCAN|CatScan]] doesn't seem to search for text strings, and also handles articles separately to their talk pages.) [[User:Adrian J. Hunter|Adrian&nbsp;'''J.'''&nbsp;Hunter]]<sup>([[User talk:Adrian J. Hunter|talk]]•[[Special:contributions/Adrian J. Hunter|contribs]])</sup> 02:06, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:I could do this for you with [[WP:AWB|AWB]], but I hope someone comes up with a better answer. AWB can create or import a list of the 10K articles in the category; and using the AWB database scanner I could create a list of the 25K articles that mentioned the word "stem", as of April 2nd, the date of my downloaded database dump; and AWB has a tool that can intersect two lists. Messy! -- [[User:John of Reading|John of Reading]] ([[User talk:John of Reading|talk]]) 08:16, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
::The problem here is that the pages you are trying to search are not actually in the Wikiproject category (it is the talk page that is in the category) so no search string is going to work.  You can search based on a category that ''is in'' the article.  The search [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=advanced&search=stem+incategory%3Afungi&fulltext=Search&ns0=1&profile=advanced stem incategory:fungi] seems to work, but it does not include the subcategories so each one would have to be searched separately.

:::Cool, thanks for the replies.  John – no need to go to that much effort, as I've come up with an easy way to generate a list that's close enough to what I was looking for: searching {{xt|stem gills cap}}, "gills" and "cap" being descriptive terms that would usually be present in fungus articles containing the word "stem".

Secondly, Commons has a gadget [[Commons:Help:FastCCI|FastCCI]] which does something similar.  It might be worth asking at [[WP:VPT]] how easy it would be to adapt this for Wikipedia.

== naming convention for new article. ==

I am writing (ok, going to write) and article on the Alexander Brothers, not to be confused with the [[Alexander Brothers]].  My article is about a pop music duo that recorded for [[Mercury Records]] in the early 1950s, and had a charted hit with [[Goodnight Irene]].  What would be the best practice for naming this article?  [[Alexander Brothers (Mercury Records artists)]], [[Alexander Brothers (1950s)]], [[Alexander Brothers (USA)]]?  Thanks!  [[User:78.26|<span style="border:1px solid black;color:red; padding:1px;background:1h5h1h"><font color="008B8B"><b>78.26</b></font></span>]] ([[User talk:78.26|I'm no IP, talk to me!]]) 14:58, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:[[Alexander Brothers]] says they are from Scotland and have been performing since the 1950s, so "1950s" would be a poor disambiguator. Readers are not expected to know the record label but when your subjects are not Scottish, nationality is good. We don't write the name of the country, and if we have to add nationality then the profession is also there. I suggest [[Alexander Brothers (American musicians)]]. The search {{search link|intitle:"American musician"}} finds other examples like that (although only for single musicians).

== Help with getting permission for image through Wiki commons and Wikipedia ==

Hello, 

I am seeking help for obtaining permission to use a photo for a page on wikipedia. I looked at the page to put a image to a wikipedia page and followed all the instructions. I uploaded the image to wiki commons, got permission from the original owner of the photo and also sent a email to the permissions email, I then put a tag on the wikipedia page and then the photo uploaded fine and everything. However, the next day the photo was removed by a admin from wiki commons because he claims that I lack license even though I had sent a email and got confirmation.Of course the image then got deleted from the wikipedia page also.  I do not know what to do next since I followed all the steps. The photo is for the article "T.J. Warren" if anybody could help that would be great. Thank you.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:WhatsDefeat|WhatsDefeat]] ([[User talk:WhatsDefeat|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/WhatsDefeat|contribs]]) 15:51, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:[[:commons:File:Tj warren in the NCAA tournament.jpeg]] was uploaded to Commons as you say. That means it must be dealt with there regardless where the image was used. Wikipedia administrators like me cannot undelete files at Commons, or see which license information was on the deleted file page. You can try asking at [[:commons:Commons:Village pump/Copyright]], or wait to see whether a Commons admin happens to see your post here.

:See [[Commons:OTRS]] which explains how to verify you have permission to use an image.  The OTRS ticket system can be used on Wikipedia also.

:{{ping|Gerhard E. Feurle}}I've fixed it for you.  Your mistakes were that the reference needs to be added at the place you want it to be referred, not in the references section, the numbering is done automatically by the system, not by you, and ref names cannot be a number.  In any case you only need to name them if you want to use them in several places.
:In my opinion the material you have inserted is not written in the style of an encyclopaedia with a general reader in mind.  I am inclined to restore the paragraph you removed in the treatment section which at least has the benefit of being easily readable.  I also note that you seem to be citing your own work and you should consider whether you have a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] here.

== copyright license and evidence of license for a free use photo to be shared on the creative commons ==

This is a question about the copyright of a photo I would like to use in the article   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Canepa
It regards a photographic portrait of a painter which I owned and donated to the collection in his name at the Dominican Studies Institute of the City University of New York.

The photo is not published in any work. I have an email from the archivist at the Dominican Studies Institute Archives telling me that the photo can go up on the Wikipedia Commons, that is, can go into the creative commons but that I should caption it: Portrait of Tito Enrique Cánepa,ca. 1942. The Dominican Studies Institute Archives, The Tito Enrique Cánepa Collection.

It has proven impossible for me to understand what choices to make in the file upload wizard.

I have assumed:

1) This is a free work
2) This file was given to me by its owner

I then fill out the information on the 3) owner/author, date of creation, source and permission. 

Then, under "The copyright owner has chosen the following license", I can choose 4) "Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike   (If I choose "public domain" there is a law that has to be cited. This probably does not apply)

However, it is impossible for me to understand what choice I should make under 5) "Evidence" (choices include "The license statement can be found online at", "The license agreement has been forwarded to Wikimedia's copyright service at ....", "The license hasn't yet been forwarded, but I will do so shortly or ask the owner to send it himself", or "I haven't got the evidence right now, but I will provide some if requested to do so."

None of these "Evidence" choices apply, unless I am to say that I am asking the owner to send the license to "permissions-en AT wikimedia.org" but this seems complicated and may not be applicable.

Can you please advise?  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ercan1|Ercan1]] ([[User talk:Ercan1|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ercan1|contribs]]) 16:29, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:{{ping|Ercan1}} First of all, this is Wikipedia, not Commons, and we have no power over Commons decisions.  You seem to be very unclear over who actually owns the copyright of this work.  The copyright is usually owned by the person who made the work (that is, the photographer in this case).  If that is not you then you do not own the copyright and are not able to grant Wikimedia a licence, even if you are the owner of the actual work.  You must get permission from the person who does have copyright.  Once you have that you should be in a position to follow one of the options at the Commons upload.

== Bobcat Bite, Old Vegas highway ==

This place had to close due to a contract problem with the property owner.

They relocated in the heart of Santa Fe and changed their name to SANTA FE BITE. 

Their menu is the same as it was before. The restaurant shares the property with a Hotel, and serves breakfast only on Sundays but continues with their lunch and dinner menu. Steaks, chops, and burgers, [including their infamous 16oz burger cooked to perfection]. as before.
I might add they are doing more business because the place is larger and hold many more customers.

The Bob Cat was on the page that contained New Mexican Cuisine at the very bottom.

:The article [[New Mexican cuisine]] does indeed mention [[Bobcat Bite]] in the See Also section.  The latter page mentions that the restaurant's website redirects to the Sante Fe Bite Downtown restaurant.

:Googling "religious skeptic" and "religion skeptic" both get hits, but not many of the latter actually contain the noun phrase "religion skeptic" (they mostly have punctuation between the words), and of those that do, most relate to one man, [[Paul Kurtz]]. "Religious skeptic" clearly has some currency, and seems to have wider currency than "religion skeptic". Whether the various people described as "religious skeptic" meet your definition of what the phrase should mean I haven't checked; but it seems clear to me that "religious skeptic" is a much more common phrase than "religion skeptic", and so is the appropriate phrase for a Wikipedia title. In my view your analysis of the phrase is irrelevant: words and phrases mean what they are used  and understood to mean, not what somebody thinks they should mean. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 17:51, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
