==History==
Opened by [[William Bradford (printer, born 1719)|William Bradford]] in 1754, the London Coffee House was built with funds provided by more than 200 Philadelphia merchants, and it soon became their meeting place. Here merchants, ship masters and others talked business and made deals that they often sealed with nothing more than a simple handshake. The [[governor]] and other officials also frequented the coffee house, where they held court in their own private booths.<ref name=EPH />

It was named the London coffee house, the second house in Philadelphia to bear that title. The building had stood since 1702, when Charles Reed, later mayor of the city, put it up on land which he bought from [[Letitia Penn]], daughter of [[William Penn]]. Bradford was the first to use the structure for coffee-house purposes.<ref name=Ukers>{{cite web|last=Ukers|first=William H.|title=The Second London Coffee House|url=http://www.cluesheet.com/All-About-Coffee-XIV.htm|work=All About Coffee|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> 

The London Coffee House was situated at the once busy corner of [[Front Street (Philadelphia)|Front street]] and High Streets<ref name="teogp">{{cite web |title=The London Coffee House |url=https://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/slavery-and-the-slave-trade/slavery_london-coffee-house/ |website=The Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia |accessdate=3 February 2019 |ref=teogp}}</ref> hard on the city's docks.

Shuttered in the aftermath of the [[Philadelphia campaign|British occupation of Philadelphia]] in 1778, the London Coffee House did not re-open until 1783. But the 1780s were a difficult time in which to establish or revive a business in the city. Unable to weather the economic hardship, the London Coffee House was in 1791 converted into a residence and general store.<ref name=EPH />
