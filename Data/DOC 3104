Title : Erasure (novel)
Text : {{italic title}}
'''''Erasure''''' is a [[2001 in literature|2001 novel]] by [[Percival Everett]] and originally published by [[UPNE]]. The novel reacts against the dominant strains of discussion surrounding the publication and criticism of [[African American literature]].

==Plot==

Erasure is about a writer dealing with death, murder, and growing old. The novel's plot revolves around many things, but is essentially about the consequences of turning one's art into a simple commodity; i.e. giving into market forces. The market force within Erasure mirrors the late-90s reality around how the publishing industry pigeon-holed Black writers, and centered or valued certain experiences [those of the urban poor] over others. Themes around race, class, loyalty to family, sex, the theory of language, the life of canonical western artists, abortion, and sexual identity are also explored as the novel unfolds.

The protagonist, Thelonious "Monk" Ellison, a professor of English literature, is in a rut with his own writing. His agent repeatedly explains to him that publishing houses don't believe his writing to be "black enough". To make matters worse, Ellison experiences this angst, as another book called ''We's Lives In Da Ghetto'' by Juanita Mae Jenkins is becoming a national best seller and critical darling. Monk is angered by the success of Jenkins' book, so he composes a satirical response based on [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[Native Son]]'' and [[Sapphire (author)|Sapphire]]'s novel ''[[Push (novel)|Push]]'', which he first entitles ''My Pafology'' before changing it to ''Fuck''.  This novel is published in its entirety within Erasure and creates a meta-narrative that asks the reader about the value and merits of such writing in contrast to the supposedly more erudite text of Erasure.

==Structure==
Like many Everett novels, ''Erasure'' is experimental in structure. Part of the novel's structure involves the multiple embedded narratives, written by the main character Thelonious "Monk" Ellison, including his mock-novel titled  ''My Pafology''.  ''The Guardian'' described as a "skilful, extended parody of ghetto novels such as [[Sapphire (author)|Sapphire]]'s ''[[Push (novel)|Push]]''."<ref name = "Guardian"/> The novel includes other narrative styles within the larger narrative frame, including an [[academic paper]], personal letters, story ideas, imagined dialogue between fictionalized historical characters, and, in the final section, the end of ''Erasure'' as written by Stagg R Leigh, Monk's alter ego.

==Criticism==
The novel was well received. ''The Guardian'' focused on the [[dark comedy]] that it represents,  describing it as moving towards "bleakest comedy" and "sly work."<ref name = "Guardian">{{Cite news
