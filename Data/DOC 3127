==History==
Its purposes were to “establish in [[Philadelphia]], a Hospital for the treatment of diseases of women and children, and for [[obstetrics|obstetrical cases]]; furnishing at the same time facilities for clinical instruction to women engaged in the study of medicine, and for the practical training of nurses; the chief resident physician to be a woman.”<ref>An Act Incorporating the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, p. 6, (Philadelphia, 1861)</ref> Though most medical care in the 19th century occurred at home or in a practitioner’s office, the “teaching hospital” could provide, as clinical material, many patients gathered in one place for some time, who could be examined while the course of their diseases were observed.<ref name=Rutg_p24 />

Woman’s Hospital accepted its first patient, to the Lying In Department (maternity), on December 16, 1861.<ref name=Rutg_p24 /> By April 1862, twelve patients occupied beds.<ref>Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, Minutes of the Board of Managers, 19 December 1861, 3 April 1862.</ref> The Woman’s Hospital grew steadily; by 1875 it housed 37 beds, treated nearly 2,000 patients at their homes (home visits were carried out largely by students), and saw more than 3,000 visitors in its dispensary.<ref>''Fifteenth Annual Report of the Board of Managers of the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia,'' (Philadelphia, 1876; for 1875); Minutes of the Board of Managers of the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, April 1, 1869</ref> Women and children were admitted “without regard to their religious belief, nationality, or color.” They generally did not accept pregnant women who were unwed. At least one woman staff physician pleaded for “sympathizing care,” saying it could do more to change a life than moralistic rejection.<ref>Minutes of the Board of Managers of Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, 1 April 1869</ref>

In 1867, the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania legally changed its name to Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peitzman|first=Steven J.|title=A new and untried course : Woman's Medical College and Medical College of Pennsylvania, 1850 - 1998 |year=2000 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, N.J [u.a.]|isbn=0-8135-2815-1|pages=28}}</ref> In 1874, the College began construction of its own building, thanks to an earlier bequest of Isaac Barton, one of the corporators.<ref name="Peitzman 2000 p. 40">Peitzman (2000), ''A New and Untried Course'', p. 40</ref> The new location was adjacent to the Woman’s Hospital of Pennsylvania on North College Avenue. The architecture contract was given to Addison Hutton.<ref name="Peitzman 2000 p. 40"/>
