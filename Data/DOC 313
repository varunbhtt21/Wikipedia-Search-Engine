This is a self-published book series.  It gets virtually no hits on Google, and there seem to be no professional reviews.  Fails [[WP:BKCRIT]] and [[WP:GNG]].  Page was possibly created by the author of the book series. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 23:33, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. While self-published works can occasionally get coverage enough to merit an article, this is not one of those instances. I wish the author well, but this just doesn't meet notability guidelines at this point in time.

*'''Delete''': A self-published book series with no indication of notability and no forthcoming reliable sources. '''''[[User:Moswento|Moswento]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Moswento|talky]]</sup> 09:30, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
