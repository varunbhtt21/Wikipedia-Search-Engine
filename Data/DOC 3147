The '''Philip H. Sheridan Reserve Center''' is the former Fort Sheridan now in [[Lake Forest, Illinois|Lake Forest]], [[Highwood, Illinois|Highwood]], and [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]]<ref>http://www.fortsheridan.com</ref> in [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].  It was originally established as a [[United States Army]] Post named after [[American Civil War|Civil War]] Cavalry General [[Philip Sheridan]],<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print. Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=129}}</ref> to honor his services to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. When the main fort was officially closed by the Army on May 3, 1993,<ref>[http://www.fortsheridan.com/about/military.asp The Town of Fort Sheridan, IL - About Fort Sheridan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the majority of the property was sold by the Department of Defense to commercial land developers.  Most of the original housing structures were then refurbished and resold as a residential community. Other buildings were given to cultural organizations like [[Midwest Young Artists]], the largest youth music program in the Midwest. Approximately 90 acres of the southern end of the original post were retained by the Army; there the Army now operates the Sheridan Reserve Center complex.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Fort Sheridan was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldinger|first=Mike|title=The proud history of architecture in Illinois|url=https://springfieldbusinessjournal.com/2018/01/the-proud-history-of-architecture-in-illinois/|accessdate=30 January 2018|newspaper=Springfield Business Journal|date=January 30, 2018}}</ref> by the [[American Institute of Architects]] Illinois component (AIA Illinois).

==History==
[[File:Fort Sheridan From Above.jpg|left|thumb|Looking north on Fort Sheridan in the 1970s.]]
The Commercial Club of Chicago, concerned since 1877 with the need for a [[Garrison|military garrison]], was motivated by the [[Haymarket Riot]] in 1886 to arrange for the donation of 632 acres (2.6&nbsp;km²) of land to the [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal Government]] for this purpose. [[Troop]]s arrived in November 1887 to what was initially called Camp Highwood. A year later, Camp Highwood was renamed Fort Sheridan. Troops stationed at Fort Sheridan were used in 1894 to quell labor unrest during the [[Pullman Strike]].

Fort Sheridan became a mobilization and training center beginning with the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898. Following [[World War I]], Fort Sheridan processed nearly 20,000 returning wounded soldiers and helped them return to civilian life through physical and occupational training reenter the workforce.<ref>[http://www.filmpreservation.org/preserved-films/screening-room/the-reawakening-1919 "The Reawakening", 1919]</ref> During [[World War II]], over 500,000 men and women were processed through military service. Many army officers who later became famous lived there, including [[George Patton]] and [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan Wainwright]]. The 174th Military Police Battalion of the [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] National Guard was stationed there in 1950. Fort Sheridan served as the base for supplying and servicing [[Project Nike|Nike antimissile systems]] in the upper Midwest from 1953 to 1973, at which point it returned to providing administrative and logistical support services.

The 94 buildings in the Historic District, built between 1889 and 1910, include 64 structures that were the first major works of the [[architect|architectural firm]] [[Holabird & Roche]] of Chicago. These earliest buildings are made of bricks molded and fired on site, using clay mined from lakefront bluffs. The [[Fort Sheridan Water Tower|water tower]], originally the tallest structure in the Chicago area, was altered and shortened by 60 feet (18 m) in 1940. The row of buildings flanking the tower were troop barracks.  The 110 acre (450,000&nbsp;m²) Historic District, placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1984. In 1979, the site was documented by the [[Library of Congress]] [[Historic American Buildings Survey]].

In 1979, director [[Robert Redford]] used a warehouse on the base to build interior sets for his Oscar-winning film [[Ordinary People]].

Fort Sheridan closed in 1993. The decision to close Fort Sheridan came in the 1989 first round of base closings under the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Act (BRAC).

An Army Reserve base continues to use about {{convert|90|acre|m2}} of the original Post. The remaining property is divided between the [[Lake County Forest Preserves]], a residential development, a Navy family housing development for personnel of nearby [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] and a variety of ongoing commercial developments.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/478.html Fort Sheridan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Environmental concerns==
The geological setting of Fort Sheridan is tableland above a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} high bluff<ref name="IDOT">Illinois Department of Transportation; Division of Water Resources. Harmony with the Lake: Guide to Bluff Stabilization, Lake Michigan, IL. The Illinois Coastal Zone Management Program.</ref> in an area cut by seven deep ravines.  The bluff overlooks Lake Michigan and the ravines create an open face in the bluff at the beach's edge.  Over the years, the Army filled in the ravines with waste generated by military operations.  The most toxic waste was placed in the Wells Ravine, also known as Landfill 7.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency considers Landfill 7 to be a [[Superfund]] National Priorities List (NPL) location.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/region5superfund/fed_fac/brac_sites/ff_brac_sheridan.htm US EPA Region 5 Superfund Division, Fort Sheridan].</ref>  The landfills were not operated in an environmentally sound manner.<ref>[[Argonne National Laboratory]]. Enhanced Preliminary Assessment Report: Fort Sheridan 1989 pg. 24.</ref>  An [[Illinois Environmental Protection Agency|IEPA]] permit was not issued while the landfill was operating, and a high-density plastic containment liner was not used between the ravine and the waste.  Regulatory oversight did not begin until 1979 when the State of Illinois commenced litigation.  An operating permit was issued two months after the landfill ceased operations.<ref>Id at 13, 24.</ref>  The Army then applied for a closure permit, installed a leachate collection system, and placed a clay cap over Landfill 7.  By 1982, the cap had failed due to ponding of water and the failure of the leachate collection system to collect [[leachate]]. The Army stated that the cap failure was caused by failure to maintain the cap.

By 1989, Fort Sheridan was facing potential closure by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] commission.  The Army began evaluating the permanent closure of Landfill 7 and the inherent problems with its maintenance.  Because Landfill 7 had been dispensing 14,000 gallons of leachate per day into Lake Michigan, and the leachate was above state environmental effluent standards, CERCLA allowed the Army to implement an interim remedy prior to deciding on a permanent remedy. The Army chose to construct a $16 million cap.<ref>Walsh, Don and Liberman, Polina, Fort Sheridan Landfills 6 & 7 Closure. Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Northwestern University on behalf of Chicago Environmental Law Clinic August 2003 pg 26.  Northwestern University study.</ref> Public comments for this interim action opposed the cap,<ref>Responsiveness Summary. Mayor Geraci of Highland Park, Mayor Sirotti of Highwood, the League of Women Voters of Lake Forest/Lake Bluff/Highland Park, the Lake Michigan Federation, and the Sierra Club all opposed the interim capping action.</ref> focusing on the Army's characterization of the type of waste in the landfill, the geologic instability of the ravine and bluff environment, and the proximity to Lake Michigan from which local drinking water is drawn.  The Army responded that the cap was an interim solution that was thought to be effective for temporary containment of the waste.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

After the interim containment remedy was selected on April 22, 1997,<ref>USACE, Decision Document (DD) for Interim Source Control Action for Landfills 6 and 7 at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. April 22, 1997.</ref> the Army brought in Dr. Shabica  to evaluate the shore protections as part of the design phase.  On December 2, 1997, he informed the Army that the cap, as designed, would fail due to erosion. The Army responded by purchasing a new system designed by Dr. Shabica's company.<ref>Shabica, Charles W. and Charles Shabica & Associates. Review of Erosion Control Features for Interim Remedial Action Landfills 6 & 7, Fort Sheridan, Illinois, November 25, 1997.</ref>  The interim cap was completed in June 2004, and the Army may propose making capping the final remedy based on the same analysis that supported the interim action.<ref>[http://www.kemron.com/fortsheridan/documents/Proposed_Plan_Landfills_6_%26_7_Final_Remedy_Final.pdf Microsoft Word - Proposed Plan Landfills 6 & 7 Final Remedy Final.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The decision to cap Landfill 7 as the final remedy conflicts with some of the recommendations of the geological community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The Army is the lead agency in determining cleanup alternatives. Opponents claim the [[Analysis of Alternatives]] found in the remedial investigation, remedial action, and feasibility study was skewed in favor of the Army's preferred remedy which was less expensive.<ref>Walsh, Don and Liberman, Polina, Fort Sheridan Landfills 6 & 7 Closure. Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, Northwestern University on behalf of Chicago Environmental Law Clinic August 2003 pg 26.</ref>  According to the FY2006 Defense Environmental Restoration Program Annual Report To Congress, [[USD|$]]58.7 million in cleanup funding had been appropriated for Fort Sheridan. Estimated cost to completion was [[USD|$]]22.2 million estimated for FY2003.<ref>[https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/Public/News/OSD/DEP2006/App_M_Installation_Narrative_Summaries_osd-draft.pdf Defense Environmental Restoration Program Annual Report To Congress FY2006], page 84.</ref>
