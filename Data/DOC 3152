Fails under [[WP:NJOURNALS]] , no reliable sources to be influential in its subject area, not cited by enough reliable sources, no Journal's citation report, no impact factor, no science citation index.

*'''Delete''' This article has no information of use about the journal nor does it meet any discernible standards in [[WP:NJOURNALS]]. [[User:Szsmr|Szsmr]] ([[User talk:Szsmr|talk]]) 04:10, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Many notable social science journals don't have an impact factor. None of them are in the Science Citation Index, because there's a separate index, the Social Sciences Citation Index. However, even the latter does not have many notable social science journals. ''The Councillor'' has been around for 75 years, so I'd not be surprised if some sources are around somewhere. I have no time right now, but will look later today to see what I can find in other databases. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 06:44, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' A journal for an organisation restricted to one US state, no evidence at all that it's of encyclopaedic significance. I've been around nearly as long, longevity doesn't make me significant <font face="chiller"><font color="red"><b>[[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]] - </b></font></font><font face="arial"><font color="green">[[User talk:Jimfbleak| talk to me?]]</font></font> 16:56, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Unfortunately, I cannot find any good sources and it doesn't appear to be indexed in any major database. Our specialist in this kind of journals, {{u|DGG}}, could not find any either. Does not meet [[WP:NJournals]]. --[[User:Randykitty|Randykitty]] ([[User talk:Randykitty|talk]]) 20:52, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' The only positive thing I can find to say is that the contributors are primarily not local, but from various academic institutions in the US. Thus it is potentially more important than a journal merely publishing the work of its own school. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 00:55, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
