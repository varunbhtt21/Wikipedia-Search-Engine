Russack was a jeweller who had served his apprenticeship with [[J. M. Wendt]], and Keith trained as a watchmaker and was employed at his father's business in Kadina.<ref name=jeweller/> He enlisted with the [[2nd AIF]] early in 1940 and saw action in South-east Asia. He maintained his involvement with the military, and in 1952 was Captain of C Company [[27th Battalion (Australia)|27th Infantry Battalion]] (South  Australian Scottish Regiment).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47389792 |title="Marching In" Parade For N.S.

He was in September 1970 elected as a [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|Liberal]] candidate for a Midland district seat in the [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] made vacant by the death of [[Colin Rowe]].
