Found this topic at FAC at the French Wikipedia. I believe even the most ghastly subjects deserve decent articles so I started a translation since we only had a bare stub. I didn't know the psychic toll it would take to {{tooltip|[http://ibc.lynxeds.com/photo/przewalski039s-nuthatch-sitta-przewalskii/adult-female stare into the face of horror]|gorgeous aint she?}} day after day but I emerged from the other side and believe this is now ready for review against the criteria. There are unfortunately no usable photographs at this point, though the author of the French article, [[User:Totodu74]] (whose contributions made mine possible), is attempting to contact the photographer who snapped the second image listed in external links, to ask for a CC release. You might notice that the article is a bit short on certain areas that often get treatment. This is the result of there simply being no information out there, on, for example, feeding, nesting, breeding, moulting and so on. I learned a ton translating and expanding this, as only such a research and writing process in a topic area you've never focused can impart. Hope you find it interesting (and not too horrifying).--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 03:08, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
====Support <s>Comments</s> from Jim====
I reviewed this before it came here, so not much to add now. A few nitpicks before I support
*''nominate species'' &mdash;I'm not sure there is such a thing, and the link goes to "nominate subspecies". ''former nominate subspecies'' perhaps? or rephrase
*''One recognizable feature of Przevalski's Nuthatch is that they lack the eyestripe common to most nuthatch species''.&mdash;"it lacks", or pluralise Nuthatch
*''The specimen was captured on the outskirts of a forest, on a ridge between two valleys, where he stood on a dead branch from which he launched in pursuit of insects in flight'' &mdash;"it" not "he". There is no indication that the nuthatch was a s male, and "he" conjures up an image of Ludlow leaping off the branch to catch flies
*Your capitalisation of journal titles is inconsistent. Even if you have followed the original, they should all be sentence-case here

::<small><small><small>@[[:User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]]:</small></small></small> Thanks for looking again, and the help. I've addressed all of the issues above. "Nominate species", by the way, is used, à la a few thousand Google book hits, but certainly not as commonly as "nominate subspecies". I have modified in all places.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 14:01, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::'' <s>(One recognizable feature of Przevalski's Nuthatch is that it lacks the eyestripe common to most nuthatch species.)'' - why is this in parentheses? I think we can lose them....</s> ok.
:::Hey Cas, thanks for taking a look. It wouldn't do terrible violence to remove them but I really do think it's properly a parenthetical. The rest of the paragraph is a general description of nuthatches – an overview of traits shared between species of the genus. The line about ''this'' nuthatch is a qualifying, explanatory remark breaking away from the general to comment on the specific.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 02:28, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Support'''. <s>'''Comments'''.</s> A very good article. <s>Just a couple of minor quibbles.</s>
*"turning to a rich cinnamon on the underparts that intensifies on the sides of the breast." I had to read this twice as "that" appears to refer to underparts. I would suggest "turning on the underparts to a rich cinnamon that intensifies on the sides of the breast."
:*Hey Dudley, thanks very much for coming by. I've changed it to "that intensifies ''in color''..." I think that that addition provides the context so that what "that" refers to is clear. Do you think that that's so? I fiddled with rearranging it to some form of "turning on the underparts..." but the more I read it, the more it sounded strange to me (though it could be something like that effect you get when you say a word over and over and you reach a point of dissonance where it loses it meaning?) Anyway it feels like we're implying with that phrase that the underparts are a lamp were switching on, we're doing something perverse to the bird, or [[Turn on, tune in, drop out|Timothy Leary is stopping by]].--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 01:35, 13 May 2014 (UTC)
*"The bird is endemic to areas in southeastern Tibet and west central China, where it is found in eastern Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan among other areas". Wordy and repeats "areas". Perhaps "China, including eastern Qinghai..."

:*<small><small><small>@[[:User:Dudley Miles|Dudley Miles]]:</small></small></small> Yes, that reads better, done.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 01:35, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''—I stumbled here from [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/U.S. Route 31 in Michigan/archive1|my nomination]], and I'm curious what the status is of updating this article to comply with the updated MOS guidance on capitalization of bird names at [[MOS:CAPS#Animals, plants, and other organisms]]? For technical reasons to do with the open FAC nomination, I can foresee that the article can't/shouldn't be moved, but the text within the article can and should be updated at the present. <span style="background:#006B54; padding:2px;">'''[[User:Imzadi1979|<font color="white">Imzadi&nbsp;1979</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Imzadi1979|<font color="white"><big>→</big></font>]]'''</span>  02:53, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
:*Yes, I've been thinking about that, having learned about that discussion just a few days ago. I suppose I've been wondering if there's going to be a push back once large scale moves and article reformation begins but the edits are not difficult, and easily reversible.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 03:24, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
::*<small><small><small>@[[:User:Imzadi1979|Imzadi1979]]:</small></small></small> Done. I moved all the articles on other birds that are mentioned in this article as well, so the changes would produce no redlinks or need piping to articles that should be moved anyway. I am only not performing the move of this now because I'm not sure if that would play well with this open FAC (or cause a problem with the bot), but the closer can move it, or I'll move it immediately after a close, regardless of result.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 12:21, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
