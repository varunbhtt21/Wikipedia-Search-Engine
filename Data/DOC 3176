'''Worden Field''' is a large grass field located on the campus of the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. First mentioned in [[1890 Navy Midshipmen football team|1890]], the field served as the home stadium for the academy's [[Navy Midshipmen football|Midshipmen football team]] from that year through [[1923 Navy Midshipmen football team|1923]], replaced by [[Thompson Stadium]] in [[1924 Navy Midshipmen football team|1924]]. Since the early 1900s, the field has hosted all of the academy's various yearly parades and many of its drills. It has progressively grown smaller, due to the addition of buildings and roads within the academy.

The field is bordered on all four sides by small academy roads. On two of its sides, it is surrounded by officers' quarters and is bounded by a parking lot and the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] on its other two borders. It has rows of bleachers located along its south side and has long contained a small [[gazebo]] on its east side. A small historical marker is located on the southwest corner; it is used regularly for drills and important parades.

===Name===
The field is named for Admiral [[John Lorimer Worden]], who joined the navy in 1834. He was captured by the [[Confederate States of America|South]] at the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but was freed in 1862. He became captain of the [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and received considerable fame after its battle with the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]]. Worden suffered eye injuries in the battle and gave up his command; he supervised ship construction for the rest of the war. He was the [[List of Superintendents of the United States Naval Academy|superintendent]] of the academy for five years (1869–1874), and died in 1897, a few years after the field was named after him.<ref name="Faces Bases">[[#Royston|Royston (2009)]], p.&nbsp;215</ref><ref name="Great Graves">[[#D'Impiero|D'Impiero (2007)]], p.&nbsp;160</ref>
