Not a notable topic.  The references do not establish notability.

Side notes: the article is promotional in tone. <span style="border:2px solid #0918E8;background:#067D06;">[[User:TheCascadian|<font color="white">'''The'''</font>]]'''[[User talk:TheCascadian|<font color="white">Cascadian</font>]]'''</span> 03:12, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' This article reads more like an advertisement found in a magazine than an article containing useful information about a book. [[User:Szsmr|Szsmr]] ([[User talk:Szsmr|talk]]) 04:07, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' It's very adverty and lacks reliable third-party sources. Even if it is notable (and that's doubtful) it needs a complete rewrite so best to delete.

*'''Comment''': I'm in the process of trying to clean this, but so far it's not very promising. Part of the issue is that from my experience, Foreword isn't really usable as a RS because people pay to get them written. Per [https://www.forewordreviews.com/services/book-reviews/ their website], you can pay $500 to get a Clarion review through them. Even the non-paid reviews are sort of suspect because of this (as I seem to remember that the site still tends to ask for money through various other means), but since this wasn't a non-paid review it's sort of a moot point to discuss it. I've removed it from the article because of this.

*'''Delete, maybe salt'''. After searching a little more, I was unable to find anything other than the one newspaper source that's on the article. This just isn't a notable enough book to merit inclusion. Since this is the third incarnation of the page, there's a chance that this might be re-created, although I note that the previous versions were made back in 2010.
