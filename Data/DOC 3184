==Plot==
In 1995,<ref>{{cite web | title = Flashback to the fashion faux pas '90s with Dum Laga Ke Haisha | url = http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/flashback-fashion-faux-pas-90s-dum-laga-ke-haisha-2143663.html|work=First Post|date=9 March 2015 | accessdate = 16 March 2015}}</ref> Prem Prakash Tiwari ([[Ayushmann Khurrana]]) owns a video cassette shop in the local market of [[Haridwar]], who subscribes to nationalist organisation (RSS). He daily visits it's Shakha (branch) for their early morning ritual of recitation of the national anthem, pledge to the nation & exercise. One of the key value of the organisation is abstinence, although senior members are married & no restriction on the marriage of juniors members. However, it is expected that their members should not indulge in their married life at the expense of service to the nation. His father is keen on getting him married to an educated overweight girl Sandhya ([[Bhumi Pednekar]]). In spite of not liking her, the school drop out Prem agrees to marry her as he cannot win over a girl with '[[Juhi Chawla]]-level-of-looks.' In addition, as Sandhya is trying to be a school teacher, his family asks him to think of this alliance to a financial help too. Eventually, in an elaborate community-wedding ceremony, Prem and Sandhya get married.

Prem visibly shows his disinterest in the marriage and does not [[Consummation|consummate]] the marriage on the wedding night. While his sister, aunt and mother argue about his non-existent life, Prem leaves for Agra.  At home, Sandhya tries to get Prem attracted to her. But he is too embarrassed to even walk with her on the street. Prem and Sandhya's relationship remains strained although they share a kiss and have sex on their second night together. Shakha Babu (branch in charge), advises him that since he could not uphold his vow of abstinence he should better focus his married life. Over time, Sandhya's frustration shows; when Prem's aunt brings up a petty topic, the two have a heated exchange of words and she tells them how he does not treat her well.

Amidst all this a close friend of Prem, Nirmal gets married. Prem and Sandhya go for the ceremony where due to his excessive drinking and jealousy over his Nirmal's pretty wife, he tells everyone that sleeping with Sandhya feels like hell. Sandhya hears this and slaps him in front of his friends and he slaps her back. The following morning, Sandhya reflects on what she's been through, feels she has had enough and decides to leave Prem. She blames her father-in-law for his lack of respect towards women and not giving his son a proper education. Sandhya's mother tries to pacify her, saying she must return to her husband. But she decides that she can live by herself. Meanwhile, Prem decides to channel his energy into studying and to take his English paper again; he enrols for the examination. His friends give up on him; after a verbal squabble, they throw him out of the group. He studies sincerely for the exam, but at the time of his exam, he is overwhelmed by the emotional turmoil & not able to write a word. Ultimately he plainly writes an emotional message to the person checking his paper that if at all he feels any pity for his state he should not award him with a zero or else his family would be reduced to zero ( indicating his attempt to suicide.)

Subsequently, a friend's father opens a shop selling music CDs in the same market, clearly affecting their business. Prem's family talks to the shop owner's family and the discussion end with Prem's friend challenging him to participate and win the "Dum Lagao" contest. (The contest entails him carrying his wife on his shoulders and running an obstacle course). Meanwhile, Sandhya and Prem reach the court to file divorce. There Sandhya reveals in front of the judge that she married him because she thought he would care for her. On the other hand, Prem bluntly reverts that he married her because he was under family pressure. Prem's father pleas to the judge that divorce should not happen on petty issues & his family is more than happy to take her home, Sandhya's parents on the same page & support him. The court decides that the two must spend six months with each other and try to salvage their marriage. Both decide to live together just as a formality but the two begin to get on, as they both start understanding each other. Meanwhile, Sandhya is coerced into the contest. Sandhya also feels that Prem should take her to the contest, but it seems that Prem is too volatile to think straight. They start coming close each passing day, but in Prem's own words they lack co-ordination & are a total mismatch. One fine day as Prem returns home, he is disgusted to see that his family members are pretending to love culinary skills of Sandhya, which is basically boiled food devoid of spices. He finally snaps and expresses his anguish of this pretence everywhere & attempts to suicide. At that same time, a police constable arrives at his home, owing to the complaint regarding his emotional letter (attempt to suicide) he had earlier written in his English exam. At this point Sandhya is moved & feels the pain of Prem, they have an open-hearted conversation & both realise that they might not be the perfect spouse for one another but care for each other deeply.
Sandhya gets accepted for a teaching job in [[Meerut]], which she gladly accepts since she feels that there is no one who cares about her anymore. When she tells Prem about it, he cannot come to terms with losing her & realises that he is in love with her.  

On the day of competition, Prem's aunt successfully convinces him to participate in the competition and the couple takes a last chance to save their marriage. Surprisingly, Prem shoulders the weight of his wife and surges past all other contestants. In the last lap, Sandhya confesses to Prem that she does not want to go to Meerut and wants Prem to let her stay. Prem knows winning this competition is the only way to do this and pushes himself further to eventually win the race.

Prem does not let Sandhya get off his back even after the race is over. He takes her back all the way to his house where they seal their love with a kiss.
