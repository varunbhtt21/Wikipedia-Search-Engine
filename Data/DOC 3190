Title : Bigolona
Text : '''Bigolona''' is a white [[Italian wine]] [[grape variety]] from the [[Valpolicella]] region of northeast Italy where it has been growing since at least the early 19th century. The wine has traditionally been used in the production of [[late harvest (wine)|late harvest]] and [[botrytized]] [[dessert wine]]s with the grape's synonym ''Smarzirola'' being derived from the [[Italian (language)|Italian]] ''marcire'' meaning "to rot".<ref name="Wine Grapes">J.

==History==
[[File:MappaValpolicella.jpg|left|thumb|Bigolona has a long history of being grown in the Valpolicella region ''(highlighted)'' in the province of Verona, located east of Lake Garda.]]
Bigolona was first documented growing in the Valpolicella region in the early 19th century. By the 1970s, the grape was on the verge of extinction until viticulturalists at the [[Istituto Sperimentale per la Viticoltura]] in [[Conegliano]] and [[Verona]] began [[propagating cuttings]] to preserve the endangered vine. While the grape was not yet listed on the official register of [[Italian grape varieties]] in time for the 2000 census, producers within the [[Veneto (wine)|Veneto]] ''[[Indicazione geografica tipica]]'' (IGT) zone have begun making wine from these revived plantings.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Viticulture==
Bigolona is a [[ripe (wine)|mid-ripening]] grape variety that lends itself well to the production of late-harvest and botrytized wines. The synonym ''Smarzirola'' is derived from the Italian word ''marcire'', which means "to rot", and highlights the grape's affinity for being infected by ''Botrytis cinerea''. Among the [[viticultural hazards]] that wine growers of Bigolona have to be mindful is the vigorous nature of the vine and the tendency to produce large, leafy [[canopy (wine)|canopy]] as well as high [[yields (wine)|yields]] if not kept in check by [[pruning]] or [[green harvest]]ing.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Wine regions==
[[File:Barrel designated for vin santo.jpg|right|thumb|Bigolona is sometimes used in the production of vin santo wine, which spends a long time aging in barrels that are often specifically marked.]]
Today Bigolona is cultivated almost exclusively in the Valpolicella region and around the commune of [[Illasi]] in the [[province of Verona]]. There the grape is often used in the production of late-harvest dessert wines, including [[vin santo]] and ''[[passito]]'' style wines. While the grape can be made as a [[varietal]] under the Veneto IGT designation, it is most often blended with other local white grape varieties such as [[Garganega]].<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Synonyms==
Over the years,  Bigolona has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Bigolara, Bigolona bianca, Bigolona Veronese, Sampagna and Smarzirola.<ref name="VIVC">[[Vitis International Variety Catalogue]] (VIVC) ''[http://www.vivc.de/datasheet/dataResult.php?data=40456 Bigolona] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215018/http://www.vivc.de/datasheet/dataResult.php?data=40456 |date=2014-04-26 }}'' Accessed: April 24th, 2014</ref>
