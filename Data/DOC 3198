'''Mary Jo Ondrechen''' (born 1953) is a chemist, educator, researcher, community leader and activist. She serves as Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Principal Investigator<ref name="one">[http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/faculty/mary-jo-ondrechen/ Northeastern University College of Science Faculty - Chemistry and Chemical Biology]. (2014).</ref> of the Computational Biology Research Group at [[Northeastern University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

== Education ==

Mary Jo Ondrechen received an [[American Chemical Society]] certified bachelor's degree in Chemistry from [[Reed College]], [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1974. She pursued doctoral studies in Chemistry and Chemical Physics at [[Northwestern University]], [[Evanston, Illinois]] and earned the Ph.D. degree in 1978, under the direction of [[Mark A. Ratner]].<ref name="two">{{cite web|url=http://chemgroups.northwestern.edu/ratner/|title=Ratner Group – Home of the Ratner Research Group|website=chemgroups.northwestern.edu}}</ref> After postdoctoral research appointments at the [[University of Chicago]] and at [[Tel-Aviv University]] in [[Israel]], the latter as a [[NATO]] Postdoctoral Fellow, she joined the faculty at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts in 1980.<ref name="three">Pollastri, M.P. [http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/chemistry/faculty-4/] (2017)</ref>

== Research and discoveries ==

Her earlier research achievements include the design of [[molecules]] and materials with desirable spectroscopic and conductive properties, prediction of electric field effects in molecules and [[proteins]], the optimization of energy conversion devices, and the design and characterization of ionic conductor materials for rechargeable [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]]. Her current research activities include modeling of biological [[macromolecules]]<ref name="four">Finley, A., [http://www.sdsc.edu/pub/envision/v15.4/ondrechen.html Investigating Enzyme-Substrate Interactions with Vitamin B6]. (1999).</ref> and predictive calculations for [[functional genomics]].

She co-developed THEMATICS<ref name="five">[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/10/011030225809.htm Protein Function Predicted With New "THEMATICS" Method Developed By Northeastern University & Brandeis Scientists]. ScienceDaily, (2001).</ref><ref name="six">Borman, S., From sequence to consequence. Chemical and Engineering News,  79(48): p. 31-33 (2001).</ref><ref name="seven">Ball, P., [http://www.nature.com/news/2001/011019/full/news011025-1.html Computers spot shape clues]. Nature, (2001).</ref> (Theoretical Microscopic Anomalous Titration Curve Shapes), a simple computational predictor of functional information about proteins from their three-dimensional structure alone. THEMATICS predicts catalytic and [[binding sites]] in proteins with high sensitivity and good selectivity. A unique and powerful feature of her THEMATICS method is that it requires neither sequence nor structural comparisons and hence applies to novel folds, orphan sequences, and also to engineered [[polypeptide]] systems.

She is also the co-developer of a novel [[machine learning]] technology called Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Somarowthu|first=Srinivas|last2=Yang|first2=Huyuan|last3=Hildebrand|first3=David G. C.|last4=Ondrechen|first4=Mary Jo|date=2011-06-01|title=High-performance prediction of functional residues in proteins with machine learning and computed input features|journal=Biopolymers|volume=95|issue=6|pages=390–400|doi=10.1002/bip.21589|issn=0006-3525|pmid=21254002}}</ref> POOL is a monotonicity-constrained maximum likelihood method for the prediction of properties that depend monotonically on the input features. This powerful method, coupled with THEMATICS input features, is a top-performing [[active site]] predictor for protein structures.

These methods are also being used for the successful annotation of [[structural genomics]] proteins, i.e. for the discovery of the function of gene products whose function is currently unknown. Her Structurally Aligned Local Sites of Activity (SALSA) method uses local sets of [[amino acid]] residues that are computationally predicted to be active in catalysis to identify the biochemical function of [[enzyme]] structures of unknown function.

These computational methods are also currently used to understand how enzymes affect [[catalysis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ondrechen|first=Mary Jo|last2=Clifton|first2=James G.|last3=Ringe|first3=Dagmar|date=2001-10-23|title=THEMATICS: A simple computational predictor of enzyme function from structure|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=98|issue=22|pages=12473–12478|doi=10.1073/pnas.211436698|issn=0027-8424|pmc=60078|pmid=11606719}}</ref> Specifically Professor Ondrechen has pioneered the concept of spatially extended enzyme active sites, and that the participation of [[amino acids]], even if they are distant from the site of the catalyzed reaction, may be predicted with a simple calculation.<ref name="eight">Herring, A., [http://phys.org/news/2012-04-function-enzyme.html Form and function in enzyme activity]. (2012).</ref>

Her research group has also developed computational methods to improve the design of artificial enzymes.

== Community activism ==

Professor Ondrechen is a community leader and activist. She has recently served on the Board of Advisors of the [[Washington, DC]]-based Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council ([[ITRC]]), representing the interests of community and tribal stakeholders.<ref name="nine">Willett, A., [http://www.itrcweb.org/Documents/2012_ITRC_Board_of_Advisors1.pdf] (2012)</ref> She is the former President of the Board of Directors of the North American Indian Center of Boston ([[NAICOB]])<ref name="ten">Dunn, J., [http://www.naicob.org/about-us.html About NAICOB]. (2013).</ref> and served as Chair of the Board of Directors of the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based American Indian Science and Engineering Society ([[AISES]]) from 2011 to 2013.<ref name="eleven">EchoHawk, S., [http://www.aises.org/about/board AISES Board of Directors]. (2014).</ref> A passionate advocate for stewardship of the Earth, she previously has served on the Conservation Commission for [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts]] and on the Community Leaders Network of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]. She has been particularly active in the promotion of innovative technologies to solve environmental problems.<ref name="twelve">[http://redox-tech.com/doc_download/47-itrc-chemox.html In Situ Chemical Oxidation].
