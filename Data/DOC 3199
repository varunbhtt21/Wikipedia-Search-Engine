The {{nihongo|'''''No.8'' minesweeper'''|第八号掃海艇|''Dai Hachi Gō'' Sōkaitei}}, also sometimes called '''''W-8''''' was a {{sclass-|No.7|minesweeper (1938)|4}} [[minesweeper]] owned and operated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]], and one of only two ''W-7'' class minesweeper to survive World War II. The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 11 December 1937, and completed on 15 February 1939. Upon completion, it was registered with the [[Sasebo Naval District]]. After making it through World War II with fairly little damage, the ship was scuttled by the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Strait of Malacca]] on 13 July 1946.

== Service ==
On 1 June 1941, ''W-8'' was assigned to MineSweepDiv 21 with [[Japanese minesweeper No. 7 (1938)|''W-7'']], [[Japanese minesweeper No. 9 (1938)|''W-9'']], [[Japanese minesweeper No. 11 (1938)|''W-11'']] and [[Japanese minesweeper No. 12 (1939)|''W-12'']]. [[Japanese minesweeper No. 10 (1938)|''W-10'']] was not included because it was sunk after an [[Japanese invasion of Vigan|attack on Vigan]]. On 12 December 1941, ''W-8'' participated in the [[Japanese invasion of Legaspi|capture of Legaspi]], in the [[Philippines]]. On 17 December, ''W-8'', along with [[Japanese minesweeper No. 7 (1938)|''W-7'']], provided cover during the [[Battle of Borneo (1941–42)#Defence in Sarawak and North Borneo|invasion of Miri, Borneo]]. Between 19 December and 9 January 1942, ''W-8'' helped escort a [[convoy]] to [[Lamon Bay]], and traveled to several ports in the Philippines. On 9 January, ''W-8'' participated in Operation "H", which was the invasion [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Dutch East Indies]]. ''W-8'', along with the other remaining ''W-7'' Class ships, helped escort other ships of the Celebes Seizure Convoy. On 23–24 January, many of the same ships escorted some ships to the invasion of [[Kendari]]. On 31 January, many of the same ships also participated escorting the [[Ambon Island]]s invasion convoy. On 5  February, ''W-8'' assisted in escorting the [[Makassar]] invasion convoy. On 20 February, ''W-8'' was attacked by [[USS Pike (SS-173)|''USS Pike'']], after it misidentified ''W-7'' and ''W-8'' as [[light cruisers]]. Both shots ''USS Pike'' fired missed. Both [[minesweepers]] managed to get away from the submarine before it could get off any more shots.

After the attack, ''W-8'' participated in a number of uneventful convoys and [[minesweeping]] activities, mainly around [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], until 16 January 1943. On 16 January, the Japanese tanker [[Japanese tanker Toei Maru|''Toei Maru'']] was struck by a submarine, and began to sink. It is unclear whether ''W-8'' was still escorting ''Toei Maru'' or not at the point of the attack, although it is assumed that the escort was heading back to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. Three days later, on 19 January, ''W-8'' returned to the sight of the attack and picked up any survivors. After another three months, ''W-8'' headed towards the [[Marshall Islands]], but returned to Truk on 27 April. On 6 August, ''W-8'' was [[Dry dock|dry-docked]] for repairs. It was undocked on 23 September.

Between 23 September 1943 and 1 July 1945, ''W-8'' took part in several escorts an minesweeping operations. On 1 July, while escorting [[Japanese submarine chaser No. 2|''Sub Chaser no. 2'']], from [[Surabaya]] to [[Makassar]], ''W-8'' and ''Sub Chaser no. 2'' were "attacked by 2 enemy submarines at 0228 and 0250 and sunk in 7-30S 116-15E", according to [[FRUMEL]] intercepts.

==Post war==
On 2 September 1945, the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] was signed aboard [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''USS Missouri'']] by representatives from [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the [[United States]], the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and the [[New Zealand|Dominion of New Zealand]]. Despite this, ''W-8'' did not receive notice of the end of the war until 15 September, thirteen days later, while docked at [[Surabaya]].

On 10 July 1946, ''W-8'' arrived at [[Keppel Harbour]], in [[Singapore]]. On 13 July 1946, it was scuttled by the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Malacca Straits]]. It was officially removed from the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy's]] list of ships until 10 August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/W-8_t.htm |title=IJN Minesweeper W-8: Tabular Record of Movement |last1=Hackett |first1=Bob |last2=Cundall |first2=Peter |date= |website=combinedfleet.com |publisher= |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>
