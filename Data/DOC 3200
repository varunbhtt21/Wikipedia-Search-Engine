== History ==
Originally the district was known as Sandy Creek, but later it was named Blenheim after [[Blenheim Park]] in [[Oxfordshire]], England, which was in turn named after the [[Battle of Blenheim]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://blenheimss.eq.edu.au/Ourschool/History/Pages/History.aspx|publisher=Blenheim State School|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>

Blenheim State School opened on 7 Apr 1879, with an initial enrolment of 73 pupils.<ref>{{cite QSA Agency|4855|Blenheim State School|25 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1373481 |title=Official Notifications. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=15 July 1878 |accessdate=25 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1895, a [[German Baptist]] church was established at Blenheim under the leadership of C. Muetzelburg. As time passed, the desire for German language church services diminished and, due to falling numbers attending, the church was closed and physically relocated to [[Laidley, Queensland|Laidley]].<ref>{{cite web|title=German Baptist Churches in Queensland and the German Baptist Conference|url=http://www.bwa-baptist-heritage.org/bap-ger.htm|publisher=Baptist Union of Australia|accessdate=25 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318031522/http://www.bwa-baptist-heritage.org/bap-ger.htm|archivedate=18 March 2013|df=}}</ref>
