Title : Blatterle
Text : '''Blatterle''' is a white [[Italian wine]] [[grape variety]] from the [[Alto-Adige (wine)|Alto-Adige]] of northeast Italy. The grape, which was historically grown around the commune of [[Bolzano]] in [[South Tyrol]] and the [[Eisacktal]] valley, gets its name from the term in the local [[Tyrolese dialect]] for "little leaves". While not widely used in commercial [[wine production]], the grape is sometimes blended with other local Tyrolese varieties, such as [[Fraueler]], and [[Müller-Thurgau]].<ref name="Wine Grapes">J.

==History==

Blatterle has a long history of being grown in northeast Italy, particularly along the [[Eisack]] river and around the commune of Bolzano. Historically, the grape was also known under the synonym ''Platterle'' with its name being derived from the local Tyrolese word for "little leaves". Over the last few centuries, plantings of Blatterle have sharply declined and by the turn of the 21st century the variety was on the verge of [[extinction]] with only a few producers still cultivating the variety.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>
