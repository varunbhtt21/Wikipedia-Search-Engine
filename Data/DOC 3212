:({{Find sources|Lubbock sound}})
Deprodded. The sources do not mention the term "Lubbock sound" anywhere. The books mentioned in the deprod summary, at first glance, did not seem to mention it either, nor could I find any other relevant hits for the supposed genre. <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 03:36, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. After I think it over, it's so easy to say that there's (Bo) diddley out there about the "Lubbock sound". [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 07:07, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. My "deprod summary" was that we should keep the article because the topic was mentioned in "1996 'Prairie Nights to Neon Lights', 2003 'All Music Guide to Country' by Erlewine et al, 2003 'Rock and Roll: Gold Rush' by Maury Dean, 1982 'You're so cold I'm turnin' blue' by Hume." These sources can be seen on the following Google Books links. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 07:40, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:*''Prairie Nights to Neon Lights: The Story of Country Music in West Texas'', by Joe Carr, Alan Munde, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&pg=PT184 page 184]: "In many ways, the mix of country and rock is the basis of the "Lubbock Sound." Stubbs' Barbecue Restaurant on East Broadway in Lubbock was another center of Lubbock music activity. Established in 1968, the restaurant, especially its Sunday jam sessions, served as a focal point for Lubbock musicians... Other local clubs such as Fat Dawg's, Main Street Saloon, and Coldwater provided outlets for the developing talents of Lubbock musicians during the period."
:*''All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music'', edited by Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LdxCPLZAExsC&pg=PA918 pages 917–918]: The section titled "The Lubbock Country Scene" has about a page of text describing how Lubbock's sound is far more progressive than the conservative politics of the area would indicate. Charts show who were the influences in the Lubbock sound. One sentence reads, "As some critics quip, the Lubbock sound is too country in orientation to even get played on country radio."
:*''Music in American Life: An Encyclopedia of the Songs, Styles, Stars, and Stories that Shaped our Culture'', edited by Jacqueline Edmondson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TQPXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA559 page 559] about Buddy Holly. The book says that Holly's band the Crickets had a "Tex-Mex" or "Lubbock" sound. 
:*''Telling Stories, Writing Songs: An Album of Texas Songwriters'', by Kathleen Hudson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QSLUAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT137 page 137]. Joe Ely talks about Lubbock's style of music. He says "a lot of the Lubbock sound came not so much from the city but just from the fact that there wasn't a whole lot else to do except get into trouble." He talks about which musicians influenced the style of Lubbock's music.
:*''Rock and Roll: Gold Rush'', by Maury Dean, [http://books.google.com/books?id=lJS4EArRBwoC&pg=PA135 page 135]: Dean writes that the Bobby Fuller Five song "I Fought the Law" is "the Lubbock sound at its best."
:*''You're so cold I'm turnin' blue: Martha Hume's guide to the greatest in country music'', Martha Hume, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QoYwAQAAIAAJ&q=%22lubbock+sound%22&dq=%22lubbock+sound%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bgpaU6DpK8uWyASe94H4CQ&ved=0CEoQ6AEwAzgK pages 156–157]: "Joe Ely is from Lubbock, Texas, and is the best current exemplar of the sound of the Joe Ely: the Lubbock sound."
::*'''Comment'''. Those are just scattered mentions. Nothing substantive. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 09:59, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Lack of in-depth sources, and the topic of Holly and his influence is already covered in [[Buddy Holly]]. Non-Holly-related material on the Lubbock sound and its relation to Lubbock culture could be included in [[Lubbock, Texas#People and culture]], which already discusses Holly. Most of the material in this article needs to be referenced to show whose opinion it is (just having a list of people allegedly "influenced by the Lubbock sound" is worthless, and it's the same with the list of "popular songs") and the topic of Holly and his influence is already better covered in [[Buddy Holly]]. Might redirect either to [[Lubbock, Texas#People and culture]] or [[Buddy Holly]]. If someone wants to write a good article with proper referencing that isn't purely about Buddy Holly, I might change my opinion. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 11:46, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Weak delete'''. There does not appear to be a Lubbock "sound" so much as a Lubbock "scene". [http://books.google.com/books?id=LdxCPLZAExsC&pg=PA917&dq=%22lubbock+country+scene%22#v=onepage&q=%22lubbock%20country%20scene%22&f=false Here] [http://books.google.com/books?id=3Jorozp1yp4C&pg=PA474&dq=lubbock+%22buddy+holly%22+%22waylon%20jennings%22#v=onepage&q=lubbock%20%22buddy%20holly%22%20%22waylon%20jennings%22&f=false are] [http://books.google.com/books?id=vykEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA119&dq=lubbock+%22buddy+holly%22+%22flatlanders%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5O1iU9H1D8GxoQS8soCQDQ&ved=0CF4Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&q=lubbock%20%22buddy%20holly%22%20%22flatlanders%22&f=false examples] which discuss the city's musical heritage, plus [http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/oglfir this book] which "seeks to answer the question, why do so many innovative musicians come from Lubbock?" If someone were to re-purpose the current article into a [[Music of Lubbock, Texas]] page (like we have with [[Music of Athens, Georgia]], for example), it would certainly be worth keeping as a notable topic. <small><span style="border:1px solid">[[User:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:black">&nbsp;Gongshow&nbsp;</span>''']]</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color:black">[[User_talk:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:#ffffff">talk</span>''']]</span></small> 01:19, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:*That sounds like a good idea. Not really a straight move, but more of a pasting of greatly reworked text and refs, to [[Music of Lubbock, Texas]]. [[User:Binksternet|Binksternet]] ([[User talk:Binksternet|talk]]) 00:40, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*:'''Keep''' and expand.  The information is valid, and there's the start of something here.  It's a little too focused on the Crickets right now, but there are a LOT of good sources [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=%22Lubbock+sound%22 here] that could be used to expand the article.  Many of these establish the "Lubbock sound" as a distinct, notable style of music on its own.  Even if our current article is in sore shape, deletion is not clean up, and source material clearly exists to make this better.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 19:40, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Move''' and '''reframe''' as [[Music of Lubbock, Texas]].  I find the currently article title deeply unsatisfactory, even though there are a few scattered mentions of the term about, the "Lubbock sound" clearly isn't a major concept defined by experts in the field.  However, the city did host a number of important early developments in the rock and roll genre, and a decent article could surely be written to cover all of that.  The content in ''this'' article would be a good start.  [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] <sup>([[User talk:Lankiveil|speak to me]])</sup> 07:42, 11 May 2014 (UTC).
*'''Keep''' but '''move''' as suggested, possibly to ''Music of Lubbock, Texas''. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 17:10, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
