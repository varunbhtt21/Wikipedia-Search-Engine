Title : Bonamico (grape)
Text : {{Redirect|Canaiolo Romano|another Tuscan wine grape that is also known as Canaiolo Romano|Canaiolo}}

'''Bonamico''' is a red [[Italian wine]] [[grape variety]] that is grown in the [[province of Pisa]] in [[Tuscany (wine)|Tuscany]] where the grape has a reputation for producing very high [[yields (wine)|yields]]. Some [[ampelographers]] speculate that the grape may have originated around the town of [[Palaia]] with the grape being known under the synonym of ''Uva di Palaia''. While often used as a [[table grape]], Bonamico can be a minor blending component in several Tuscan ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata]]'' (DOC) and ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) wines where it often contributes floral [[aroma notes]] and [[acidity (wine)|acidity]].<ref name="Wine Grapes">J.

==History==
[[File:Provinces of Tuscany map.png|left|thumb|Bonamico is mostly found in the provinces of Lucca, Pisa and Pistoia.]]
Bonamico has been historically grown across Tuscany but following [[World War II]] and the post-war economic turmoil of the 1950s and 1960s, plantings of the grape sharply declined and it is now mostly found in the provinces of [[Pisa]], [[Pistoia]] and [[Lucca]] where it is also used as a table grape.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Viticulture==
The name "Bonamico" is derived from the [[Italian (language)|Italian]] term for "good friend" which ampelographers believe may be a reference to the grape's propensity to produce bountiful [[yields (wine)|yields]]. However, these high yields coupled with Bonamico being a [[ripe (wine)|late ripening variety]] meant that the grape often produced off balanced wines with high [[acidity levels]], unripe [[tannins (wine)|tannins]] and low [[alcohol]] levels.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Wine regions==
[[File:Vineyards in Tuscany.jpg|right|thumb|Bonamico is found almost exclusively in Tuscany where the grape can benefit from a long growing season.]]
In 2000, there were {{convert|100|ha|acres}} of Bonamico in cultivation, mostly in the province of Pisa and in the provinces of [[Lucca (province)|Lucca]] and [[Pistoia (province)|Pistoia]].<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>

==Styles==
According to [[Master of Wine]] [[Jancis Robinson]], if yields are kept in check and the grape is allowed a long [[growing season (vine)|growing season]] to fully ripen before [[harvest (wine)|harvest]], Bonamico has the potential to make [[body (wine)|medium bodied]] wines with good acidity levels and floral aromatics.<ref name="Wine Grapes"/>
