'''''Angelica venenosa''''' is a species of plant known as '''hairy angelica'''. It is native to the Eastern United States where it ranges from the East Coast to the [[Ouachita Mountains]].

It is a tall perennial, reaching heights of 2 meters. It produces an [[umbel]] of flowers in late spring and early summer.<ref>[http://www.missouriplants.com/Whitealt/Angelica_venenosa_page.html MissouriPlants]</ref>

A recent publication has suggested that populations in the Fall Line Sandhills area of the Southeast have a number of unusual morphological features and may be worthy of taxonomic recognition. At the present, no varieties or subspecies of ''Angelica venenosa'' are recognized.<ref>[http://www.herbarium.unc.edu/flora.htm Flora of the Southern and Mid-Atlantic States]</ref>
