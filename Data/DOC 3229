Title : Writer's home
Text : '''Writers' homes''' (sometimes '''writer's''', '''author's''' or '''literary houses''') are locations where writers lived. Frequently, these homes are preserved as [[historic house museum]]s and [[literary tourism]] destinations, called '''writer's home museums''', especially when the homes are those of famous [[Author#Literary significance|literary figures]]. Frequently these buildings are preserved to communicate to visitors more about the author than their work and its historical context.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Visitors can learn much from famous writers’ houses - The Boston Globe|url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2013/10/04/visitors-can-learn-much-from-famous-writers-houses/laEMOGJGehdDUflPOwmlbP/story.html|website = BostonGlobe.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}</ref> These exhibits are a form of [[biographical criticism]]. Visitors of the sites who are participating in [[literary tourism]], are often fans of the authors, and these fans find deep emotional and physical connections to the authors through their visits.<ref name=":0" />

Sites include a range of activities common to cultural heritage sites, such as [[living history]], [[museum exhibit]]s, [[guided tours]]  and [[poetry reading]]s.<ref name=":0" /> ''New York Times'' commentator Anne Trubek counted 73 such houses in the United States.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|title = Read My Book?

The tradition of preserving houses or sites important to famous authors has a long history: in the 14th century Petrarch's birthplace was preserved, despite Petrach barely spending time there as a child.<ref name=":1" /> In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century France, photojournalism which represented authors homes created an increased public interest in writers' private lives, making their homes destinations.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Photojournalism and the Origins of the French Writer House Museum (1881-1914): Privacy, Publicity, and Personality|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9PtTRm1E8C|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9781409408772|first = Elizabeth|last = Emery}}</ref>

The public popular imagination around these literary homes is a central theme of the satirical novel ''[[An Arsonist's Guide to Writers' Homes in New England]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Burn Down a Poet’s House, and the Mail Just Pours In|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/books/10masl.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2007-09-10|access-date = 2015-11-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Janet|last = Maslin}}</ref>
