'''Banbhore Division''' ({{lang-sd|'''ڀنڀور ڊويزن'''}}), also known as "'''Thatta Division'''" or "'''Bhambore Division'''", is the sixth administrative division of [[Sindh]] as announced by the People's Party's Sindh Government.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/1102074/bhambhore-division-in-sindh Bhambhore division in Sindh – Newspaper]. ''Dawn''. (25 April 2014).</ref><ref>[http://videos.arynews.tv/sindh-government-promoted-thatta-division/ Sindh government promoted Thatta as division | ARYNews Video Portal].

The planned capital of this division is the city of [[Thatta]]. In addition to [[Thatta District]] itself, plans exist to incorporate the districts of [[Sujawal District|Sujawal]] and [[Badin]] into Banbhore Division; prior to this change, all three of these districts were included in the [[Hyderabad Division]].<ref>[http://abbtakk.tv/eng/94282indh-govt-declares-thatta-sixth-division-of-province240414/ Sindh Govt declares Thatta sixth division of province | Abb Takk News – Breaking News, News in English and Latest Headlines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426170608/http://abbtakk.tv/eng/94282indh-govt-declares-thatta-sixth-division-of-province240414/ |date=26 April 2014 }}.

== History ==
{{POV-section|date=May 2014}}
The Sindhi Nationalists wanted a new division from the existing Hyderabad it was part of.<ref>[http://www.samaa.tv/news/searchByTag/nationalist Samaa TV]. Samaa TV.</ref> In 2012, when [[Badin]] was badly flooded
by a seasonal monsoon, Hyderabad management failed to rescue Badin and provide disaster management in the aftermath. Therefore, in the 2013 regional election, people demanded a separate division as a condition of voting for the People's Party.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130610112644/http://election2013.geo.tv/constituency/results/238/NA-238.html Election Result NA-238 Thatta-II Sindh | Pakistan Election 2013 – geo.tv]. Election2013.geo.tv (15 April 2013).</ref> In the People's Party's election campaign, the party accepted the demand and it was successful in gaining majority seats in these areas. It was also important to make another administrative division for better governing and development in the region.
