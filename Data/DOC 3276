==Career==
In 2008, Fisher began performing in the [[Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey]]'s "Shakespeare Live" program, which presents professional theater performances at schools throughout the [[New York metropolitan area]]. He eventually obtained the role of [[List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters#Tom Robinson|Tom Robinson]] in the program's production of ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', which he had first read in high school. On how he approached the role, he stated: "I tried to show his compassion. Here’s a guy who’s been in jail for seven months for a crime he didn’t commit. He’s had everything taken away from him. He can’t feed his wife. He can’t feed his kids. Yet he doesn’t badmouth anyone for what’s happened to him. Partly it’s because he can't. But I think that even when he’s alone, he doesn’t have bad thoughts about these people other than he’s sorry for them. That’s admirable. It’s a quality I wish I could say I had. I know if this happened today, I’d have a lot to say."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/07/ray-fisher-cyborg-justice-league-bio-family/|title=Ray Fisher: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|first=Daniel S.|last=Levine|date=22 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref>

But he had a naturally bigger frame than I did, so in order for me to get to his size I had to lift — bench presses, curls, squats, calf raises. I had to get used to a new body."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superherojacked.com/2017/03/26/ray-fisher-workout/|title=Ray Fisher Workout Routine and Diet: Train like a Machine to become Cyborg|website=superherojacked.com|accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref>
