Title : Thirteen Heavens
Text : The [[Nahua people]] such as the [[Aztec mythology|Aztecs]], [[Chichimecs]] and the [[Toltecs]] believed that the heavens were constructed and separated into 13 levels, usually called '''Topan''' or simply each one '''Ilhuicatl iohhui''', '''Ilhuicatl iohtlatoquiliz'''. Each level had from one to many Lords (gods) living in and ruling them.

In [[Aztec mythology]], the '''Thirteen Heavens''' were formed out of [[Cipactli]]'s head when the gods made creation out of its body, whereas [[:es:Tlaltícpac|Tlaltícpac]], the earth, was made from its center and the nine levels of the underworld ([[Mictlan]]) from its tail.<ref name="Fernández1992">{{cite book|author=Adela Fernández|title=Dioses prehispánicos de México: mitos y deidades del panteón náhuatl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FG45qSQgDwwC|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Panorama Editorial|isbn=978-968-38-0306-1|pages=30, 33, 34}}</ref>

The most important of these heavens was [[Omeyocan]] (Place of Two), where [[Ometeotl]] - the dual Lord, creator of the Dual-Genesis who, as male, takes the name Ometecuhtli (Two Lord), and as female is named Omecihuatl (Two Lady) - resided.
