* {{anchor|:Mátyás Eörsi}}[[:Mátyás Eörsi]] <span class="plainlinks">([{{fullurl::Mátyás Eörsi|action=history}} history] · [{{fullurl::Mátyás Eörsi|diff=0}} last edit] · [[Talk:Mátyás Eörsi/Temp|rewrite]])</span> has the same text as his official biography at http://www.hrnk.org/about/advisory-council.php.  I can't rule out a case of reverse copying (archive.org doesn't have a version of that page which predates ours) though given the contributor's history of copyvios I thought I'd get a second opinion here.  The rest of the article should also be checked.  (Part of it is an unattributed copy of https://hu.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eörsi_Mátyás&oldid=7792272 for which I'll add a {{tl|translated page}} tag, though possibly some non-free sources have also been copied or translated.)

:*Oh, it's a copyvio all right - if nothing else, an old school cut & paste copy from an alternate title. Looking further. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 19:13, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

:*[[File:Pictogram voting keep.svg|20px]] '''Article cleaned''' by investigator or others. No remaining infringement. I am not able to prove backwards copying. Some of the changes I see from the external site suggest that our article is a modification of their content rather than the other way around - for instance, our article said "His recent report on Attitude to memorials exposed to different historical interpretations (2009), was also" - the external site says "His recent report, “Attitude to Memorials Exposed to Different Historical Interpretations” (2009), was also". The comma is correct in the latter, incorrect in our own version. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 19:31, 7 May 2014 (UTC)<br>
