Per the [[Talk:Alternate universes and omake theater in Megatokyo#Merge?|merge discussion]] that was initiated at this article's talk page, there appears to be some consensus  within the discussion to nominate the article for deletion. Taking this to AfD to gain a wider discussion. The rationale for deletion can be seen on the talk page, but essentially, these alternate universes are not a major part of the source material involved, and the article lacks secondary sources.

*'''Delete''' no third-party surces or any secondary info. clearly not notable or worthy by any means. [[User:Lucia Black|Lucia Black]] ([[User talk:Lucia Black|talk]]) 13:22, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': I realize I may induce groans by saying this, as I was the one who first proposed it be merged, but I wonder if these universes are covered by reviews or other secondary coverage we just haven't looked at yet.

:*Update: I've perused the sources linked in Reception, and I didn't notice a single mention of the alternate universes. I could see articles on Piro and Largo, but since the reviewers didn't think to mention this feature of the comic, it doesn't satisfy [[WP:N]] to keep an entire article on it.

*'''Delete''' I don't believe there's an alternate universe where this article is relevant. I would have suggested a speedy deletion. -[[User:Novil Ariandis|Novil Ariandis]] ([[User talk:Novil Ariandis|talk]]) 07:46, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per Lucia and Novil.  I don't see how it's [[WP:GNG|notable generally]] outside of its own universe. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 17:52, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
