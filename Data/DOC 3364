'''"Bonjour Vietnam"''' is a song composed by [[Marc Lavoine]], co-written by Lavoine and Yvan Coriat, and recorded by [[Vietnamese people in Belgium|Vietnamese-Belgian]] singer [[Quynh Anh]]. Lavoine said he was impressed by Quynh Anh's charm and talent as well as being touched by the feeling of a small girl who had never seen her homeland, so he wrote the song as a gift for her.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/151268/bonjour-viet-nam-a-gift-to-the-homeland.html|title=Bonjour Vietnam, a gift to the homeland|last=Bach Lien|first=Thanh Liem|publisher=Vietnam News}}</ref> The content of the song is about the longing of an [[overseas Vietnamese]] to the homeland.
