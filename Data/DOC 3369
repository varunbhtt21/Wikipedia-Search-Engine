The result of the discussion was   '''delete''' There is a procedure for this - and this is it. The keep !vote is lessened in weight for obvious reasons. That, combined with the delete !votes and the wish of the IP who we can [[WP:AGF]] is likely to be the user in question, settles this as delete.

An IP claiming to be [[User:Chris seidl]] left a PROD on that user page. Given that User Chris seidl had only three total edits, all to that user page as a joke and that the last edit was from January of 2007, it is quite probable that the IP is indeed User Chris seidl. Even if he is not, I would recommend deleting this user page anyway, due to the fact that the user never intended to contribute to Wikipedia. I have gone ahead and left the PROD on the page for the moment, for ease of reference. [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 05:08, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Also, I did not use the speedy deletion process (user requested) as I, of course, cannot verify that the IP was actually the user in question. [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 05:10, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' If Chris ever did mean to be a Wikipedia editor, he/she never got around to it, and the information on the user page is not about Wikipedia activities.  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 23:59, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Isn't there a valid procedure for this. Oppose deletion on the basis of opposing hysterical deletionsism by destructive user.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:QuackDoctor|QuackDoctor]] ([[User talk:QuackDoctor|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuackDoctor|contribs]]) 21:49, 29 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:*'''Comment''' Just note that I have taken the above user to the Admnistrator's Incidents noticeboard.
