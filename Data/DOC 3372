{{divbox|fawn|Contributor copyright investigation|
This [[WP:CCI|CCI]] cleanup subpage has been opened because concerns of multiple point infringement have been substantiated and further steps are necessary to address the serious risk of [[Wikipedia:Copyright violation|copyright violation]] from the listed contributor. Listings are not intended to imply a presumption of bad faith on the part of any contributor, as copyright laws vary widely around the world and many contributors who violate [[WP:C|Wikipedia's copyrights policy]] do so inadvertently through not understanding it or the United States' laws that govern it.

'''If you are here because of a note on an article's talk page explaining removal of text''', please do not restore any removed text without first ensuring that the text does not duplicate, closely paraphrase or plagiarize from a previously published source. You are welcome to use sourced facts that may have been removed to create new content in your own words or to incorporate brief quotations of copyrighted material in accordance with [[WP:NFC|the non-free content policy and guideline]].}}

==Instructions==
'''All contributors with no history of copyright problems are welcome to contribute to clean up.''' Contributors who are the subject of a contributor copyright investigation are among contributors with a history of copyright problems and so are not welcome to directly evaluate their own or others' copyright violations in CCIs. They are welcome to assist with rewriting any problems identified.

''If contributors have been shown to have a history of extensive copyright violation, it may be assumed without further evidence that all of their major contributions are copyright violations, and they may be removed indiscriminately in accordance with [[Wikipedia:Copyright violations]].'' Contributors who are the subject of a contributor copyright investigation are among contributors who have been shown to have a history of extensive copyright violation and so all of the below listed contributions may be removed indiscriminately. However, to avoid collateral damage, efforts should be made when possible to verify infringement before removal. 

When every section is completed, please alter the listing for this CCI at [[Wikipedia:CCI#Open_investigations]] to include the tag "completed=yes". This will alert a clerk that the listing needs to be archived.
*<code><nowiki>{{CCI-open|Contributor name|Day Month Year|completed=yes}}</nowiki></code>

===Text===
* Examine the article or the diffs linked below. 
* If the contributor has added creative content, either evaluate it carefully for copyright concerns or remove it.
:*Evaluating for copyright concerns may include checking the listed sources, spot-checking using google, google books and other search engines and looking for major differences in writing style. The background may give some indication of the kinds of copyright concerns that have been previously detected. For older text, mirrors of Wikipedia content may make determining which came first difficult. It may be helpful to look for significant changes to the text after it was entered. Searching for the earlier form of text can help eliminate later mirrors. If you cannot determine which came first, text should be removed presumptively, since there is an established history of copying with the editor in question.
:*If you remove text presumptively, place  <code>{{tlsp|CCI|name&#61;Contributor name}}</code> on the article's talk page.
:*If you specifically locate infringement and remove it (or revert to a previous clean version), place  <code>{{tls|cclean}}</code> on the article's talk page. The url parameter may be optionally used to indicate source.
:*If there is insufficient creative content on the page for it to survive the removal of the text or it is impossible to extricate from subsequent improvements, replace it with <code>{{tls|copyvio}}</code>, linking to the investigation subpage in the url parameter. List the article as instructed at the copyright problems board, but you do not need to notify the contributor. Your note on the CCI investigation page serves that purpose.
:*To tag an article created by the contributor for presumptive deletion, place <code><nowiki>{{subst:copyvio|url=see talk}}</nowiki></code> on the article's face and <code>{{tlsp|CCId|name&#61;Contributor name}}</code> on the article's talk page. List the article as instructed at the copyright problems board, but you do not need to notify the contributor.
* After examining an article: 
:*replace the diffs after the colon on the listing with indication of whether problem was found (add {{tl|y}}) or not (add {{tl|n}}). If the article is blanked and may be deleted, please indicate as much after the {{tl|y}}.
:*Follow with your username and the time to indicate to others that the article has been evaluated and appropriately addressed. This is automatically generated by four tildes (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>)
*If a section is complete, consider collapsing it by placing {{tl|collapse top}} and {{tl|collapse bottom}} beneath the section header and after the final listing.

*In evaluating an unblock request from this user, I noted a number of copyright warnings ([[Slugterra: Ghoul from Beyond]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Slugterra:_Ghoul_from_Beyond&diff=591509396&oldid=591362219][http://animationmagazine.net/tv/disney-xd-air-slugterra-tv-movie-spring/], [[Edo Japan restaurant]], [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Edo Japan restaurant]], [[Special:Undelete/Zodiak Kids]], [[Hornet Films]]). Sockpuppets have all been cleaned. I recommend this editor's contributions be nuked (not the episode lists, they may be unattributed copies). [[User:MER-C|MER-C]] 05:08, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
