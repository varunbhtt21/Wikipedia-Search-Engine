Sgt. Morrissey was at Ardee courthouse for a sitting of the local court when he was found out about the raid at the employment exchange in Ardee. He joined two Ardee based Gardaí in their patrol car who were shot at by the robbers. Near [[Tallanstown]] the robbers,who had switched from a car to a motorcycle, collided with an approaching car injuring its occupants. Two of the Gardaí stayed with the injured persons while Sergeant Morrissey, alone and on foot, pursued the raiders. As he caught up with them a shot was fired and he fell to the ground grievously wounded.  One of the gunmen stood over him and at point blank range shot the Sergeant dead.<ref name=garda /> [[RTÉ]] Security Correspondent at the time, Tom McCaughren, described it as "an execution".
