The novel is part of a [[tetralogy]] written by [[Vasconcelos]] and centered on different stages in the life of the protagonist, Zeze, and, by extension, Vasconcelos. The four books were published in a disorganized order, following an [[Aleatoricism|aleatory]] chronology instead of a direct one. The direct continuation of the story, ''Doidão'', was actually published in 1963, five years before ''My Sweet Orange Tree'', and follows the life of Zeze during his adolescence.

A [[My Sweet Orange Tree (film)|film adaptation]] was released in 2012.<ref>[http://zerohora.clicrbs.com.br/rs/cultura-e-lazer/segundo-caderno/noticia/2013/04/estreia-nos-cinemas-nova-adaptacao-de-meu-pe-de-laranja-lima-4111366.html Estreia nos cinemas nova adaptação de "Meu Pé de Laranja Lima" - Segundo Caderno - Zero Hora<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Plot ==
Zeze is a young boy who lives in [[Bangu, Rio de Janeiro]] with his underprivileged family. Because everyone is busy trying to support the family, Zeze is usually left by himself with his baby brother Luis, and ends up doing mischievous deeds that make his parents and older siblings so angry that they physically discipline him for what he has done.

After Zeze's father gets fired, the whole family moves, and the new house has a few trees that each of the siblings claims. After having all the trees taken, Zeze gets upset, but one of his older sisters, Gloria, suggests looking in the backyard and Zeze soon discovers a small orange tree. At first, Zeze doesn't like his tree, but he finds out that amazingly, he can communicate with it. He gives the tree a name, Minguinho, and the two become best friends.

Even after meeting a companion, Zeze continues his naughty pranks, and he finally decides to hang on the back of the car of a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] man called [[Manuel Valadares]]. Unfortunately Zeze gets busted and Valadares humiliates him in public, causing Zeze to vow to take his revenge. However, Valadares attributes Zeze's attitude to the fact that he's a child and offers Zeze his friendship. With this relationship, Zeze learns what real love is.

The two of them share many memories as good friends, but sadly, Valadares dies in a train accident. Zeze goes through serious mental [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] that causes illness. In the end, Zeze overcomes the trauma, but loses the ability to talk to Minguinho. Zeze also hears the news from his father that he has got a new job and their life will be better. However, Zeze confesses he feels he has killed his father in his mind for the treatment he has given him and expresses sorrow at losing his ‘real’ father, [[Manuel Valadares]].

== Background and publication ==
The book '''''O meu pé de laranja lima''''' ({{lang-pt|My Sweet Orange Tree}}) was first published in 1968 by Ed. Melhoramentos in [[São Paulo]], Brazil and was Written in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL18096533M/O_meu_p%C3%A9_de_laranja_lima. |title=O meu pé de laranja lima.  |last=workbot |publisher=Open Library |date=15 December 2009 |website=openlibrary.org |access-date=7 August 2015}}</ref>

According to www.aladin.co.kr, the author believed we feel sorrow in life when we realise life' has two faces and eventually leads us away from childhood. It is also said, through this book, the author puts Zeze in front to appeal the salvation of dilapidating human nature by saying how real beauty of life is not how extravagant it is, but small but simple like leaves gently floating on river and how without love, life is so miserable. To the author, the reason that our life is deprived of love is adult's lack of creativity and feelings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aladin.co.kr/author/wauthor_overview.aspx?AuthorSearch=@15640 |title=J.M 바스콘셀로르 |publisher=aladin.co.kr  |access-date=10 August 2015 |website=aladin.co.kr |language=Korean |trans-title=J.M.
