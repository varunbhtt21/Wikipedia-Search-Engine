He studied law at the [[University of Sydney]], graduating with honours, and was admitted as a solicitor of the NSW Supreme Court in 1935. In 1940 and 1941, he was official secretary to the NSW Agent-General in London, and acted as Agent-General himself for some months. On return to Australia he advised the NSW and Commonwealth governments on civil defence.<ref name=farq>Farquharson, John, "Administrative guru of his day", ''The Canberra Times'', 13 November 1997, p. 11</ref>

Bland commenced his [[Australian Public Service]] career in 1942, as Principal Adviser to the Director-General of Manpower. In 1946 he was appointed Assistant Director of Employment in the [[Department of Labour and National Service]].<ref name=farq/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107035652|title=Envoy Post to Sir Edwin Hicks|date=7 December 1967|page=1|newspaper=The Canberra Times}}</ref> Between 1952 and 1967, Bland was [[Departmental secretary|Secretary]] of the Department of Labour and National Service.<ref name="NAA CA 40">{{citation|title=CA 40: Department of Labour and National Service, Central Secretariat/ (by 1947 known as Central Office)|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+40|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> In the role, he was the main architect of the Commonwealth Employment Service.<ref name=ObitAust/>

Bland was appointed Secretary of the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] in 1968, but he stayed in the role just two-years, retiring in 1970.<ref name=Unfinished>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110463415|title=Sir Henry Bland tells of his unfinished business at Defence|page=19|date=30 September 1970|newspaper=The Canberra Times}}</ref> During his short time as head of the department, Bland initiated a broad and intense program of administrative reform,<ref name=Unfinished/> including a "rolling" five year defence program that intended to make allowances for Australian defence needs over a five-year period, expecting to shorten the waiting time for hardware by having service departments make submissions for their needs earlier than in the past.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bruce|last=Juddery|author-link=Bruce Juddery|date=28 August 1970|newspaper=The Canberra Times|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110339884|title=Sir Henry's legacy of dissatisfaction|page=2}}</ref>

In 1971-2, he undertook a review of land transport in Victoria for the state government, which resulted in the [[Bland Report]] recommending closure of many Victorian Railways branch lines and passenger services.<ref>[http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1971-72No29.pdf Victoria, ''Report of the Board of Inquiry into the Victorian Land Transport System'', Government Printer, Melbourne,1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119073530/http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1971-72No29.pdf |date=19 January 2016 }}</ref>

In July 1976 Bland was appointed Chairman of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]],<ref name=ObitAust/> a position in which [[Earle Hackett|Dr. Earle Hackett]] had been acting since the death of Prof Richard Downing in November 1975.  He resigned after only five months, following clashes with both staff (who resented his appointment as what they called "[[Malcolm Fraser]]'s hatchet man") and the Fraser government itself, which backed down on its intention to remove the position of Staff Commissioner on the ABC Board. The position was held by [[Marius Webb]], who had been at loggerheads with Bland from the start.<ref name=farq/>
