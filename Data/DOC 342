'''''Malaspina''''' is a 1947 Italian [[melodrama film]] directed by [[Armando Fizzarotti]] and starring [[Vera Rol]], [[Aldo Bufi Landi]] and [[Rino Genovese]]. It is a [[melodrama]], based on a popular song of the same name. Its story of female wrongdoing and ultimate redemption was characteristic of Neapolitan-style cinema. A young woman promises to be faithful to her lover when he goes off to fight in the [[Second World War]]. However, in his absence she becomes a [[prostitute]] and takes up with a notorious criminal. When her real love returns he kills her new boyfriend. Deeply ashamed of her conduct, she becomes a [[nun]].

The film revived the [[Naples]] film-industry, which had largely disappeared during the [[Fascist era]] when Italian filmmaking was concentrated in Rome. The film was released in the [[United States]], where it proved popular with [[Italian-American]] audiences.<ref>Marlow-Mann p.16</ref>
