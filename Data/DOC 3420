*'''Delete'''. Obvious delete, unref'd BLP. Person is way way below notability standards, zero usable refs. CEO of a company (Richmont Holdings) which does not itself have an article or probably deserve one. If Richmont Holdings gets an article, a sentence or two on this person could be added (if ref'd). [[CVSL]] has an article, but 1) he's just board member, and 2) it's described as "a community of multiple... companies, each maintaining its own unique brand, knit together in a publicly traded company as a network of networks" which is a barftastic way to describe a company (they probably have "mind-encounter sessions" instead of "meetings" I suppose) and tends to make my spam-O-meter go off.
