'''Robert Peter Davies-Jones''' is a British atmospheric scientist who substantially advanced understanding of [[supercell]] and [[tornado]] dynamics and of [[tornadogenesis]]. A theoretician, he utilized numerical simulations as well as [[storm chasing]] field investigations in his work as a longtime research meteorologist at the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) in Norman, Oklahoma.<ref name="retire">{{cite web |title = Bob Davies-Jones, NSSL tornado expert to retire |work = Hot Items |publisher = National Severe Storms Laboratory |date = 15 Dec 2008 |url = https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/news/hotitems/display.php?id=112 |accessdate = 2014-04-25 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}</ref>

Davies-Jones received a B.Sc. in [[physics]] from the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1964 and a Ph.D. in [[astrophysics]] from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] in 1969. From 1969-1970 Davies-Jones did a post-doc at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR) before embarking on a long career at NSSL in 1970. He retired from NSSL in 2009 where he remains an emeritus researcher and continues to publish some papers. Davies-Jones is a Fellow of the [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS). Davies-Jones earned the NOAA Distinguished Career Award<ref name="career"/> and in 2018 the Nikolai Dotzek Lifetime Achievement Award by the [[European Severe Storms Laboratory]] (ESSL).<ref name="Dotzek">[https://www.essl.org/cms/lifetime-achievement-nikolai-dotzek-award-2018-for-bob-davies-jones/ Lifetime Achievement Nikolai Dotzek Award 2018 for Bob Davies-Jones]</ref>
