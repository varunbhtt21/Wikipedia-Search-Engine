==History==
Built in 1863 during the [[Qing dynasty]], the park was originally the private garden of the wealthy salt merchant Li Chuncheng (李春城). Its formal name was '''Rong Garden''', but it was commonly called the '''Li Shanren (Philanthropist Li) Garden'''.

After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the Li family donated the garden to the state, and it was opened to the public on 1 July 1951 as People's Park. In 1954, Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] presented the park with his [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] of its name. It is the only work of calligraphy Mao wrote for a park.<ref name=enorth/>

After major renovation work, the park was reopened in 2009. Entrance is free.<ref name=chinadaily/>
