==Production==
Due to the box office success of [[Choi Dong-hoon]]'s gambling epic ''[[Tazza: The High Rollers]]'' (it attracted 6.84 million in admissions in 2006, making it one of the [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea|highest-grossing Korean films that year]]), production company [[Sidus Pictures|Sidus FNH]] announced a [[sequel]], with [[Jang Joon-hwan]] originally attached as screenwriter/director and a release planned for late 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paquet|first=Darcy|title=Jang to direct ''Tazza'' sequel|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/jang-to-direct-tazza-sequel-1117964385/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2014-05-19|date=6 May 2007}}</ref> But pre-production was later halted, and Jang pulled out of the film.

Speculation about a sequel continued, given that ''[[Tajja]]'', the famous local comic series (or "[[manhwa]]") illustrated by [[Huh Young-man]] and written by Kim Se-yeong that served as the 2006 film's source material comes in four volumes, each with entirely different characters and settings. ''Tazza 2'' is based on the second volume ''Tazza: Hand of God'', which was published on November 16, 2006 by [[Random House]] Korea.

In 2012, [[Kang Hyeong-cheol]] signed on to direct the sequel, and casting was finalized in late 2013, with [[T.O.P (entertainer)|Choi Seung-hyun]] as lead character Ham Dae-gil, the nephew of Goni, the protagonist in ''Tazza: The High Rollers''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=So-yeon|title=Big Bang's T.O.P, Shin Se Kyung and More to Star in ''Tazza 2''|url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/51019/tazza-2-almost-finished-casting-members|work=enewsWorld|accessdate=2014-05-19|date=18 November 2013}}</ref>

Filming began on January 2, 2014 at a pool hall in [[Cheongnyangni-dong]], [[Seoul]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hong|first=Grace Danbi|title=Tazza 2 Reveals First Stills of Big Bang's T.O.P|url=http://mwave.interest.me/enewsworld/en/article/54998/tazza2-releases-photos|work=enewsWorld|accessdate=2014-05-19|date=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chung|first=Joo-won|title=Shin Se-kyung, Choi Seung-hyun to co-star in Tazza 2|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140103000545|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=2014-05-19|date=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Sun-min|title=''Tazza 2'' set for release soon|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2983012|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2014-05-19|date=6 January 2014}}</ref>
