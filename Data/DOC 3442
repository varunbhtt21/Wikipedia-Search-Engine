Corresponding article in mainspace has been deleted under [[WP:A7|CSD A7]], and the only user who was working on it has since been blocked. There isn't really a solid deletion policy for the draft namespace, but it seems to me like there's really no reason to keep this weeks-old draft around. <span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS,sans-serif">[[User:IagoQnsi|'''<span style="color:#a00;">Iago</span><span style="color:#f50;">Qnsi</span>''']]</span> ([[User talk:IagoQnsi|talk]]) 05:53, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:There isn't any reason to remove it either. It's not a BLP violation, it  does not seem to be particularly spammy nor advertising, and it isn't against any of the criteria we have for excluding content at [[WP:NOT]]. What benefit is there to be gained by turning the switch and making it invisible? It will still be there occupying space on the hard drive, so there is not even any storage gain to recover by "deleting" it.

*'''Keep''' for the moment. I think the right approach to abandoned drafts is the same as we use for abandoned AfCsubmissions - delete only if not edited for six months. The definition of [[WP:CSD#G13]] refers only to "drafts in the Special:PrefixIndex/Draft: namespace ''that are using the project's {{tl|AFC submission}} template''"; I'm not sure why that condition is there (and haven't got time to check just now), but I see no reason to delete abandoned drafts in less than six months.

::John, the condition is G13 is there because there are drafts that have not been created through AfC, and there's currently no consensus on what to do with those. This has been discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:Drafts]], you can join the conversation there. [[User:Diego Moya|Diego]] ([[User talk:Diego Moya|talk]]) 10:34, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Thanks, I'll look at that. Absent any agreement to apply G13 to other drafts, I guess this (MfD) is the place to discuss deleting them, and it seems to me that six months without any edits is a reasonable time to allow before deletion.
