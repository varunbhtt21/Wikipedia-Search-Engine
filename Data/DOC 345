Fails Wikipedia's notability standard.  [[User:Staglit|Staglit]] ([[User talk:Staglit|talk]]) 23:43, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

This is a good page. It just needs a little improvement. [[User:Raymond37|ℜ@ƴмøηd]] 00:01, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

And if you're going to find sources look up Phoebe Allen's because most people call it that. [[User:Raymond37|ℜ@ƴмøηd]] 00:03, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I can't quite see enough evidence of notability. There's coverage on Huffington Post[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-n-powell/phoebe-allens-the-little-hummer_b_4875067.html] and a short article on ABC Go.com[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/04/mom-baby-hummingbirds-star-in-live-webcam/], plus local media[http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Hummingbird-Cam-Offers-People-a-Closer-Look-Orange-County-146698615.html], and a bit of content on websites of ornithological organisations. But not much goes beyond "look at the cute birds". It's just a webcam, and there's no indication of wider cultural impact. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 08:59, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect and Merge''' with [[Allen's Hummingbird]]. Not notable on it's own. [[User:Dragonfire X|Dragonfire X]] ([[User talk:Dragonfire X|talk]]) 11:34, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

It just needs improvement. [[User:Raymond37|ℜ@ƴмøηd]] 13:06, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

This article is fixable. I know it. [[User:Raymond37|ℜ@ƴмøηd]]  20:13, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Enough RS coverage to establish GNG. Some of it is "look at the cute birds", and there's some duplicative, repetitive info, but there is more varied detail about the site and its subject when taken as a whole, over a period of years. I'm listing some sources found on Google, including a couple of arguable reliability. [http://phoebeallens.com/news.html phoebeallens.com/news.html] lists additional sources, including television news coverage, foreign language coverage, and some other articles.
