==Plot ==
After the events of one-shot ''Death of Optimus Prime'', [[Rodimus]] forms a crew of [[Cybertron]]ians to man a vessel known as the ''Lost Light'', which soon sets out on a mission to learn what became of the legendary [[Knights of Cybertron]] after they departed their home planet. While [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and the other Autobots stayed on [[Cybertron]]. They encounter the D.J.D, Tarn aka Glitch, who recognised Deadlock who is [[Drift (Transformers)|Drift]] now has join the [[Autobots]]. [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]] committed suicide in the oil reservoir. Luckily, [[Grapple (Transformers)|Grapple]] and Rodimus noticed it. Meanwhile, in Swerve's bar, [[Swerve (Transformers)|Swerve]], [[Whirl (Transformers)|Whirl]], [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] etc. are talking about the events on Shadowplay while trying to fix Rung's brain. Rodimus informed Drift. Drift arrived in no time by realising in a shocked manner. Rodimus got furious and is going to question [[Cyclonus]] the only Decepticon in the Lost Light. [[Ultra Magnus]], Rodimus and others watched Drift questioning Cyclonus. Drift pointed his sword at Cyclonus. Cyclonus smack Drift's sword away from him. Thankfully, Rodimus and Magnus stop the duo from fighting. Cyclonus admitted that he did not kill Red Alert. So, Rodimus asked [[First Aid (Transfomers)|First Aid]] and [[Ambulon]] to fix Red Alert. First aid told Rodimus that it was not Cyclonus who did it. Rodimus bid a farewell to red alert that he will be seeing Red alert a better version. Suddenly something happened in Swerve's bar. The alarm bell rang that they are going to war. [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] asked Rung a few questions and Rung replied. Skids was delighted. The Lost Light went to battle the Seacons. Meanwhile, at the Decepticon outpost, [[Nautilator]] and Blip were chatting until Blip heard Nautilator voice sounded like [[Megatron]] . They realised Whirl,  Atomiser, [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]] etc. are here to destroy the outpost. Tailgate and Swerve watched how Magnus, [[Sunstreaker]] and the others fight with the cons. Drift sliced two Decepticons by using his swords, killing two members of the Seacons. Rodimus is almost near to his death when Snap Trap is about to kill him. But Snap Trap was however killed by Drift in the face. Meanwhile, Whirl, Cyclonus, Tailgate, Swerve and [[Rewind (Transformers)|Rewind]] are where Nautilator is at. Whirl and Nautilator play a show. However, Nautilator was so unlucky that Whirl forgets how did Prime speak and Whirl just killed Nautilator in the face. Swerve asked Whirl if he has any weapon left. Whirl gave Swerve the Shroomer which Brainstorm created. Swerve don't get it why is it called the Shroomer. Swerve accidentally pressed the button to shoot. Causing himself to lose an eye. Tailgate is trying to defuse an leakage explosion but it is going to explode in a few seconds. Cyclonus and Rewind threw Tailgate out of the leakage area. And it exploded. Everybody from the Lost Light fall back and Rodimus informed everyone that their attack is a success. But some got serious injuries. Swerve was on air with [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] as he was talking about what was his favourite experience in the Lost Light to [[Blurr]]. Ultra Magnus went to Swerve's and gave Swerve his medal. [[Overlord (Transformers)|Overlord]] came on board as Drift was a former Decepticon called Deadlock. Overlord starts to kill characters like [[Pipes (Transformers)|Pipes]] who was crushed by him and sacrificed his life. Magnus was also severely injured as Overlord destroyed his incubator. Overlord also got destroyed by [[Chromedome (Transformers)|Chromedome]] after seeing Rewind being held captive by Overlord. Overlord ended up with meeting Tarantulas. Drift quits the Lost Light and go for an adventure on his own. Magnus has landed safely on Luna 2 where chief justice [[Tyrest]] , [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]] and Pharma stays. Tyrest brought Magnus to his medibay and changed his heart where his injured part is. After his heart has changed, Magnus finally  awakened. He shouted Overlord and he realised that Tyrest was just directly in front of him. Tyrest gave him a punch. Tyrest and Magnus chatted until Magnus realised Tyrest is going to take away his armour. Minimus aka ultra magnus,saw his helmet and his armour. And he asked Tyrest who is going to take over him. Which was none other than [[Star Saber]] .
