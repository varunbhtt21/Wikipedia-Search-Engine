==Acquisition==
On December 28, 2012, Clover entered into a merger agreement with First Data Corporation.<ref> https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/740112/000104746913011139/a2217468zs-4.htm</ref> In a radio interview with Wharton professor Rahul Kapoor<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.innonavi.com/recent-guests/ | title=Recent Guests}}</ref> the structure of the acquisition was explained.  An operating agreement was put into place whereby Clover would receive $100M in funding to run independently.  First Data would be responsible for sales and support, while Clover built all new payment hardware/software for the company.  The deal utilized a "Founder's Clause" that would trigger a very large penalty payment if the parent company interfered with operations of Clover.  Thirty two months after the acquisition Clover was mentioned 88 times in the S-1 filed by First Data Corporation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883980/000119312515256975/d31022ds1.htm | title=Form S-1}}</ref>
