==Plot==
"Nobby" Butcher has been separated from his little brother Sebastian for 28 years. During their years apart, Nobby has become an alcoholic [[soccer hooligan]] and has started his own life with his girlfriend Dawn and his eleven children in the English seaport town of [[Grimsby]].

Sebastian (now Sebastian Graves) has become one of [[MI6]]'s top agents. After completing an interrogation, Sebastian comes into information regarding [[philanthropist]] Rhonda George, who is hosting a benefit called WorldCure and is a potential target for assassination, and is assigned to go. Nobby's friends at the pub also find out that his brother will be at WorldCure and convince Nobby to go there and reconnect with him. At the event, Sebastian sees a hitman, Pavel Lukashenko, who plans to assassinate Rhonda with a gun disguised as a video camera. As Sebastian prepares to shoot the camera, Nobby sees him and gives him a hug, accidentally causing him to shoot an [[AIDS]]-infected Jewish-Palestinian boy named Schlomo. The spray of blood lands in [[Daniel Radcliffe]]'s mouth, infecting him with the disease.

The brothers go on the run from the authorities and other criminals. Despite Sebastian's protests, Nobby convinces his brother that it would be best to hide out at his home in Grimsby. Meanwhile, MI6 believes that Sebastian has gone rogue. MI6 send orders to an assassin named Chilcott to track Sebastian down. However, Sebastian calls his handler Jodie and proclaims his innocence.

Chilcott and his men find the two brothers at a pub, but they both manage to escape, though Sebastian is hit with two ''[[Lonomia]]'' poison darts in the process. Though reluctant to do so, Nobby is forced to suck the poison out of Sebastian's body, saving his life.

Sebastian learns from Jodie that Lukashenko was going to make a deal with Joris Smit in a [[South Africa]]n lodge and the brothers travel there. Sebastian accidentally injects himself with [[heroin]], mistaking it for the bone strengthening treatment for his broken ankle. Nobby then assumes his brother's identity and goes undercover.

Nobby mistakenly seduces Banu the Cleaner, as she wore similar clothing to Joris' wife Lina and is interrupted by Joris and his two men. Sebastian arrives in the nick of time and saves Nobby. Lina tells them that Lukashenko bought some sort of virus, but she is fatally shot by Chilcott's men from a distance before she reveals any further information. To outrun Chilcott's men, the brothers are forced to hide inside an elephant's vagina, but end up covered in elephant semen due to several males having sexual intercourse with the female. Later, Sebastian asks why Nobby abandoned him as a child. Nobby explains that Sebastian's adoptive parents only wanted to adopt one of the brothers but were unable to decide, and he ran away so Sebastian could have a better life. Sebastian apologises to Nobby.

The two brothers travel to [[Santiago, Chile]], the venue of the football cup final between [[England]] and [[Germany]]. They realise that the syndicate plans to unleash their weapon upon a football match in the area, but the syndicate captures Sebastian. Rhonda visits the captured Sebastian and tells him her plans to launch the virus — called WorldCure — into the arena via fireworks. Nobby kills Lukashenko and other henchmen on his way before rescuing Sebastian.

The brothers race back to the arena and spot Rhonda. Chilcott attempts to kill Sebastian, but Nobby's kids throw Schlomo's wheelchair at him, knocking him over and impaling him on a helmet while Nobby goes after Rhonda. Nobby then tries to shoot Rhonda but his gun jams and he realises he must stop the fireworks himself. He sits on one of the fireworks containing the virus; Sebastian sits on the other at the last minute, reaffirming his brotherhood with Nobby. The fireworks go off with the two atop them and the brothers are knocked unconscious upon landing. Nobby's gun goes off and hits Daniel Radcliffe, whose infectious blood spills into [[Donald Trump]]'s mouth.

The news reports state that Rhonda has been arrested, the Grimsby brothers have "died" after saving the world, and that Donald Trump has AIDS. Schlomo is in custody after "killing" Chilcott. The brothers are actually recovering in the hospital. Jodie visits and gives them new identities, informing them that the virus did not affect them because its antidote is elephant semen. Nobby's family visits them.

In the final scene, eight weeks later, Nobby and Sebastian are on a mission in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. On a boat, Nobby is approached by a team of gunmen, whom he quickly kills. He reaches Sebastian, who asks him if he has met the team; Nobby realises too late that the gunmen were his team.

In a post-credits scene, the brothers are in a car and stop to ask a man for directions to the stadium. After receiving directions, Nobby shoots the man saying 'leave no witnesses', disturbing Sebastian.
