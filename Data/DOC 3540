'''''Z²''''' (short for '''''Ziltoid 2'''''; pronounced "[[Z#Name and pronunciation|zed]] squared" or alternatively "zee two"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqkvv3OZT_U</ref>) is a double album by Canadian musician [[Devin Townsend]] and his musical project Devin Townsend Project,<ref name=Rockadia>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockadia.com/news/devin-townsend-unveils-track-listing-for-ziltoid-2/2583|title=Devin Townsend unveils track listing for 'Ziltoid 2'|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2014 |first=Alex |last=May |publisher=Rockadia.com}}</ref> released on October 27, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/centurymedia/status/496767123004616705|title=Twitter / centurymedia|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> It consists of two albums released together: the sixth album in the Devin Townsend Project series, '''''Sky Blue''''', and '''''Dark Matters''''', a solo [[concept album]] acting as a sequel to Townsend's 2007 album ''[[Ziltoid the Omniscient]]''.<ref name=Rockadia /><ref>https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/497219080886439936</ref> The main theme of ''Dark Matters'' is, according to Townsend, "Ziltoid against the world".<ref name=Rockadia />

==Background==

''Z²'' has been a long-running project, with Townsend announcing it in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2009/11/17/ziltoid-part-2-z2/|title=Ziltoid Part 2... Z2|publisher=[[MetalSucks]]|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref> Later he stated that he "may have just written the heaviest thing he's ever done" for the album.<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/258081924592062464 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> Townsend also mentioned there is a surprising lack of Ziltoid himself appearing on the album, and that it "will be interesting to see how it all pans out". The project took its first steps on August 24, 2013, when a London-based radio station TeamRock Radio aired the first one-hour episode of ''Ziltoid Radio'', a satirical radio show hosted solely by Ziltoid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teamrockradio.com/news/devin-townsends-ziltoid-gets-teamrock-radio-show |title=Devin Townsend's Ziltoid gets TeamRock Radio show |publisher=TeamRock Radio |date=August 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824233055/http://www.teamrockradio.com/news/devin-townsends-ziltoid-gets-teamrock-radio-show |archivedate=August 24, 2013 }}</ref> Later, Townsend stated that "''Z Radio'' is just one little element of the ''Z²'' project".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teamrockradio.com/news/devin-townsends-teamrock-radio-show-is-part-of-z2-project |title=Devin Townsend's TeamRock Radio show is part of the Z2 project |publisher=TeamRock Radio |date=August 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830005951/http://www.teamrockradio.com/news/devin-townsends-teamrock-radio-show-is-part-of-z2-project |archivedate=August 30, 2013 }}</ref> After several ''Ziltoid Radio'' episodes aired, Townsend said he found the project hard to schedule and work with amidst touring and writing,<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/394248886266511360 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/395642612427661313 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> because he doesn't want to just "phone it in", and "it takes a lot of effort" to keep the content with tongue-in-cheek humour entertaining.<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/394249087588900864 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/395644912516874240 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> A total of seven ''Ziltoid Radio'' episodes aired between August 2013 and January 2014, and since then there has been no discussion or activity considering the series or its affiliation with the ''Z²'' project. The episodes have since been removed from TeamRock Radio's website. Townsend has also discussed a "ZTV" or "Ziltoid TV", being a part of the ''Z²'' project and preceding the album.<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/328322089796898818 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/341067714942627840 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/366909864993230848 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref>

In October 2013, Townsend said that he had "more ideas than time", but that it was "almost time to start demoing" the album.<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/393101142021775361 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> Later Townsend stated that since June 2013 he had written ideas for over 70 songs,<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/417565848983699456 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> and revealed that the album was "taking shape".<ref name="z2rec">[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/417566755960012800 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> Townsend also stated he was going to finish the whole project in two years.<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/364761687708008448 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> In February 2014, Townsend announced the recording process of ''Z²'' started on May 2, 2014, in [[Los Angeles]],<ref name="z2rec" /><ref name="z2contents">[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/433937161398673409 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> and also revealed that the project will include the Ziltoid TV program and a live show, with a "big graphic novel comic" and a documentary.<ref name="z2contents" /> On February 26, 2014, Townsend posted that ''Z²'' will be a double album, with disc one being the main album and disc two featuring Devin Townsend Project material.<ref name="z2discs">[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/438912576554934273 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> According to Townsend, the album's theme will be "Ziltoid against the world".<ref name="z2discs" /> Townsend revealed his intention of adding [[audience participation|audience-participated]] choir tracks on both discs.<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/438912776006668288 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref>

The ''Z²'' show took place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on April 13, 2015, after which Townsend stated his intent to take at least a year-long hiatus from recording and touring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWsppHFEc6s|title=Devin Townsend interview with TotalRock @Sonisphere 2014|date=July 8, 2014|accessdate=September 9, 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/497215176353906688 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/486292942441562113 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> However, by February 2016, work had begun on the next DTP record, ''Transcendence''.<ref>[https://twitter.com/dvntownsend/status/695649574476623872 Devin Townsend's Twitter]</ref> ''Z²'' won the [[Juno Award for Metal/Hard Music Album of the Year]] at the [[Juno Awards of 2015|2015 Juno Awards]].<ref>[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/devin-townsend-wins-juno-award-in-metalhard-music-album-of-the-year-category/ BLABBERMOUTH.net]</ref>

<small>Do note that the original tenth track "''Through the Wormhole''" has been removed entirely on the raw version, likely because it almost only consists of dialogue.</small>
