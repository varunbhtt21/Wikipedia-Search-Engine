'''''Trainwreck''''' is a 2015 American [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Judd Apatow]] and written by [[Amy Schumer]] in her breakthrough role. The film stars Schumer and [[Bill Hader]] along with an ensemble cast that includes [[Brie Larson]], [[Colin Quinn]], [[John Cena]], [[Vanessa Bayer]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Ezra Miller]], and [[LeBron James]]. The film is about a hard-drinking, free-spirited young magazine writer named Amy Townsend (Schumer) who has her first serious relationship with a prominent sports doctor named Aaron Conners (Hader).

[[Principal photography]] began on May 19, 2014, in [[New York City]]. The film premiered at the 2015 [[South by Southwest]] Film Festival on March 15, 2015, and was released theatrically in the United States on July 17, 2015, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film won several awards and was nominated for numerous others, including two [[73rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]] ([[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]]) and the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]].

== Plot ==
<!-- See WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The plot summary is recommended to be between 400 and 700 words. -->
Gordon Townsend tells his two young daughters Amy and Kim that he and their mother are divorcing because [[monogamy]] is not realistic, repeating it like a mantra. Twenty-three years later, Amy is a heavy-drinking party girl who sleeps around while writing for a men's magazine. She is in a casual relationship with a gym-addict named Steven, who was attracted to her because he first thought she "looked like a dude". Her cold-hearted English boss, Dianna, assigns her to write an article about a sports doctor named Aaron Conners.

While Amy is interviewing Aaron, she receives a text from Kim insisting they move Gordon to a cheaper assisted-living facility. Amy starts to hyperventilate, but Aaron calms her down and suggests they get food. Over dinner, he compliments her writing and she learns about his family. After some drinks, at Amy's suggestion, they go to his place and have sex. Amy stays the night, at Aaron's suggestion, which is a departure from her rule of never sleeping over with a man with whom she has had sex.

The next day, Aaron calls to ask if they can see each other again. Amy panics and tells him they will talk about it at the interview. She and her friend Nikki decide she has to end it. Meanwhile, Aaron's friend, [[LeBron James]], is excited for him since Aaron has not dated anyone in six years. Amy goes to watch Aaron perform surgery to [[Billy Joel]]'s "[[Uptown Girl]]", his favorite song. Afterwards, she tries to break things off. He insists they like each other and should date. Amy then gets a phone call that her father has had a fall. Aaron drives her to the home where he tends to her father.

Aaron and Amy begin dating and fall for each other. Amy is worried she is going to mess up the relationship, but Kim tells her she is just doing what everyone else does. Gordon takes a stockpile of his medication, overdoses, and dies. At his funeral, Amy accuses Kim of not caring about Gordon and the two have a falling-out. Shortly thereafter, Aaron tells her, for the first time, that he loves Amy, who berates him for choosing that particular day to start saying that to her.

Aaron receives a prestigious award at a luncheon and brings Amy. While making his speech, Amy gets a call from her boss Dianna, who threatens to fire her if she does not answer. She chooses to take the call and leaves during his speech. Afterwards, Aaron is upset that Amy missed the ceremony, and they start arguing. They return to her apartment, but Aaron thinks they should not go to bed angry, so Amy rants all night. The next day, Aaron is too tired to operate on [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] and tells Amy that they need to take a break. Hurt, Amy reacts by telling him that it is fine.

Amy goes out drinking with her co-workers, including an intern, who invites her back to his place; their bizarre sexual encounter is interrupted when his mom enters and reveals that he is only 16. The next day, Dianna fires Amy for the incident. Aaron is moping in his apartment until LeBron calls, claiming he has been injured. Aaron rushes over to find an intervention for him consisting of LeBron, [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Chris Evert]], and [[Marv Albert]]. They tell him he has always been afraid of opening up and needs to make things right with Amy, but Aaron insists things with Amy are over.

Amy visits Kim to make amends and tell her everything that has been happening in her life; Amy is comforted by Kim and her family with a group hug. Amy decides it is time to change and clears out all the alcohol from her apartment. She takes her Aaron story to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', where it ends up getting published, and sends a copy of the magazine with the story to Aaron. After attending a game at [[Madison Square Garden]], Aaron is called back to the court, where the Knicks City Dancers perform with Amy front and center, performing to Aaron's favorite songs, including "Uptown Girl". She tells him she wants to make their relationship work. They confess their love for each other and kiss, and everyone applauds.

=== Box office ===
''Trainwreck'' grossed $110.2 million in North America and $30.6 million in other territories for a total gross of $140.8 million, against a budget of $35 million.<ref name="mojo" />

In the United States and Canada, ''Trainwreck'' opened on July 17, 2015, the same day as the superhero film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''. Initial projections had the film opening to around $20 million, with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noting that it could overperform if it takes off among females or underperform given how R-rated comedies have struggled over the summer, with both ''[[Ted 2]]'' and ''[[Magic Mike XXL]]'' failing to meet expectations.<ref name="THR">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ant-man-amy-schumers-trainwreck-808615|title=Box Office Preview: 'Ant-Man,' Amy Schumer's 'Trainwreck' Pull Out of Station|first=Pamela|last=McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}</ref> It made $1.8 million on Thursday night showings, which began at 8 p.m. from 2,363 theaters,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/box-office-ant-man-amy-schumer-trainwreck-1201541637/|title=Box Office: Amy Schumer's ‘Trainwreck’ Opens Respectably on Thursday Night|first=Dave|last=McNarry|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 17, 2015|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref> and $10.7 million on its opening day.<ref name="OpeningDay">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/box-office-ant-man-trainwreck-2-1201543517/|title=Box Office: ‘Ant-Man’ Large with $58 Million, ‘Trainwreck’ Solid with $29 Million|first=Dave|last=McNary|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 18, 2015|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}</ref> Through its opening weekend, it grossed $30.1 million from 3,158 theaters, exceeding expectations.

Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying, "Schumer and Hader are wonderful together.

Sara Stewart of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film four out of four stars, saying "''Trainwreck'' is a corrective to a lot of outdated clichés. It's very funny and sweet and even a little weepy, and it has maybe the best scene ever filmed of dirty talk gone wrong."<ref>{{cite web|last=Stewart |first=Sara |url=https://nypost.com/2015/07/15/amy-schumers-trainwreck-is-a-hilarious-4-star-ride/ |title=Amy Schumer’s ‘Trainwreck’ is a hilarious 4-star ride |work=New York Post |date=July 15, 2015 |accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref> Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "''Trainwreck'' serves as confirmation that a star is born, a seemingly average woman whose above-average superpowers include reminding us of our own.
