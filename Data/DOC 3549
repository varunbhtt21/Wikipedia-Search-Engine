'''Nariman Bomanshaw Mehta''' (April 8, 1920 – August 22, 2014)<ref name="times-news-obituary" /> was an [[Indian American|Indian-born American]] [[organic chemist]] and [[pharmacologist]] who designed, synthesized, and patented the organic compound [[Bupropion]], marketed under the name [[Wellbutrin]] as an [[antidepressant]] and [[smoking cessation]] aid.<ref>{{US patent|3819706}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Mehta was born in [[Bombay]], [[India]] into a [[Parsi]] [[Zoroastrian]] family. He attended [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College]] in [[Bombay]], from where he received [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] and  [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in [[English studies|English]] and [[economics]], and a [[Master of Science]] degree. In 1939, he and fellow student [[Kaikhosrov D. Irani]], later a noted academic in his own right, wrote and published the book "Textbook of Theoretical and Practical Physics".<ref>[http://www.kdirani.com/books.htm Irani K.D. and Mehta N.B.] (1942) "Theoretical and Practical Physics"</ref>

Mehta won a Tata Scholarship and received a grant from [[Wendell Willkie]]. In 1947 Mehta went to the [[United States]], where he earned a PhD in chemistry from [[The University of Kansas]].

He had two daughters and a son.

==Career==
[[Seagram]] invited Mehta to the [[United States]] as a trainee in their research lab where he learned about [[fermentation]] and [[distillation]]. During his time at Seagram, Mehta studied the antibiotic [[Penicillin]]. While teaching chemistry at [[Central State University]], [[Wilberforce, Ohio|Wilberforce]], [[Ohio]], Mehta joined the pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome, Inc., now [[GlaxoSmithKline]], where he worked on potential [[neuropsychopharmacology|neuropsychopharmacological drugs]] and designed, synthesized, and patented (in 1969) the compound [[Bupropion]] (BW 323U66) that was approved for use as an [[antidepressant]] in 1985 and sold under the trade name Wellbutrin. Another application of the drug was as a [[smoking cessation]] aid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofmentalhealth.com/2014/01/10/dec-30-1985-want-a-zyban/ |title=1985: Want a Zyban? |publisher=The history of mental health |first=Henk |last=van Setten|accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>
