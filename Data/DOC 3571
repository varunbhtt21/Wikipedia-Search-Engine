'''''Seigneur''''' (English: ''Lord''), was the name formerly given in [[France]] to someone who had been granted a [[fief]] by the crown, with all its associated rights over person and property. This form of lordship was called ''seigneurie'', the rights that the ''seigneur'' was entitled to were called ''seigneuriage'', and the ''seigneur'' himself was the ''seigneur justicier'', because he exercised greater or lesser  [[jurisdiction]] over his fief. Since the repeal of the [[feudal system]] on 4 August 1789 in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], this office has no longer existed and the title has only been used for [[sovereign]] princes by their families.

In common speech, the term ''grandseigneur'' has survived. Today this usually means an elegant, urbane gentleman. Some even use it in a stricter sense to refer to a man whose manners and way of life reflect his noble ancestry and great wealth. In addition, ''Le Grand Seigneur'' had long been the name given by the French to the Ottoman [[sultan]]. ''Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ '' is the French equivalent of the English ''Our Lord Jesus Christ''.

The word ''[[seignorage]]'' is also derived from ''seigneur''.

The word shares the same provenance as the Italian ''[[Signore]]'', Portuguese ''[[Senhor]]'' and Spanish ''Señor'', which in addition to meaning "Mister" were used to signify a feudal lord.

The title is still used for the hereditary ruler of [[Sark]], an island in the [[English Channel]] which swears fealty to the [[The Crown|British Crown]].
