'''''Jem and the Holograms''''' is a 2015 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] film produced and directed by [[Jon M. Chu]], written by Ryan Landels, and starring [[Aubrey Peeples]] (as the title character), [[Stefanie Scott]], [[Hayley Kiyoko]], [[Aurora Perrineau]], [[Ryan Guzman]], [[Molly Ringwald]], and [[Juliette Lewis]]. Borrowing elements from the 1980s animated television series ''[[Jem (TV series)|Jem]]'' by [[Christy Marx]], the film was produced by [[Hasbro Studios]] and [[Blumhouse Productions]]. Chu's interest in developing a [[film adaptation]] of ''Jem'' is based on having grown up watching the original animated series with his sisters.<ref name=thedailybeastnostalgia>{{cite web|last1=Yamato|first1=Jen|title=How Justin Bieber Insipred 'Jem and the Holograms' |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/21/how-justin-bieber-inspired-jem-and-the-holograms.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>  He had attempted to make the film 11 years earlier, but was rejected by Universal due to the cost.

''Jem and the Holograms'' was theatrically released on October 23, 2015, by [[Universal Pictures]] and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $2 million worldwide on a $5 million budget and receiving negative reviews from critics and audiences alike.

==Plot==
<!--Plot summaries may not be copied or closely paraphrased from other sources, they must be written from scratch. Ideal length: 400-700 words per WP:FILMPLOT-->
Teenaged songwriter Jerrica Benton and her younger sister Kimber live with their Aunt Bailey and two foster sisters, Aja and Shana. The four girls frequently videotape themselves playing music and wearing colorful '80s outfits just for fun, but Jerrica is too shy to sing on camera. Jerrica learns one day that due to Aunt Bailey's financial problems their house will be auctioned. She vents her emotions by recording a song with the video camera Kimber uses to post blogs. She disguises herself by calling herself Jem, her deceased father's nickname for her.

She is interrupted just before deleting the video and an Internet-obsessed Kimber posts it onto YouTube. The video attracts millions of views in a single day. Jerrica is offered a record deal by Starlight Productions and travels to LA with her sisters. They meet music producer Erica Raymond and her son Rio. Erica is polite and courteous with the four girls but shows particular interest in Jerrica, who she sees as a potential superstar.

The girls settle down in LA and discuss their next move. They've brought along a small robot called 51N3RG.Y (pronounced ''synergy'') built by the Benton sisters' deceased father, Emmett. The robot suddenly activates itself and leads them on a [[scavenger hunt]]. Each clue represents something Jerrica did or wanted to do with her father. The objective is to find several missing pieces designed to fit into the robot so that it can be fully activated. The girls find the first piece in the [[Santa Monica Pier]]. They find the second clue in a guitar once owned by Jerrica's father when, by coincidence, the band plays a concert.

Rio and Jerrica begin to develop feelings for each other, much to Erica's dismay. Erica signs Rio off to another singer in an attempt to keep him away from Jerrica. Aunt Bailey tells Jerrica via FaceTime that their house is going for auction in a few days. Desperate to save the home, Jerrica asks Erica for an advance. Erica says she will oblige if Jerrica agrees to leave her sisters and start a solo contract. Jerrica relents, believing she is doing it for the family. Her sisters discover the truth about the contract, denounce her for leaving them out of the deal, and leave. After a dull solo performance, Jerrica becomes depressed over her mistake and goes to visit the LA house where she used to live with Kimber and her father.

Her sisters arrive to visit her at the old house and make amends. They vow to help her finish the scavenger hunt and Rio goes along too. Jerrica realizes that the last piece is the earrings her dad told her to wear, but Erica made her take them off when she first went to Starlight. The earrings are now stored in Erica's office. Rio and the girls break into Starlight headquarters, almost getting caught by Erica, but succeed. The reward for finishing the hunt is a final hologram message from Jerrica and Kimber's father. They also discover Rio's late father's will, which gives him a majority of shares in Starlight and effectively puts him in control of the company.

With the house safe, Jem and her sisters play in their concert together. Rio chats with a woman called Lindsey Pierce at the concert. She offers to give the band the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', and asks Rio what to call the band; he suggests "Jem and the Holograms".

In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Erica, now terminated from Starlight, arrives in a seedy junkyard, where she attempts to recruit a group of punkish young women into a band to rival the Holograms. They decline, saying that Erica dropped them the first time they were signed with Starlight. They change their minds when the leader, Pizzazz, discovers that Rio is dating Jem, and take Erica inside. The graffiti on the side of their trailer reveals their name as the Misfits.

===Critical reception===

The film received generally negative reviews from critics and fans of the original animated series.<ref name=thr1/> Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that the film has a rating of 20% based on 76 reviews; the average rating is 3.7/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Jem and the Holograms'' ignores its source material's goofy charm in favor of bland by-the-numbers drama."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jem_and_the_holograms_2015/ | title=''Jem and the Holograms'' (2015) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] | accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jem-and-the-holograms | title=''Jem and the Holograms'' Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=DeadlineCinemascore>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/the-last-witch-hunter-paranormal-activity-ghost-dimension-jem-and-the-hologram-box-office-1201592008/|title=Weekend Box Office: 'Last Witch Hunter', 'Paranormal Activity' Opening - Deadline|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=October 26, 2015|quote=The film's B+ CinemaScore doesn't mean anything: Very few were in the theater.}}</ref>

Geoff Berkshire of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised Peeples' performance as Jem, noting that she "keeps the film watchable", as well as Lewis as "a nonsensical bitch-on-wheels caricature with offbeat line readings and live-wire energy", and noted that "a generally unremarkable tech package — cinematography, sound, costuming & makeup, etc. — at least provides a modest showcase for costume designer Soyon An, makeup head Mary Klimek and hairstylist Vanessa Price, who come the closest to channeling the vibrant spirit of the ''Jem'' cartoons that originally made fans fall in love."<ref name="variety">{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/jem-and-the-holograms-film-review-1201623589/ | title='Jem and the Holograms' Review: '80s Cartoon Comes to Life | work=Geoff Berkshire | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=October 22, 2015 | accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref>

[[Matt Zoller Seitz]], editor-in-chief of [[RogerEbert.com]], gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that the film "is one of the weirdest big screen adaptations of a cheap TV cartoon that I've seen", giving his observation that the film even sometimes evokes the films of [[Terrence Malick]], a filmmaker known for his films' lush cinematography and reflective nature. Seitz's overall conclusion is that "[the film is] not a good film in terms of plot or tonal consistency, and it offers almost nothing in the way of true conflict, but it's always an observant and sincere movie, and occasionally a beautiful and deep one."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seitz|first1=Matt Zoller|title=Jem and the Holograms Movie Review (2015)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jem-and-the-holograms-2015|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=20 June 2016|date=23 October 2015}}</ref>

===Contest controversy===
In March of 2014, the films producers opened an online contest encouraging fans to create short videos describing their love of the original ''Jem'' animated series and what a film version would mean to them. The winners of the contest were initially to be offered a small role in the film; this prize was later changed to having the videos themselves featured. In the final production, the fan footage was interspersed with clips of celebrities and edited in such a manner that the fans appeared to be talking about the film's version of the characters. The fans who submitted the footage were not informed as to how it would be used in the film. This was perceived as fans being misled into providing positive reviews for a film they had not yet seen, resulting in many being upset by the manipulation of their perspectives on the character and series in light of how unlike the original series was the premise of the film.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/how-the-jem-and-the-holograms-movie-manipulates-its-biggest-fans-56325/ | title= How the 'Jem and the Holograms' Movie Manipulates Its Biggest Fans | publisher=[[IndieWire]] | accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref>
