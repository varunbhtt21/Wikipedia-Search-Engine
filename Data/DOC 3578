'''Nora Nadjarian''' is an [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian–Cypriot]] poet and short story writer. She writes in English and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], as well as [[Greek language|Greek]]. Her writing mostly centres on the island of [[Cyprus]], especially the [[Cyprus dispute|partition of Cyprus]] into [[Northern Cyprus|North]] and [[Cyprus|South]], though there are numerous works of universal themes. A frequent participant in international competitions, poetry festivals, literary conferences and other projects, her poems and short stories have also appeared in numerous anthologies around the world including [[Cyprus]], United Kingdom, United States of America, Germany, [[India]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]].<ref>http://fictionaut.com/users/nora-nadjarian--2</ref> The writer has said that her work is inspired by [[Sylvia Plath]] and [[Yehuda Amichai]].<ref name="Nora Nadjarian - Background Information">http://www.authorsden.com/visit/author.asp?id=34010</ref> [[Paul Celan]], [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[Sharon Olds]] are a few other idols that she has mentioned.<ref>http://bettyboopinspired.blogspot.com/2011_03_01_archive.html</ref>

==Biography==
Nora Nadjarian was born in 1966 in [[Limassol]], a city on the southern coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island of [[Cyprus]]. Her grandparents were [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[refugee]]s who moved to [[Cyprus]] in the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>http://fictiondaily.org/author-interviews/nora-nadjarian/</ref> She first attended an [[Armenian education in Cyprus|Armenian elementary school]], then moved to a private school called Foley's Grammar School where she graduated from high school. She obtained a degree from [[University of Manchester|Manchester University's]] department of [[modern language]]s and [[linguistics]] and then returned to [[Cyprus]]. She taught in [[Limassol]] and then in [[Nicosia]], where she is currently residing.<ref name=heiditrautmann>http://www.heiditrautmann.com/category.aspx?CID=6457137135</ref> She visited her [[homeland|ancestral homeland]] of [[Armenia]] in 1983 which inspired her to write poems based on [[ethnic identity development|ethnic identity]], [[culture|cultural self-discovery]], her Armenian roots and the [[Armenian Genocide|tragic fate of the nation]]. She first decided to participate in a competition because of the encouragements of a friend, and after being acknowledged for her poem "Vinegar" (1999–2000) she continued to take part in numerous international competitions.

==Critical Review==
Nora Nadjarian has received international praise for her work, especially for that centring on themes of the [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus partition]] of [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|1974]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and loss. Her "stories are political without being polemical", she writes of an ongoing [[battle]] in both the physical sense and mind inside the Cypriot heart that is defined by the division in [[Nicosia]] between the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot]] side of the island without taking on a side. She condemns the [[battle]] itself, not the people. Her work is read beyond the [[Mediterranean]] borders and can very much be identified with in its search to find what defines one's nationality.<ref>http://www.theshortreview.com/reviews/NoraNadjarianLedraStreet.htm</ref>
