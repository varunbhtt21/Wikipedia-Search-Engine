'''''Monsta''''' is the debut [[extended play]] (EP) by the British band [[I See MONSTAS]] (credited as MONSTA on the release). It was released on 23 October 2012 through [[OWSLA]]. The EP spawned a single, "Messiah", which entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 154. "Holdin' On" climbed the UK Singles Chart to number 48, due to strong sales of the [[Skrillex]] and [[Nero (band)|Nero]] remix. It also peaked at number ten on [[UK Dance Chart]] and number three the [[UK Indie Chart]].

==Critical response==
''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' noted that "Messiah" was "brimming [with] raw energy while a grinding bass rhythm chugs along in the background with an overlay of powerfully deep vocals".<ref name="vibe2">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-owsla-drops-monsta-ep-today|title=New Music: OWSLA Drops MONSTA EP Today|publisher=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|date=22 October 2012}}</ref> ''[[Mixmag]]'' commented that the [[Skrillex]] and [[Nero (band)|Nero]] remix "should boost the production outfit further into the EDM stratosphere".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixmag.net/words/news/hear-new-skrillex-and-nero-remix-of-monsta-|title=Hear Skrillex and Nero remix of Monsta|publisher=[[Mixmag]]|date=2 October 2012}}</ref> Renowned dance music blog ''Dancing Astronaut'' praised the release, commenting that "listeners can hear the power behind Skaar’s silky androgynous voice" and "adding the sounds of Skaar’s gritty soulful voice prove dubstep does not have to be the cliche “bass in your face” genre it has become".<ref name="DA">{{cite web|url=http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2012/10/owsla-trio-monsta-self-titled-debut-ep/|title=OWSLA-signed trio Monsta releases self-titled EP|publisher=Dancing Astronaut|date=23 October 2012}}</ref>
