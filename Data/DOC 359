:Thanks for completion. There are two of them ([[Heavy Beat]] and [[Heavy beat]]). Both redirects are not related to the article name or content. Seems to be a neologism. --[[Special:Contributions/89.244.73.21|89.244.73.21]] ([[User talk:89.244.73.21|talk]]) 20:29, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''delete''' A heavy beat is so common a feature of pop music that it seems impossible to pick a place to point it to. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 12:08, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
