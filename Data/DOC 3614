==Career==
Prior to running one of the world's biggest TV production companies<ref>{{cite news|last=Roxborough|first=Scott|title=Marc-Antoine d’Halluin Replaces David Frank as Zodiak Media CEO|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marc-antoine-d-halluin-replaces-634556|date=2013-09-23}}</ref> Frank spent five years working in investment banking in London, first with [[Hill Samuel]] and latterly with [[Swiss Bank Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Chris|title=David Frank, Zodiak Media Group|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/in-depth/the-braodcast-interview/david-frank-zodiak-media-group/5018563.article|work=Broadcast|date=2010-09-22}}</ref> Following his time in finance he decided to pursue a career in journalism, first in newspapers - [[Euromoney]] - and subsequently working for the [[BBC]] as a television reporter specialising in business and finance.<ref>{{cite news|title=57. David Frank|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/09/mediatop1002007.mondaymediasection54|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2007-07-09}}</ref>

===RDF Media===
After three years at the BBC, he left to set up his own independent production company, RDF Media, in 1993 with £35,000 start-up capital.<ref>{{cite news|title=INDIE FINANCE - Building RDF into a TV money-spinner|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/indie-finance-building-rdf-into-a-tv-money-spinner/1175382.article|work=Broadcast|date=2001-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Zodiak gets Frank with RDF acquisition|url=http://www.c21media.net/zodiak-gets-frank-with-rdf-acquisition/?ss=David+Frank|work=C21 Media|date=2010-06-02}}</ref> His brother, Matthew Frank, joined RDF in 1994 to establish the company's distribution arm.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kemp|first=Stuart|title=Zodiak Rights Hires Steve Macallister as CEO|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/zodiak-rights-hires-steve-macallister-669826|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2014-01-10}}</ref> Originally the company focused on the production of factual programmes but rapidly expanded into other genres such as entertainment, drama and children's, establishing itself as a leading force in TV production in the UK.

Within 10 years RDF was turning over around £32m a year. In 2000 the company established a successful presence in the US.<ref>{{cite news|title=INDIE FINANCE - Building RDF into a TV money-spinner|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/indie-finance-building-rdf-into-a-tv-money-spinner/1175382.article|work=Broadcast|date=2001-05-18}}</ref>

In 2002, Frank turned down the opportunity to become the Chief Executive at [[Channel Five (UK)]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Deans|first=Jason|title=RDF head shortlisted for C5 top job|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/16/independentproductioncompanies.broadcasting|work=The Guardian|date=2002-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Frank pulls out of Five chief race|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/frank-pulls-out-of-five-chief-race/1166950.article|newspaper=Broadcast|date=2002-12-19}}</ref>

By 2005, revenues exceeded £40m and the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange (AIM) with a valuation of £49m.<ref>{{cite news|title=57. David Frank|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/09/mediatop1002007.mondaymediasection54|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2007-07-09}}</ref>

In 2006, RDF won its third 'Best Independent Production Company' award at the annual Broadcast Awards, adding to wins in 2002 and 2004. It was the first and, as of 2016, the only company to have won the award three times.<ref>http://www.investegate.co.uk/articlePrint.aspx?id=200512011428499951U</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Broadcast Awards 2002|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcast-awards-2002/1136572.article|newspaper=Broadcast|date=2002-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Broadcast Awards winners 2004|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcast-awards-2004-winners/1088438.article|newspaper=Broadcast|date=2004-02-13}}</ref>

====Queengate Affair====
In July 2007, RDF became embroiled in a controversy concerning a documentary series the company was making about the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=RDF results hit by Crowngate|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/rdf-results-hit-by-crowngate/211250.article|newspaper=Broadcast|date=2007-10-31}}</ref> The incident, which became known as Queengate, centred on manipulation of footage in a promotional tape for the series which was shown to journalists at a [[BBC One]] press event purporting to show the Queen storming out of a photoshoot with [[Annie Liebowitz]]. The affair led to the resignations of RDF Director of Programmes [[Stephen Lambert (media executive)|Stephen Lambert]] and BBC One Controller [[Peter Fincham]].<ref>{{cite news|title=RDF to miss targets as suspension hits home|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/rdf-to-miss-targets-as-suspension-hits-home/212796.article|newspaper=Broadcast|date=2007-10-31}}</ref>

====Management Buy-Out====
The controversy resulted in a sharp fall in the RDF share price on [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]]. In 2009, with revenues now of approximately £150m and in response to the fall in the share price, Frank led a management buy-out of the company's shares supported by Dutch private equity firm Dasym Investment Strategies (formerly Cyrte Investments).<ref>{{cite news|last=Bulkley|first=Kate|title=RDF steels itself with £2m in cost savings|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/rdf-steels-itself-with2m-in-cost-savings/1994175.article|work=Broadcast|date=2009-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Loveday|first=Samantha|title=RDF MBO closes|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/rdf-mbo-closes/035649|work=Licensing|date=2009-02-05}}</ref>

In July 2010, RDF Media was sold to Zodiak Entertainment, for a reported £150m, and Frank was appointed the CEO of the enlarged group, now renamed Zodiak Media.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|title=RDF Media sold to Zodiak Entertainment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/02/rdf-media-sold-zodiak-entertainment|work=The Guardian|date=2010-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Katherine|title=Zodiak closes RDF deal|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/indies/zodiak-closes-rdf-deal/5014519.article|work=Broadcast|date=2010-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Katherine|title=Zodiak deal transforms RDF|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/indies/zodiak-deal-transforms-RDF/5014586.article|work=Broadcast|date=2010-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Loveday|first=Samantha|title=RDF rebrands as Zodiak Media Group|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/rdf-rebrands-as-zodiak-media-group/032431|work=Licensing|date=2010-09-22}}</ref>

===Zodiak Media===
The acquisition of RDF Media, in 2010, created a £500m "super-indie" global production giant, Zodiak Media.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Katherine|title=Zodiak closes RDF deal|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/indies/zodiak-closes-rdf-deal/5014519.article|work=Broadcast|date=2010-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Zodiak gets Frank with RDF acquisition|url=http://www.c21media.net/zodiak-gets-frank-with-rdf-acquisition/?ss=David+Frank|work=C21 Media|date=2010-06-02}}</ref> Zodiak Media is an independent media company that produces entertainment, factual, drama and kids' programming, with 45 companies operating in 17 countries and $800 million in annual revenues.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bulkey|first=Kate|title=Signs of Zodiak's next move|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/comment/kate-bulkley/signs-of-zodiaks-next-move/5038124.article|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=Broadcast|date=2012-02-17}}</ref> It is headquartered in [[Paris]] and with other key offices in [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Milan]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Moscow]]. It is majority-owned by Italian conglomerate [[De Agostini]] and operates across the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|title=New Zodiak chief overseas expansion|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118049715|publisher=Variety|accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>

Following his appointment as CEO in July 2010, Frank rebranded Zodiak Entertainment as Zodiak Media and organised the group along geographical divisions to replace the acquired group brands ([[Marathon Media Group]], Magnolia, Zodiak Entertainment and RDF Media). He launched a “creativity and innovation unit” at the centre of the group to look for shows and formats with the best chance of becoming international hits. In 2011 Zodiak acquired UK comedy producer [[Bwark Productions]] (makers of hit TV series and movie [[The Inbetweeners]]). Under Frank, the group also made its first scripted series for a US broadcaster ([[Being Human (North American TV series)|Being Human]] for [[SyFy]] Channel). Frank also oversaw a $267m refinancing of the group's debt through a deal with a syndicate of international banks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|title=New Zodiak chief overseas expansion|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118049715|publisher=Variety|accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>

Frank informed majority owner De Agostini several months prior to his departure of his intent to leave Zodiak at the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Barry|title=David Frank leaving Zodiak, successor appointed|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/09/23/david-frank-leaving-zodiak-successor-appointed/|work=Kidscreen|date=2013-09-23}}</ref>

During his two decades in TV, Frank gained a reputation as an executive who, although driven by business, was capable of creating a very enjoyable working environment.<ref>{{cite news|title=INTERVIEW - Facts and figures|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/interview-fact-and-figures/1222840.article|work=Broadcast|date=1999-09-08|quote='don't take things too seriously,' Durkin says.}}</ref>
