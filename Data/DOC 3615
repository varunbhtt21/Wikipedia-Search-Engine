'''Emma Chadwick''', née '''Hilma Amalia Löwstädt''' (10 August 1855, [[Stockholm]] &ndash; 2 January 1932, [[Avignon]])<ref name=RKD/>, was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] painter who specialized in [[Genre art|genre]] scenes and portraits.

==Biography==
She was the granddaughter of {{ill|Carl Theodor Löwstädt|sv}}, a miniature painter and printmaker who was originally from Germany. Her father, {{ill|Rudolf Löwstädt|sv|lt=Rudolf}} was a master tailor. She began her artistic education at the [[Konstfack|Technical School]], then studied at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts]] from 1874 to 1880.<ref name=Riks>[http://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=10132 Emma HA Löwstädt Chadwick] in the Swedish biographical archives</ref> In 1881, after having spent the previous summers on the French coast, she went to Paris to finish her studies at the [[Académie Julian]] with [[Jean Charles Cazin]] and [[Tony Robert-Fleury]]. She had her first showing at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] her first year there.<ref name=Riks/> 

She eventually settled in at the Swedish artists' colony in [[Grez-sur-Loing]], where she met her husband, the American painter [[Francis Brooks Chadwick]]. They married and bought an inn there in 1887, which became a popular meeting place for the expatriate artists. Five years later, they built a villa on the same property. While living there, she travelled extensively, visiting Brittany with her friend, [[Amanda Sidwall]], and accompanying her husband on trips to Spain, North Africa, Italy, the United States and England. When an old friend from the Academy, [[Anders Zorn]], came to visit, he remarked that she was beginning to forget how to speak Swedish.

She also gradually switched from painting to etching and became a member of the {{ill|Grafiska sällskapet|sv}} (Graphic Society) when it was created in 1910.<ref name=RKD>[http://explore.rkd.nl/explore/artists/16229 Emma Chadwick] in the [[RKD]]</ref> She [[List of women artists exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition| exhibited]]   her work at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Palace of Fine Arts]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, Illinois and continued to participate in exhibits at the Salon until 1924.<ref name="Nichols">{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=K.
