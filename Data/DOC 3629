'''''[[Oryzomys peninsulae]]''''', also known as the Lower California rice rat, is a species of [[rodent]] from western Mexico. Restricted to the southern tip of the [[Baja California peninsula]], it is a member of the genus ''[[Oryzomys]]'' of family [[Cricetidae]]. Twenty-one specimens of ''O.&nbsp;peninsulae'' are known, caught in 1896 and 1906 at two locations about 13&nbsp;km (8&nbsp;mi) apart along the Río San José, a river in southernmost [[Baja California Sur]]. Río San José no longer exists, having fallen prey to irrigation projects, and touristic development of its estuary has resulted in pollution. Biologists working in the area in 1979 and from 1991 to 1993 failed to find ''O.&nbsp;peninsulae'', casting doubt on its continued existence. Medium in size for its genus, it was first described as a separate species, but later lumped into other widespread species until it was reinstated as separate in 2009. It is distinctive in fur color&mdash;grayish brown on the forequarters and reddish brown on the hindquarters&mdash;and in some dimensions of its skull ''(pictured)'', with a high [[braincase]], robust [[zygomatic arch]]es (cheekbones), and long [[incisive foramen|incisive foramina]] (perforations of the [[palate]] between the [[incisor]]s and the [[molar (tooth)|molars]]). {{TFAFULL|Oryzomys peninsulae}}
