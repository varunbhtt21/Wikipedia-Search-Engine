Melnotte managed [[Toole's Theatre]] and produced plays at the [[Royalty Theatre]], while at the same time she and Wyatt were building the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London. It opened on 10 September 1892 as the Trafalgar Square Theatre, with ''Wedding Eve'', and Melnotte retained ownership of this theatre until her death in 1935, with the exception of a five-year gap from 1928 to 1933. The theatre became known as the Trafalgar Theatre in 1894 and the following year became the Duke of York's to honour the future [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].<ref name=Who/>

In 1910 she built the [[Duke of York's Picture House, Brighton|Duke of York's Picture House]] in [[Brighton]], at a cost of £3000; it boasted all the latest amenities and comforts.

Eventually neither marriage nor adoption went ahead.<ref name=Free/><ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19340812-1.2.92.aspx "Romance Broken – Aged Theatre-Owner Changes Her Mind"], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 12 August 1934, p. 12</ref>
