'''[[Beppe Grillo]]''' (b. 1948) is an Italian comedian, actor, blogger and political activist who established the [[Five Star Movement]] in 2009. Born in [[Genoa]], Grillo became well-known as a comic through several television shows in the 1980s, but following jokes which attacked the corruption of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and its leader [[Bettino Craxi]] he was banned from television. Grillo continued to tour as a comedian while speaking out against corruption and banking scandals, and in 2005 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him a European hero.
