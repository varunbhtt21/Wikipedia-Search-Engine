Non-notable building fails GNG - one reference is a planning permit, the other the developer's website. Google search returns nothing of note. The Fatburger now appears to be closed, if that ever counted as a claim for notability [[User:Philg88|<span style="color:#3a23e2; font-weight:bold; text-shadow:grey 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em;">&nbsp;Philg88&nbsp;</span>]]<sup>♦[[User_talk:Philg88|talk]]</sup> 08:35, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Good article: let's keep it.[[User:Ipigott|Ipigott]] ([[User talk:Ipigott|talk]]) 16:48, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Notable building, sure many more sources exist in Mandarin.♦ [[User talk:Dr. Blofeld|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:#aba67e">''Dr. Blofeld''</span>]] 08:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' While a number of additional references have been added to the article, these all relate to tenants of the building and carry no weight per no inherited notability.[[User:Philg88|<span style="color:#3a23e2; font-weight:bold; text-shadow:grey 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em;">&nbsp;Philg88&nbsp;</span>]]<sup>♦[[User_talk:Philg88|talk]]</sup> 08:46, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
