*'''Support''' Lovely picture! Like the difference in texture - butterfly-stone, and the grey colour keeping it together. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 11:08, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' (having stumbled here from [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/The Impact of Wikipedia by Adrianne Wadewitz|my FPC discussion page]]). Beautiful and quite high quality. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:37, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' Good catch. I was feeling annoyed by the orange blur up left, but I decided I liked the photo nevertheless. Pity that the article on the species is a stub though. --[[User:Ebertakis|Ebertakis]] ([[User talk:Ebertakis|talk]]) 20:59, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::*''Comment'' Funny enough the orange blur is the thing that gives balace to the picture, it takes up the colour of the small patches on the butterfly, also gives the balance this picture needs, just cover it and look at the picture again.

:::* I even downloaded the image and used Gimp to eliminate the orange blur (I duplicated the layer and desaturated it *a lot*, then I painted the rest of the image back in). I also tried cropping it. I found that my eyes could concentrate more on the butterfly afterwards. Exactly because the blur has the same tone as the spots on the butterfly, my eyes keep jumping back and forth. I think that a "balance" effect would be the case if e.g. the out-of-focus orange spots were homogeneously distributed around the butterfly. Then again, nobody else is complaining, so I decided that this was just me, and I proceeded to support the image :-) --[[User:Ebertakis|Ebertakis]] ([[User talk:Ebertakis|talk]]) 23:04, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
