:'''keep''' - I am a believer that nothing on Wikipedia should only be described in text when it can easily (and without impairing the article) be shown. The inclusion of the "Alternative Cover" section of the infobox is meant for cases like as this when more than one main, official cover for a work exists. Since album covers are a purely visual medium no explanation, no matter how detailed, can instill in the reader the exact image in mind. Also as an article about a copy-written work no free alternative can exist, including the image with has been deemed similar, but not placed for deletion.21:45, 27 April 2014 (UTC)[[User:Danleary25|Danleary25]] ([[User talk:Danleary25|talk]])
::{{ping|Danleary25}}. Wikipedia is "the free encyclopedia" and has a strict [[WP:NFCC|set of rules]] for when non-free content is allowed. How does your argument, and the duplicated ones below, address this ?. Whether or not you believe it should be replaced with text, I am sure that reader's can look at one image, with a red surround, be told that the 1996 cover had a blue surround, and not walk away from the article with significant gaps in their understanding of the topic because they read the words "the 1996 cover had a blue surround rather than the red in the 2001 release" rather than saw two images. This article is on the '''album''' not the cover. The cover is not discussed in this, and any of the below nominations, by any sources in the article. I'm not going to address all of the duplicated comments you've made, but you largely said....there are two versions so we must have two covers.... This is not a compelling argument and has not held up to scrutiny in the past - [[User:Peripitus |Peripitus]] [[User talk:Peripitus|(Talk)]] 02:44, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I looked at each file, its corresponding article and its matching/similar file before pasting my argument. I only copied my argument on files for deletion where I thought the deletion is unnecessary, each for varying reasons. If you notice where I didn't copy the argument that was a case where I didn't feel the need to contest deletion. Admittedly, since each case is separate, some arguments are lesser than others, if I were to defend each one specifically. But my argument for saving any file here is fundamentally the same, hence the copy/paste.
:::Your particular argument that "This article is on the '''album''' not the cover" is something that I can not agree with because a cover is a fundamental part of most any album. More than most any other work of media the cover of a musical album is a direct reflection of the artistic expression of the artist. It is often chosen, created or at the very least overseen by the musical artist before publication. The cover is meant to work in tandem with the music contained within and to set an artistic feeling before the music is heard. Other artistic works like novels or movies do not have the same artistic significance with the cover or poster because this is often handled by the publisher or promotional department and not directly by the work's main artist(s). This being said, any article on Wikipedia about a modern music album (modern being approx. 1950s-present) '''is''' about the cover as much as it is about any other aspect of the album.
:::If the cover of an album is changed for some reason, then we're talking about a significant redirection for the initial artistic expression of the work as a whole, and I think that is something that should be properly expressed in the article. As a visual medium expressing it simply through words (in most cases) is not strong enough. Clearly, I'm not the first to think this since the Alternate Cover section for Album infobox exists.
:::Now, all this being said I admit that this argument is not as strong for this one in particular image: ([[:File:Swim (Feeder EP, original release - cover art).gif]]) and a few others below. But in particular the following files are ones I strongly contest deletion for the reasons I have mentioned: [[:File:OpenUpCensored.jpg]], [[:File:BurnThePriestst.jpg]], [[:File:Five Iron Frenzy End is Near cover.jpg]], [[:File:Marillion - marillion.co.uk (2005) Front Cover.jpg]], [[:File:Kula Shaker Peasants Pigs and Astronauts 10th Anniversary Edition Cover.JPG]], [[:File:Gorillaz Demon Days Japan.jpg]].[[User:Danleary25|Danleary25]] ([[User talk:Danleary25|talk]]) 06:24, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:'''keep''' - I am a believer that nothing on Wikipedia should only be described in text when it can easily (and without impairing the article) be shown. The inclusion of the "Alternative Cover" section of the infobox is meant for cases like as this when more than one main, official cover for a work exists. Since album covers are a purely visual medium no explanation, no matter how detailed, can instill in the reader the exact image in mind.
