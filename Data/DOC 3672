The '''British Virgin Islands general election, 1957''' was a general election held in the [[British Virgin Islands]] in 1957 for seats on the [[Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands]].  The election in 1957 is the election with the least recorded information at the Deputy Governor's office in the British Virgin Islands.  Even exact date of the election is not recorded.  Nor are the names of the candidates who stood, or is the exact vote tallies in each of the Districts.  There are no details of turnout, nor is it recorded who the supervisor of elections was.

The 1957 election is best remembered as the first election in which [[Lavity Stoutt]] stood and won.  It would prove to be the first of eleven consecutive electoral victories for Stoutt (a record) and he would sit in the Legislature for over 38 years consecutively (also a record, since surpassed by [[Ralph T. O'Neal|Ralph O'Neal]]) until his death, and would serve as [[Premier of the British Virgin Islands|Chief Minister]] a record five times.

==Results==
The Territory was divided into five districts, the largest of which (the 2nd District - [[Road Town]]) would have two members.  At the time candidates were not affiliated with [[political parties]].

Particulars of the members elected to the individual seats are not available for the 1957 general election.  It possible to ascertain the list of members elected from the historical record of individual members who served in the Legislature during that term,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |pages=47-63 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but not their actual seats.  However it is reasonable to infer the representatives for the various District seats on the basis that elected candidates most likely to have held the seats which they held in elections before and/or after the 1957 election.<ref>Howard Penn and Isaac Fonseca were elected in the 2nd District in both 1954 and in 1960; as did Leslie Malone with respect to the 4th District.  Lavity Stoutt was elected to the 1st District in 1960 (and in each subsequent year to 1995); as was Ivan Dawson with respect to the 3rd District.  Waldo O'Neal is assumed to have been elected in the 5th District by process of elimination.</ref>
