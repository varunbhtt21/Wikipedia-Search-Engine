'''[[HMS Hood (51)|HMS ''Hood'']]''' was a British [[battlecruiser]], the last such ship built for the [[Royal Navy]]. Constructed beginning in 1916, ''Hood'' was the only [[Admiral-class battlecruiser]] to be completed. She was commissioned in 1920 and used generally for showing-the-flag exercises until the onset of the Second World War. After a refit, ''Hood'' was sent back into service. On 24 May 1941, early in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], she was struck by several German shells and exploded; only three of the 1,418 crew members survived.
