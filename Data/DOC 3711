'''RRS ''Discovery''''' is a [[Royal Research Ship]] operated by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]]. The ship is the third such vessel to be built and named for [[RRS Discovery|the ship]] used by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] in his [[Discovery Expedition|1901-1904 expedition to the Antarctic]].

''Discovery'' was built as a replacement for the [[RRS Discovery (1962)|previous ''Discovery'']] in the "blue ocean" research role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noc.ac.uk/research-at-sea/ships/rrs-discovery-replacement/rrs-discovery-replacement-project |title=RRS Discovery Replacement Project |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=National Oceanography Centre |publisher= |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> The ship was ordered in 2010 from the [[:es:Freire Shipyard|C.N.P. Freire]] shipyard in [[Vigo]], and was launched in April 2012. ''Discovery'' was delivered to the NERC in the summer of 2013 for a period of sea trials prior to her planned initial deployment.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cooper |first=Edward |last2= |first2= |year=2012 |title=The future RRS ''Discovery'' |url=http://noc.ac.uk/f/content/downloads/2013/Ocean%20Challenge,%20Vol.%2019,%20Autumn%202012%20-%20The%20Future%20RRS%20Discovery%20Article.pdf |journal=Ocean Challenge |publisher=The Challenger Society for Marine Science  |volume= 19|issue= |pages=10–11 |doi= |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>

The ship is fitted with flexible laboratory spaces, allowing the laboratories to be tailored to the nature of the different scientific activities intended to take place on each cruise. ''Discovery'' is also fitted with an advanced hydroacoustic system in three major parts; a pair of major [[echosounder]]s plus a [[hydrophone]] are installed in a special "blister" installation on the ship's [[keel]], while she also carries a pair of "drop keels" containing more echosounders, hydrophones and [[CCTV]] cameras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noc.ac.uk/research-at-sea/ships/rrs-discovery|title=RRS ''Discovery'' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=National Oceanography Centre |publisher= |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> ''Discovery'' is also capable of operating the [[National Oceanography Centre]]'s [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROUV]] ''Isis''.
