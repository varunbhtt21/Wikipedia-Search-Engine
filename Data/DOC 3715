==History==
During the 19th Century [[British people|British]] naturalists made various studies about Botany along with other sciences. One of their interests was the finding of possibility of establishing [[Rubber]] yielding plants in [[Asia]]. They have used various Rubber yielding plants both in [[India]] and [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka). Some of them are Para Rubber ([[Hevea brasiliensis]]), Gutta percha ([[Palaquium gutta]]), Panama Rubber ([[Castilea elastica]]), Balatta ([[Mimusops globesa]]) and Lagos ([[Funtumia elastica]]). The British naturalists concentrated their trials to Ceylon due to the failure of Rubber trials in India and discovered that Ceylon offers the same envirionmental condition as that of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. 

1919 Rubber seedlings, collected from the Amazon forest, were imported from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and were planted at the Henerathgoda gardens in 1876. These Rubber plants were bloomed for the first time in 1881 and seeds obtained from it were exported to South India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Myanmar]]. In 1919 the world first Rubber exhibition was held at the [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya]]. 

At these times the garden was laid out and handled by Muhandiram A. De Zoysa under the supervision of the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya. The first Rubber tree was collapsed due to rain storm in 1988 and the remainings were now preserved as a national monument of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgci.org/garden.php?id=589|title=Gampaha Botanic Garden - Botanic Gardens Conservation International}}</ref>
