The '''Diamond Apartments''' are an apartment building located at 321 Diamond St. in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], [[California]]. Built in 1913 by Harry Meacham, the apartment complex was the first commercial building in the surrounding neighborhood. Architect Lovell Pemberton designed the [[Classical Revival architecture|Classical Revival]] building. The first floor of the building held commercial space; early businesses in the building included a furniture store, a laundromat, and a paint store. Developers demolished all but three of Redondo Beach's downtown commercial buildings in the 1960s, leaving the apartment complex as the city's second-oldest standing commercial building and the oldest which has maintained its historic integrity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dyan|first=Sandra|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Diamond Apartments|url={{NRHP url|id=92000260}}|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=April 25, 2014|date=July 10, 1991}} {{NRHP url|id=92000260|title=Accompanied by photos|photos=y}}.</ref>
