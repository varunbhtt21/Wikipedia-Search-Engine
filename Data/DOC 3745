== Plot ==
After stealing a student's one month of allowance, Eros Magdayo meets a girl named Eris Jane Trinidad, who claims that she is his guardian angel. Disbelieving her, Eros tries hard to get away from her, with no success. Eris tries to convince him further, stating that she is already dead and it is her mission to change Eros' bad ways within a month. She further states that if they are able to complete the mission, Eros will be granted a wish, and Eris will be given the chance to live again. Still not convinced by her, Eros returns to his family's home, a place he rarely visits because of his being an adopted child. Much to his dismay, Eris tries to come to his home, having no place to settle in, with his older step-sister Risa letting her stay inside. While lamenting about Risa's inevitable death due to her illness, he thinks about Eris' claim of being able to grant him a wish, and wanting to wish for his sister to be healed. Thus Eros goes along with Eris to try to finish her mission within a month so that he could be granted his wish while giving Eris a chance to live again.
