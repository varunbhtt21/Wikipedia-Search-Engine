The '''screw turbine''' is a [[water turbine]] which uses the principle of the [[Archimedean screw]] to convert the [[potential energy]] of water on an upstream level into [[Work (physics) | work]]. It may be compared to the [[water wheel]]. The turbine consists of a rotor in the shape of an Archimedean screw which rotates in a semicircular trough. Water flows into the turbine and its weight presses down onto the blades of the turbine, which in turn forces the turbine to turn. Water flows freely off the end of the turbine into the river. The upper end of the screw is connected to a generator through a gearbox.

== History ==
[[File:Turbina Archimedesa MEW Goryn.jpg|thumb|A screw turbine at a small hydro power plant in Goryn, Poland.]]
The Archimedean screw is an ancient invention, attributed to [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]] (287–212 BC.), and commonly used to raise water from a watercourse for [[irrigation]] purposes. In 1819 the French engineer Claude Louis Marie Henri Navier (1785–1836) suggested using the Archimedean screw as a type of water wheel. In 1916 William Moerscher applied for a U.S. patent on the hydrodynamic screw turbine.<ref>William Moerscher, Water-power system, {{US patent|1434138}}, granted Oct 31, 1922.</ref>

The Archimedean screw turbine is applied on rivers with a relatively low head (from 1&nbsp;m to 10&nbsp;m) and on low flows (0.01 m³/s up to around 10 m³/s on one turbine). Due to the construction and slow movement of the blades of the turbine, the turbine is considered to be friendly to aquatic wildlife. It is often labelled as "fishfriendly". The Archimedean turbine may be used in situations where there is a stipulation for the preservation and care of the environment and wildlife.
