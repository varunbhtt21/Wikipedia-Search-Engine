*'''Comment''' - Below minimum resolution. In 2006 this would have been amazing. In 2014...&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 09:55, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:*Then how about the alternate..?? <font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0em 0em 0.8em,#FF4500 -0.8em -0.8em 0.9em,#90EE90 0.7em 0.7em 0.8em;color:#696969"><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;color:black"><big>[[User:The Herald|The herald]]</big></span></font> 12:36, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::*That might be worth considering. However, note that the date should most certainly ''not'' the date it was uploaded, but the date it was created.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 00:08, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' <s>alt 1</s> '''Alt.2'''. But I actually think the colours and texture were a bit better on original. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 11:09, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:*{{ping|Hafspajen}} Can you please now specify which one you are supporting..?? Thank you.. <font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0em 0em 0.8em,#FF4500 -0.8em -0.8em 0.9em,#90EE90 0.7em 0.7em 0.8em;color:#696969"><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;color:black"><big>[[User:The Herald|The herald]]</big></span></font> 15:10, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::*Well, then it has to be alt 2. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 15:19, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''<s>Support alt 1</s>''' — But ditto re texture in orig. <small>(And I wonder if there isn't also wheat flour in the bread.)</small> [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 13:38, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' the white balance correction of the original with the resolution from alt 1 (a theoretical alt 2). WB is clearly too warm in the original (which isn't actually the original, it's a derivative... confusing). It should be relatively straight forward to do this, but I'm not in a position to at the moment.

:*{{ping|Diliff}}..How now..?? <font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0em 0em 0.8em,#FF4500 -0.8em -0.8em 0.9em,#90EE90 0.7em 0.7em 0.8em;color:#696969"><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;color:black"><big>[[User:The Herald|The herald]]</big></span></font> 16:44, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' alt 2 <strike>until what Diliff has suggested is done.</strike> Correctness isn't as important as believable. Yet, I think these are indeed correct now [[User:Saffron Blaze|Saffron Blaze]] ([[User talk:Saffron Blaze|talk]]) 15:58, 26 April 2014 (UTC) (edit) [[User:Saffron Blaze|Saffron Blaze]] ([[User talk:Saffron Blaze|talk]]) 22:16, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:*Its gonna be a mammoth task but how's the Alt.2...??<font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0em 0em 0.8em,#FF4500 -0.8em -0.8em 0.9em,#90EE90 0.7em 0.7em 0.8em;color:#696969"><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;color:black"><big>[[User:The Herald|The herald]]</big></span></font> 16:33, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' (having stumbled here from [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/The Impact of Wikipedia by Adrianne Wadewitz|my FPC discussion page]]), alt 1 or original, as part of a balanced Wikipedia diet. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:35, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:*{{ping|Cirt}}  How's Alt.2..?? <font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0em 0em 0.8em,#FF4500 -0.8em -0.8em 0.9em,#90EE90 0.7em 0.7em 0.8em;color:#696969"><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;color:black"><big>[[User:The Herald|The herald]]</big></span></font> 15:11, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::*Alt 2 is also tasty. Clearly you were bread well. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:32, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Good image, but with so much doubt as to the correct colour, I'm not sure I trust any of them. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])</sup></span> 21:51, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support ALT2'''. Lighting looks reasonable, resolution is up to par. Composition is lovely.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 01:28, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' — Transferring my support from Alt. 1 to '''Alt. 2.''' [[User:Sca|Sca]] ([[User talk:Sca|talk]]) 14:25, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
