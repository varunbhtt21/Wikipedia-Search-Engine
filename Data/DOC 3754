==Playing career==

===Early life and cricket at Rossall===
Goodwin was born in 1870 in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], at the time a mining town for iron ore, coal and limestone in Glamorgan, Wales. He was schooled in [[Lancashire]], attending Rossall School and playing cricket there. In these school matches he batted in the top order, scoring five and 16 against [[Loretto School]] on 7 June 1889 while batting at three. He also took a [[five-wicket haul]] with his bowling though his bowling style is not recorded, and he did not bowl during his [[first class cricket|first class career]].<ref name="capro">{{cite web | url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/29/29702/29702.html | title=Player Profile: Harry Goodwin | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/216/216574.html | title=Rossall School v Loretto School Loretto School in England 1889 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> On 21 June he played against [[Malvern College]] and scored 72 and 15 opening the batting, but did not bowl.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/415/415453.html | title=Malvern College v Rossall School Other matches in England 1889 | publisher=Cricket Archive | accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>
