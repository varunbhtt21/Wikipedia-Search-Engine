<small>5x expanded by [[User:Lajbi|Lajbi]] ([[User talk:Lajbi|talk]]). Self nominated at 09:56, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]]  Article was classified as a stub by bot, but has been reclassified as a C, which seemed more appropriate because it is useful for a casual reader. Article was recently expanded more than 5x, has more than 1500 characters, and has appropriate citations. I was able to slowly muddle through some of the sources and they are accepted in good faith. Hook is a good size and interesting. [[User:Mvblair|Mvblair]] ([[User talk:Mvblair|talk]]) 00:00, 6 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
