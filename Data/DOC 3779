'''''Raja Narasimha''''' ({{lang-kn|ರಾಜ ನರಸಿಂಹ}}) is a 2003 Indian [[Kannada language|Kannada]] romantic drama - action film directed by Muthyala Subbaiah and written by [[Posani Krishna Murali]]. The film stars [[Vishnuvardhan (actor)|Vishnuvardhan]]<ref>[http://www.vishnuvardhan.com/home.htm Vishnuvardhan film list]</ref> along with [[Ramya Krishnan]] and [[Raasi (actress)|Raasi]] in the prominent roles.<ref>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/kannada/movies/raja-narasimha/cast-crew.html Cast & crew]</ref> The film was produced by Medikonda Amaravathi under the Sri Venkataramana Productions banner.

The film released on 21 March 2003 to generally positive reviews from critics.<ref>[http://www.vishnuvardhan.com/rajaNaraSimha.htm Raja Narasimha - Review]</ref> However, the film failed commercially at the box office.

The same story was later used in the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] movie ''[[Palnati Brahmanayudu]]'' which released within two months of the release of this movie. The film starred [[Nandamuri Balakrishna]], [[Arti Agarwal]] and [[Sonali Bendre]] in lead roles. However, that movie added quite a few sequences  which were not in this movie - like the sequence of train moving in reverse gear - to suit the nativity.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/bonda/20030606.htm Overconfidence is Palnati Brahmanaidu's downfall]</ref>
