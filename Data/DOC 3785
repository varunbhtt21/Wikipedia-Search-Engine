Title : History of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region
Text : {{Politics of Syria}}
This article details the history of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]] of the Ba'ath Party (the [[Ba'ath Party|original one]] and that of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Syrian-dominated group]]).

==Founding and early years==
The Ba'ath Party was founded on 7 April 1947 by [[Michel Aflaq]]{{spaced ndash}}a Christian, [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]]{{spaced ndash}}a [[Sunni|Sunni Muslim]] and [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]]{{spaced ndash}}an [[Alawite]]. It was a merger of the [[Arab Ba'ath]], founded and led by al-Arsuzi, and the [[Arab Ba'ath Movement]], led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, which established the party.{{sfn|Tejel|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g4f54qsU618C&pg=PA149 149]}} The party initially was a vehicle for the national liberation movement against [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon|French rule in Syria and Lebanon]]. Soon after, the Ba'ath Party established itself as a critic of the perceived ideological inefficiencies of old [[Syrian nationalism]].{{sfn|Tejel|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g4f54qsU618C&pg=PA149 149]}} [[Pan-Arabism]] became popular among Arabs after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Jones|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3yflKU0MWoUC&pg=PA96 96]}}

Aflaq, the main originator of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] ideology, drew heavily from Islam and its values. He wrote that the time of [[Muhammad]] represented the ideal Arab community and that the Arabs had fallen under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Europeans. ''Ba'ath'' means ''restoration'', and the party's programme called for Arab restoration through modernisation. The most important influence upon Alfaq and al-Bitar was European socialism, which became the basis of their [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Jones|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3yflKU0MWoUC&pg=PA97 97]}}

The party was formally established at its founding congress under the name ''Arab Ba'ath Party''. According to the congress, the party was "nationalist, populist, socialist, and revolutionary" and believed in the "unity and freedom of the Arab nation within its homeland." The party opposed the theory of class conflict, but supported the nationalisation of major industries, the unionisation of workers, land reform, and supported private inheritance and private property rights to some degree.{{sfn|Kostiner|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YQb1Ilj2U7EC&pg=PA36 36]}} Party membership increased from around 100 to 4,500 by the early 1950s; most members were either teachers or students. The Ba'ath Party merged with the [[Arab Socialist Movement|Arab Socialist Party]] (ASP), led by [[Akram al-Hawrani]], to establish the ''Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party'' in Lebanon following [[Adib Shishakli]]'s rise to power. The merger gave the Ba'ath movement its first peasant constituency; the ASP's stronghold was [[Hama]].{{sfn|George|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&pg=PA66 66–67]}} Most ASP members did not adhere to the merger and remained, according to George Alan, "passionately loyal to Hawrani's person."{{sfn|George|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&pg=PA67 67]}} The merger was so weak that the ASP's original infrastructure remained intact. With the rise of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in Egypt and Arab nationalism, the Ba'ath Party grew rapidly. In 1955, the party decided to support Nasser and his pan-Arab policies.{{sfn|George|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&pg=PA67 67]}}

==Elections, the UAR and factionalism: 1954–1961==
[[File:Hawrani Aflaq 1957.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Akram al-Hawrani]] (left) with [[Michel Aflaq]] as seen in 1957.]]

Syrian politics took a dramatic turn in 1954 when the military government of [[Adib al-Shishakli]] was overthrown and the democratic system restored. The Ba'ath, now a large and popular organisation, won 15 out of 142 parliamentary seats in the [[1954 Syrian parliamentary election|Syrian election]] that year, becoming the second-largest party in parliament. Most of the new members of parliament were independents. The Ba'ath Party was one of the most organised parties in parliament, rivaled only by the [[Syrian Communist Party]] (SCP) and the [[People's Party (Syria)|People's Party]]. The SCP and the Ba'ath Party were the only parties able to organise mass protests among workers.{{sfn|Peretz|1994|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=UqfHROAUevsC&pg=PA413 413]}}

The Ba'ath Party was supported by the intelligentsia because of their pro-Egyptian and anti-imperialist stance and their advocation of social reform.{{sfn|Finer|Stanley|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4lhgDBDWw3AC&pg=PA149 149]}} The Ba'ath faced considerable competition from ideological enemies, notably the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] (SSNP), which supported the establishment of a [[Greater Syria]]. The Ba'ath Party's main adversary was the SCP, whose support for class struggle and internationalism was anathema to the Ba'ath.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=[https://books.google.no/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA211 211]}} All these parties competed with each other and [[Islamist]]s in street-level activity and sought support among the military.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA210 210–211]}}

The assassination of Ba'athist colonel [[Adnan al-Malki]] by a member of the SSNP in April 1955 allowed the Ba'ath Party and its allies to launch a crackdown, thus eliminating one rival. In 1957, the Ba'ath Party partnered with the SCP to weaken the power of Syria's conservative parties. By the end of that year, the SCP weakened the Ba'ath Party to such an extent that in December the Ba'ath Party drafted a bill calling for a union with Egypt, a move that was very popular. The union between Egypt and Syria went ahead and the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR) was created, and the Ba'ath Party was banned in the UAR because of Nasser's hostility to parties other than his own. The Ba'ath leadership dissolved the party in 1958, gambling that the legalisation of certain parties would hurt the SCP more than it would the Ba'ath.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp= [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA211 211–212]}}

Meanwhile, a small group of Syrian Ba'athist officers stationed in Egypt watched the party’s poor position and the increasing fragility of the union with alarm. They formed a secret military committee whose initial members were Lieutenant-Colonel [[Muhammad Umran]], Major [[Salah Jadid]] and Captain [[Hafez al-Assad]]. At first, the committee did not play a political role in the Ba'athist movement; its unclear whether leading Ba'athist officials knew of the Military Committee's existence before the [[8th of March Revolution]].{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KqR5eFb3xGsC&pg=PA25 25]}}

A military coup in Damascus in 1961 brought the UAR to an end.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA52 52–53]}} Sixteen prominent politicians, including al-Hawrani and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]]{{spaced ndash}}who later retracted his signature, signed a statement supporting the coup.{{sfn|Podeh|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=F9GsyTmJZYwC&pg=PA152 152–153]}} The Ba'athists won several seats during the [[1961 Syrian parliamentary election|1961 parliamentary election]].{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA52 52–53]}}

==Revolution and the 1966 split: 1962–1966==

The secession from the UAR was a time of crisis for the party; several groups, including al-Hawrani, left the Ba'ath Party. al-Hawrani formally resigned on 20 June 1962 and re-established the ASP, but his popular appeal had weakened over the years, and the ASP's only electoral stronghold was the [[Hama Governorate]].{{sfn|Moubayed|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&pg=PA249 249]}} In 1962, Aflaq convened a congress which re-established the Ba'ath Party.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=[https://books.google.no/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA55 55]}} The division in the original Ba'ath Party between the National Command led by [[Michel Aflaq]] and the “regionalists” in the Syrian party stemmed from the break-up of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Aflaq had sought to control the regionalist elements{{spaced ndash}}an incoherent grouping led by Fa'iz al-Jasim, Yusuf Zuayyin, Munir al-Abdallah and Ibrahim Makhus. The regionalists hailed from towns in the Syrian periphery, where local Ba'ath Party structures had not dissolved during the years of union with [[Nasser]].{{sfn|Rabinovich|1972|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KqR5eFb3xGsC&pg=PA36 36–39]}} Aflaq retained the support of the majority of the non-Syrian National Command members (13 at the time).{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3D5FulN2WqQC&pg=PA34 34]}}

Aflaq convened the Fifth Congress in [[Homs]]. Al-Hawrani was not invited; cells that had defied Aflaq's orders and remained active, and Ba'athists who become Nasserists during the period of the UAR, were not invited to the congress. Aflaq was re-elected the National Command's Secretary General, and ordered the re-establishment of the Syrian-regional Ba'ath organisation. During the congress, Aflaq and the Military Committee, through [[Muhammad Umran]], made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'état, which Aflaq supported.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&pg=PA75 75]}} The Military Committee did not show itself to the civilian wing of the party at this congress.{{sfn|George|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&pg=PA68 68]}}
 
Following the success of the [[Ramadan Revolution|February 1963 coup d'état]] in Iraq, led by the Ba'ath Party's [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi cell]], the Military Committee hastily convened to plan a coup against [[Nazim al-Kudsi]]'s presidency. The coup{{spaced ndash}}dubbed the [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|8th of March Revolution]]{{spaced ndash}}was successful and a Ba'athist government was installed in Syria.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&pg=PA76 76–78]}} The plotters' first order was to establish the [[National Council of the Revolutionary Command]] (NCRC), which consisted entirely of Ba'athists and Nasserists, and was controlled by military personnel rather than civilians.{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&pg=PA78 78]}}

While the Ba'ath Party had attained power, it experienced problems with internal infighting. The Military Committee, which was a tiny minority of the already small Ba'ath Party membership, was forced to rule by force. The Ba'ath Party, which had only 2,500 members by mid-1963, lacked a popular base. [[Hanna Batatu]] called the period from 1963 to 1970 the "Transitional Ba'ath";{{sfn|George|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&pg=PA68 68–69]}} she wrote that the "Old Ba'ath" was removed and was replaced with the "Neo Ba'ath" led by [[Salah Jadid]] and [[Hafez al-Assad]] in 1966.{{sfn|George|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&pg=PA68 68–69]}}

The civilian wing was riven with infighting between the radical socialist and moderate factions, while the military was more unified. The [[Syrian Regional Command]] slowly amassed powers by weakening the National Command, culminating in the [[1966 Syrian coup d'état]]. According to Batatu, the power struggle was not ideological in character:{{sfn|George|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFdbVVcKsSIC&pg=PA69 69]}} <blockquote>The internal party discords were never purely sectarian or purely regional in character... Often personal factors or aspirations for sheer power were at play. Ideological affinities had some role but do not appear to have been decisive. To be sure, the labels 'leftists' and 'rightists' were freely tossed about. But the political conduct of the period's central figure, Salah Jadid, did not point to a clear or consistent ideological commitment."</blockquote>

Jadid served as the Assistant Secretary of the Regional Command of the party in Syria, while General [[Amin Hafiz]] served as Regional Secretary. al-Hafiz removed Jadid as the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, which forced Jadid to concentrate on building a support base within the party. On 21 December 1965 the National Command dissolved the Syrian Regional Command and on 18 February 1966, Aflaq denounced the Jadid group as a regional separatist deviation. A [[coup d'état]] took place on 23 February 1966, the bloodiest coup Syria had experienced since 1949. Jadid and the Syrian Regional Command, backed by army units under their control, seized power.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA59 59–60]}} Other leaders of the coup were Hafez al-Assad{{spaced ndash}}an Alawite general, and [[Nureddin al-Atassi]].{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA55 55]}} The new rulers of Syria expelled the former members of the National Command from the party and from Syria. Aflaq and Bitar were released from jail and went into exile shortly after the coup.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA59 59–60]}} This effectively split the Ba'ath Party National Command in two: one based in Syria, the other in Iraq.{{sfn|Hauss|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=18AaF51eXHUC&pg=PA410#v=onepage&q&f=false 410]}} In Syria, Ba'athist civilian politicians were made leaders of state institutions; Atassi became President, Yusuf Zuayyin became Prime Minister and Ibrahim Makhus became Minister for Foreign Affairs. Jadid sought to avoid suspicions against a military dictatorship and did not formally join the government. During an attempted coup in September 1966, Jadid formed "Workers Battalions", inspired by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] of the People's Republic of China, to defend the government.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA59 59–60]}}

==Assad Era: 1970–present==
After the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], tensions between Jadid and Al-Assad increased, and al-Assad and his associates were strengthened by their hold on the military. In late 1968,{{sfn|Seale|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&pg=PA142 142]}} they began dismantling Jadid's support network, facing ineffectual resistance from the civilian branch of the party that remained under Jadid's control.{{sfn|Seale|1990|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D9EiJKRTHcC&pg=PA149–150 149–150]}} This duality of power persisted until the [[Corrective Movement (Syria)|Corrective Revolution]] of November 1970, when al-Assad ousted and imprisoned Atassi and Jadid. He then set upon a project of rapid institution-building, reopened parliament and adopted a permanent constitution for the country, which had been ruled by military fiat and a provisional constitutional documents since 1963.{{sfn|Federal Research Division|2004|p=[https://books.google.no/books?id=B9L9ZWtnYsgC&pg=PA213 213]}}

===8th Regional Congress: 1985–2000===
The 8th Regional Congress (held 5–20 January 1985), the last held under the stewardship of Hafez al-Assad, elected the Central Committee, which in turn elected the 21-strong Regional Command.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=435}} Due to the [[Centralized government|centralized nature of Syrian politics]], Hafez al-Assad did not hold another Regional Congress so as to undermine the potential of other senior party leaders of establishing their own independent power bases.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=362}} While the Central Committee was active from 1985 to 2000, it rarely met and was used as a tool to [[rubber stamp]] decisions.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=362}}

At the congress, Bashar emphasized that "the party does not own the state", and stated that the Prime Minister and the government should be independent from the party.<ref name="baathbashar"/> The congress also discussed the possibility of introducing the [[market economy]] in Syria.<ref name="baathbashar"/> It was eventually decided that the "[[social market economy]]" would be introduced, while at the same time introducing safeguards so that Syria would not be engulfed in the global [[capitalism|capitalist system]].<ref name="baathbashar"/> However, it was decided at the Regional Congress that both the Prime Minister and the speaker of parliament had to be members of the Regional Command, hence weakening the officeholder's respective powers.<ref name="baathbashar"/> The congress discussed the possibility of changing the party's name from the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party to either the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in the Syrian Region, to downplay the party's Arab nationalist credentials, or to the Democratic Ba'ath Party, downplaying the party's socialist credentials.<ref name="baathbashar"/>{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} There were even some who recommended changing the party's slogan from "unity, liberty, socialism" to "unity, democracy, social justice", so as to strengthen the party's democratic appeal.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} Some even floated the idea of defining the party as a “democratic socialist national [pan-Arab] political organization which struggles for achieving the great goals of the Arab Nation for Unity, Freedom and Socialism,” based on “the principles of citizenship and democracy and respect of human rights and implementation of justice among citizens.”{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} At last, there were talks of dissolving both the Regional and National Commands and replace it with a proposed Party Command, so as to make Bashar al-Assad the party's Secretary General.<ref name="baathbashar"/>

Up to the 10th Regional Congress, it was rumoured that Bashar al-Assad was a closet reformer who sought to introduce a market economy and [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic thoughts]] into Syria.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} For those who believed these rumours the 10th Regional Congress was a disappointment.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} The party's doctrine was not changed, but downplayed and were reduced to slogans.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} Mention of Arab unity in the Ba'athi constitution is mentioned once, in passing, and the demand that other Arab countries undergo a revolution to introduce socialism was removed.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} In general, the 10th Regional Congress reversed the trend of strengthening the party, and the party again became an institution to control the public.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=388}} A central motif at the congress was the need to "re-activate" the party, however, while dully supported at the congress, there are no signs that the party has become more active or dynamic.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=389}} The congress officially supported further democratization of society, the separation of the party from government to certain degrees, economic reform, and an anti-corruption campaign.{{sfn|Bar|2006|p=389}}

Today, apart from the party branch of the security forces, all branches of the Baath, whether at the governorate or district level, are nonoperational. They are no longer able to lead the political process, report to the Regional Command concerning the situation on the ground, or provide economic and social information.
