[https://www.webcitation.org/6P60ziYL8 Archived here.]</ref> Tamsen was an expert in the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Transvaal|stamps of Transvaal]], about which he researched and wrote, and he was one of the founders in 1894 of the [[Johannesburg Philatelic Society]].

==Early life==
Tamsen was born in Naby, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], on 2 January 1862, at that time part of Denmark.<ref>"Emil Tamsen – Dane" by Ebbe Rask in Letters, ''Gibbons Stamps Monthly'', October 1982, p. 83.</ref> He was the son of Franz August Tamsen and Friedericke Schuffman.<ref name=Ancestry />

He emigrated to South Africa as a teenager and during the [[First Boer War]] (1880–81), he fought for the British and was part of the garrison that held [[Pretoria]].<ref name=notable/> He was discharged in 1883, and moved to the [[Waterberg District Municipality|Waterberg area]] of the Northern Transvaal. On arrival, he found there were only 25 families in the area and only two houses at [[Modimolle|Nylstroom]] where he settled.<ref name=GSM>''Rhodesia: The British South Africa Company first provisional issue 1892'' by E. Kenneth Wright in ''[[Gibbons Stamp Monthly]]'', July 1982, pp. 51–55.</ref> He became a naturalised citizen of the [[South African Republic]] (the Transvaal Republic or ZAR).<ref name=notable/>

==Stamp dealing and collecting==
[[File:Stamp Transvaal 1885 2p.jpg|right|thumb|An 1885 stamp of Transvaal.]]
Tamsen was a friend of the [[Boer]] leader [[Paul Kruger]], and he farmed and traded, but his main interests lay in stamp dealing and collecting where he was able to exploit the international interest in the stamps of Southern Africa in the 1880s and 90s. Stamps were issued in the period by [[Postage stamps and postal history of British Bechuanaland|British Bechuanaland]] and [[Postage stamps and postal history of Bechuanaland Protectorate|Protectorate]], [[Postage stamps and postal history of British Central Africa|British Central Africa]], the [[British South Africa Company]], [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Postage stamps and postal history of Natal|Natal]], [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Orange Free State|Orange Free State]], [[Postage stamps and postal history of Swaziland|Swaziland]], Transvaal, and [[Postage stamps and postal history of Zululand|Zululand]].

Despite the vast area covered, Tamsen was ideally positioned, either personally or through agents, to obtain information about new stamps. These included many surcharged and [[Provisional stamp|provisional]] issues and Tamsen obtained them either mint or by having them posted to him on [[Cover (philately)|cover]].<ref name=GSM/> He was friends with [[Friederich Jeppe]], the first [[Postmaster General]] of the Transvaal<ref>[http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/philatelicrecord1818lond "Philately in the Mags"] in ''The Philatelic Record and Stamp News'', Vol. 18, June 1896, pp. 165–170.</ref> who also introduced adhesive stamps there, and [[Isaac van Alphen]], Postmaster General during the Second Republic.<ref>"The Transvaal – A Challenge" by Alan Drysdall in ''Gibbons Stamp Monthly'', June 1997, pp. 47–49. [http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/town/terrace/ymw18/transvl/study%20circle/challnge.html Reproduced here] and [https://www.webcitation.org/6P8D7K5UM here.]</ref> He bought the contents of the [[dead letter office]] and "in ransacking the contents he added treasure after treasure to his collection".<ref name=notable>[http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/philatelicrecord22190lond "Notable Philatelists: Mr. Emil Tamsen"] in ''The Philatelic Record'', Vol. 22, November 1900, p. 246.</ref>

==Auctions==
The success of Tamsen's activities may be gauged by the fact that he sold over £7000 worth of stamps in London between 1899 and 1905, which represented only part of his collection and stock,<ref name=GSM/> a figure that would equate in 2014 terms to around £6-700,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} He did this while living in a remote area of the [[veld]]t and during a time which included the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).

The war may have helped stimulate interest in Transvaal stamps. The first Tamsen auction sale was by Ventom, Bull and Cooper of [[Old Jewry]], London, on 26 October 1899.<ref name=GSM/> ''[[The Philatelic Record|The Philatelic Record and Stamp News]]'' reported that competition was brisk and: "The war has made sales of South Africans, particularly Transvaals and Orange Free States, very lively, one dealer in the Strand has been completely cleared out of current Transvaals."<ref>[http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/philatelicreco211899lond "Echoes from the Mart"] in ''The Philatelic Record and Stamp News'', Vol. 21, December 1899, p. 232.</ref> The second Tamsen sale was through the same auctioneers 9–10 January 1900 and included fine Cape triangulars. His Bechuanaland was sold on 10 May 1900 through the same firm.

==Writing==
Tamsen was a regular writer for ''Stanley Gibbons Monthly Journal'' and its successor ''Gibbons Stamp Weekly'', both predecessors of the current ''[[Gibbons Stamp Monthly]]''. He wrote of the latest stamp finds in the Transvaal and elsewhere in Southern Africa, and gave reports on the health, or otherwise, of philatelic societies in the region. In November 1904 he wrote from Nylstroom that it was not easy to report on current philatelic events when the nearest collector lived 100 miles away.<ref>"Transvaal Notes" by Emil Tamsen in ''Gibbons Stamp Weekly'', January 1905, pp. 31–32.</ref>

*''From cover to cover''. Privately produced and circulated, 1940. (With Park Smith)

==Personal life==
Tamsen married Clara Pauline Richter (1866–1963) and they had a son, Adolph Carl Tamsen (1892–1961).<ref name=Ancestry /> He was a freemason.<ref>"[https://issuu.com/hermanpienaar/docs/philatelist_apr2016 The Evolution of Stamp Dealing in South Africa]", Paul van Zeyl, ''[[The South African Philatelist]]'', Vol. 92, No. 2 (April 2016), Whole No. 935, pp. 49-53.</ref> Tamsen died on 30 July 1957 in Pretoria.<ref name=Ancestry />
