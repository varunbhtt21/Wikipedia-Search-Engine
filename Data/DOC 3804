The Historic Toy Museum in [[Freinsheim]] (''Historisches Spielzeugmuseum Freinsheim'') in [[Germany]] is a private collection of old [[toy]]s.

==Exhibition==

The exhibits date from the time of the Industrial Revolution around 1890 to the Second World War. Most of them are products by the firm of Bing in [[Nuremberg]] (''[[Bing (company)|Bing]] Werke Nürnberg''). The museum curator is Marion Groll. The collection by Uwe Groll was the basis for the private museum opened on 2 April 2011. This collection originally concentrated on model railways and accessories of [[0 Gauge]] from the House of Bing. Over the course of years Groll became so fascinated by the firm’s history and the variety of their products, that the collection  grew ever wider.
