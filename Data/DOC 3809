Do we need to different version of this logo? [[:File:PTV Awards logo.jpg]] appears to be oversized and should possibly be replaced with [[:File:PTV Awards.jpg]] in [[17th PTV Awards]]. [[:File:PTV Awards logo.jpg]] also violates [[WP:NFCC#10c]] in [[17th PTV Awards]]. -- [[User:Toshio Yamaguchi|'''<span style="color:black;">Toshio</span>''']] [[User talk:Toshio Yamaguchi|'''<span style="color:black;">Yamaguchi</span>''']] 12:47, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:I've gone ahead and deleted the overly large "logo.jpg" image and replaced that with the smaller version and added a rationale for that. That said, I do agree that the use of this logo (for the specific ceremony) is not appropriate for the main PTV Award page. Normally we use an image of the award (this being what they are holding on the left here [http://showbizspice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/457615_413878001988380_1544431289_o.jpg]) for this space. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 14:25, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

Given that it appears that it was first published in 1843 wouldnt this fall out of copyright? [[User:Werieth|Werieth]] ([[User talk:Werieth|talk]]) 12:56, 16 April 2014 (UTC)

This appears to be a photograph of a textbook or educational poster; it's a table of Kannada characters. As Kannada has about 40 million native speakers, is an official language in India, and is widely researched, I doubt it's impossible to find or make a free alternative to this table; so I feel it fails [[WP:NFCCP|NFCC criterion 1]].

At minimum, the use on [[18XX]] seems fair if the free mock-up is not considered a proper replacement, but the use on [[18XX games]] is not appropriate. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 16:38, 18 April 2014 (UTC)

Non-free images are only allowed if "No free equivalent exists, or could be created."

See also: [[Talk:Heartbleed#xkcd explains Heartbleed]].    As much as I would like to keep this image in the [[Heartbleed]] article, policy says it can't stay.  Of course, the best resolution would be for the artist to re-license this with a Commons-compatible license.

::Hrrrm. I would say that it just passes NFCC#8 by that, but editors should be aware that could be challenged in the future (eg GA/FA/FFD). The statements by SciAm and Engadget aren't so much about Heartbleed but about how XKCD helps to simplify the concept, and thus part of the strips reception, but that's more my opinion. But it also serves to simplify the explanation of the bug. As such, it could be kept for the time being, I just don't know if it is needed in the long run. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 19:21, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

I tend to be a NFCC dove, but I don't see a justification here. I like the XKCD strips and wish we could use them in many articles, but there is no ''need'' to use it in this article. Also this image was made at reduced resolution, presumably to make it more acceptable, but as is it is illegible and therefore pretty much useless.--[[User:ArnoldReinhold|agr]] ([[User talk:ArnoldReinhold|talk]]) 14:21, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

: If published before 1923, it is PD.

: It meets [[WP:NFCC#8]] for [[1953 Pennsylvania Railroad train wreck]], although I would agree that it's much weaker in the other cases. Strangely [[1953 Pennsylvania Railroad train wreck]] is the sole article that Werieth removed this image from. It would meet #8 for [[PRR 4876]] because if this ''individual'' locomotive meets [[WP:N]], that's presumably for its involvement in the accident (and thus NFCC#8 can be  met). If 4876 is only notable for being the preserved example of this class, then I agree that's a weaker case â€“ but still possible.   For the two "class" articles, we would have to show that this accident is important to the overall history of each, and that this article both covers that accident, and makes justifiable use of this image to do so.

I do beg the question of use at the PRR 4876, in part that how that article constructed is poorly done - the bulk of that content should be at the train wreck article - the PRR article should only have about a paragraph to explain that this is why this engine is notable, but the details of the wreck are fully described elsewhere. The wreck is important to mention on the Federal Express route page, but I don't see the need for the picture when the details of the wreck are linked to, and there was no apparent "impact" on the route (it continued to run until 1971).  Similarly on the GG1 page - the wreck didn't impact the use of that class, so there's no need for that image there as long as the wreck page is used. So to be clear: the use of the wreck page is fine, I am not sure on the actual engine page, but it definitely fails NFCC#8 on the route and class pages. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 18:15, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

I propose that [[:File:Hillary.png]] falls well below the threshold of originality, as it is merely an exceedingly common arrangement of public domain elements. Really, any campaign poster assembling the well-worn motif of a flag-banner and a candidates name and some contact info should be considered PD, but this is a pretty stark example of such a display.

:::::::It is an edge case, I will admit.  If the "3 stars and 3 bars" itself is proven to be in the public domain due to age, it's a fairly easy to stretch to say the entire sign is.  Why?  Because if the campaign sign had a plain rectangle instead of the "stars and bars" art, the whole sign would easily be recognized as PD-simple.  If the "stars and bars" is PD due to age, then I can't see how the campaign sign as a whole could receive a new copyright.  As for Monderian's works, there were many, many rectangles in his works. If Monderian did a work that consisted of nothing but one rectangle overlaying another of the same color (and with the overlayed area being the background color) I would argue that the resulting work would be "pd-simple."  Once you start adding more rectangles, it's harder and harder to claim "pd-simple" and easier and easier to claim an enforceable copyright.

::::::::It's not the fundamental "stars and stripes", it is how it is "waving" that is a unique shape. If it was a straight-up rectangle with the starts and stripes, it would be PD. If it was a simple bend, like an arc, same thing. But the waving effect is just questionable enough we can't dump it off as PD readily. I do agree this is an edge case, I'm probably taking a cautious edge to this, but that's how we should take these edge cases. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 02:58, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

These flag images have been blanked from [[List of Australian flags]].  As discussed at [[Talk:List of Australian flags#Omitted flags]], I believe they meet the criteria at [[WP:NFCCP]] and should be included to illustrate the flags being listed in the article, rather than rely on descriptions of the flags and links to other articles which depict the flags; my reasons are set out in detail there.  Another editor, [[User:Werieth|Werieth]], disagrees, although the reasons given do not seem to match up with the policy criteria.

</li></ol></div>
::::My view is that the images significantly increase readers' understanding of the article (i.e., a list of flags) and their omission would be detrimental to that understanding.  The images aid the reader to recognise the flags being discussed.  Relying on the descriptions is a poor substitute: "A five-pointed star and traditional headdress in white, on a blue, green and black background" does not adequately explain the arrangement of the elements, the fact that the background colours appear as stripes, the direction/size/order of the stripes, or the design of the stylised headdress, and thus is inadequate in representing the flag accurately; a more detailed description would be more cumbersome and lose the succinctness the current description affords.  Likewise, the link to another article which shows the image is a poor substitute for the image itself in an article whose specific purpose is to list flags: the inclusion of the image aids the comparison of flags in the list and allows the reader to quickly scroll through the list to find an image they may have in their mind that they are looking for; without the image, the reader must navigate between multiple articles to make comparisons and must stop to read the descriptions for the hidden flags to see if they might resemble the image they have in their mind of a flag they are looking for.

::::::If NFLISTS is the issue, then why has NFCC been repeatedly stated as the issue?  Note that NFCC is a policy whereas NFLISTS is a guideline, and [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|policies generally take precedence over guidelines]].  In any case, NFLISTS does not state any definitive prohibitions but rather preferences on how images should be used, and the stated examples referring to television shows, art styles, depictions of aliens, etc., do not correlate well with flag designs.  For example:
<div style="margin-left: 9.6em; border: solid 2px #1e90ff; padding-left: .7em; padding-right: .7em"><ol start="4"><li>If another non-free image of an element of an article is used elsewhere within Wikipedia, referring to its other use is preferred over repeating its use on the list and/or including a new, separate, non-free image. If duplicating the use of a non-free image, please be aware that a separate non-free fair use rationale must be supplied for the image for the new use.</li></ol></div>
::::::Presumably this is ''now'' the argument used for the flags not being included in the list.  However, the second sentence implies that an image can be used on a list page if there is a justifiable fair use rationale specific for that page.  There is such a rationale on the various image pages and the justification is set out in more detail in my reasoning above.  I'm not convinced that flags under copyright cannot be included in lists of flags, but if that's the consensus, then I'll let it go.   <small>â€”'''[[User:sroc|sroc]]'''&nbsp;[[User talk:sroc|&#x1F4AC;]]</small> 15:44, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::NFLISTS is a guideline that encompasses the concerns of NFCC#1, #3a and #8 together. Note that providing the second non-free rational (it is not "fair use", we are more strict than that) is a minimum requirement but sufficient for the image, but that's a trivial part here.

{{od|9}}Sorry, I'm not entirely sure I follow you, nor that NFLISTS was meant to be applied so rigidly.

I just realised that the rationale was missing at [[:File:Flag of the Torres Strait Islanders.svg]] so I have now included it as follows:

{{Non-free image rationale
|Article           = List of Australian flags
|Purpose           = 
*The image significantly increase readers' understanding of the article and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding. The image aids the reader to recognise the flag.
*A description alone would not adequately and accurately represent the flag as a substitute for the image.  The current description in the article ("A five-pointed star and traditional headdress in white, on a blue, green and black background") does not adequately explain: the arrangement of the elements; the fact that the background colours appear as stripes; the direction, size and order of the stripes; the design of the stylised headdress.  Thus, the description is inadequate in representing the flag accurately.  A more detailed description would be less succinct, more cumbersome and would likely still fail to describe the flag (including the shape of the headdress) precisely
*A link to the [[Torres Strait Islander Flag]] article would be a poor substitute for including the image itself in an article whose specific purpose is to list flags.  The inclusion of the image aids the comparison of flags in the list and allows the reader to quickly scroll through the list and visually scan the flag images.  This may assist the reader to find an image that they are looking for.  Otherwise, the reader would either need to stop and read the detailed (yet imprecise) descriptions of missing flags to assess whether it might resemble the flag they are looking for; or alternatively, navigate between multiple articles to make comparisons, which undermines the utility of the article.
|Replaceability    = Irreplaceable. Any other image would not accurately represent the flag
}}

Is this rationale sufficient to justify the inclusion of the image?  Conversely, what is the rationale behind limiting such use?  I could understand limiting the number of articles a particular photograph is used in (since this would be monotonous, other photographs could usually be sourced, and not all uses may be justifiable), but in this case, this use of the flag is pertinent to the article and its omission would be detrimental.  <small>â€”'''[[User:sroc|sroc]]'''&nbsp;[[User talk:sroc|&#x1F4AC;]]</small> 17:27, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

:It's not so much the rationale, it's the fact that this is a list article, and thus there's little context given that ''requires'' the reader to see the flags as per NFCC#8. On the separate articles about the flags, then the use is clearly appropriate, but not in navigation lists like this is. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 00:23, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

::I disagree.  As I argued above, the images are important to the readers' understanding of the article in identifying the flags and understanding what they look like.  Although this list only summarises the purpose of each flag, this is discussion of the flags that benefits from the image being there.  Without the flag images, the article might as well be removed and replaced with a category with links to individual articles{{snd}}but the article is more than merely a list; it is organised and provides descriptions of what each flag is used for, grouped together with similar flags used for related purposes, which provides context.
::For example, take the [[Torres Strait Islander Flag]], which I dare say many Australians have seen but may not necessarily know what it is called or exactly what purpose it serves, especially in parts of the mainland where Torres Strait Islanders are few and far between.  Such readers might come to the [[List of Australian flags]] article hoping to find it, but they don't see it.  If they stop to read the description of each flag and are lucky enough to recognise that the description for this flag ("A five-pointed star and traditional headdress in white, on a blue, green and black background") refers to the image they have in their head, they might click on the link; but they probably won't know just from sight that the dominant stylised image represents a headdress (I didn't, despite having seen the flag many times) and they may not recall from memory which colours were used, so the description alone would not be enough.  They would recognise the image in an instant but may be lost without it.  <small>â€”'''[[User:sroc|sroc]]'''&nbsp;[[User talk:sroc|&#x1F4AC;]]</small> 04:29, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

Blatant failure of NFCC, this is covering a generic topic and using a large number of non-free files is not justified, as we can use free examples to illustrate the point. [[User:Werieth|Werieth]] ([[User talk:Werieth|talk]]) 00:10, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

:[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supercouple&diff=607556970&oldid=607556291 I reverted] [[User:Werieth|Werieth]] on the removals he made. I only used [[WP:Rollback]] because I considered some of the removals unconstructive and wanted to alert him to the fact that I reverted him (the initial "undo" option for the edit that I wanted to revert was blocked by intermediate edits); I then provided a [[WP:Edit summary]] while removing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supercouple&diff=607557512&oldid=607556970 one of the images] that {{User|Partyclams}} added; I stated, "The [[Luke and Laura]] image passes [[Wikipedia:NFC#Images]], and so does the [[Bianca and Maggie]] image, because of historical importance and extensive critical commentary."  However, neither of these images are historical; I was more so referring to the couples. After that statement, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supercouple&diff=607557816&oldid=607557512 removed another image] that Partyclams added. Regarding the fair-use images other than the Luke and Laura image, which are three: I think that the Bianca and Maggie, [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], and [[Cloud Strife]] and [[Aerith Gainsborough]] images pass Wikipedia:NFC#Images because they are used for the "critical commentary and discussion of the work in question" aspect, and the Buffy and Angel/Cloud and Aerith imagery seemingly adhere to the part that states: "Iconic and historical images which are not subject of commentary themselves but significantly aid in illustrating historical events may be used if they meet all aspects of the non-free content criteria, particularly no free alternatives, respect for commercial opportunity, and contextual significance." These couples are significantly discussed in the sections they are in, and the Buffy and Angel/Cloud and Aerith imagery, which concern deaths, significantly impacted viewers. The impact of the Aerith death scene is linked in the Supercouple article; that link is [[Aerith Gainsborough#Reception]]. However, the Buffy and Angel/Cloud and Aerith text in the Supercouple article doesn't discuss the impact of either imagery. Either way, I'm not as tied to these images as I was before, and wouldn't mind too much if they were removed. I would be disappointed to see them all removed, but not too upset by the removals.

[[:File:East Side Access.jpg]]- Review requested because it is claimed in the notes that the project concerned may have been federally funded, which the notes claim makes this a US GOV work.

Im not seeing justification for including 10 non-free files in what is basically a list article [[User:Werieth|Werieth]] ([[User talk:Werieth|talk]]) 12:18, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
:I'd have to argue in favor that these are unneeded. We're talking about non-acadmic parts of a university (housing/etc) and while they're well documented, they are also sub-par notable. If it was that these could all have been individual stand-alone articles but the editors chose to cover it as one topic, I could see that, but this doesn't seem to be the case. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 14:28, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

*This was debated previously at [[Talk:Residential_colleges_of_Rice_University#Use_of_non-free_images_on_this_article]]. More importantly, and what truly matters, is that admins [[User:Kusma]] and [[User:Graeme Bartlett]], plus editor [[User:Armbrust]] successfully edit warred in June/July of 2011 in favor of their retention. As is the case with so many other pages where there is overuse, if there is a group of users vocal enough to fight against policies and guidelines, the policies and guidelines simply do not apply. That is the case here. This page is exempt from WP:NFCC #3 by fiat. Recommend closure of this review as futile. --[[User:Hammersoft|Hammersoft]] ([[User talk:Hammersoft|talk]]) 14:38, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

** The argument that was presented then - that if these were standalone articles they'd each have their own logos so as merged they would appropriately have a logo each - is one that I would have to support on the same principle that we allow logos in general on standalone articles. '''But''' that assumes each of the individual colleges given could have a stand-alone article that would otherwise meet all notability and other policies/guidelines, and as I look, no that doesn't seem to be the case in the current iteration of the article. So while that discussion from the past is "right", it doesn't apply to this in the present state. And I will note that just because admins discuss that on talk pages doesn't make it "right"; whomever closes this will be making the "right" decision. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 15:01, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
**I find it difficult to understand why we should allow non-free logos for articles about single colleges, but not for an article about several colleges. I personally think we should not allow non-free logos at all, but while we do, we should not have arbitrary limits like "at most five non-free logos per article". I also object to the characterisation of that bunch of edits as a "fight against policies and guidelines". â€”'''[[User:Kusma|Kusma]]''' ([[User talk:Kusma|t]]Â·[[Special:Contributions/Kusma|c]]) 19:18, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
*We argued that use was within the policy.  For logos we have the special case where the copyright holders probably ''want'' them to be displayed for this purpose, even if they will not release it on a free license.  Ps I have just nominated [[:File:Jones Crest.png]] for deletion on commons, as it looks identical to the non free logo. I would argue that the article is superior with the logos exhibited.

** It is not what the companies what, it is what they actually. If they don't release them for a complete free license, they cannot work with our goal of trying to create a free content work.

******Baseball clubs (as are most notable businesses, universities (like the overall Rice U.), and other entities) that are notable will have stand-alone pages that go into depth about that entity, and thus it is consensus that for such stand-alone articles, the logo is appropriate for demonstrating the branding of these notable entities.
