'''''Sweet XVI''''' is the second [[extended play|EP]] by [[United States|American]] recording artist [[Mýa]]. Her second EP, it was released on April 21, 2014 worldwide via digital media store [[iTunes]], marking Harrison's fifth independently released project through her own label imprint [[Planet 9 (record label)|Planet 9]] via [[INgrooves]]. The six-track EP commemorates the release of her debut studio album ''[[Mýa (album)|Mýa]]'' (1998) and 16th anniversary in the [[entertainment industry]]. Its release was preceded by its first and only single, the [[Eric Bellinger]]-assisted "Same Page".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/04/mya-same-page-f-eric-bellinger-premiere|title=Premiere: Listen to MÝA's "Same Page" f/ Eric Bellinger|accessdate=2014-05-12|work=[[Complex.com|Complex]]}}</ref>

Described as "more up-tempo" than its predecessor, the EP ''[[With Love (Mýa EP)|With Love]]'', ''Sweet XVI'' is intended to celebrate not only Harrison's journey thus far, but be an indication of a new path as she reinvents her career and gears up to tour and work on her ninth studio project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myamya.com/mya-with-love-ep-available-now-httpsitunes-apple-comusalbumwith-love-epid815832355/|title=GRAMMY AWARD WINNING ARTIST: MÝA "SWEET XVI" EP OUT APRIL 21|accessdate=2014-05-12|work=myamya.com}}</ref> Production on ''Sweet XVI'' was primarily handled by longtime friend and frequent collaborator Yonni with additional contributions from musicians Antione Hart and Nate "Impact" Jolley as well as her in-house team of producers The Alliance. Just as Harrison did on previous projects, she used existing material she personally pulled from her archive of unreleased music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://okmagazine.com/meet-the-stars/exclusives-meet-the-stars/mya-sweet-16-interview/|title=Mya Talks About Her New EP and Why "Lady Marmalade" Is Still Her Favorite Single|accessdate=2014-05-12|work=[[OK! magazine]]}}</ref>

==Background==
[[File:Prince by jimieye.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Harrison took wise business advice from mentor [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] regarding ownership of her records and decided to go the independent route.<ref name="Jadore Liife">{{cite web|url=http://www.jadoresliife.com/2012/01/liife-mya.html|title=Liife&Such: Mya|accessdate=2012-01-21|work=jadoresliife}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://youknowigotsoul.com/?p=17456|title=Interview: Mya Talks New Album "K.I.S.S.", Releasing Albums in Japan First, Importance of Her Music|accessdate=2012-01-21|work=youknowigotsoul}}</ref>]]

Prior to Mýa recording and releasing her first independent album overseas, she released three successful studio albums in the United States; ''[[Mýa (album)|Mýa]]'' (1998), ''[[Fear of Flying (album)|Fear of Flying]]'' (2000) and ''[[Moodring]]'' (2003). In 1998, Mýa released her debut [[Mýa (album)|self-titled album]], which peaked at No. 13 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. ''Fear of Flying'' (2000) fared even better at No. 7, with the single "[[Case of the Ex]]" reaching No. 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. In 2001, she took home a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for "[[Lady Marmalade]]", her massive No. 1 single with [[Pink (singer)|P!nk]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lil' Kim]], and [[Missy Elliott]]. A role in the hit film ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' and other acting opportunities followed. After she released ''Moodring'' in 2003, with the exception of a popular stint on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' in 2009 (she finished second), it seemed as if Mýa had left the entertainment industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/464710/mya-talks-kiss-deluxe-album-new-catty-single-trina-collabo|title=Mýa Talks 'K.I.S.S.' Deluxe Album, New 'Catty' Single, & Trina Collabo|accessdate=2011-12-15|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

In 2004, after the ''Moodring'' album, she ended up in a year-long litigation with management. In late 2005, Harrison made a transition within the Universal system from [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] to [[Universal Motown]]. In 2007, her fourth studio album ''[[Liberation (Mýa album)|Liberation]]'' was accidentally released in Japan when its release date changed. At the time, she was with Motown/Universal; her lawyer advised that she not waste time and money taking the issue to court, so Harrison decided to go independent instead. [[Japan]] loved the ''Liberation'' album so much, that a company by the named [[Manhattan Records|Manhattan Recordings]] located there approached her about doing business with them. Harrison released her first independent album, titled ''[[Sugar & Spice (Mýa album)|Sugar & Spice]]'', in Japan in 2008, a year after her split with Motown.<ref name="4Eight Media">{{cite web|url=http://www.four8media.com/mya-exclusive-interview-k-i-s-s/ |title=Mya Interview 4Eight Media |accessdate=2012-01-21 |work=four8media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109084518/http://www.four8media.com/mya-exclusive-interview-k-i-s-s/ |archivedate=2014-01-09 |df= }}</ref>

''Sweet XVI'' is Harrison's second [[extended play]] and fifth independently self-funded project. It is the follow-up to her fourth independently released project (EP) ''With Love'' (2014). The EP served as Harrison's fourth U.S. release since her departure from record label [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] back in 2005.

===Planet 9===
In 2008, Harrison created her own label imprint, Planet 9. Since parting ways with [[Universal Motown]], Harrison has released four independently self-funded, self-executive produced projects ''[[Sugar & Spice (Mýa album)|Sugar & Spice]]'' (2008), ''[[Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1]]'' (2010) and ''[[K.I.S.S. (Keep It Sexy & Simple)|K.I.S.S.]]'' (2011). In 2009, Harrison spoke with ''Rolling Out'' magazine, elaborating more on her hiatus from music and decision to go independent:

<blockquote>
"I've never stopped doing music. I've created a label called Planet 9 and I released an album in Japan. I invested in my own studio and it cut the recording cost down 95 percent. I have my own in-house producers and they are not as expensive as an established producer. The return is greater and now I own my masters. I see six dollars per album sold versus 10 cents. You may not sell as many units because you don't put as much money in promotions, but the returns are better."<ref name="rolling out">{{cite web|url=http://rollingout.com/covers/mya%e2%80%99s-last-dance/|title=Mya’s Last Dance?|accessdate=2012-07-22|work=Rolling Out|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105035104/http://rollingout.com/covers/mya%E2%80%99s-last-dance/|archivedate=2013-01-05|df=}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Later in the interview, Harrison voiced her opinion on the major difference between major record labels and independent labels, saying, "Major labels have a system that you have to go through. The people in power dictate how things should sound and where the money is spent. But when you become your own boss, you check every line item and you have to be cautious."<ref name="rolling out"/>
