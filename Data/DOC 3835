:({{Find sources|Rashtra times}})
I find no evidence to support the [[WP:N|notability]] of this publication.  Claims of playing a "vital role" during the emergency (which emergency?) or of being "one of the most read weekly newspaper (''sic'') in Delhi" cannot be verified.  Its website consists of a single static page with a telephone number for contact.  There are ''no'' mentions of this publication in any other reliable source. <font color="green">[[User:WikiDan61|WikiDan61]]</font><font color="green" size="5px"></font><sup>[[User talk:WikiDan61|ChatMe!]]</sup><sub>[[Special:Contributions/WikiDan61|ReadMe!!]]</sub> 10:53, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': Although I accept that offline sources ''might'' exist for this, I cannot find anything that suggests this is likely. I can only find it mentioned in lists of newspapers. No citations to articles, no description of its history, no evidence of significant reporting...

*'''Delete''', also can't find reliable sources about this, other than a mention in a list of papers, and its editor being on a Press Club committee ([http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/anil-anand-re-elected-as-pcis-secretary-general/ here]). I also tried searching for राष्ट्र टाइम्स, but don't read/speak Hindi, and didn't turn up anything. Someone who reads Hindi might find more about the newspaper.

*'''Keep''', weekly newspaper that has clearly been running for quite a while. I'm somewhat suprised by the claim that "There are ''no'' mentions of this publication in any other reliable source". Book references for being a Hindi weekly from Delhi includes http://books.google.com/books?id=SqkxAQAAIAAJ . http://books.google.se/books?id=SV7gAAAAMAAJ , p. 299, has circulation numbers, I can't read it well (text too small). http://books.google.com/books?id=NV_gAAAAMAAJ , p. 269 has a claimed circulation figure of 72,250. http://www.rni.nic.in/webreport.asp gives circulation as 72,600. And the Emergency refers to [[Emergency (India)]]. --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 21:53, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::[[User:Soman|Soman]], while one-line mentions in lists of newspapers is a good indication that it exists, it falls short of the significant coverage by independent reliable sources required by [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:Agyle|Agyle]] ([[User talk:Agyle|talk]]) 22:15, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Yes, but if there are multiple refs indicating that it's a regular, weekly publications with a circulation in thousands, that can work. Notability criteria are subjective, and as per WP:GNG, if we have a stub saying that it's a) Hindi newspaper 2) weekly 3) published from Delhi, claimed a circulation of 72,600 in 2004, then that's covered per the references given. --[[User:Soman|Soman]] ([[User talk:Soman|talk]]) 05:03, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
