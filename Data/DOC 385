'''Bruvik''' (historically: ''Kyrkjebruvik'') is a village in [[Osterøy]] municipality in [[Hordaland]] county, [[Norway]].  The village is located on the southern shore of the island of [[Osterøy (island)|Osterøy]], along the [[Sørfjorden (Osterøy)|Sørfjorden]].  It sits about {{convert|13|km}} east of the village of [[Hausvik]] and about {{convert|3|km}} across the fjord from the village of [[Vaksdal (village)|Vaksdal]].<ref name="snl">{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/Bruvik|title=Bruvik|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

Historically, Bruvik village was the [[administrative centre]] of the municipality of [[Bruvik (municipality)|Bruvik]] which existed from 1870 until 1964.  [[Bruvik Church]] has been located here for centuries, as has the parish of Bruvik for the [[Church of Norway]]. Bruvik was a central hub for the region since it sat along the fjord and boat travel was the main mode of transportation, but as time progressed, railroads and highways were built on the opposite side of the fjord, and that side grew into larger urban areas while Bruvik has now become less important since it has only one road leading to it from the rest of Norway.<ref name="LW">{{cite web|url=http://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Bruvik|title=Bruvik|language=Norwegian|publisher=lokalhistoriewiki.no|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

The small island of [[Olsnesøyna]] lies about {{convert|1.7|km}} southeast of Bruvik in the middle of the [[fjord]].  It was the site of school for disobedient boys and later used by the local [[county jail]].<ref name="LW" /> In june 2019 it has since been closed and sold to a private owner for 11,8 million NOK. <ref>https://e24.no/naeringsliv/eiendom/fengselsoey-solgt-for-11-8-millioner-kroner/24636420</ref>
