The result was    '''delete'''. There's no doubt that there are sources which talk about this.  The only question is whether they are independent, reliable sources.  The consensus here seems to be that they are not -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 00:02, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

Article has no [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], and I doubt that any can be found; I certainly didn't find any with a web search.

The main source for this article is a website called ufoevidence.org, which [http://www.ufoevidence.org/Cases/CaseSubarticle.asp?ID=130 copied] an article from [http://ufos.about.com/library/weekly/aa082701a.htm about.com] (dead link).

*'''Delete''' No sources other than UFO books/authors which are not [[WP:INDY|independent of the topic they are promoting]]. I could find no coverage by news sources that would make this incident notable. See [[Voronezh UFO incident]] for an example of reliable, independent sourcing. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 12:36, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*:A lot of this coverage is about [[John E. Mack]]'s investigation into this incident (or the film subsequently made of it) and seems to be itself notable.  By the way, if you are relying on Gnews to find news articles I think the archive search has become thorougly broken, it no longer seems to find anything other than recent material. I really do not believe there were no news items on [https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ariel+ufo&hl=en&biw=803&bih=899&sa=X&ei=qr9bU9bZOoqy7AbH3oCgDA&ved=0CB4QpwUoBQ&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1990%2Ccd_max%3A2009&tbm=nws#hl=en&q=Princess+Diana&tbm=nws&tbs=cdr:1%2Ccd_min:1990%2Ccd_max:2009 Princess Diana] between 1990 and 2009, which includes the year of her death.

::: Your sources are about the film or the filmmaker. Do you have any sources that cover the alleged incident only - independently of the claims of the film or the filmmaker? - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 14:50, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::: Let me explain a bit further. Our ostensible article concerns [[WP:REDFLAG|extraordinary claims]] i.e. space aliens landed and spoke with schoolchildren, so we need to find objective, non-[[WP:FRINGE|fringe]] sources rather than the claims of Randy Nickerson and [[John E. Mack]] that are associated with the promotion of a film. So far, I don't see evidence of notability for the "incident", but possibly for ''a film about it'', and given that, it's possibly deserving of a paragraph at [[John E. Mack]]. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 15:17, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Yes, the articles are about the film, but they also discuss the incident.  For instance from the ''Cape Times'';
::::<blockquote>During morning break on September 14 of that year, 62 schoolchildren between the ages of eight and 12 saw a strange craft land 150 metres from the Ariel School in Ruwa, from which two small beings emerged which were described as having "big eyes like rugby balls". The children's individual descriptions of the phenomenon were so similar that news of the sighting spread around the globe.</blockquote>
::::I'm not going to go looking for reliable sources claiming this to be true.  There won't be any because it is a heap of bollocks.  That does not mean that the incident is not notable—it has still had a lot of coverage.

::::: No, I didn't mean we should find RS claiming it to be true. I meant we need RS showing in depth coverage of reports of the incident itself. If all we've got is sources describing it in relation to the promotion of a film from the filmmakers perspective, it's impossible to write an objective article about the incident itself. - [[User:LuckyLouie|LuckyLouie]] ([[User talk:LuckyLouie|talk]]) 16:22, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::: Well, there's [http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-8281.html this article] from ''Bulawayo News 24''.  They do mention Mack's visit but nothing about the film.

*'''Comment'''-While it could be interesting-you can't possibly have a page for everyone who claims to have seen a UFO-which of course they really are weather balloons really most of the time-which I heard a news story on why people tend to think at times the weather ballons are UFO's I don't remember what it was though.

*'''Weak delete''' - there are some sources but I'm not sure they constitute (together) significant coverage in independent sources. Maybe they do, I dunno. All of the sources seem to have the same genesis and it's not really clear whether that's the kids or Hind.
