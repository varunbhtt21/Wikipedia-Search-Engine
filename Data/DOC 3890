Title : Phil McCarthy
Text : '''Phil McCarthy''' was a [[County Kerry|Kerry]] senior [[gaelic football]] player in the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>http://www.terracetalk.com/kerry-football/player/428/Phil-McCarthy</ref>

Hailing from Baltygarron in The Spa ([[Tralee]]), McCarthy played his club football with Churchill. He played at [[full-forward]] for Kerry in league and championship games between 1944 and 1950. During the 1940s, Kerry won 3 [[All-Ireland Football Final|All Ireland football final]]s and lost 2 - including the "famous" final against Cavan held in New York in 1947.

When his playing days ended, McCarthy was heavily involved in the development of under-age teams with his club, Churchill, for many years both in training and taxiing under-age players to games all over [[County Kerry|North Kerry]].

McCarthy's nephew, [[Pat McCarthy (Gaelic footballer)|Pat McCarthy]], was also a senior Kerry footballer in the 1970s; and his own son, Philip McCarthy, represented Kerry at junior level in the 1980s.
