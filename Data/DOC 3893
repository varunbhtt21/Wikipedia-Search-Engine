'''Sandford Arthur Strong''' (10 April 1863 – 18 January 1904) was an English [[Oriental studies|orientalist]], art historian and librarian.<ref name="times">{{cite news |title=Obituary: Mr. S. Arthur Strong |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |page=4 |date= 19 January 1904}}</ref>

==Life==
Born in [[Kensington]] in 1863, he was the second son of Thomas Banks Strong of the [[War Office]], and his wife, Anna Lawson; his elder brother was [[Thomas Banks Strong]]. In 1877 he entered [[St Paul's School, London]] as a foundation scholar, but remained there for little more than a year. His next two years were passed as a clerk at [[Lloyd's]], though during this time he also attended classes at [[King's College, London]]. As a boy he had been taught drawing by Albert Varley, who gave him a copy of [[Matthew Pilkington]]'s ''Dictionary of Painters'', and he frequented the National Gallery. In 1881 he matriculated with a Hutchinson studentship at [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated in 1884, with a third class in Part I of the classical tripos, being placed in the second class in Part II the following year. He proceeded M.A. in 1890.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Strong, Sandford Arthur|volume=3}}</ref><ref>{{acad|id=STRN881SA|name=Strong, Sandford Arthur}}</ref>

On the recommendation of [[Edward Byles Cowell]], Strong worked on [[Sanskrit]] with [[Cecil Bendall]], but discouraged at Cambridge, he moved to Oxford towards the end of 1885. There he was subkeeper and librarian of the [[Indian Institute]], and befriended  [[Max Müller]], [[Archibald Henry Sayce]], and [[Adolf Neubauer]]. Neubauer advised him to visit the continent, and gave him letters of introduction to [[Ernest Renan]] and [[James Darmesteter]] at Paris; he also studied with [[Eberhard Schrader]] in Berlin. Strong on his return to England found recognition and employment slow in coming, and he failed in his candidature for the [[Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic|chair of Arabic]] at Cambridge vacant by the death of [[Robertson Smith]] in 1894. He was appointed in 1895 professor of Arabic at [[University College, London]], an almost nominal post.<ref name="DNB"/> At this period he taught Persian to [[Gertrude Bell]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=30686|title=Bell, Gertrude Margaret Lowthian|first=Liora|last=Lukitz}}</ref>

[[Sidney Colvin]] introduced Strong to the [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], who was then in need of a librarian to succeed [[Sir James Lacaita]]. At [[Chatsworth House]] from 1895, he concentrated on its works of art, and was invited to other collections: the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]]'s at [[Welbeck Abbey]], where he also acted for a time as librarian, the [[George Herbert, 13th Earl of Pembroke|Earl of Pembroke]]'s at [[Wilton House]], and [[Robert Loyd-Lindsay, 1st Baron Wantage|Lord Wantage]]'s at [[East Lockinge|Lockinge]].<ref name="DNB"/>

In 1897, Strong was also appointed librarian at the House of Lords. After a lingering illness, he died in London on 18 January 1904, and was buried in [[Brompton cemetery]]. 
The Arthur Strong Oriental Library at University College, London was formed around his books, given by his widow.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Works==
Strong's major oriental publications were his editions of the ''[[Bodhi Vamsa|Maha-Bodhi-Vamsa]]'' for the [[Pali Text Society]] (1891), and of the ''Futah al-Habashah'' or "Conquest of Abyssinia" (1894) (see [[Abyssinian–Adal war]]) for the [[Royal Asiatic Society]]'s monographs. At his death he was engaged on the Arabic text of [[Ibn Arabshah]]'s ''History of Yakmak, Sultan of Egypt'', on [[Jaqmaq]], the first part of which appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' for 1904. As well as Sanskrit and Arabic, Strong studied Pali, Persian and Assyrian hieroglyphics and Chinese; on all these he wrote in learned publications, and he also contributed reviews to the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'' and ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]''.<ref name="DNB"/>
