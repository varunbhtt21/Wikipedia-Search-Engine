The result was    '''speedy delete'''. [[WP:G7|G7]], since dkbot apparently wants it removed. [[User:Yunshui|Yunshui]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Yunshui|<sup style="font-size:90%">雲</sup>]][[Special:Contributions/Yunshui|<sub style="font-size:90%">水</sub>]] 14:15, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

Not a notable actor. Article was PROD and seconded but at the last second, the article creator removed it. [[User:JDDJS|JDDJS]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|talk]]) 12:01, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Lacks in-depth coverage in media (mainly just mentions in articles on Godzilla) and all roles are small/minor. No awards or other indications of importance. Fails [[WP:NACTOR]] and [[WP:BASIC]]. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 12:07, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': A short list of minor roles, with no awards and no real coverage in independent sources. Hopefully in a few years, he'll be ready, but definitely not yet. '''''[[User:Moswento|Moswento]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Moswento|talky]]</sup> 13:26, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': Administrators: please delete ASAP. Requesting expedited deletion, please. Thank you.'''''[[User:dkbot|dkbot]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:dkbot|talky]]</sup> 14:52, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
