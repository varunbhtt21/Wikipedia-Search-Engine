<small>Created by [[User:MrBill3|MrBill3]] ([[User talk:MrBill3|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Caponer|Caponer]] ([[User talk:Caponer|talk]]) at 12:05, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

* '''ALT 1''': <s>... that Sarah Einstein, director of Mental Health America, called '''[[Milan Puskar Health Right]]''' ''(pictured)'' "better than any clinic I have seen around the country"?</s>

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Providing alternate hook and reviewing. The article was created within the timeline, contains plenty of inline citations, is free of close paraphrasing and copyright infringement, and has a neutral point of view. I'm providing an alternative hook that I think is much more interesting.--[[User:3family6|<font color="navy">&iquest;3fam</font>]]'''''[[User talk:3family6|<font color="black">ily6</font>]]''''' <sub>[[Special:Contributions/3family6|<font color="purple">contribs</font>]]</sub> 16:20, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
::*[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  Per [[Wikipedia:Did you know/Supplementary guidelines#Rules for evaluating other people's hooks and articles|Rule H2]], you cannot approve your own hook, 3family6. Could another reviewer evaluate ALT1? Thanks, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 20:45, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:::* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] I have reviewed the tag and the quote is accurate. It matches the source used to obtain the material.[[User:HotHat|HotHat]] ([[User talk:HotHat|talk]]) 06:27, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

[[File:Symbol redirect vote 4.svg|16px]]  I've undone the promotion of this DYK by Crisco1492[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ADid_you_know_nominations%2FMilan_Puskar_Health_Right&diff=609650674&oldid=609346630], as explained at [[Wikipedia talk:Did you know#Daily prep area removal]]. [[User:Fram|Fram]] ([[User talk:Fram|talk]]) 12:03, 22 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] Striking ALT1 per Framâ€”note that Einstein's title was inflated from local in the original to national in the ALT, along with other issues. Perhaps [[User:Caponer|Caponer]], who nominated this, can suggest an ALT2 hook. There's no point in calling for a new reviewer when we don't have a valid hook.

:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] '''ALT2''': ... that '''[[Milan Puskar Health Right]]''' ''(pictured)'', a system of free clinics in West Virginia that handles nearly 4,000 patients a year, originally operated out of a Baptist church?
:*I'd also like to note that the [[WP:LEAD|lead]] does not adequately summarize the article. There is some editorializing in the article, such as the assertion that the clinics "fill a huge need", which is attributed to a local paper. Most of the sources, in fact, are local. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 17:17, 22 May 2014 (UTC)
::*I concur with the suggested ALT2 hook! I've also left a message on {{u|MrBill3}}'s talk page, as he is probably better suited to answer questions regarding the article's sourcing. Thank you all for taking the time to review and improve this article for DYK consumption! -- [[User:Caponer|Caponer]] ([[User talk:Caponer|talk]]) 12:18, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*First MPHR is more of a single clinic with several satellites, there is a statewide system "Health Right WV". I don't know if that matters. Second the sourced "editorial" statement is well supported by the multiple facts in the paragraph it starts. Third the sources meet RS, they are local and statewide published newspapers, TV stations, the largest university in the state and national and statewide organizations. They include local papers from around the state so the sourcing isn't all from the locality of the clinic. If a subject is notable statewide I think it qualifies for DYK, but I am not very familiar with DYK. Fourth if someone can write a lead which provides a better summary, I welcome them to edit boldly. - - [[User:MrBill3|MrBill3]] ([[User talk:MrBill3|talk]]) 12:36, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*I edited the lead and removed the quote from Sarah Einstein per DYK discussions. I also removed the unattributed quote that it "fills a huge need". I left a note on the article talk page regarding other needed improvements. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 22:44, 25 May 2014 (UTC) 
:::::* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] New review '''for ALT2''' from scratch, due to changes made since nomination date. New enough (for 25 April) and long enough. Offline citations for hook accepted AGF. QPQ OK. Hook image is free, and appears in the article. No problem with disambig links, and all but two external links are OK. Issues: (1) The Association of Free Clinics citation #8 shows where its website is, but adds no support to the text, so it appears to be redundant. (2) Citation #16 is a dead link. This is a worthwhile article, so if you could kindly deal with the two issues, this nom will be good to go. --[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 15:54, 1 June 2014 (UTC)
::::::*{{done}} Citation #8 is indeed superfluous, and I removed it. I also removed the dead link, and trimmed the 3 words attributed to it. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 21:41, 11 June 2014 (UTC)  
:::::::* [[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] Good to go. --[[User:Storye book|Storye book]] ([[User talk:Storye book|talk]]) 23:33, 11 June 2014 (UTC)
