:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] The article was created within five days of its nomination. It is long enough.  It has inline citations throughout.  I could find no copyright violations.  The hook is interesting.  It is based on the title of an article, but her accent is discussed in the article supporting the hook. It is good to go.
