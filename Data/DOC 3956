'''United Kingdom environmental law''' concerns the protection of the [[Natural environment|environment]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Environmental law]] is increasingly a European and an international issue, due to the cross border issues of air and water pollution, and man made [[climate change]].

==History==
In the [[common law]], the primary protection was found in the [[tort law|tort]] of [[Nuisance in English law|nuisance]], but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from [[pig sty|pig sties]],<ref>''[[Aldred's Case]]'' (1610) 9 Co Rep 57b; (1610) 77 ER 816</ref> [[strict liability]] against dumping rubbish,<ref>''[[R v Stephens]]'' (1866) LR 1 QB 702</ref> or damage from exploding dams.<ref>''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' [1868] UKHL 1</ref> Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. 

*1306, Edward I briefly banned coal fires in London.
*John Evelyn, ''[[Fumifugium]]'' (1661) argued for burning fragrant wood instead of mineral coal, which he believed would reduce coughing. 
*''Ballad of Gresham College'' (1661) describes how the smoke "does our lungs and spirits choke, Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron."
*In 1800, one million tons of coal were burned in London, and 15 million across the UK.
*Smoke Nuisance Abatement (Metropolis) Act 1853
*[[John Snow]] in 1854 discovered that the water pump on [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]], [[Soho]] was responsible for 616 [[cholera]] deaths because it was contaminated by an old [[cesspit]] leaking fecal bacteria. [[Germ theory of disease]] began to replace [[miasma theory|miasma]] theory that had lingered since the [[Black Death]]. 

During the "[[Great Stink]]" of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the [[River Thames]] began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848]] had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close [[cesspit]]s around the city in an attempt to "clean up" but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the [[London sewerage system]].

*[[James Johnston (socialist politician)]], president of the Smoke Abatement League, international conference in 1911.

London also suffered from terrible air pollution, and this culminated in the "[[Great Smog]]" of 1952, which in turn triggered its on legislative response: the [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning [[coal]]) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance. It required zones for smokeless fuel to be burned and relocated power stations.

*Clean Air Act 1968 required tall chimneys to disperse pollution.
