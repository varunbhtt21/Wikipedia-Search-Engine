'''[[Groundhog]]s''' (''Marmota monax'') are [[rodent]]s in the family [[Sciuridae]]. They belong to the group of large [[ground squirrel]]s known as [[marmot]]s. This lowland creature is widely distributed in [[North America]] and common in the northeastern and central [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Although considered by farmers to be a nuisance, groundhogs have become part of popular culture through [[Groundhog Day]] and the [[Groundhog Day (film)|film of the same name]].
