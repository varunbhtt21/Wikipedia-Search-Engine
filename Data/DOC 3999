'''''Bucculatrix caribbea''''' is a [[moth]] in the [[Bucculatricidae]] family. It is found on the island of Cozumel ([[Mexico]]) and Glovers Reef in [[Belize]], but it is probably widespread along coastal areas in many parts of the Caribbean region.

The length of the forewings is 2â€“2.3&nbsp;mm. The forewings are white, densely covered with dark brownish fuscous scales. The hindwings are pale grey.

The larvae feed on ''[[Cordia sebestena]]''. They [[leaf miner|mine]] the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a serpentine mine, which is later enlarged to a small, full depth blotch. 
The black [[frass]] is deposited in the serpentine portion of the mine and partway along either side of the blotch. Older larvae feed externally, skeletonizing small patches of leaf. Pupation takes place in a cocoon, which is spun on the underside of the leaf, mostly near the midrib.

==Etymology==
The species name refers to the Caribbean, the geographical regional name of the area of distribution.<ref>[http://biostor.org/reference/115374 Two new Neotropical species of Bucculatrix leaf miners (Lepidoptera: Bucculatricidae) reared from Cordia (Boraginaceae)]</ref>
