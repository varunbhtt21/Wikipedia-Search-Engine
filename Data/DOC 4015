===Minnesota Blades===
''(Division I)''

The Blades were formed at the beginning of the 2002-2003 bandy season as the successor club to the Stabaek (MN) Bandy Club, which, after enjoying success in the 1980s and 1990s, fell on hard times. After Stabaek finished last in the Premier League table in 2001-2002, the Blades were founded and led by Steve Nelson of Edina, MN (see notable players below) and finished their inaugural season in third place, before losing in the league playoff semifinals to the Amur Tigers.

The Blades have won four [[Division I (US bandy)|US Premier League]] titles, taking the [[Gunnar Cup]] in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2011. In 2005, the Gunnar Cup, which is traditionally awarded to the playoff champions, was awarded to the Blades by virtue of their first-place regular-season finish, as inclement weather in Minnesota caused the cancellation of that year's post-season tournament. In the 2005-2006 season, the Blades finished 4th in the regular season, and were eliminated from the league playoffs by expansion side OBS.

In both 2005 and 2006, the Blades were the runners-up in the [[North American Cup]] competition. The Blades are captained by Steve "Jazz Hands" Nelson; he earned the nickname due to his indelible stick-handling prowess in the 2006 Federation Cup.

===Mississippi Mojo===
''(Division I)''

The Mississippi Mojo is based in northern United States, despite its name. The team was the runner-up for the Gunnar Cup in 2013, 2015, and 2017.
