</div>'''''Acrocanthosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|k|r|oʊ-|ˌ|k|æ|n|θ|oʊ-|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s}} {{respell|ak-rə|KAN|thə|SOR|əs}}; meaning "high-spined lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that existed in what is now [[North America]] during the [[Aptian]] and early [[Albian]] stages of the [[Early Cretaceous]]. Like most dinosaur genera, ''Acrocanthosaurus'' contains only a single species, ''A. atokensis''. Its [[fossil]] remains are found mainly in the [[United States|U.S.]] states of [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and [[Wyoming]], although teeth attributed to ''Acrocanthosaurus'' have been found as far east as [[Maryland]].

''Acrocanthosaurus'' was a [[bipedal]] [[predator]]. As the name suggests, it is best known for the high [[spinous process|neural spines]] on many of its [[vertebra]]e, which most likely supported a ridge of muscle over the animal's neck, back and hips. ''Acrocanthosaurus'' was one of the largest theropods, approaching 12&nbsp;meters (40&nbsp;ft) in length, and weighing up to {{convert|6.2|t|ST}}. Large theropod footprints discovered in Texas may have been made by ''Acrocanthosaurus'', although there is no direct association with skeletal remains.

Recent discoveries have elucidated many details of its anatomy, allowing for specialized studies focusing on its [[brain]] structure and forelimb function. ''Acrocanthosaurus'' was the largest theropod in its [[ecosystem]] and likely an [[apex predator]] which possibly preyed on large [[sauropod]]s and [[ornithopod]]s.
