</div>'''''Albertosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˌ|b|ɜːr|t|oʊ-|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s}}; meaning "Alberta lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in western [[North America]] during the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], about 70&nbsp;[[million years ago]]. The [[type species]], ''A. sarcophagus'', was apparently restricted in [[range (biology)|range]] to the modern-day [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Alberta]], after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing ''[[Gorgosaurus libratus]]'' as a second species.

As a tyrannosaurid, ''Albertosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[predator]] with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head with dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the [[food chain]] in its local [[ecosystem]]. Although relatively large for a theropod, ''Albertosaurus'' was much smaller than its more famous relative ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', probably weighing less than 2&nbsp;[[metric ton]]s.

Since the first discovery in 1884, [[fossil]]s of more than thirty individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of ''Albertosaurus'' anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of [[pack hunter|pack]] behaviour and allows studies of [[ontogeny]] and [[population biology]] which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.
