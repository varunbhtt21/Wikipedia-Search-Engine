</div>'''''Carnotaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of large [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in [[South America]] during the [[Late Cretaceous]] period, between about 72 and 70 million years ago. The only [[species]] is '''''Carnotaurus sastrei'''''. Known from a single well-preserved skeleton, it is one of the best-understood theropods from the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the [[Chubut Province]] of Argentina from rocks of the [[La Colonia Formation]]. ''Carnotaurus'' is a derived member of the [[Abelisauridae]], a group of large theropods that occupied the large [[predation|predatorial]] [[Ecological niche|niche]] in the southern Landmasses of [[Gondwana]] during the late [[Cretaceous]].

''Carnotaurus'' was a lightly built, [[biped]]al predator, measuring {{convert|8|to|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and weighing at least {{convert|1|metric ton|ton|abbr=on}}. The skeleton is preserved with extensive skin impressions, showing a mosaic of small, non-overlapping scales. The mosaic was interrupted by large bumps that lined the sides of the animal, and there are no hints of feathers. The distinctive horns and the muscular neck may have been used in fighting [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]]. The feeding habits of ''Carnotaurus'' remain unclear: some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as [[sauropod]]s, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. ''Carnotaurus'' was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods. ('''[[Carnotaurus|see more...]]''')
