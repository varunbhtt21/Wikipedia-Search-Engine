</div>The '''Chicxulub crater''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|k|ʃ|ə|l|uː|b}}; {{IPA-myn|tʃʼikʃuluɓ|[[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]]:}}) is a prehistoric [[impact crater]] buried underneath the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]], after which the crater is named. The age of the Chicxulub asteroid impact and the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–Pg boundary) coincide precisely. The crater is more than {{convert|180|km}} in diameter and {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} in depth, making the feature one of the [[List of impact craters on Earth#Confirmed impact craters listed by size|largest confirmed impact structures on Earth]]; the impacting [[bolide]] that formed the crater was at least 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) in diameter. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes [[shocked quartz]], a [[gravity anomaly]], and [[tektite]]s in surrounding areas.

The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], and the start of the [[Paleogene]] period. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], including the worldwide extinction of [[dinosaur|non-avian dinosaurs]]. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20&nbsp;years worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the [[mass extinction]]s at the K–Pg boundary. ('''[[Chicxulub crater|see more...]]''')
