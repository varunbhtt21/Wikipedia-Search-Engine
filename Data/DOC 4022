</div>The '''Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event''' was the [[extinction event|mass extinction]] of three-quarters of Earth's plant and animal [[species]] during a geologically brief interval about 66 million years ([[Annum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]) ago. A wide range of species perished in the K–Pg extinction, most notably the non-avian dinosaurs. However, other groups that sustained losses or vanished include [[mammal]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[bird]]s, lizards, insects, and plants. In the oceans, the K–Pg extinction devastated the [[Mosasaur|giant marine lizards]], plesiosaurs, fishes, [[ammonites]] and plankton. It marked the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period and with it, the entire [[Mesozoic]] Era, opening the [[Cenozoic]] Era which continues today.

In the [[geologic record]], the K–Pg event is marked by a thin layer of [[sediment]] called the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|K–Pg boundary]], which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows high levels of the metal [[iridium]], which is rare in the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]] but abundant in [[asteroid]]s. It is now generally believed that the K–Pg extinction was triggered by [[Chicxulub impactor|a massive comet/asteroid impact]] and its catastrophic effects on the global environment, including a lingering [[impact winter]] that halted [[photosynthesis]] in plants and plankton. However, some scientists maintain the extinction was caused or exacerbated by other factors, such as volcanic eruptions, climate change, and/or sea level change. Whatever the cause, many of the surviving animal groups diversified during the ensuing [[Paleogene]] period. Mammals in particular radiated into new forms such as horses, whales, bats, and primates.
