</div>'''''Daspletosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|æ|s|ˌ|p|l|iː|t|oʊ-|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s}} {{respell|das|PLEET|o|SAWR|əs}}; meaning "frightful lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in western North America between 77 and 74 million years ago, during the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. Fossils of the only named [[species]] (''D. torosus'') were found in [[Alberta]], although other possible species from Alberta and [[Montana]] await description. Including these [[undescribed taxon|undescribed species]] makes ''Daspletosaurus'' the most species-rich genus of tyrannosaur.

''Daspletosaurus'' is closely related to the much larger and more recent ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Like most known tyrannosaurids, it was a multi-tonne [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]] equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. ''Daspletosaurus'' had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, although they were proportionately longer than in other genera.

As an [[apex predator]], ''Daspletosaurus'' was at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on large dinosaurs like the [[ceratopsid]] ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and the [[hadrosaur]] ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]''. In some areas, ''Daspletosaurus'' coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'', though there is some evidence of [[niche differentiation]] between the two. While ''Daspletosaurus'' fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids, the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including [[social behavior]], diet, and life history.
