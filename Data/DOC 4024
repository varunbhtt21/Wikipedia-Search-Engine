</div>'''''Deinonychus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[coelurosauria]]n [[dinosaur]]s. There is one described species, ''Deinonychus antirrhopus''. This species, which could grow up to {{convert|3.4|m|ft}} long, lived during the early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], about 115â€“108&nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|million years ago]] (from the mid-[[Aptian]] to early [[Albian]] [[faunal stage|stages]]). Fossils have been recovered from the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Oklahoma]], in rocks of the [[Cloverly Formation]] and [[Antlers Formation]], though teeth that may belong to ''Deinonychus'' have been found much farther east in [[Maryland]].

[[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[John Ostrom]]'s study of ''Deinonychus'' in the late 1960s revolutionized the way scientists thought about dinosaurs, leading to the "[[dinosaur renaissance]]" and igniting the debate on whether dinosaurs were [[endothermy|warm-blooded]] or [[ectothermy|cold blooded]]. Before this, the popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding, reptilian giants. Ostrom noted the small body, sleek, horizontal posture, [[ratite]]-like spine, and especially the enlarged raptorial claws on the feet, which suggested an active, agile predator. The etymology "terrible claw" refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each hind foot. The fossil YPM 5205 preserves a large, strongly curved [[ungual]]. Ostrom looked at crocodile and bird claws and reconstructed the claw for YPM 5205 as over {{convert|150|mm|in}} long.

In both the Cloverly and Antlers formations, ''Deinonychus'' remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Teeth discovered associated with ''Tenontosaurus'' specimens imply they were hunted, or at least scavenged upon, by ''Deinonychus''. ('''[[Deinonychus|see more...]]''')
