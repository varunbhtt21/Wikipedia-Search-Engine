</div>'''Dinosaurs''' are a diverse group of animals that first appeared during the [[Triassic]] period, 231.4&nbsp;million years ago, and were the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s for 135&nbsp;million years, from the beginning of the [[Jurassic]] until the end of the [[Cretaceous]] (66 million years ago), when the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups. The [[fossil]] record indicates that [[bird]]s evolved from [[theropod]] dinosaurs and, consequently, they are considered a subgroup of dinosaurs by many paleontologists. Some birds survived the extinction event and their descendants continue the dinosaur lineage to the present day.

Using fossil evidence, [[paleontologist]]s have identified over 500 distinct [[genus|genera]] of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. While dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedalism|bipedal]], many extinct groups included [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] species. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as [[armour (zoology)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs. While modern birds are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs were large-bodied—the largest [[sauropod]] dinosaurs may have achieved lengths of 58 meters (190 feet). Many dinosaurs were quite small: ''[[Xixianykus]]'', for example, was only about 50&nbsp;cm (20&nbsp;in) long. ('''[[Dinosaur|see more...]]''')
