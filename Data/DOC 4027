</div>'''''Dromaeosauroides''''' is a [[genus]] of [[dromaeosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of what is now [[Denmark]]. It is known from two teeth, the first of which was found in 2000. Based on the [[holotype|first tooth]], the genus and species '''''Dromaeosauroides bornholmensis''''' was named in 2003. The genus name means "''[[Dromaeosaurus]]''-like", due to the similarity to the teeth of that genus, and the species name means "from Bornholm". The holotype tooth is {{convert|21.7|mm|in}} long, and the second tooth is {{convert|15|mm|in}}. They are curved and finely serrated. In life, ''Dromaeosauroides'' would have been {{convert|3|to|4|m|ft|sigfig=1}} in length, and weighed about {{convert|40|kg|lb}}. As a dromaeosaur it would have been feathered, and had a large sickle claw on its feet like its relatives ''Dromaeosaurus'' and ''[[Deinonychus]]''. Some teeth from Britain that have been referred to the genus ''[[Nuthetes]]'' may also belong to ''Dromaeosauroides''. [[Coprolites]] containing fish remains found in the Jydegaard Formation may belong to this animal.

''Dromaeosauroides'' was discovered in the [[Jydegaard Formation]] in [[Robbedale]], on the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is one of the oldest known dromaeosaurs in the world, and the first known uncontested dromaeosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Europe. It lived in a coastal lagoon environment with [[sauropods]], as evidenced by a possible [[titanosaur]] tooth. Remains and tracks of other dinosaurs have been found in several formations on Bornholm.
