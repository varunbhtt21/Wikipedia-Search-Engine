</div>'''''[[Edmontosaurus]]''''' is a [[genus]] of crestless duck-billed [[dinosaur]].  The [[fossil]]s of this animal have been found in rocks of western North America that date from the late [[Campanian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] to the end of the [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|Period]], between 73 and 65.5&nbsp;million years ago. It was one of the last non-[[bird|avian]] dinosaurs, and lived shortly before the [[Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event]].  ''Edmontosaurus'' was one of the largest [[hadrosaurid]]s, measuring up to {{convert|13|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing around {{convert|4.0|MT|ST}}.  It is known from several well-preserved specimens that include not only bones, but in some cases extensive skin impressions and possible gut contents.

''Edmontosaurus'' has a lengthy and complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history dating to the late 19th century. The [[type species]], ''E. regalis'', was named by [[Lawrence Lambe]] in 1917, although several other species that are now classified in ''Edmontosaurus'' were named earlier.  The best known of these is ''E. annectens'', originally named by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1892.

''Edmontosaurus'' was widely distributed across western North America.  The distribution of ''Edmontosaurus'' fossils suggests that it preferred coasts and [[coastal plain]]s.  It was an [[herbivory|herbivore]] that could move on both two legs and four.  Because it is known from several [[bone bed]]s, ''Edmontosaurus'' is thought to have lived in groups, and may have been migratory as well.
