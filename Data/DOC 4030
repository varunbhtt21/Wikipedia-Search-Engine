</div>'''''Gorgosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in western [[North America]] during the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], between about 76.6 and 75.1&nbsp;[[million years ago]]. [[Fossil]] remains have been found in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Alberta]] and possibly the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]]. [[Paleontologist]]s recognize only the [[type species|type]] [[species]], ''G. libratus'', although other species have been erroneously referred to the genus.

Like most known tyrannosaurids, ''Gorgosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]] weighing more than two [[metric ton]]s as an adult; dozens of large, sharp teeth lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. ''Gorgosaurus'' was most closely related to ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', and more distantly related to the larger ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Some experts consider ''G. libratus'' to be a species of ''Albertosaurus''; this would make ''Gorgosaurus'' a [[junior synonym]] of that genus.

''Gorgosaurus'' lived in a lush [[floodplain]] environment along the edge of an [[Western Interior Seaway|inland sea]]. It was an [[apex predator]] (meaning that it was at the top of its [[food chain]]), preying upon abundant [[ceratopsid]]s and [[hadrosaur]]s. In some areas, ''Gorgosaurus'' coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, ''[[Daspletosaurus]]''. Although these animals were roughly the same size, there is some evidence of [[niche differentiation]] between the two. ''Gorgosaurus'' is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens. These plentiful remains have allowed scientists to investigate its [[ontogeny]], [[Biological life cycle|life history]] and other aspects of its [[biology]]. ('''[[Gorgosaurus|see more...]]''')
