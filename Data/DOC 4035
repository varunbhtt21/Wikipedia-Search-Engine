</div>'''''Iguanodon''''' is a [[genus]] of [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] that existed roughly halfway between the first of the swift [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[hypsilophodont]]ids of the [[Middle Jurassic|mid-Jurassic]] and the [[hadrosaurid|duck-billed]] dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous. The genus was named in 1825 by [[England|English]] [[geologist]] [[Gideon Mantell]], based on fossil specimens that are now assigned to different genera and species. ''Iguanodon'' was the second type of dinosaur formally named based on fossil specimens, after ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. Together with ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', it was one of the three genera originally used to define [[Dinosaur]]ia. The genus ''Iguanodon'' belongs to the larger group [[Iguanodont]]ia, along with the duck-billed hadrosaurs. The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of this genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera.

Scientific understanding of ''Iguanodon'' has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from [[fossil]]s. The numerous specimens of this genus, including nearly complete skeletons from two well-known [[bone bed|bonebeds]], have allowed researchers to make informed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] regarding many aspects of the living animal, including feeding, movement, and social behaviour. As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, ''Iguanodon'' has occupied a small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.
