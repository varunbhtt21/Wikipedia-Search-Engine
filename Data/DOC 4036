</div>'''Lambeosaurus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|æ|m|b|i|.|oʊ-|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s}} {{respell|LAM|bee-ə|SOR|əs}}; meaning "[[Lawrence Lambe|Lambe's]] lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[hadrosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] that lived about 76 to 75&nbsp;million years ago, in the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[period (geology)|period]] ([[Campanian]]) of North America.  This [[bipedalism|bipedal]]/[[quadruped]]al, [[herbivore|herbivorous]] dinosaur is known for its distinctive hollow cranial crest, which in the best-known species resembled a [[hatchet]].  Several possible species have been named, from Canada, the United States, and Mexico, but only the two Canadian species are currently recognized as valid.

''Lambeosaurus'' was belatedly described in 1923 by [[William Parks (paleontologist)|William Parks]], over twenty years after the first material was studied by [[Lawrence Lambe]]. The genus has had a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, in part because small-bodied crested hadrosaurids now recognized as [[juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] were once thought to belong to their own genera and [[species]]. Currently, the various skulls assigned to the [[type species]] ''L. lambei'' are interpreted as showing age differences and [[sexual dimorphism]]. ''Lambeosaurus'' was closely related to the better known ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', which is found in slightly older rocks, as well as the less well-known genera ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Olorotitan]]''. All had unusual crests, which are now generally assumed to have served social functions like noisemaking and recognition. ('''[[Lambeosaurus|see more...]]''')
