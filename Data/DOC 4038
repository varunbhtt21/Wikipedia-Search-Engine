</div>'''''Majungasaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[abelisaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in [[Madagascar]] from 70 to 66 [[million years ago]], at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. Only one [[species]] ('''''Majungasaurus crenatissimus''''') has been identified. This dinosaur was briefly called ''Majungatholus'', a name which is now considered a [[junior synonym]] of ''Majungasaurus''.

Like other abelisaurids, ''Majungasaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[predator]] with a short snout. Although the forelimbs are not completely known, they were very short, while the hindlimbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very rough texture and thickened bone on the top of its snout, and the single rounded horn on the roof of its [[skull]], which was originally mistaken for the dome of a [[pachycephalosaur]]. It also had more [[teeth]] in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.

Known from several well-preserved skulls and abundant skeletal material, ''Majungasaurus'' has recently become one of the best-studied theropod dinosaurs from the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It appears to be most closely related to abelisaurids from [[India]] rather than [[South America]] or [[continent]]al [[Africa]], a fact which has important [[biogeography|biogeographical]] implications. ''Majungasaurus'' was the [[apex predator]] in its [[ecosystem]], mainly preying on [[sauropod]]s like ''[[Rapetosaurus]]'', and is also one of the few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]].
