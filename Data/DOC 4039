</div>'''''Nigersaurus''''' (meaning "[[Niger]] reptile") is a [[genus]] of [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] [[sauropod]] dinosaur that lived during the middle [[Cretaceous]] period, about 115 to 105 million years ago. It was discovered in the [[Elrhaz Formation]] in an area called [[Gadoufaoua]], in the [[Republic of Niger]]. Fossils of this dinosaur were first described in 1976, but it was only named in 1999 after further and more complete remains were found and described. The genus contains a single species, '''''Nigersaurus taqueti'''''.

''Nigersaurus'' was {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} long, which is small for a [[sauropod]], and had a short neck. It weighed around four tonnes, comparable to a modern [[elephant]]. Its skeleton was filled with air spaces connected to [[Physiology of dinosaurs#Air sacs|air sacs]], but the limbs were robustly built. Its skull was very specialised for feeding, with a wide muzzle filled with more than 500 teeth. The jaws may have borne a [[keratinous]] sheath. Unlike other [[tetrapod]]s, the tooth-bearing bones of its jaws were rotated transversely relative to the rest of the skull, so that all of its teeth were located far to the front.

''Nigersaurus'' was probably a [[browsing (herbivory)|browser]], and fed with its head close to the ground. It lived in a [[riparian]] habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as [[fern]]s, [[horsetails]], and [[angiosperms]]. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian [[megaherbivore]]s, as well as large [[theropods]] and [[crocodylomorph]]s.
