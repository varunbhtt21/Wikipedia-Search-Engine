</div>'''''Parasaurolophus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|s|ɔː|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|ə|f|ə|s|,_|-|ˌ|s|ɔːr|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|f|ə|s}}; meaning "near crested lizard" in reference to ''[[Saurolophus]]'') is a [[genus]] of [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in what is now [[North America]]  during the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], about 76.5–73&nbsp;million years ago. It was a [[herbivore]] that walked both as a [[bipedalism|biped]] and a [[quadruped]]. Three [[species]] are recognized: ''P. walkeri'' (the [[type species]]), ''P. tubicen'', and the short-crested ''P. cyrtocristatus''. Remains are known from [[Alberta]] ([[Canada]]), and [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]] ([[United States]]).  The genus was first described in 1922 by [[William Parks (paleontologist)|William Parks]] from a [[skull]] and partial skeleton found in Alberta.

''Parasaurolophus'' was a [[hadrosaurid]], part of a diverse [[family (biology)|family]] of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus is known for its large, elaborate cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the [[skull]]. ''[[Charonosaurus]]'' from [[China]], which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest. The crest has been much discussed by scientists; the consensus is that major functions included visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and [[thermoregulation]]. It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids, known from only a handful of good specimens. ('''[[Parasaurolophus|see more...]]''')
