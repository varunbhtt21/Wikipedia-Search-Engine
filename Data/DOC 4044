</div>'''''Psittacosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪ|t|ə|k|ə|ˈ|s|ɔr|ə|s}} {{respell|SIT|ə-kə|SOR|əs}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "[[parrot]] [[lizard]]") is a [[genus]] of [[psittacosaurid]] [[ceratopsia]]n [[dinosaur]] from the Early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] of what is now [[Asia]], between 124.2 to 100 [[million years ago]]. It is notable for being the most [[species]]-rich dinosaur genus. Nine to eleven species are recognized from [[fossil]]s found in different regions of modern-day China, Mongolia and Russia, with a possible additional species from Thailand.

All species of ''Psittacosaurus'' were [[gazelle]]-sized [[biped]]al [[herbivore]]s characterized by a high, powerful [[beak]] on the upper jaw. At least one species had long, quill-like structures on its tail and lower back, possibly serving a display function. Psittacosaurs were extremely early ceratopsians. Although they developed many novel adaptations, they shared many anatomical features with later ceratopsians such as ''[[Protoceratops]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]''.

''Psittacosaurus'' is not as familiar to the general public as its distant relative ''Triceratops'' but it is one of the most completely known dinosaur genera. Fossils of over 400 individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most different age classes are represented, from [[hatchling]] through to adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of ''Psittacosaurus'' growth rates and [[reproductive]] [[biology]]. The abundance of this dinosaur in the [[fossil record]] has led to the creation of the ''Psittacosaurus'' [[biochron]] for Lower Cretaceous sediments of [[east Asia]].
