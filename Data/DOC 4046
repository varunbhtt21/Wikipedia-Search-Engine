</div>'''''Styracosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ᵻ|ˌ|r|æ|k|ə|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s}} {{respell|stə|RAK|ə|SOR|əs}}; meaning "spiked lizard" from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''styrax/στύραξ'' "spike at the butt-end of a spear-shaft" and ''sauros/[[Wikt:σαῦρος|σαῦρος]]'' "lizard") was a [[genus]] of [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[ceratopsia]]n [[dinosaur]] from the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Campanian]] [[faunal stage|stage]]), about 75.5 to 75&nbsp;[[million years ago]]. It had four to six long horns extending from its [[neck frill]], a smaller horn on each of its cheeks, and a single horn protruding from its nose, which may have been up to 60&nbsp;centimetres (2&nbsp;ft) long and 15&nbsp;centimetres (6&nbsp;in) wide. The function or functions of the horns and frills have been debated for many years.

''Styracosaurus'' was a relatively large dinosaur, reaching lengths of 5.5&nbsp;metres (18&nbsp;ft) and weighing nearly 3&nbsp;[[ton]]s. It stood about 1.8&nbsp;meters (6&nbsp;ft) tall. ''Styracosaurus'' possessed four short legs and a bulky body. Its tail was rather short. The skull had a beak and shearing cheek teeth arranged in continuous dental batteries, suggesting that the animal sliced up plants. Like other ceratopsians, this dinosaur may have been a [[herd animal]], traveling in large groups, as suggested by [[bone bed|bonebed]]s.

Named by [[Lawrence Lambe]] in 1913, ''Styracosaurus'' is a member of the [[Centrosaurinae]]. One [[species]], ''S. albertensis'', is currently assigned to ''Styracosaurus''. Other species assigned to the genus have since been reassigned elsewhere. ('''[[Styracosaurus|see .]]'''
