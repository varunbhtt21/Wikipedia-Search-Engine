</div>'''''Tarbosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod dinosaur]] that flourished in [[Asia]] about 70 [[million years ago]], at the end of the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. [[Fossil]]s have been recovered in [[Mongolia]], with more fragmentary remains found further afield in parts of [[China]].

Although many [[species]] have been named, modern paleontologists recognize only one, ''T. bataar'', as valid. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the [[North America]]n genus ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''; this would make the genus ''Tarbosaurus'' redundant. ''Tarbosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'', if not [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]], are considered to be at least closely related genera.

Like most known tyrannosaurids, ''Tarbosaurus'' was a large [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]], weighing up to six tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth. It had a unique locking mechanism in its lower jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs.

''Tarbosaurus'' lived in a humid [[floodplain]] criss-crossed by river channels. In this environment, it was an [[apex predator]] at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the [[hadrosaur]] ''[[Saurolophus]]'' or the [[sauropod]] ''[[Nemegtosaurus]]''. ''Tarbosaurus'' is very well represented in the [[fossil]] record, known from dozens of specimens, including several complete skulls and skeletons. These remains have allowed scientific studies focusing on its [[phylogeny]], skull mechanics, and brain structure. ('''[[Tarbosaurus|see more...]]''')
