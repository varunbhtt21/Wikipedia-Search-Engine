</div>'''''Thescelosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|θ|ɛ|s|ᵻ|l|ə|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s}} {{respell|THESS|il-ə|SOR|əs}}; [[ancient Greek]] θέσκελος-/''theskelos-'' meaning "godlike", "marvelous", or "wondrous" and σαυρος/''sauros'' "lizard") was a [[genus]] of small [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] that appeared at the very end of the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[period (geology)|period]] in North America. It was a member of the last dinosaurian [[fauna]] before the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] around 66&nbsp;million years ago. The preservation and completeness of many of its specimens indicate that it may have preferred to live near streams.

This [[bipedalism|bipedal]] ornithopod is known from several partial skeletons and skulls that indicate it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0&nbsp;meters (8.2 to 13.1&nbsp;ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide hands, and a head with an elongate pointed snout. The [[morphology (biology)|form]] of the teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal. This genus of dinosaur is regarded as a specialized [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] ornithopod, traditionally described as a [[hypsilophodont]], but more recently recognized as distinct from ''[[Hypsilophodon]]''. Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three currently are recognized as [[valid name (zoology)|valid]]: the [[type species]] ''T. neglectus'', as well as ''T. garbanii'' and ''T. assiniboiensis''.

The genus attracted media attention in 2000, when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in [[South Dakota]], United States, was interpreted as including a [[fossil]]ized heart. There was much discussion over whether the remains were of a heart. Many scientists now doubt the identification of the object and the implications of such an identification.
