</div>'''''Triceratops''''' is a [[genus]] of [[herbivorous]] [[Ceratopsidae|ceratopsid]] [[dinosaur]] that first appeared during the late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], about 68 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] in what is now [[North America]]. It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extinct in the [[Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago. Its head bore a large bony [[neck frill|frill]] and three [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] while its body was massive and four-legged. It shared the landscape with and was probably [[predation|preyed upon]] by the fearsome ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''.

The exact placement of the ''Triceratops'' genus within the ceratopsid group has been debated by [[paleontology|paleontologists]]. Two [[species]], ''T. horridus'' and ''T. prorsus'', are considered valid. Research published in 2010 suggests that the contemporaneous ''[[Torosaurus]]'', a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents ''Triceratops'' in its mature form, a view not accepted by all researchers. ''Triceratops'' has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889, including at least one complete individual skeleton. Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found.

The function of the frills and three distinctive facial horns has long inspired debate. Traditionally these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of blood vessels in the skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, [[mating|courtship]] and dominance displays, much like the [[antler]]s and horns of modern [[reindeer]], [[mountain goat]]s, or [[rhinoceros beetle]]s.
