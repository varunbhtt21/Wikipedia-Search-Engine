</div>'''''Tyrannosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[coelurosaur]]ian [[theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]. The [[species]] '''''Tyrannosaurus rex''''' is commonly abbreviated to '''''T.&nbsp;rex'''''. It lived throughout what is now western North America. Fossils are found in a variety of [[geologic formation|rock formations]] dating to the [[Maastrichtian]] age of the upper [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], 67 to 66&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]]. It was among the last non-[[aves|avian]] dinosaurs to exist before the [[Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event]]. 

Like other [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]], ''Tyrannosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[carnivore]] with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hindlimbs, ''Tyrannosaurus'' forelimbs were short and bore two clawed digits. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' in [[dinosaur size|size]] it is one of the largest known land predators in history. The most complete specimen measures up to {{convert|12.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, up to {{convert|4|m|ft}} tall at the hips, and up to {{convert|6.8|MT|ST}} in weight. ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' would have been an [[apex predator]], preying upon [[hadrosaur]]s, [[ceratopsia]]ns, and possibly sauropods.

More than 50&nbsp;specimens of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' have been identified, some of which are nearly complete skeletons. [[Soft tissue]] and [[protein]]s have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology. Its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] is also controversial: some scientists consider ''[[Tarbosaurus|Tarbosaurus bataar]]'' from Asia to be a second species of ''Tyrannosaurus'' and others maintaining ''Tarbosaurus'' as a separate genus.
