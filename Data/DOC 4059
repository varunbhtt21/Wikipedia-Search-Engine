</div>'''''Velociraptor''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived approximately 75 to 71&nbsp;[[million years ago]] during the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[Epoch (geology)|Epoch]]. Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past.  The [[type species]] is ''V. mongoliensis''; [[fossil]]s of this species have been discovered in [[Mongolia]].  A second species, ''V. osmolskae'', was named in 2008 for skull material from [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]].

Like other dromaeosaurids like ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Achillobator]]'', ''Velociraptor'' was a [[biped]]al, [[feather]]ed [[carnivore]] with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped [[claw]] on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle [[predation|prey]]. ''Velociraptor'' can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low [[skull]], with an upturned snout.

''Velociraptor'' (commonly shortened to "raptor") is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' motion picture series. In the films it was shown with anatomical inaccuracies, including being much larger than it was in reality and without feathers. Some of these inaccuracies, along with the head's larger dome in the movies may suggest that the dinosaurs in the movies were actually modeled on ''[[Deinonychus]]''. Velociraptor is also well known to [[paleontology|paleontologists]], with over a dozen described fossil skeletons, the most of any dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous specimen preserves a ''Velociraptor'' locked in combat with a ''[[Protoceratops]]''. ('''[[Velociraptor|see more...]]''')
