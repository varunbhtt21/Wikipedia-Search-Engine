</div>'''Abelisauridae''' (meaning "Abel's lizards") is a [[family (biology)|family]] (or [[clade]]) of [[ceratosauria]]n [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. Abelisaurids thrived during the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], on the ancient southern [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]], and today their [[fossil]] remains are found on the modern [[continent]]s of [[Africa]] and [[South America]], as well as on the [[India]]n [[subcontinent]] and the island of [[Madagascar]]. Abelisaurids first appear in the fossil record of the early middle [[Jurassic]] period, and at least one species (''[[Majungasaurus crenatissimus]]'') survived until the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era 66 million years ago.

Like most theropods, abelisaurids were [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[biped]]s. They were characterized by stocky hindlimbs and extensive ornamentation of the [[skull]] bones, with grooves and pits. In many abelisaurids, like ''[[Carnotaurus]]'', the forelimbs are [[vestigial]], the skull is shorter and bony crests grows above the eyes. Most of the known abelisaurids would have been between 5 to 9&nbsp;meters (17 to 30&nbsp;ft) in length, from snout to tip of tail, with a new and as yet unnamed specimen from northwestern Turkana in Kenya, Africa reaching a possible length of 11â€“12 meters (36 to 39 feet). Before becoming well known, fragmentary abelisaurid remains were occasionally misidentified as possible South American [[tyrannosaurid]]s. ('''[[Abelisauridae|see more...]]''')
