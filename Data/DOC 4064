</div>'''''Alioramus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|i|.|oʊ-|ˈ|r|eɪ|m|ə|s}}; meaning 'different branch') is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s from the [[Late Cretaceous]] period of [[Asia]]. The [[type species]], ''A. remotus'', is known from a partial [[skull]] and three [[metatarsal|foot bones]] recovered from [[Mongolia]]n sediments which were deposited in a humid [[floodplain]] about 70&nbsp;[[million years ago]]. These remains were named and described by [[Soviet]] paleontologist [[Sergei Kurzanov]] in 1976.  A second species, ''A. altai'', known from a much more complete skeleton, was named and described by [[Stephen L. Brusatte]] and colleagues in 2009. Its relationships to other tyrannosaurid genera are unclear, with some evidence supporting a hypothesis that ''Alioramus'' is closely related to the contemporary species ''[[Tarbosaurus bataar]]''.

''Alioramus'' were [[biped]]al like all known theropods, and their sharp teeth indicate that they were [[carnivore]]s. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like ''Tarbosaurus bataar'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The genus ''Alioramus'' is characterized by a row of five bony crests along the top of the snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.
