</div>'''''Ampelosaurus''''' is a [[titanosauria]]n [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] hailing from the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] of what is now [[Europe]]. Its type species is ''A. atacis'', named by Le Loeuff in 1995. A possible unnamed species has given ''Ampelosaurus'' an age reaching to the latest Cretaceous, from about 70 to 66 million years ago.

Like most sauropods, it would have had a long neck and tail but it also carried [[Armour (zoology)|armor]] in the form of [[osteoderms]].  The blade of the scapula, contrary to most titanosaurs, is triangular. The blade narrows at one end instead of showing an expansion like most other genera. Titanosaurians were a flourishing group of sauropod dinosaurs during [[Cretaceous]] times. The Spanish locality from the latest Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with ''A. atacis'' from France. However, it appeared to differ from ''A. atacis'' in some traits also. The specimen has been provisionally identified as ''Ampelosaurus'' sp..

''Ampelosaurus'' lived alongside many other animals. Over 8500 specimens have been found alongside it, including gastropods, bivalves, crocodiles, other sauropods, plants and invertebrates in the [[Villalba de la Sierra Formation|Villalba de la Sierra]], [[Gres de Saint-Chinian]], [[Marnes Rouges Inférieures Formation|Marnes Rouges Inférieures]] and [[Gres de Labarre Formation|Gres de Labarre]] formations. Recent attention has made ''Ampelosaurus'' one of the most well-known dinosaurs known from [[France]]. ('''[[Ampelosaurus|see more...]]''')
