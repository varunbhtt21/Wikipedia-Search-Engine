Although a complete skeleton has not been discovered and several other dinosaurs are represented by more extensive fossil material, ''Ankylosaurus'' is often considered the [[archetype|archetypal]] [[Armour (zoology)|armored]] dinosaur. Other ankylosaurids shared its well-known features—the heavily armored body and massive bony tail club—but ''Ankylosaurus'' was the largest known member of the family.
