</div>'''''Balaur bondoc''''' is a [[species]] of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s which lived in what is now [[Romania]] during the late [[Cretaceous]] period. It is the [[type species]] of the [[monotypic]] [[genus]] ''Balaur'' which was described by scientists in August 2010, and was named after the ''[[balaur]]'' ({{IPA-ro|baˈla.ur}}), a dragon of [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]].  The specific name ''bondoc'' means "stocky", so ''Balaur bondoc'' means "Stocky dragon" in Romanian. This name refers to the greater musculature that ''Balaur'' had compared to its relatives. The genus is known from two partial skeletons including the [[type specimen]].

Seventy million years ago, world sea levels were higher, and the location where its fossils are found was a part of the [[European Archipelago]] called [[Hațeg Island]] which is also referred to as the "Island of the Dwarf Dinosaurs". Unlike other early members of the group [[Paraves]], which includes ''[[Velociraptor]]'', ''[[Troodon]]'', and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', this theropod had not just one but two large, retractable, sickle-shaped claws on each foot, and its limbs were proportionally shorter and heavier than those of its relatives. As with other dinosaurs from Hațeg, such as ''[[Magyarosaurus]]'', a dwarf [[sauropod]], its strange features have been argued to show the effects of its island habitat on its evolution.
