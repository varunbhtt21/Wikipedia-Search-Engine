</div>'''Ceratopsia''' or '''Ceratopia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛr|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|p|s|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛr|ə|ˈ|t|oʊ|p|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: "horned faces") is a group of [[herbivore|herbivorous]], beaked [[dinosaur]]s that thrived in what are now [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]], during the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], although ancestral forms lived earlier, in the [[Jurassic]]. The earliest known ceratopsian, ''[[Yinlong downsi]]'', lived between 161.2 and 155.7 million years ago. The last ceratopsian species became extinct in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], {{ma|Paleogene|million years ago}}.

Early members of the ceratopsian group, such as ''[[Psittacosaurus]]'', were small [[biped]]al animals. Later members, including [[Ceratopsidae|ceratopsids]] like ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'', became very large [[quadruped]]s and developed elaborate facial [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from [[predation|predators]], they may also have been used for [[display (zoology)|display]], [[thermoregulation]], the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1&nbsp;meter (3&nbsp;ft) and 23&nbsp;kilograms (50&nbsp;lb) to over 9&nbsp;meters (30&nbsp;ft) and 5,400&nbsp;kg (12,000&nbsp;lb).

''Triceratops'' are by far the best-known ceratopsians to the general public. It is traditional for ceratopsian [[genus]] names to end in "''-ceratops''", although this is not always the case. One of the first named genera was ''[[Ceratops]]'' itself, which lent its name to the group, although it is considered a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' today as its fossil remains have no distinguishing characteristics that are not also found in other ceratopsians.
