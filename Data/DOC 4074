</div>'''Dromaeosauridae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[bird]]-like [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. They were small- to medium-sized feathered [[carnivore]]s that flourished in the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. The name Dromaeosauridae means 'running lizards', from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''dromeus'' (''δρομευς'') meaning 'runner' and ''sauros'' (''σαυρος'') meaning 'lizard'. In informal usage they are often called '''raptors''' (after ''[[Velociraptor]]''), a term popularized by the film ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''; a few types include the term "raptor" directly in their name and have come to emphasize their supposed bird-like habits.

Dromaeosaurid fossils have been found in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Argentina]], and [[Antarctica]]. They first appeared in the mid-Jurassic Period (late [[Bathonian]] stage, about 164 [[million years ago]]) and survived until the end of the Cretaceous ([[Maastrichtian]] stage, 66 ma), existing for over 100 million years, up until the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The presence of dromaeosaurs as early as the Middle Jurassic has been confirmed by the discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils have been found from this period.
