</div>'''''Gryposaurus''''' (meaning "hooked-nosed ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''grypos'') [[lizard]]"; sometimes incorrectly translated as  "[[griffin]] ([[Latin]] ''gryphus'') lizard") was a [[genus]] of [[hadrosaur|duckbilled]] [[dinosaur]] that lived about 83 to 75.5 million years ago, in the [[Late Cretaceous]] (late [[Santonian]] to late [[Campanian]] [[faunal stage|stages]]) of [[North America]].  Named species of ''Gryposaurus'' are known from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] in [[Alberta]], Canada and the Lower [[Two Medicine Formation]] in [[Montana]] and the [[Kaiparowits Formation]] of [[Utah]] in the United States.

''Gryposaurus'' is similar to ''[[Kritosaurus]]'', and for many years was regarded as the same genus.  It is known from numerous skulls, some skeletons, and even some skin impressions that show it to have had pyramidal scales pointing out along the midline of the back. It is most easily distinguished from other duckbills by its narrow arching nasal hump, sometimes described as similar to a "[[hooknose|Roman nose]]," and which may have been used for species or sexual identification, and/or combat with individuals of the same species. A large [[bipedalism|bipedal]]/[[quadrupedal]] [[herbivore]] around 9&nbsp;meters long (30&nbsp;ft), it may have preferred [[river]] settings. ('''[[Gryposaurus|see more...]]''')
