</div>'''Heterodontosauridae''' ("different-toothed lizards") is a [[family (biology)|family]] of early [[ornithischia]]n [[dinosaur]]s that were likely among the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] (primitive) members of the group. Although their [[fossil]]s are rare, they lived around the globe beginning in the late [[Triassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], and a few late-surviving species persisted into the [[Early Cretaceous]].

Heterodontosaurids were [[fox]]-sized dinosaurs less than 2&nbsp;meters (6.6&nbsp;ft) in length, including a long tail. They are known mainly for their characteristic teeth, including enlarged [[canine (tooth)|canine]]-like tusks and cheek teeth adapted for chewing, [[Analogy (biology)|analogous]] to those of Cretaceous [[hadrosaurid]]s. Their diet was [[herbivore|herbivorous]] or possibly [[omnivore|omnivorous]]. ('''[[Heterodontosauridae|see more...]]''')
