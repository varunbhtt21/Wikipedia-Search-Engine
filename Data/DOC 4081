</div>'''''Hypacrosaurus''''' (meaning "near the highest lizard" [Greek υπο-, ''hypo-'' = less + ακρος, ''akros'', high], because it was almost but not quite as large as ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'') was a [[genus]] of [[hadrosaurid|duckbill]] [[dinosaur]] similar in appearance to ''[[Corythosaurus]]''.  Like ''Corythosaurus'', it had a tall, hollow rounded crest, although not as large and straight. It is known from the remains of two species that spanned 75 to 67 million years ago, in the [[Late Cretaceous]] of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and [[Montana]], [[United States]], and is the latest hollow-crested duckbill known from good remains in [[North America]]. It was an obscure genus until the description of [[nest]]s, [[egg (biology)|eggs]], and [[hatchling]]s belonging to ''H. stebingeri'' in the 1990s. ('''[[Hypacrosaurus|see more...]]''')
