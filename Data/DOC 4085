</div>'''''Hypsibema missouriensis''''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɪ|p|s|ᵻ|ˈ|b|iː|m|ə|_|m|ᵻ|ˌ|z|ʊər|i|ˈ|ɛ|n|s|ɪ|s}}; originally '''''Neosaurus missouriensis''''', first renamed to '''''Parrosaurus missouriensis''''', also spelled '''''Hypsibema missouriense''''') is a species of [[herbivore|plant-eating]] [[dinosaur]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Hypsibema]]'', and the [[state dinosaur]] of the [[U.S. state]] [[Missouri]]. One of the few official state dinosaurs, bones of the species were discovered in 1942, at what later became known as the Chronister Dinosaur Site near [[Glen Allen, Missouri]]. The remains of ''Hypsibema missouriensis'' at the site, which marked the first known discovery of dinosaur remains in Missouri, are the only ones to have ever been found. Although first thought to be a [[sauropod]], later study determined that it was a [[hadrosaur]], or "duck-billed" dinosaur, whose snouts bear likeness to ducks' bills. Some of the species' bones found at the Chronister Dinosaur Site are housed in [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Smithsonian Institution]]. ('''[[Hypsibema missouriensis|see more...]]''')
