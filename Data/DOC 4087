</div>'''''Kritosaurus''''' is an incompletely known but historically important [[genus]] of [[hadrosaurid]] (duck-billed) [[dinosaur]]. It lived about 74-70 million years ago, in the [[Late Cretaceous]] of [[North America]]. The name means "separated lizard" (referring to the arrangement of the cheek bones in an incomplete [[type (biology)|type]] skull), but is often mistranslated as "noble lizard" in reference to the presumed "[[hooknose|Roman nose]]" (in the original specimen, the nasal region was fragmented and disarticulated, and was originally restored flat). Despite the dearth of material, this [[herbivore]] appeared frequently in dinosaur books until the 1990s, although what was usually represented was the much more completely known ''[[Gryposaurus]]'', then thought to be a synonym.
