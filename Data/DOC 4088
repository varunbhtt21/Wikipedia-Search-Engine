</div>'''''Pachycephalosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|k|ᵻ|ˌ|s|ɛ|f|ə|l|ə|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s}}; meaning "thick headed lizard," from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''pachys-/παχυς-'' "thick", ''kephale/κεφαλη'' "head" and ''sauros/σαυρος'' "lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[Pachycephalosauria|pachycephalosaurid]] [[dinosaur]]s. The [[type species]], ''P. wyomingensis'', is the only known [[species]]. It lived during the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Maastrichtian]] [[faunal stage|stage]]) of what is now [[North America]]. Remains have been excavated in [[Montana]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Wyoming]]. It was an [[herbivore|herbivorous]] or [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] creature which is primarily known from a single skull and a few extremely thick [[skull roof]]s, though a more complete fossils havebeen found in recent years. ''Pachycephalosaurus'' was one of the last non-avian dinosaurs before the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Another dinosaur, '''''Tylosteus''''' of western North America, has been [[synonym (biology)|synonymized]] with ''Pachycephalosaurus''.

Like other pachycephalosaurids, ''Pachycephalosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[omnivore]] with an extremely thick [[skull]] roof. It possessed long hindlimbs and small forelimbs. ''Pachycephalosaurus'' is the largest known pachycephalosaur.

The thick skull domes of ''Pachycephalosaurus'' and related genera gave rise to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurs used their skulls in intraspecific combat. This hypothesis has been disputed in recent years. ('''[[Pachycephalosaurus|see more...]]''')
