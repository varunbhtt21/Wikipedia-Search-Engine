</div>'''''Prosaurolophus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|s|ɔː|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|ə|f|ə|s}}; meaning "before ''[[Saurolophus]]''", in comparison to the later dinosaur with a similar head crest) is a [[genus]] of [[hadrosaur]]id (or duck-billed) [[dinosaur]] from the [[Late Cretaceous]] of [[North America]]. It is known from the remains of at least 25 individuals belonging to two species, including skulls and skeletons, but it remains obscure. Around 9&nbsp;meters long (29.5&nbsp;[[foot (length)|ft]]), its fossils have been found in the [[Campanian|late Campanian]]-age [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] in [[Alberta]], and the roughly contemporaneous [[Two Medicine Formation]] in [[Montana]], dating to around 76-75&nbsp;million years ago. Its most recognizable feature is a small solid crest formed by the [[nasal bone]]s, sticking up in front of the eyes. 

The [[type species]] is ''P. maximus'', described by American paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1916. A second species, ''P. blackfeetensis'', was described by [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] of the [[Museum of the Rockies]] in 1992. The two species are differentiated mainly by crest size and skull proportions. ('''[[Prosaurolophus|see more...]]''')
