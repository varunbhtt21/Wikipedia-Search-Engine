</div>'''''Rajasaurus''''' (meaning "king" or "king of lizards") is a [[genus]] of carnivorous [[abelisaur]]ian [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] with an unusual head crest. Between 1982 and 1984, its [[fossil]]ized bones were discovered by Suresh Srivastava of the [[Geological Survey of India]] (GSI). Excavated from the [[Narmada River]] valley in Rahioli in the [[Kheda district]] of [[Gujarat]], [[India]], the find was announced as a new genus of dinosaur by American and Indian scientists on [[2003 in paleontology|August 13, 2003]].

[[Paleontologist]]s [[Paul Sereno]] of the [[University of Chicago]], [[Jeffrey A. Wilson|Jeff Wilson]] of the [[University of Michigan]], and Srivastava worked together as an Indo&ndash;American group to study the Narmada River fossils. The fossils represented the partial skeleton of the new species ''Rajasaurus narmadensis'', which means "princely lizard from the Narmada Valley."
The fossilized bones of ''Rajasaurus'' have also been found in the upriver region of the Narmada, at [[Jabalpur]], in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]].('''[[Rajasaurus|see more...]]''')
