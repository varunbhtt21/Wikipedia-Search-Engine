'''''Bucculatrix mirnae''''' is a [[moth]] in the [[Bucculatricidae]] family. It is found in the [[Azapa Valley]] in northern [[Chile]].

The length of the forewings is {{convert|2.78|-|3.33|mm}}. The forewings are covered with light reddish-brown scales. The hindwings are creamy white.

The larvae feed on ''[[Baccharis salicifolia]]''. They [[leaf miner|mine]] the leaves of their host plant. Older [[larva]]e feed externally, skeletonizing the leaves. Pupation takes place in a [[cocoon (silk)|cocoon]], mostly spun on either twigs or dry leaves of the host plant.
