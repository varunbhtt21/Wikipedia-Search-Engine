</div>'''''Saurolophus''''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɔː|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|ə|f|ə|s}}; meaning "lizard crest") is a [[genus]] of large [[hadrosaurinae|hadrosaurine]] [[hadrosaurid|duckbill]] that lived about 69.5–68.5&nbsp;million years ago, in the [[Late Cretaceous]] of [[North America]] and [[Asia]]; it is one of the few genera of [[dinosaur]]s known from multiple continents. It is distinguished by a spike-like crest which projects up and back from the skull. ''Saurolophus'' was an [[herbivorous]] dinosaur which could move about either [[biped]]ally or [[quadruped]]ally.

The [[type species]], ''S. osborni'', was described by [[Barnum Brown]] in 1912 from [[Canada|Canadian]] fossils. A second valid species, ''S. angustirostris'', is represented by numerous specimens from Mongolia, and was described by [[Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky]]. A third species, ''S. morrisi'' from [[California]], was described in 2013, and a fourth species, ''S. kryschtofovici'' from [[China]], is considered [[nomen dubium|dubious]].
