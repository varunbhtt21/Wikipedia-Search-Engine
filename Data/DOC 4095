</div>'''''Sauropelta''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɔː|r|oʊ-|ˈ|p|ɛ|l|t|ə}} {{respell|SAWR|o|PEL|tə}}; meaning 'lizard shield') is a [[genus]] of [[nodosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] that existed in the Early [[Cretaceous Period]] of [[North America]]. One [[species]] (''S. edwardsorum'') has been named although others may have existed. Anatomically, ''Sauropelta'' is one of the most well-understood nodosaurids, with [[fossil]]ized remains recovered in the [[U.S.]] states of [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], and possibly [[Utah]]. It is also the earliest known genus of nodosaurid; most of its remains are found in the [[Cloverly Formation]], which dates to about 108.05±0.2&nbsp;[[Mega-annum|Ma]] ([[million years ago]]).

It was a medium-sized nodosaurid, measuring about 5&nbsp;meters (16.5&nbsp;ft) long. ''Sauropelta'' had a distinctively long tail which made up about half of its body length. Although its body was smaller than a modern [[black rhinoceros]], ''Sauropelta'' was about the same mass, weighing in at about 1,500&nbsp;[[kilograms]] (3,300&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]). The extra weight was largely due to its extensive bony [[Armour (zoology)|body armor]], including the characteristically large spines projecting from its neck. ('''[[Sauropelta|see more...]]''')
