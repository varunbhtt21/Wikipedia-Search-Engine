</div>'''''Sinoceratops''''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|aɪ|n|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɛr|ə|t|ɒ|p|s}} is a [[extinct]] [[genus]] of [[ceratopsia]]n [[dinosaur]] that lived approximately 72 to 66 [[million years ago]] during the latter part of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] in what is now [[Shandong province]] in [[China]]. It was named in [[2010 in paleontology|2010]] by [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]] ''et al.'' for three skulls from [[Zhucheng]], China. Its name means "Chinese horned face from Zhucheng", after the location of its discovery.

''Sinoceratops'' was a medium sized, averagely-built, ground-dwelling, [[quadrupedal]] [[herbivore]]. It could grow up to an estimated {{Convert|6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|m|ft}} high, and weigh up to {{convert|2|tonne|ton}}. It was the first [[ceratopsid]] dinosaur discovered in China, and the only ceratopsid known from Asia. All other [[centrosaurines]], and all [[chasmosaurines]], are known from fossils discovered in North America, except for possibly ''[[Turanoceratops]]''. ''Sinoceratops'' is also significant because it is one of the largest known centrosaurines, and is much larger than any other known [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] members of this group.

''Sinoceratops'' existed in the [[Xingezhuang Formation]] during the late Cretaceous. It lived alongside leptoceratopsids, saurolophines, and tyrannosaurines. The most common creature in the formation was ''[[Shantungosaurus]]'', to whom most of the material has been assigned to. The animals living alongside ''Sinoceratops'' and ''Shantungosaurus'' were ''[[Zhuchengceratops]]'', ''[[Huaxiaosaurus]]'', and ''[[Zhuchengtyrannus]]''. ('''[[Sinoceratops|see more...]]''')
