</div>'''''Sinosauropteryx''''' is a [[compsognathid]] [[dinosaur]]. Described in 1996, it was the first dinosaur taxon outside of [[Avialae]] (birds and their immediate relatives) to be found with evidence of [[feather]]s. It was covered with a coat of very simple filament-like feathers. Structures that indicate colouration have also been preserved for some of the feathers, which makes ''Sinosauropteryx'' the first non-avialian dinosaurs where colouration has been determined. Colouration includes a reddish and light banded tail.

''Sinosauropteryx'' was a small theropod with an unusually long tail and short arms. The longest known specimen reaches up to 1.07 m (3.5 ft) in length, with an estimated weight of 0.55 kg (1.2 lb). It was a close relative of the similar but older genus ''[[Compsognathus]]'', both genera belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Compsognathidae]]. Only one [[species]] of ''Sinosauropteryx'' has been named: ''S. prima'', meaning "first" in reference to its status as the first feathered non-avialian dinosaur species discovered.

''Sinosauropteryx'' lived in what is now northeastern [[China]] during the early [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|period]]. It was among the first dinosaurs discovered from the [[Yixian Formation]] in [[Liaoning Province]], and was a member of [[Jehol Biota]]. Well-preserved fossils of this species illustrate many aspects of their biology, such as their diet and reproduction. ('''[[Sinosauropteryx|see more...]]''')
