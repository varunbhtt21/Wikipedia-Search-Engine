</div>'''''Spinosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]] which lived in what is now [[North Africa]], from the lower [[Albian]] to lower [[Cenomanian]] [[faunal stage|stages]] of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], about 112 to 97&nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]]. This genus was first known from [[Egypt]]ian remains discovered in 1912 and described by [[Germans|German]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Ernst Stromer]] in 1915. The best known species is ''S. aegyptiacus'' from Egypt, although a potential second species ''S. maroccanus'' has been recovered from [[Morocco]].

''Spinosaurus'' may be the largest of all known [[carnivore|carnivorous]] dinosaurs. Estimates published in 2005 and 2007 suggest that it was {{convert|12.6|to|18|m|ft|0}} in length and {{convert|7|to|20.9|t|short ton}} in weight. The [[skull]] of ''Spinosaurus'' was long and narrow like that of a modern [[crocodilia]]n. ''Spinosaurus'' is known to have eaten fish; evidence suggests that it lived both on land and in water like a modern crocodilian. The distinctive [[spinous process|spines]] of ''Spinosaurus'', which were long extensions of the [[vertebra]]e, grew to at least {{convert|1.65|m|ft|sp=us}} long and were likely to have had skin connecting them, forming a [[sail (anatomy)|sail-like structure]]. Multiple functions have been put forward for this structure, including [[thermoregulation]] and display. ('''[[Spinosaurus|see more...]]''')
