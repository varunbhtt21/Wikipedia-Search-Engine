Text : [[File:Donausteig Rastplatz.jpg|thumb|Rest area with a scenic view of the ''Donausteig''.]]

The '''Donausteig''' is a hiking trail that passes through parts of [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]]. Since the summer of 2010, the trail follows both banks of the [[Danube]], from [[Passau]] via [[Linz]] up to St. Nikola and [[Grein, Austria|Grein]].

== Description ==
The Donausteig trail is a non-alpine, [[long-distance trail]]. It has a length of around 450&nbsp;km, with 23 stages, and it extends through 5 Bavarian and 40 [[municipality|Austrian municipalities]]. The ''Donausteig'' runs mostly through natural landscapes, and includes popular scenic spots and viewing areas.<ref name="Donausteig">{{cite web |title=The Donausteig – simply legendary! |url=http://www.passauer-land.de/en/donausteig-simply-legendary/|accessdate= 2014-04-14}}</ref>

In addition to the main routes, 41 official Donausteig routes have been marked; 135 start, rest and viewing areas have been set up along the trail; and 4000 trail markers have been set up. In Passau, the route connects to the "Golden Trail", which was opened in 2007.<ref name="Donausteig"/>

As well as the [[EV6 The Rivers Route|Danube Cycle Path]], the ‘Boat Trip along the Danube’ and ‘Culture on the Danube’, the Donausteig is a project created by the Danube Tourist Board of [[Upper Austria]], with its 37 member municipalities. It was partly funded by the public purse (EU, Country, Municipality).<ref name="Hiking Tourism">{{cite web |title=Status Quo analysis of hiking tourism along the Danube |url= http://www.donausteig.com/fileadmin/user_upload/danube/Projekte/DanubeHIKE/DanubeHIKE_Summary-report_ENG.pdf|accessdate= 2014-04-14}}</ref>

== Course of the Trail ==
The ''Donausteig'' trail runs along the Danube River, starting in Passau and passing through [[Linz]], the former European Capital of Culture, to Grein, an Upper Austrian town with an altitude of 218 meters above sea level, the lowest in the region.

In several day-long sections, hiking enthusiasts can walk along the ''Donausteig’s'' 450 kilometers-long track. Starting in Passau and passing the chapel ''Maria am Walde '', one arrives at [[Freinberg]], from where one can enjoy the ''Dreiflüsseblick '', an elevated view of the surrounding area. From there, the path leads through the nature reserve called ''Kleines Kößlbachtal '', past the ''Donauleiten '' and towards [[Vichtenstein]]. The ''Donausteig'' then leads right alongside the Danube to ''Wesenufer''. From there it continues to the ''Vier-Viertel-Blick '' and the ''Schlögener Blick'', offering a great view of the boldest natural highlight of the Donausteig: the ''Schlögener Schlinge''. From [[Aschach an der Donau|Aschach]], the hiking trail then leads up to the castle ruin ''Burgruine Schaunberg'', to [[Eferding]] and [[Wilhering]]. From there one has the possibility to cross the Danube on a ferry to [[Ottensheim]].

The next section of the ''Donausteig'' trail contains several highlights such as the ''[[Pöstlingberg]]'', which has one of the steepest adhesion railways in all over Europe: the ''[[Pöstlingbergbahn]]''. The next big stop along the trail is Linz, which offers interesting sightseeing spots such as its historic old town, the new and old dome, the baroque ''Linzer Hauptplatz''(town square), the [[Ars Electronica Center]], the [[Lentos Art Museum]], the Castle Museum Linz, the city museum Nordico, the [[Brucknerhaus]], the Linz State Theatre and the ''[[Voestalpine]] Stahlwelt ''.

Starting in Linz, one can follow the gravel paths leading through the cultural landscape to [[Rohrbach in Oberösterreich|Rohrbach]], St. Florian and eventually [[Enns (town)|Enns]]. Taking the ferry from Enghagen, one can reach [[Mauthausen]] and hike through the flat landscape along field paths on to [[Perg]]. From the town’s central square the ''Donausteig'' continues to [[Baumgartenberg]], to [[Saxen]] via the [[Burg Clam]] and the ''Klamschlucht'', and eventually to [[Grein, Austria|Grein]] via the ''Gobelwarte''. The final legs of the trail lead the hiker via St. Nikola and Sarmingstein to [[Waldhausen]] and finally back to Grein via [[Bad Kreuzen]].

== Donausteigrunden (circular trails) ==
The 41 ''Donausteigrunden'' were created for frequent hikers. They branch off from the main route of the ''Donausteig'' and lead into the more remote countryside and to numerous viewing points.

=== Wilhering – Bauern- und Holzknechtrunde ===
The starting point for the ''Bauern- und Holzknechtrunde'' (farmers and woodcuttles tour) is the ferry terminal at [[Wilhering]]. From the main road, in direction of Linz, the circular trail runs through the center of the town and onto a field path. From a little hill a beautiful view across [[Ottensheim]] and Wilhering can be enjoyed. The trail continues from there uphill through the Kürnberger forest and then downhill again on a wooden natural trail to the settlement of Mühlbach. Over plain fields and small hills the trail leads back to the Danube. At the Ottensheim-Wilhering power station, the circular trail reconnects with the ''Donausteig''and leads back to Wilhering.

=== City trail Pöstlingberg ===
Starting point is the information board ''Donaussteig/Urfahrmarkt'', adjacent to the [[Ars Electronica Center]]. From here a direct view down Linz’s cultural mile can be enjoyed, with the [[Lentos Art Museum]], the [[Brucknerhaus]] and the Linz Castle. The trail then leads alongside the Danube to the new town hall, before arriving at the street ''Obere Donaustraße''. Subsequently, the trail crosses the path of the ''[[Pöstlingbergbahn]]'', the steepest adhesion railway in Europe. Turning left, the path continues along the ''Schablederweg'', which runs alongside the tracks of the ''Pöstlingbergbahn'' for the most part. Not far from here, the zoo ''Linzer Tiergarten'' welcomes animal lovers.
The trail continues all the way up to the 537 meter high ''[[Pöstlingberg]]'', which is also dubbed [[Acropolis]] of Linz. The Linzer Grottenbahn fairy-tale [[grotto]], the baroque ''Wallfahrtsbasilika'' and the rose garden are further points of interest along the way. The ''Grottenbahn'' runs through a colourful fairytale world with scenes from famous fairytales on display. In the lower part of the fortification tower, one can find a miniature model of what the town’s main square looked like in 1900. The panorama terrace ''Sieben Schmerzen Mariä'' offers a grand view of Linz.
Via a steep path the Collegium Petrinum, an episcopal high school that was founded at the end of the 19th century, can be reached. From there the trail leads back to the information board at the Ars Electronica Center. After the hike, it seems legitimate to explore the nearby old town of Linz, which is easily accessible via the ''Nibelungenbrücke'' bridge.

== Municipalities on the Danube Trail (in alphabetical order) ==
Out of the 45 municipalities that can be found on the ''Danube trail'', five are in Bavaria (Germany) and 40 are in Upper Austria.

The trail runs through a total of seven upper Austrian ‘leader regions’ (from West to East): [[Sauwald]], Donau-Böhmerwald, Hausruck Nord, [[Eferding]], Urfahr-West, [[Linz-Land District|Linz-Land]] and [[Waldhausen im Strudengau|Strudengau]].
