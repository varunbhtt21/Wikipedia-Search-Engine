</div>'''Struthiosaurinae''' is a [[subfamily]] of [[ankylosauria]]n [[dinosaur]]s from the [[Cretaceous]] of Europe. It is defined as "the most inclusive clade containing ''[[Europelta]]'' but not ''[[Cedarpelta]]'', ''[[Peloroplites]]'', ''[[Sauropelta]]'' or ''[[Edmontonia]]''" while being reinstated for a newly recognized clade of basal nodosaurids.

It was originally mentioned by [[Franz Nopcsa]] in 1923 as a subfamily of [[Acanthopholidae]], along with the previously defined [[Acanthopholinae]]. The family has gone through many taxonomic revisions since it was defined by Nopcsa in 1902. It is now recognized as a junior synonym of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Nodosauridae]]. The subfamily now includes the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Anoplosaurus]]'', ''Europelta'', ''[[Hungarosaurus]]'', and ''[[Struthiosaurus]]'', designated as the [[type genus]]. Because of the instability of ''[[Acanthopholis]]'', the generic namesake of Acanthopholinae, and its current identification as a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', Struthiosaurinae, the next named group, was decidedly used over the older one.

Struthiosaurinae appeared at about exactly the same time as the North American subfamily [[Nodosaurinae]]. Struthiosaurines range all across the cretaceous, the oldest genus being ''Europelta'' at an age of 112 Ma and the youngest being ''Struthiosaurus'' at about 85â€“66 Ma.
