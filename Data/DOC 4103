</div>'''Tyrannosauridae''' (or '''tyrannosaurids''', meaning "[[tyrant]] lizards") is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[coelurosauria]]n [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s which comprises two subfamilies containing up to eleven [[genus|genera]], including the [[eponym]]ous ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. The exact number of genera is controversial, with some experts recognizing as few as three. All of these animals lived near the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] and their [[fossil]]s have been found only in [[North America]] and [[Asia]].

Although descended from [[Tyrannosauroidea|smaller ancestors]], tyrannosaurids were almost always the largest [[Predation|predators]] in their respective [[ecosystem]]s, putting them at the [[apex predator|apex]] of the [[food chain]]. The largest [[species]] was ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', one of the largest known land predators, which measured up to {{convert|12.3|m}} in length and up to {{convert|6500|kg|ST|1}} in weight. Tyrannosaurids were [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] carnivores with massive [[skull]]s filled with large teeth. Despite their large size, their legs were long and proportioned for fast movement. In contrast, their arms were very small, bearing only two functional digits.

Unlike most other groups of dinosaurs, very complete remains have been discovered for most known tyrannosaurids. This has allowed a variety of research into their [[biology]]. Scientific studies have focused on their [[ontogeny]], [[biomechanics]] and [[ecology]], among other subjects. [[Soft tissue]], both fossilized and intact, has been reported from one specimen of ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. ('''[[Tyrannosauridae|see more...]]''')
