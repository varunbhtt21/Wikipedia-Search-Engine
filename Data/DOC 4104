</div>'''Tyrannosauroidea''' (meaning 'tyrant lizard forms') is a [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] (or [[clade]]) of [[coelurosaur]]ian [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s that includes the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Tyrannosauridae]] as well as more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] relatives. Tyrannosauroids lived on the [[Laurasia]]n [[supercontinent]] beginning in the [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]]. By the end of the [[Cretaceous Period]], tyrannosauroids were the dominant large predators in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], culminating in the gigantic ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' itself. [[Fossil]]s of tyrannosauroids have been recovered on what are now the continents of [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], possibly [[South America]] and [[Australia]].

Tyrannosauroids were [[biped]]al [[carnivore]]s, as were most theropods, and were characterized by numerous [[synapomorphy|skeletal features]], especially of the [[skull]] and [[pelvis]]. Early in their existence, tyrannosauroids were small predators with long, three-fingered forelimbs. [[Late Cretaceous]] genera became much larger, including some of the [[Dinosaur size#Longest theropods|largest land-based predators ever to exist]], but most of these later genera had proportionately small forelimbs with only two digits. Primitive [[feather]]s have been identified in fossils of two species, and may have been present in other tyrannosauroids as well. Prominent bony crests in a variety of shapes and sizes on the skulls of many tyrannosauroids may have served [[Display (zoology)|display]] functions. ('''[[Tyrannosauroidea|see more...]]''')
