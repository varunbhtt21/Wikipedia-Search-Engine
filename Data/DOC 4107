</div>'''Ferugliotheriidae''' is one of two known [[family (biology)|families]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Gondwanatheria]], an enigmatic group of extinct [[mammal]]s. Gondwanatheres have been classified as a group of uncertain affinities or as members of [[Multituberculata]], a major extinct mammalian order. The best-known representative of Ferugliotheriidae is the [[genus]] ''[[Ferugliotherium]]'' from the [[Late Cretaceous]] epoch in [[Argentina]]. A second genus, ''[[Trapalcotherium]]'', is known from a single tooth, a first lower [[molariform]] (molar-like tooth), from a different Late Cretaceous Argentinean locality. Another genus known from a single tooth (in this case, a fourth lower [[premolar]]), ''[[Argentodites]]'', was first described as an unrelated multituberculate, but later identified as possibly related to ''Ferugliotherium''. Finally, a single tooth from the [[Paleogene]] of [[Peru]], [[LACM 149371]], perhaps a last upper molariform, may represent a related animal. Ferugliotheriids are known from isolated, low-crowned ([[brachydont]]) teeth and possibly a fragment of a lower jaw. ''Ferugliotherium'' is estimated to have weighed 70&nbsp;g (2.5&nbsp;oz).

Most ferugliotheriids come from the Late Cretaceous epoch ([[Campanian]]–[[Maastrichtian]] ages, 84–66 million years ago, or mya) of Argentina, where they may have lived in a marshy or seashore environment. They coexisted with mammals such as [[dryolestoid]]s and a variety of other animals, including dinosaurs. Ferugliotheriids may have been [[herbivore]]s or [[omnivore]]s.
