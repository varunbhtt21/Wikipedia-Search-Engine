</div>'''''Archaeamphora longicervia''''' is an [[extinction|extinct]] species of [[flowering plant]] and the [[Monotypic taxon|only member]] of the genus '''''Archaeamphora'''''. Fossil material assigned to this [[taxon]] originates from the [[Yixian Formation]] of northeastern [[China]], dated to the [[Early Cretaceous]] (around {{Period span/brief|Early Cretaceous}}).

The species was originally described as a [[pitcher plant]] with close affinities to [[Extant taxon|extant]] members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Sarraceniaceae]]. This would make it the earliest known [[carnivorous plant]] and the only known fossil record of pitcher plants (with the possible exception of some [[palynomorph]]s of uncertain [[Nepenthes|nepenthacean]] affinity).''Archaeamphora'' is also one of the three oldest known [[genus|genera]] of [[flowering plant|angiosperms]] (flowering plants). Li (2005) wrote that "the existence of a so highly derived Angiosperm in the Early Cretaceous suggests that Angiosperms should have originated much earlier, maybe back to 280 mya as the [[molecular clock]] studies suggested".

Subsequent authors have questioned the identification of ''Archaeamphora'' as a pitcher plant. ('''[[Archaeamphora|see more...]]''')
