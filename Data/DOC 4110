</div>'''''Archaeomarasmius''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of gilled [[fungus]] in the [[Agaricales]] family [[Tricholomataceae]], containing the single [[species]] '''''Archaeomarasmius leggetti'''''. It is known from two [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] recovered from [[amber]], one consisting of a complete [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a broken [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], the other consisting of a fragment of a cap. The cap has a diameter ranging from {{convert|3.2|to|6|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, while the stem is {{convert|0.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick. [[Spore]]s were also recovered from the amber, and are broadly ellipsoid to egg-shaped, measuring roughly 7.3 by 4.7 [[micrometre|μm]]. The species, which resembles the extant genera ''[[Marasmius]]'' and ''[[Marasmiellus]]'', is inferred to have been [[saprobic]] on [[plant litter]] or other [[forest floor|forest debris]].

The genus is solely known from the [[New Jersey amber]] deposits along the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] in [[New Jersey]], United States, which date from the [[Turonian]] stage (about 90–94 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]]) of the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. ''Archaeomarasmius'' is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in the fossil record, and the only one to be described from New Jersey amber. ('''[[Archaeomarasmius|see more...]]''')
