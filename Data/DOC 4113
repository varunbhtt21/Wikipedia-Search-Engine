</div>'''''Pteranodon''''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ᵻ|ˈ|r|æ|n|ə|d|ɒ|n}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πτερόν ("wing") and ἀνόδων ("toothless")) is a [[genus]] of [[pterosaur]]s which included some of the largest known flying [[reptile]]s, with wingspans over {{convert|6|m|ft}}. It existed during the late [[Cretaceous]] geological period of [[North America]] in present day [[Kansas]], [[Alabama]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wyoming]], and [[South Dakota]]. More [[fossil]] specimens of ''Pteranodon'' have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1,200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons. It was an important part of the animal community in the [[Western Interior Seaway]].

''Pteranodon'' was not a [[dinosaur]]. By definition, all dinosaurs belong to the groups [[Saurischia]] and [[Ornithischia]], which exclude pterosaurs. Nevertheless, ''Pteranodon'' is frequently featured in dinosaur books and is strongly associated with dinosaurs by the general public. ('''[[Pteranodon|see more...]]''')
