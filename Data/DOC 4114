The '''Speyer wine bottle''' (or '''''Römerwein'''''<ref name="Michelin"/>) is a sealed vessel, presumed to contain liquid [[wine]], and so named because it was unearthed from a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tomb found near [[Speyer]], [[Germany]].  It is considered the world's oldest known bottle of wine.

==History==
The Speyer wine bottle most likely holds wine, and was originally found in 1867, in what is now the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] region of Germany near Speyer, one of the oldest settlements in the area.  The artifact has since become known as "the world's oldest existing bottle of wine".<ref name=dw>{{cite web| title=The Roman Wine of Speyer: The oldest Wine of the World that's still liquid| url=http://www.deutscheweine.de/icc/Internet-EN/nav/4b4/4b470693-6826-7e21-e66b-48554c41ed8b&_ic_uCon=016407a8-5735-f431-aecd-f9916f135e25| publisher=Deutsches Weininstitut| accessdate=25 April 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215229/http://www.deutscheweine.de/icc/Internet-EN/nav/4b4/4b470693-6826-7e21-e66b-48554c41ed8b%26_ic_uCon%3D016407a8-5735-f431-aecd-f9916f135e25| archivedate=26 April 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="NationalGeo">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/book-highlights/uncommon-history.html?source=email_inside |title=Of Vice & Vines: The Uncommon History of Wine |first1=Bethanne |last1=Patrick |first2=John |last2=Thompson |first3=Henry, Foreword |last3=Petroski  |page=304 |year= 2009 |isbn=978-1426204203 |work=The Uncommon History of Common Things |location= Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=27 April 2014}} </ref>{{efn-ua| More precisely, the Speyer wine bottle is oldest ''liquid'' wine still surviving, in contrast to the oldest known remains of wine (in the form of powdered residue), which date back to 6,000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |title=Old wine: An ancient timeline for great old wine| first1=Gregory |last1=Dal Piaz |url= http://www.snooth.com/articles/old-wine/?viewall=1#ixzz309BTaD8e |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>}}  The bottle has been dated between 325 and 350 AD<ref name="dw"/><ref name="Mail2013"/> and is the oldest known unopened bottle of wine in the world.<ref name="dw"/><ref name="Mail2013">{{cite book | author=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Ask A Wine Expert: 101 Things We All Want to Know| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRJKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT13&dq=Speyer| date=4 December 2013| publisher=Booktango| isbn=978-1-4689-4147-0| page=13| accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=hall2011>{{cite news | last=Hall| first=Allan| title=Shall We Crack Open the 350 AD Vintage?

==Discovery==
The bottle was discovered during an excavation<ref name="speyer">{{cite web | url=http://www.speyer.de/sv_speyer/en/Tourism/Palatine%20wine/Highlight%20of%20the%20Wine%20Culture/ |title=Roman Wine in Speyer |work=Highlight of the Wine Culture |publisher=speyer.de |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> within a 4th-century AD Roman nobleman's tomb.  The tomb contained two [[Roman sarcophagi|sarcophagi]], one holding the body of a man and one a woman.<ref name="dw"/>  One source says the man was a [[Legionary|Roman legionary]] and the wine was a provision for his celestial journey.<ref>{{cite web | title=The oldest wine in the world |url=http://www.pfalz.de/en/wine-enjoyment/the-oldest-wine-in-the-world#| publisher=Pfalz |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> Of the six glass bottles in the woman's sarcophagus and the ten vessels in the man's sarcophagus, only one still contained a liquid.  There is a clear liquid in the bottom third, and a mixture similar to [[rosin]] above.  

==Wine preservation==
While it reportedly lost its [[ethanol]] content, analysis is consistent with at least part of the liquid having been [[wine]].<ref name="dw"/>  The wine, likely produced in the same region,<ref name="hall2011"/> was diluted with a mixture of herbs.<ref name="dw"/>  The preservation of the wine is attributed to the large amount of thick [[olive oil]], added to the bottle to seal the wine off from air,<ref name="dw"/> along with a [[Sealant|hot wax]] seal.<ref name="NationalGeo"/><ref name="Mail2013"/><ref name="hall2011"/>  [[Petronius]] (c. 27{{ndash}}66 AD), in his work, ''[[Satyricon]]'', writes of plaster sealed bottles, and this one is analogous.  The use of glass in the bottle is unusual, however, as typically [[Roman glass]] was too fragile to be dependable over time.<ref name="Jackson"/>  

While scientists have considered accessing the liquid to further analyze the content, as of 2018 the bottle remained unopened, because of concerns about how the liquid would react when exposed to air.<ref name="hall2011"/><ref name="local2011"/>  The museum's curator, Ludger Tekampe, has stated he has seen no variation in the bottle in the last 25 years.<ref name="local2011"/>  [[Oenology]] professor Monika Christmann of [[Hochschule Geisenheim University]] has said, "Micro-biologically it is probably not spoiled, but it would not bring joy to the palate."<ref name="hall2011"/>
