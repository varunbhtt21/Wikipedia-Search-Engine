</div>'''Pterosaurs''' were flying [[reptile]]s of the [[clade]] or [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Pterosauria'''. They existed from the late [[Triassic]] to the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] (228 to 66 [[million years ago]]). Pterosaurs are the earliest [[vertebrate]]s known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. Early species had long, fully toothed jaws and long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats made up of hair-like filaments known as [[#Pycnofibres|pycnofibres]], which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pterosaurs spanned a wide range of adult sizes, from the very small ''[[Nemicolopterus]]'' to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' and ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]''.

Pterosaurs are often referred to in the popular media and by the general public as flying [[dinosaur]]s, but this is incorrect. However, like the dinosaurs, pterosaurs are [[Avemetatarsalia|more closely related to birds than to any living reptile]]. Pterosaurs are also incorrectly referred to as pterodactyls, particularly by journalists. "Pterodactyl" refers specifically to members of the genus ''[[Pterodactylus]]'', and more broadly to members of the suborder [[Pterodactyloidea]] of the pterosaurs.
