</div>'''UA 8699''' ([[University of Antananarivo]] specimen 8699) is a fossil [[mammal]]ian tooth from the [[Cretaceous]] of [[Madagascar]]. A broken lower [[molar (tooth)|molar]] about 3.5&nbsp;mm (0.14&nbsp;in) long, it is from the [[Maastrichtian]] of the [[Maevarano Formation]] in northwestern Madagascar. Details of its crown [[morphology (anatomy)|morphology]] indicate that it is a [[boreosphenida]]n, a member of the group that includes living [[marsupial]]s and [[placental]]s. Krause, who first described the tooth in 2001, interpreted it as a marsupial on the basis of five shared characters, but in 2003 Averianov and others noted that all those are shared by [[zhelestid]] placentals and favored a close relationship between UA 8699 and the Spanish zhelestid ''[[Lainodon]]''. Krause used the tooth as evidence that marsupials were present on the southern continents ([[Gondwana]]) as early as the late Cretaceous and Averianov and colleagues proposed that the tooth represented another example of faunal exchange between Africa and Europe at the time.
