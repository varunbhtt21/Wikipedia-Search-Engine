</div>The exposed '''geology of the Bryce Canyon area''' in [[Utah]] shows a record of deposition that covers the last part of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] and the first half of the [[Cenozoic]] era in that part of [[North America]]. The ancient [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of the region around what is now [[Bryce Canyon National Park]] varied from the warm shallow sea (called the [[Cretaceous Seaway]]) in which the Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited to the cool [[stream]]s and [[lake]]s that contributed sediment to the colorful Claron Formation that dominates the park's amphitheaters.

Other formations were also formed but were mostly [[erosion|eroded]] following uplift from the [[Laramide orogeny]] which started around 70&nbsp;[[million years ago]] ([[mya (unit)|mya]]). This event created the [[Rocky Mountains]] far to the east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] topography around 15&nbsp;mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces.

The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the [[Grand Staircase]]. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the [[Grand Canyon]], the intermediate ones in [[Zion National Park]], and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park. ('''[[geology of the Bryce Canyon area|see more...]]''')
