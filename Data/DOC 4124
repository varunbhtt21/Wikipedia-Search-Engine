Yurkevich was in 1851, appointed the position of instructor in Philosophical Sciences at the [[Kiev Theological Academy]]. In 1852 he received his master's degree in philosophy (from 1861 - professor). Then in 1857 Yurkevich also began to teach German at the University.

==Views==
Yurkevich's more well known positions and the works that reflected them (The Heart and Its Significance in the Spiritual Life of Man) revolved around the expression and rationalization of [[essentialism]]. In this Yurkevich concerned himself with the philosophical clarification of what material and the observable world are. Though Yurkevich was an idealist in the sense of [[Platonic Realism]], he was thoroughly Christian in his approach rejecting that the mind of a person as reason was the basis for the essences of things or beings and instead saying that essentialism was idealist (from conscious beings inline with Plato) but it was from the rational part of the being (their mind) and also from the emotional center and that the heart of the person was the complete expression of the person. Person or soul (hypostasis) is heart, mind and body, as the rational part of a person was but a part of the larger whole which as a heart or soul each person gave meaning to the things they experienced. Yurkevich was continuing the work that had been set out before him by his famous mentor [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]].
Idealist criticism Yurkevich work by Chernyshevsky, "The Anthropological Principle in Philosophy", marked the beginning of a stormy debate (statements by Chernyshevsky, M. A. Antonovich, etc.), which had wide public resonance. From the Marxist standpoint Yurkevich criticized [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]]. Themes work Yurkevich largely determined responsive the subsequent development of philosophical idealism in Russia
