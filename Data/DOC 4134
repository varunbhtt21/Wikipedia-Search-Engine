Titles that appear here are sometimes good candidates for [[WP:Requested moves]] discussions, but in many cases are the result of them, most commonly when [[WP:COMMONNAME]] or some other such concern has resulted in an article being at a broader, more general term than its content might naturally suggest. In other cases, an entry here may be a subtopic that redirects to a more overarching article, but which may deserve its own eventual separate article, in which case the redirect should also be tagged with {{Template|R with possibilities}}.

More specific names are not necessarily longer versions of the same name, for which see {{Cat|Redirects from long names}}.
