'''Nokia 1616''' is an affordable ultrabasic GSM mobile phone from Nokia announced on 4 November 2009<ref>{{cite web |author=JBC |title=New Nokias feature more for less |work=Nokia Conversations |publisher=Nokia |date=2009-11-04 |url= http://conversations.nokia.com/2009/11/04/new-nokias-feature-more-for-less/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511234049/http://conversations.nokia.com/2009/11/04/new-nokias-feature-more-for-less/ |archivedate=2010-05-11 |dead-url=yes}}</ref> and released in 2010 for developing countries and budget users for a suggested price of €24 before taxes and excluding subsidies (SIM-free).

The device's main non-phone features are flashlight at the top of the device, and an FM radio. The radio requires a headset or headphones in lieu of an antenna to function, and can work in the background, thereby providing access to other phone tasks without having to turn it off.

==Hardware==
The device has a color display with scratch-proof display glass, a dust-proof keypad, and comes in Black, Dark Gray, Dark Blue, and Dark Red colors.

In addition to the phone, the battery, and the Nokia AC-3 compact charger, the original packaging also includes a Nokia WH-102 stereo headset.<ref name="specifications">{{cite web |title=Nokia 1616 Specifications |publisher=Nokia |year=2012 |url=http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/devices/nokia-1616/specifications |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120422054721/http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/devices/nokia-1616/specifications |archivedate=2012-04-22 |dead-url=yes}}</ref><ref name="CNET"/>

==Reception==
Damien McFerran at CNET UK praised the phone for its dustproof keypad, FM radio, and flashlight. Special mention was given to good battery life, a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (earlier Nokia phones used a 2.5mm connector), and inclusion of headphones in the packaging, which McFerran pointed out is something that other manufacturers' budget phones packaging did not include.<ref name="CNET">{{cite news |last=McFerran |first=Damien |title=Nokia 1616 review |publisher=CNET UK |location=United Kingdom |date=2010-09-03 |url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/products/nokia-1616/ |accessdate=2015-07-25}}</ref>

In a May 2010 guest opinion published in the German ''[[:w:de:T3N Magazin|t3n magazine]]'', Swiss IT author Roman Hanhart weighed the pros and cons of having a smartphone and a basic phone. Hanhart compared the dismal battery life of his SIM-locked 800-franc HTC Dream (on Android 1.5) and the need to be on-demand online &mdash; versus the two weeks' battery life using his Nokia 1616 that he ordered for a total of 44 francs from a webshop (delivery price included; approx. retail price 38 [[Swiss franc|SFr.]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Bild 2/5: Outdoor-Helfer für 38 Franken |work=Und auch bei uns gibts Telefone für Sparfüchse |publisher=[[Blick]] |location=Switzerland |date=2012-01-02 |url= http://www.blick.ch/life/digital/das-billigste-handy-der-welt-kostet-1-60-franken-und-auch-bei-uns-gibts-telefone-fuer-sparfuechse-id65221.html |accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref>), and his sense of liberty with a basic phone, wherein he could attain the level of reachability he wanted without having to worry about his phone collecting information on him.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hanhart |first=Roman |title=Meinung: Wir Sklaven der Erreichbarkeit – Warum ein Simpel-Handy mein Android-Smartphone schlägt |language=German |trans-title=Opinion: We the Slaves of Availability - Why Does a Simple Mobile Beat an Android Smartphone |work=t3n digital pioneers |publisher=yeebase media GmbH |location=Germany |date=2010-05-18 |url=http://t3n.de/news/sklaven-der-erreichbarkeit-272598/ |accessdate=2015-07-06}}</ref>

In a July 2010 comparative review of budget phones published in the Russian weekly [[Argumenty i Fakty]] and penned by Viktor Zaykovskiy, Nokia 1616 got the top spot, as offering the best price-to-feature ratio. Zaykovskiy pointed out the presence of a colour display in a budget phone, quick UI responsiveness, the rubber keypad (protects from dust and occasional water drops), good battery life, and the flashlight. He praised the FM radio's excellent reception, sound quality and volume, and that the radio can work as a background task, thus enabling people to use other phone functions while listening to music. Zaykovskiy concluded that this was "one the best phones one can buy for 1350 roubles."<ref name="AiF">{{cite news |author=Zaykovskiy, Viktor (Виктор Зайковский) |title=Дешево и сердито: сравнительный тест бюджетных мобильников |language=Russian |trans-title=Cheap and angry: comparative test of budget mobiles |work=Mobile Digital |publisher=[[Argumenty i Fakty]] |location=Russia |date=2010-07-09 |url=http://www.aif.ru/techno/pc/19213 |accessdate=2015-07-26}}</ref>
