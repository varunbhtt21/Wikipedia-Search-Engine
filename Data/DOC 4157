Text : [[Image:SawashfanCoin.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of Sawashfan]]
'''Sawashfan''' (died 8th-century) was the ruler of the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarezm]] during the 8th-century. He was the son and successor of [[Askajamuk II]].

He is one of the few Afrighid rulers whose coins have been identified. The coin shows a bust of Sawashfan to the left, while it shows him on horseback to the right. Sawashfan is known in [[China|Chinese]] sources as Shao-she-fien, where he in 751 is reportedly said to have requested help from the [[Tang dynasty]]. Sawashfan was later succeeded by his son [[Torkasbatha]].
