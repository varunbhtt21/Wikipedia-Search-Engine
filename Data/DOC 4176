==Plot==
The tenth in the Oslo crime series featuring detective Harry Hole is the most sizeable entry yet; a twisting-turning saga that pits the gangly maverick against that most feared of serial killers, the cop killer. This murderer has a very devious ''modus operandi'', luring police, and ex-police, involved in unsolved murders to the scene of the original crime to perform a [[Copycat crime|copycat killing]] there, seemingly as a punishment for having failed to solve the original case.
