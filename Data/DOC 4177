Thanks; I've not kept any record of the password for that login and it's been a while... But that's part of the reason for this request. Have tried several likely logins, though nothing's worked. If it had been linked to an email I may have been able to send a reminder that way, but alas. Appreciate the need to check it isn't being used by someone else first, so do what you have to. Given I'm not logging in there, there should be no response. <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Paul clark 2003|Paul clark 2003]] ([[User talk:Paul clark 2003|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Paul clark 2003|contribs]]) 21:18, 23 April 2014‎ (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

*Reason: Hello. I am [[:es:Usuario:Canaan|Canaan]], from Spanish Wikipedia. First excuse me, I do not speak English very well. I noticed that mine had some issues here in the English Wikipedia, in an account in my name but I do not own ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Canaan]). Apparently, this is my article import [[:es:Jardinería del Barroco]], made by [[User:Calliopejen1]]. However, apparently the account [[User:Canaan]] was already registered, so it has been assigned a few issues that are mine. The problem is that until now had no unified account, which I've already done, although English has not been able to assign me because it was already registered. I wonder if you could usurp that account, since that has never recorded edited and current issues come from my article in Spanish. Thanks

**I'd say it's fine; I wouldn't usually think of "director" as a position of power in the context of a website (unlike, say, "moderator", which has significant use in online communities even though it's not used for such on Wikipedia specifically). I'd be more likely to think of a film director than anything else (hence the potential for confusion with PRODUCER, which is at least lessened by the move to no-caps). I don't think the chance for misunderstandings with "Director" are particularly high, so I'd grant it.

So I started another account called Aleskva. But at present, the account Dvorapa on the english Wiki is 7 years old and there are not any edits from that account. Therefore I would like to ask for usurpation of the english Dvorapa account to finish SUL. And also I would like to ask for merging these two Global accounts (Dvorapa and Aleskva) into Dvorapa, if it is possible.

I am making this request on behalf of Arctic Kangaroo who is currently blocked on the English Wikipedia and is therefore unable to post this request himself. AK's reasons for the request are as follows ([[Commons:Commons:Changing username/Current requests#Arctic Kangaroo → Graphium|see here]] for the Commons request for name change, which includes the text below which was posted by AK at my request):

''Hi. Recently, I requested to be renamed globally at Meta. But as that is not yet possible due to the SUL finalisation, I'm currently requesting renaming/requested renaming at certain wikis, mainly the ones I am more active at. I should be requesting renaming at Meta within the next 60 hours of this message when I have time. I have also requested renaming at mswiki, Commons, and idwiki. The requests at mswiki and idwiki have already been approved. Now, one hurdle remains and it is my home wiki, which is enwiki. Michael, my mentor at Commons, has suggested requesting renaming at enwiki as well. The reasons are mentioned in the link to the request at Commons. However, I'm totally blocked on enwiki except for email, so he has offered to help me request renaming at enwiki, which I gladly accepted based on the reasons he mentioned and because this matter can be settled on-wiki.''

As mentioned, the name changes on mswiki and idwiki have already been approved, and I have today approved the change at Commons as well. When the user requests to be unblocked here, later, I believe it will be more transparent for him to be using a single SUL username across all wikis.

*Reason: My current username does not comply with Wikipedia policy and my request to change my username was approved on my Talk page. In searching the Wikipedia database, I discovered that an account with my personal name was created back in 2009, which was almost certainly done by me, and subsequently forgotten. (Sorry.) I have placed the Usurpation request on the TristanBerry user page to ensure that this is the case, and am hoping to have all of this resolved. Thank you all so much for being helpful as I learn to navigate very unfamiliar waters. [[User:Moriah-Torchlight|Moriah-Torchlight]] ([[User talk:Moriah-Torchlight|talk]]) 17:20, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

I dislike my current name and it does not represent me. I also do not want to continue using a name containing the number "2600", since although no longer relevant today it nevertheless is a reference to form of "phone hacking" that was illegal. I am here to contribute constructively to Wikipedia and do not want a name that may give a different impression. As per the instructions given to me on the talk page, I placed a message on my LibertyOrDeath account Talk page. (If I was meant to edit THIS page with that account, please let me know and I apologize for the error.)
