==Background==

In an interview about the songs lyrics, bass player [[Nicky Wire]] approached the topic of whether the song was about former band member, [[Richey Edwards]] or not, Wire stated that: 
:People might have the idea that this song contains a lot of Richey references but it really isn’t about that, it’s about the [[Øresund Bridge]] that joins Sweden and Denmark. A long time ago when we were crossing that bridge I was flagging and thinking about leaving the band (the “fatal friend”). It’s about the idea of bridges allowing you an out of body experience as you leave and arrive in different places.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gigwise.com/news/90527/Manic-Street-Preachers-unveil-new-video-announce-Futurology-details#RYoY7GIJqzjo4KpP.99 |title=Manic Street Preachers unveil new video, announce Futurology details |first=Andrew |last=Trendell |work=Gigwise |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>

The band, especially Wire, have stated that he wrote the song at a critical time, when he was, as described above, tired of being in the band, and he wrote the lyrics thinking of that subject. He later felt differently after a gig in [[Denmark]].

==Release==

The song was released as a digital download and it was backed by two new songs ''The Sound of Detachment'' and ''Caldey'', it also featured a live version of the title song and a reworking of "[[Futurology (song)|Futurology]]", album track, ''Europa Geht Durch Mich''.

==Music video==

In an interview [[Nicky Wire]] said that he wanted [[Kieran Evans]] for the video. The band tried to continue the narrative element that the two previous singles from [[Rewind the Film]] had. It was inspired by [[Run Lola Run]] and the video was released to the public on Sunday, the 27 April.
