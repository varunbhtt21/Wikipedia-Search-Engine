==Arts Council Report 1991==
In response to the significant shifts in the [[performance art]] scene in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, Keidan authored the Arts Council of Great Britain's ''Strategy: Discussion Document on Live Art'' in 1991. This document was written to "map current practices and provisions for live art as well as to identify key issues". The report used the term live art, instead of performance art to define a set of practices and cultural strategies that were apparent in the UK at the time. The report covered "areas as diverse as the history, development, status of artists, critical coverage, potential venues and training/education".<ref>{{cite book|last=Heddon|first=Deirdre (eds)|title=Histories and practices of Live Art|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-0-230-22974-7|page=23|authorlink=Developing Live Art|author2=Klein, Jennie |chapter=1}}</ref>
