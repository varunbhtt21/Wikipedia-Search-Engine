Title : Eufemiavisorna
Text : {{Italic title}}
The '''''Eufemiavisorna''''' are a group of three medieval romances translated into [[Old Swedish|medieval Swedish]]: ''[[Ywain|Herr Ivan lejonriddaren]]'' (1303), ''[[Hertig Fredrik av Normandie]]'' (1301 or 1308), and ''[[Floris and Blancheflour|Flores och Blanzeflor]]'' (probably 1312). They are known in Swedish (and generally in English) as the ''Eufemiavisorna'', 'the Euphemia poems' (or, without the definite article, the ''Eufemiavisor'') or, less commonly, ''Eufemiaromanerna'', 'the Euphemia romances'; they are known in Norwegian ([[bokmål]]) as the ''Eufemiavisene''. The romances are an early example of the poetic form known as [[Knittelvers]]; are the first known Scandinavian renderings of Continental European [[chivalric romance]] in verse; and are one of the first major works of literature in Swedish.<ref>Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 172-73.</ref>

==Origins and content==

Scandinavian translations of Continental European romance began with [[Chivalric sagas|prose translations]] in the Norwegian court. The ''Eufemiavisorna'' represent a further stage of adaptation of Romance, using verse. They are named after Norway's Queen [[Euphemia of Rügen]] (1270–1312): in the fullest manuscript attestations, there is a colophon at the end of each romance indicating that she commissioned the translations. The translations are thought to represent Euphemia's effort to bring Continental courtly culture to the royal court of Sweden.

It is not known who translated the poems, but scholarly consensus supports the idea that there was one, clerical translator, intimately familiar with German ''Knittel'' forms.<ref>Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.</ref>

=== ''Herra Ivan'' ===
According to [[Peter Andreas Munch]]'s generally accepted theory, the translation of Chrétien de Troyes's ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion|Yvain]]'' as ''Herr Ivan lejonriddaren'' celebrated the betrothal of Euphemia's daughter [[Ingeborg of Norway|Ingeborg]]'s abortive betrothal to [[Magnus Birgerson]] in 1302. ''Herr Ivan'' is 6,645 lines and, in the assessment of Gösta Holm,

: It is generally maintained that the Swedish translator used MSS both of the Old French ''Yvain'' and of the Old Norwegian ''Íven(t)''. The end of the poem states that it was translated ''af valske tungo'' ("from the French language"). The translator deals freely with his originals; he shortens, revises, and makes additions. The narration is more expansive in the latter part. The additions are often mechanical and especially frequent in rhyme position.<ref>Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.</ref>

=== ''Hertig Fredrik'' ===
The reason for the 3,310-line translation of ''Hertig Fredrik av Normandie'' (1308) is not known, and it may not originally have belonged to the ''Eufemiavisorna''. 'On the whole, it is more artistic than its Swedish forerunner, ''Herr Ivan''.' No direct source for this romance survives, but 'the end of the poem states that it was first translated ''aff walsko j tytzt mall'' ("from French into German"), at the instance of [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto]]. This information is generally accepted by scholars, although no German text is known'.<ref>Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.</ref>

=== ''Flores och Blanzeflor'' ===
The translation of the anonymous Old French ''[[Floris and Blancheflour]]'' as the 2,192-line ''Flores och Blanzeflor'' seems to have been composed in 1312<ref>Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.</ref> and in Munch's theory may have marked Ingeborg's successful marriage in 1312 to [[Eric, Duke of Södermanland]]. The translation is based on the Norwegian translation of the French.

=== Danish translation ===
The ''Eufemiavisorna'' were translated into Danish at the beginning of the sixteenth century; there are two other independent Danish versions of ''[[Ywain]]''.

==Form==

According to Gösta Holm, 'The style, rhyme technique, and vocabulary of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' are to a great extent influenced by German patterns; the translator(s) must have been acquainted with the culture of the South. Thus, French originals have had a surprisingly insignificant influence on the form of the ''Eufemiavisorna''.'

: Like the English adapters of the 13th and 14th centuries, the author of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' possessed a weak sensitivity to the subtle and refined aspects of courtly romance. The intricate analysis of the emotional life of characters, especially women, in the best French romances, was foreign to the author of the ''Eufemiavisorna''. Instead, he was very font of manly sports, ''torney'', ''dyost'' ("tournaments, jousts"), and the like, fights, grand assemblies, and vivid scenes in the knights' castles. In short, the main themes of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' are adventures, fights, and love.<ref>Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.</ref>

==Manuscripts==

The Danish translations of the Swedish ''Eufemiavisorna'' derive from lost manuscripts closer to the archetypes than our surviving Swedish ones, and therefore have an independent text-critical value for reconstructing the Swedish translations.<ref>Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.</ref>
