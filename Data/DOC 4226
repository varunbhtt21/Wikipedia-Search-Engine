:({{Find sources|Martial Arts History Museum}})
Has a single reference of questionable significance. Most content is unreferenced, and there is a strong promotional streak running through the text. [[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]<sup> [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]</sup> 13:46, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep'''.  This museum has actually received coverage in multiple reliable sources: ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' [http://www.latimes.com/topic/tn-gnp-0710-museum,0,6179718.story#axzz2zqjiImPK]; [[KNBC]] [http://www.nbclosangeles.com/the-scene/events/Martial_Arts_History_Museum_Opens_in_Burbank_Los_Angeles-125250434.html] (video); ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' [http://www.dailynews.com/20110626/martial-arts-fans-get-their-kicks-at-new-history-museum-in-burbank] (reprinted at [[SFGate.com]] [http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Martial-Arts-History-Museum-reopens-in-Burbank-2366534.php]), [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-34785346.html].  My !vote is a little "weak" because (1) the nominator is right about the excessively promotional and puffery-laden tone of the article, which does set off an alarm bell and at minimum needs to be cleaned up; and (2) there doesn't seem to have been much coverage since the 2011 reopening in Burbank, although it does get some other mentions [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-34785346.html] [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/local/me-rodriguez21][http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/11/entertainment/la-et-0511-museum-guide-20110511].  On balance I'm inclined to keep this assuming we can strip it down to NPOV factual content. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 19:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''.  It's a museum, open to the public.  If the article is promotional, it should be edited, not deleted. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 01:48, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''  Not sure of my vote yet - but the question is it notable not if it is open,  Museum's are not inherintly notable.  The sources may be nothing more than local interest coverage but should be at least put in the article.[[User:PRehse|Peter Rehse]] ([[User talk:PRehse|talk]]) 07:01, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::It would be better if more of the above references could be integrated into the article but generally they are about local interest rather than the notability of the museum.  My vote would be '''Weak delete''' on notability grounds.[[User:PRehse|Peter Rehse]] ([[User talk:PRehse|talk]]) 16:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak Keep''' It's notable enough to try and salvage it. It might be worth a rewrite using a NPOV.  If that doesn't work, it might be time to either delete or WP:TNT. I'd try a general rewrite first, removing all of the promotional content and stripping it down to encyclopedic and verifiable info [[User:QueenFan|QueenFan]] ([[User talk:QueenFan|talk]]) 20:55, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' It appears [[WP:BEFORE]] reveals coverage from some major reliable sources. Everything else such as a lack of references, tone, and due weight are all [[WP:SURMOUNTABLE]] problems.
