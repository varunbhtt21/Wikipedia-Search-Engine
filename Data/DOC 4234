'''Wist''' was an application for smartphones that helped users find top five restaurants, bars and coffee shops nearby.

==History==
Triptrotting, the previous version of Wist, was focused on combating easy tourism by connecting travelers and hosts online for local insight and suggestions. But in some months since its raise, the team found that users were more interested in just asking locals for their opinions rather than anything else.

It gives just five recommendations at a time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sawers|first=Paul|title=Wist for iPhone now recommends the top 5 best places to eat and drink anywhere in the world|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/04/24/wist-now-lets-eke-best-coffee-cafe-bars-anywhere-around-world|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=The Next Web|date=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lepore|first=Meredith|title=Win your coffee meeting: How to pick a great networking spot|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/01/16/win-your-coffee-meeting-how-to-pick-a-great-networking-spot|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=16 January 2014}}</ref>
