==History ==
The band started when a mutual friend asked them separately to be musical acts in a geeky theatre showcase. They decided to pair up and started a website, social media, and T-shirts in one week. They write many songs that are funny and emphasize geeky topics.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stargazing_blog/2014/02/frozen_s__let_it_go__remade_for_star_trek_is_the_best_thing_of_the_day.html “Frozen's 'Let it Go' remade for Star Trek is the best thing of the day”, “thestar.com”, February 7, 2014 ]</ref>

Debs & Errol announced their retirement on their website on 15 January 2015.<ref>[http://debsanderrol.com/2015/01/de-farewell-comic/ "D&E: Farewell Comic", January 15, 2015]</ref>

== Other Projects ==

=== Daily Webcomic ===

Debs & Errol have a daily webcomic (except Sundays). Errol said, "That happened by accident, really. I wanted to put out a CD and I thought, foolishly, we could get it done in a short amount of time. Considering I had created the characters for our logo, I decided to do a daily comic so that people could keep coming back every day until the CD was done."<ref>[http://almostnerdy.com/cool-stuff/music/music-monday-nerd-band-debs-and-errol/ “Music Monday: Nerd Band Debs and Errol”, “Almost Nerdy”, May 20, 2013]</ref>

=== NaNoWriMo ===

Debs & Errol first met through [[National Novel Writing Month]] and have been huge supporters of the organization ever since. Since then, they have written a musical about NaNoWriMo, and Errol pens the NaNoToons, the webcomic for NaNoWriMo.
