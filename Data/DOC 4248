__NOTOC__
=== Usage ===
{{hatnote|Use this rcat template in '''any [[wp:namespace|namespace]]'''.}}
* This redirect category ([[wp:RCAT|rcat]]) template populates {{Cat|Redirects from more specific names}}.  Add this rcat to a redirect in the following manner: 
<pre>
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{Rcat shell|
{{R from more specific name}}
}}
</pre>
: Template {{tl|Rcat shell}} is an alias for the ''Redirect category shell'' template, which may be used to add as many appropriate rcats as needed, usually from one to seven, along with their parameters, to a redirect.  For more information see the documentation on its template page.  This rcat may also tag a redirect individually:
<pre>
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{R from more specific name}}
</pre>
: This is in accord with instructions found at [[Wikipedia:REDCAT]].
* Use this rcat to tag any redirect from a title that is a more specific, less general page name.

==== When to use a different rcat template ====
* If the redirect is simply a longer version of the same name, use {{tl|R from long name}} instead.
* If the redirect is a completely different name for the same topic, use {{tl|R from alternative name}} instead.
* If the redirect names a subtopic treated in detail at the target article, use {{tl|R from subtopic}} instead (and {{tl|R to subsection}} if appropriate).
* For redirects that are incorrect names for the target, use {{tl|R from incorrect name}}.

==== Aliases ====

=== Printworthiness ===
* In [[wp:mainspace|main-article namespace]], many redirects to more general page titles are considered unprintworthy; however, there are many others that are printworthy, so there is no default sort for [[wp:printworthiness|printworthiness]].  In 2003, efforts were begun to support the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s goal of increasing access and availability of  ''Wikipedia'' articles in {{diff|Wikipedia:Pushing to 1.0||1319195|printed versions}}.  Some rcats automatically populate either {{Cat|Printworthy redirects}} or {{Cat|Unprintworthy redirects}} by default.  Others, like this rcat, do not, and that means it is up to editors to choose which of those categories, ''Printworthy'' or ''Unprintworthy'', is appropriate and should be populated.  The rcats that are used separately to populate those categories are: 
:* {{tlx|R printworthy}} and
:* {{tlx|R unprintworthy}}
: Please click on each one for more details and guidance.
* Template {{tl|Redirect category shell}} will accept these rcats just like any other.
:: '''Examples:'''
<pre>
{{Rcat shell|
{{R from more specific name}}
{{R printworthy}}
}}

{{Rcat shell|
{{R from more specific name}}
{{R unprintworthy}}
}}
</pre>
: Either {{tl|Redirect category shell}} or its alias/shortcut, {{tl|Rcat shell}}, may be used.
