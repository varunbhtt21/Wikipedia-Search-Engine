:*'''Review''' New enough.  Long enough.  I added content, as it was close to the 1500 character cut off at the time, but now has tripled in size and citations.  ''Many'' sources supporting hook, including at least <s>two</s> three books.  Clear for plagiarism and close paraphrasing.  Covers the subject well. Well done! <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#060">7&amp;6=thirteen</b>]] ([[User talk:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]])</span> 15:56, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' If it were up to me, I would add this picture, which is in the article. As to copyright status of the picture, at Commons the uploader says it was his and a free image.  Also, maybe the hook should have the name [[Speyer wine bottle]] directly in it? As to the article itself, it uses [[A.D.]], and maybe that should be [[C.E.]].  There is also a statement of 1.5 litres which maybe should have a conversion. <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#060">7&amp;6=thirteen</b>]] ([[User talk:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]])</span> 16:06, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Further comment''' I have found some sources that pretty clearly indicate that it was tested at least, if not literally opened.  How one tests the contents without opening is not clear.  See the external links and the talk page.  Perhaps we need to work on an Alternate query/hook?  However, this seems to be well supported by ''all'' the sources: "The Roman Wine of Speyer: The oldest Wine of the World that's still liquid."   <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#060">7&amp;6=thirteen</b>]] ([[User talk:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]])</span> 20:34, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
**{{tq|How one tests the contents without opening is not clear.}} - By [[spectroscopy]], I'd say. But we just stick by what sources say, so I am not very sure of your question.--[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 15:12, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
***They talk about smell.  And I think the spectroscopy claim (which is not in any source) is wishful thinking and an [[anachronism]].  Better to say "The oldest Wine of the World that's still liquid" even though some sources do say it was unopened, and others say it was.  I understand [[WP:truth]].  But I don't want somebody higher up the food chain saying I certified a dubious hook line.  So I would propose we go with an alternate hook.  I understand your claim that "we just go with what the sources say, but we have an evident conflict here that in my opinion is 'not rug-sized.'  If I certify this, I will catch heat if it blows up. IF the hierarchy wants to go with this, let it be their decision. <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#060">7&amp;6=thirteen</b>]] ([[User talk:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]])</span> 15:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
****I was wrong about the anacchronism part.  [[History of spectroscopy]].  But I don't think that "smell" is covered by that.  It may depend upon the definition of "unopened."     But the 30s test results were lost during the war, and the other anecdotal reports of earlier tests or openings are sketchy, in my opinion. <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#060">7&amp;6=thirteen</b>]] ([[User talk:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]])</span> 16:05, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*****"Still liquid" is okay for me. I have no interest in speculation about it at all -my spectroscopy claim was just an hypothesis. I only know what sources say; if something comes out that explains how they did the analysis, all the better. Do you have sources about the smell claim? I didn't find any.--[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 18:11, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

::Sorry, just to understand: what have the references to do with the hook? The hook would be correct and verified with the original references in.

::'''Comment''' Nominator removed a source for an important block quote (only one in the article) which explicates on whether the bottle was tested and opened.  He says it was an "unreliable source." I won't certify this with that omission, and removed my tick.  I would concede that the ALT1 hooks is supported by the sources.  But attribution is important, and while we are not trying to get to [[WP:TRUTH]], ignoring this information (or not attributing it) is not right.   <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#060">7&amp;6=thirteen</b>]] ([[User talk:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]])</span> 17:32, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Nonsense. The ''reliable'' sources present verify both hooks. The two ''unreliable'' sources (added by the editor above and now removed) added some more background indeed, but being, ehm, unreliable, we cannot rely on them anyway, so they change nothing on the status of the hook. Feel free to suggest a different hook however. --[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 17:34, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::::I think I got what you meant, forgot to remove the footnote that was unreliably sourced. I suppose this fixes the issue. --[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 17:43, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
Issue is ''not'' fixed.  Article was far better and more accurate with the block quote in the footnote and the sourcing.  As it is you have created a potential half truth article based upon a failure to appreciate that those two sources were credible.  You have applied policy at the expense of common sense.  One ought to not blindly apply an general ''a priori'' rule without looking at the specific instances of the application.  <span style="text-shadow:#396 0.2em 0.2em 0.5em; class=texhtml">[[User:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#060">7&amp;6=thirteen</b>]] ([[User talk:7&amp;6=thirteen|<b style="color:#000">☎</b>]])</span> 18:17, 28 April 2014 (UTC) 
:Okay, the issue here is clear. Now, since the hook is verified and all other conditions are verified anyway, can we put back the tick here? And also, can we please move this discussion on [[Talk:Speyer wine bottle]] or, even better, at [[WP:RS/N]]? I will be happy to include the references if it turns out that they are reliable sources, but for something like a Wordpress-hosted personal blog, there is a significant burden of proof to show that they can be used as reliable sources.--[[User:Cyclopia|<font size="2" color="seagreen">cyclopia</font>]][[User talk:Cyclopia|<font color="red"><sup>speak!</sup></font>]] 18:37, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:::For me, the hook you suggest, {{u|ThaddeusB}}, is perfect. Thanks! {{u|Bearian}}, thanks to you as well.

::::OK by me. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 15:27, 28 May 2014 (UTC)
[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] The length is fine and it has lots of references and it has been considered and discussed by experienced editors and compared to policy and all actions and comments have been resolved or abated. I have checked the ref and it supports all the hook variations, but this is "the community" speaking here. Hierarchy??
