The '''Castellani Art Museum''' of [[Niagara University]] is an art museum centrally located on the University's main campus in the town of [[Lewiston (town), New York|Lewiston]]. The museum features exhibitions of nationally known and emerging [[contemporary art]]ists and traditional [[folk art]]s.

==History==
The Castellani Art Museum collection was initiated in 1976 by Armand J. Castellani to encourage the study and love of art and to improve cultural understanding by forming a significant collection for Niagara University students and the [[Western New York]] public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Category / Castellani Art Museum|url=http://news.niagara.edu/category/castellani-art-museum/|website=niagara.edu|publisher=[[Niagara University]]|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref>

The original museum, known as the Buscaglia-Castellani Art Gallery, was built in 1978 and was located off campus.  The Gallery housed a permanent collection of about 300 pieces. In 1990, the museum was renamed the Castellani Art Museum and a new building was constructed on campus. The building was designed by Thomas Moscati and boasts seven different gallery spaces, indoor and outdoor sculpture courts, a museum shop, offices, and storage and preparation spaces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum History|url=http://www.castellaniartmuseum.org/visitor-info/museum-history/|publisher=Castellani Art Museum|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>

The museum is also used for educational purposes. The Niagara University Fine Arts Program has studio and classroom spaces in the museum for students as well. The Museum is dedicated to facilitating art educational programs for students of the University, as well as other schools in the area and cultural organizations. Docent and volunteer programs are offered to any interested member of the community.

Niagara University also offers a degree program that was developed collaboratively with the Director of the Castellani Art Museum (Kate Koperski) and the former Curator of Education (Marian Granfield).<ref name="BSA">{{cite news|last1=Summerson|first1=Mia|title=Buffalo Society of Artists open 120th Catalogue Exhibition|url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/news/night_and_day/buffalo-society-of-artists-open-th-catalogue-exhibition/article_536a4fa2-f1d1-11e5-942c-e7d0148fd812.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|publisher=''[[Niagara Gazette]]''|date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>
