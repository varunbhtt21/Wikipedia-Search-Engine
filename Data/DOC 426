'''''Rock in Rio USA''''' was a [[music festival]] held in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] in 2015. A spin-off of [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s ''[[Rock in Rio]]'' festival, it was held on two consecutive weekends in May 2015 at the [[Las Vegas Festival Grounds]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. It shared a similar structure and format to its Brazilian counterpart, hosting at least 120 acts for its first and only edition, while its site was developed in cooperation with organizers. The event was a partnership with [[LiveStyle|SFX Entertainment]] (which had acquired an operating stake in the Rock in Rio festival), the festival's Brazilian stakeholder IMX, [[MGM Resorts International]], [[Yucaipa Companies]], and [[Cirque de Soleil|Cirque de Soleil Entertainment Group]].

Per the terms of the organizers' contract with the venue, the festival was to be held biennially from 2015 through at least 2019. The first edition was held across two weekends of two days each, and was to expand into a three-day, two-weekend format during the subsequent editions. However, after attendance and revenue from the 2015 edition were below expectations, plans for future editions of the event were quietly shelved.

== Development ==

In November 2013, [[SFX Entertainment]], an [[electronic dance music]] events company founded by [[Robert F.X. Sillerman]], reached a deal with Roberto Medina, organizer of the ''[[Rock in Rio]]'' festival series, to acquire a 50% stake in a new entity that would own the [[rock music]] festival alongside [[Eike Batista]]'s IMX, with SFX replacing IMX as the managing partner of the festival. Sillerman also disclosed that plans were being made to bring the festival to the United States for the first time ever. Medina revealed further information about these plans in an interview with [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] shortly after the deal was reached. He stated that the inaugural festival was to be held in Las Vegas in May 2015, at a site in proximity to the Las Vegas Strip. Medina touted that in comparison to other, U.S.-based festivals, Rock in Rio USA was going to be "bigger in terms of public, in terms of sponsorship, in terms of social media. Not a little bit bigger, a lot bigger."<ref name=billboard-rockinrio>{{cite web|title=Robert Sillerman on Rock In Rio Deal (Exclusive)|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/5800683/robert-sillerman-on-rock-in-rio-deal-exclusive|work=Billboard.biz|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=billboard-rirlv>{{cite web|title=Rock in Rio's Roberto Medina Reveals Plan For Las Vegas Festival in 2015: Exclusive|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/5800770/rock-in-rios-roberto-medina-reveals-plan-for-las-vegas-festival-in|work=Billboard.biz|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

On March 20, 2014, ''Rock in Rio USA'' was officially announced, to be held in May 2015. For its inaugural year, it would consist of four days of performances held across two weekends, with plans to expand to six days on subsequent editions.<ref name=bb-teams>{{cite web |title=Rock In Rio USA Teams With MGM, Cirque & Yucaipa Ahead of 2015 Debut |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/6062785/rock-in-rio-usa-teams-with-mgm-cirque-yucaipa-ahead-of-2015-debut |work=Billboard.biz |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rock in Rio, whose headliners have included Beyonce and Justin Timberlake, heads to Las Vegas|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2014/mar/31/rock-rio-whose-headliners-have-included-beyonce-an/|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> In April 2014, further details were announced; on April 22, 2014, it was announced that Rock in Rio would partner with [[MGM Resorts International]], [[Cirque du Soleil]], and [[Ron Burkle]]'s [[Yucaipa Companies]] to construct a 33-acre open-air multi-purpose venue on the Strip near [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] as its site. While the festival itself would not have any direct ownership stake in the venue, it contributed resources to its development, and secured a long-term deal to hold Rock in Rio USA at the venue biennially from 2015 to 2019. Additionally, Yucaipa Companies and Cirque each acquired a 20% equity stake in a subsidiary that would own Rock in Rio USA; Rock in Rio CEO Louis Justo explained that the involvement of Cirque de Soleil was oriented more towards their knowledge of the Las Vegas market and its consumers, rather than their creative works. At least $30 million was spent on promoting the festival's inaugural edition across multiple platforms, including marketing partnerships with [[Clear Channel Communications]] and [[National CineMedia]].<ref name=lvsun-mgmresort>{{cite web|title=MGM Resorts, Cirque to build 33-acre, open-air venue to host Rock in Rio in Las Vegas|url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2014/apr/21/rock-rio-headed-las-vegas-mgm-resorts-cirque-build/|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=bb-teams />

[[File:2013-0222-CircusCircus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Circus Circus Las Vegas]], a casino near the site of the Las Vegas Festival Grounds]]
Rock in Rio USA was held at the [[Las Vegas Festival Grounds]], a {{convert|33|acre|adj=on}}, open-air venue with a capacity of 80,000, located on [[Sahara Avenue]] near the MGM-owned [[Circus Circus Las Vegas]] hotel and casino. It is owned by the MGM/Yucaipa/Cirque consortium, who collectively spent $20 million on its development. Rock in Rio organizers collaborated with MGM and Yucaipa on the design of the venue to ensure a "very premium festival experience", stating that it would have an [[amusement park]]-inspired layout with five stages (including dedicated stages for [[Indie music|indie]] and [[electronic music]] acts), rides (such as a [[roulette]]-themed [[ferris wheel]] and a [[zipline]]), shopping, and themed food courts.

== Lineup ==
=== 2015===
For its inaugural edition, the festival featured a lineup of at least 120 acts. The two weekends of the festival were oriented towards different genres. The first weekend's lineup was [[rock music|rock]]-oriented, with the second being [[pop music|pop]]-oriented. Owing to its increasing prominence in the festival (especially under SFX ownership), [[electronic music]] acts were featured on a dedicated stage; additionally, plans were disclosed for a nightly feature where an EDM act would "fly" from the main stage to the EDM stage, and transform the venue into a "360-degree nightclub" to close each night.<ref name=lvsun-mgmresort/><ref name=bb-teams/><ref name=billboard-rockinrio/>

The first artists for the 2015 lineup were revealed on September 26, 2014, at an event in [[New York City]], including the [[Deftones]], [[Jessie J]],  [[John Legend]], [[Linkin Park]], [[No Doubt]], [[Metallica]], and [[Taylor Swift]].<ref name=lvw-lineup1>{{cite news|title=Metallica, Taylor Swift and No Doubt included in partial lineup reveal for Rock in Rio USA|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/ae/music/2014/sep/26/metallica-taylor-swift-no-doubt-rock-in-rio-USA/|accessdate=27 September 2014|work=Las Vegas Weekly|date=27 September 2014}}</ref>
