==History==
[[File:AFP Medical Center July 2016.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Front gate of the AFP Medical Center along V. Luna Road.]]
The V. Luna General Hospital was named after [[Colonel|Col.]] Victoriano Luna who was then Chief of the Medical Service and Adviser to the Chief of Staff. He came up with the idea in 1935 of putting up an Army Station Hospital to address the health service needs of a growing army.<ref name=MS001>{{cite web|title=History of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Medical Center|url=http://www.afpmedicalcenter.com/mc6/afpmc2/aboutus/history.htm|publisher=AFP Medical Center|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>

By 1937, Army Engineers started the design conceptualization and construction of Luna's dream. On 3 September 1946, pursuant to Headquarters Philippine Army (HPA) GO Nr 512, the 1st Philippine Army General Hospital was named "Colonel Victoriano Luna General Hospital" in honor Luna who conceptualized the medical center.<ref name="MS001"/>
