The '''Garner Mill''' was a historic [[grist mill]] and [[saw mill]] on [[Shoal Creek (Tennessee River)|Shoal Creek]] in [[Lawrenceburg, Tennessee]].

The original mill was built in 1820 by James Scott, after the [[county commission|county court]] gave him permission to establish a mill on Shoal Creek. It had many owners through its history. C. H. Nicholson, who acquired it in 1851, operated it as both a [[water-power]]ed sawmill and a grist mill.<ref name=countrysideride>{{cite web|url=http://www.selectlawrence.com/pdf/south-scenic-driving-tours.pdf |title=TAKE A COUNTRYSIDE RIDE: A SCENIC TOUR OF SOUTHEAST LAWRENCE COUNTY |author1=Anne Morrow |author2=Bobby Alford |author3=Kathy Niedergeses |author4=Wallace Palmore |publisher=Lawrence County Tennessee Chamber of Commerce |page=1 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234303/http://www.selectlawrence.com/pdf/south-scenic-driving-tours.pdf |archivedate=April 26, 2014 |df= }}</ref> The mill was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name="nris"/>
