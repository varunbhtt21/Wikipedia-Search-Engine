==Location==
Fedamore is located in east County Limerick roughly 10 miles/16 kilometres from [[Limerick City]]. Nearby villages include [[Crecora]], Manister, [[Croom, County Limerick|Croom]], Ballyneety and Meanus. The village is just off the R511 regional road and is situated on a small hill roughly 90 metres in height. Fedamore is in the [[Limerick County (Dáil constituency)|Limerick County]] [[Dáil Éireann]] constituency and in the [[Adare]]/[[Rathkeale]] local election constituency.

==History==
The name Fedamore comes from Fiadh Damair or Feadaimir, the wood of Damar, a local Gaelic chieftain. Fairs were held in Fedamore on 5 May and on 9 October. Castles were located at Englishtown, Rockstown and [[Williamstown, Fedamore|Williamstown]] and the latter two have ruins still intact. There are remains of an abbey in Friarstown in a field which marks the border between Fedamore and Donoughmore parishes. At [[Fanningstown, Fedamore|Fanningstown]] and Rockstown, there are old disused graveyards. St. Patrick's well is located at Kilpeacon which is in Fedamore parish although in reality is located far closer to [[Crecora]] village. An old well called St. John's well seems to have been lost, as has the mass rock at Rockstown. The present day church was built in 1830.

==Services==
Fedamore currently has a church, two national schools: Fedamore and [[Carnane]], one pub: The Ranch, a community hall, a [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] field and four housing estates: Cluain Ard, Castlequarter Heights, Ballyea Close and Clohessy Park. Local organisations include a hall committee, [[Muintir na Tíre]], and [[Irish Countrywomen's Association|ICA]] guild, a pastoral council and a community alert scheme.

==Sports==
The main sport in Fedamore is hurling. The club's pitch is situated in Boolavoord and they won two [[Limerick Senior Hurling Championship|County Senior Hurling Championships]] in 1912 and 1927. Famous hurlers such as [[Paddy Clohessy]] who won [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]s in 1934, 1936 and 1940. The club's fortunes have dwindled in recent years and they now compete at Junior A level, while at underage they are forced to join up with neighbouring clubs to field teams. Gaelic football is played at Junior B level and Fedamore reached the county final in 2013 but were beaten by Feenagh/Kilmeedy.

Soccer is also popular in the parish and the local team, Castle Rovers, play in [[Williamstown, Fedamore|Williamstown]] and currently compete in Division 2A in the Limerick & District Junior Soccer League. Fedamore Villa is the over-40s soccer side.

Other sports groups in the parish include the Fedamore & District Gun Club, Fedamore Coursing Club, the Fedamore Powerlifting Club and the Fedamore Foot Beagles. Darts tournaments are also held in The Ranch bar.
