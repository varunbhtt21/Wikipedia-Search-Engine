==2014 arrest and criticism of government==
On 14 December 2014 Turkish police arrested more than two dozen senior journalists and media executives on charges of "forming, leading and being a member of an armed terrorist organization." Among those now detained was Dumanlı, who was serving as editor-in-chief of ''Zaman''. The arrested were people associated with the [[Gülen movement]]. The Turkish government accuses the movement of infiltrating the police and judiciary. Police arriving at 7.30 a.m. at the newspaper's office were greeted by scores of protesters shouting "a free media cannot be silenced." They had mounted a vigil after tweets from "{{Interlanguage link multi|Fuatavni|tr}}" - a reliable but anonymous source - had warned of the raid. Police retreated only to reappear in the afternoon when Dumanlı gave himself up voluntarily.

A statement by the [[US State Department]] drawing attention to raids against media outlets "openly critical of the current Turkish government", cautioned Turkey not to violate its "own democratic foundations".<ref>{{cite news|title=In Turkey, police arrest journalists and executives|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/14/world/europe/turkey-media-crackdown/|accessdate=19 December 2014|newspaper=CNN}}</ref> [[EU]] foreign affairs chief [[Federica Mogherini]] and EU Enlargement Commissioner [[Johannes Hahn]] said that the arrests went "against European values" and "are incompatible with the freedom of media, which is a core principle of democracy".<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey media arrests: Mogherini leads EU criticism|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30471996|accessdate=19 December 2014|newspaper=BBC}}</ref>

On 19 December 2014 a court ordered that Dumanlı and seven others to be released due to lack of evidence. Thousands gathered outside Çağlayan Courthouse in İstanbul to show support for the detained journalists and police officials. While crowds celebrated the release of Dumanlı in the courtyard of the courthouse, they protested the arrest order for [[Samanyolu TV]] General Manager Hidayet Karaca and former police chiefs Tufan Ergüder, Ertan Erçıktı and Mustafa Kılıçaslan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court rules for release of Zaman chief editor, Samanyolu manager arrested|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_court-rules-for-release-of-zaman-chief-editor-samanyolu-manager-arrested_367441.html|accessdate=19 December 2014|newspaper=Today's Zaman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219133859/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_court-rules-for-release-of-zaman-chief-editor-samanyolu-manager-arrested_367441.html|archivedate=19 December 2014|df=}}</ref>
