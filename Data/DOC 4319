'''Cefn Ila''' ({{lang-cy|Coed Cefn Ila}}) is an {{convert|83|acre}} [[woodland]] located in [[Llanbadoc]], a mile away from [[Usk]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]], owned and run by the [[Woodland Trust|Woodland Trust Wales]] (Coed Cadw).<ref name=WTAbout/><ref name=WGCefdIla/>

==History==
The estate was developed as a [[hunting lodge]], and then [[medieval]] [[manor house]] with surrounding lands. Bought in the mid-[[Victorian era]] by [[Edward John Trelawny]], a friend of notable poets [[Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], he extensively redeveloped the gardens as a then modern [[pleasure gardens]] through extensive [[Terrace garden|terracing]]. After his death, new owner Joseph Lister employed architect Alfred Waterhouse to rebuild the property as a picturesque large cottage manor house. After his death in 1885 in a riding accident on the estate, it was bought by Gustavus Ducarel, the 4th Marquis de la Pasture.<ref name=BBCefnIlaMat/> His family had fled to England post the [[French Revolution]], and although his father had by this time regained control of the family estate at [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]], they lived mainly at the close-by Llandogo Priory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starcourse.org/emd/mrs_h.htm|title=Mrs Henry de la Pasture (from Auberon Waugh's foreword to ''The Unlucky Family'')|publisher=StarCourse.org|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

After [[World War I]], with the estate virtually abandoned by the now again fully French-resident family, in 1925 the entire estate was annexed to Pontypool Hospital, and after redevelopment opened on 3 October 1925 as the "Kate Ayres Gustard Convalescent Home", providing care for up to 24 women and children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikebrothers.co.uk/cefnilabook.html|title=Book commemorating the opening of "Kate Ayres Gustard Convalescent Home", 3 October 1925|publisher=BikeBrothers.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Used from September 1939 as a child evacuation centre in the phoney war leading up to [[World War II]], it then became a war casualty convalescence unit. Post war, in 1947 it was reopened as a [[maternity hospital]], with accommodation for up to 18 patients.<ref name=BBCefnIlaMat/>

During the early hours of 14 September 1973,<ref name=BBC27114007/> only two weeks after a fire inspection, a fire consumed the entire main property. As today, only the [[stable]] block survived (now home to a protected roost of bats), and the patients resultantly transferred to County Hospital in [[Griffithstown]].<ref name=BBCefnIlaMat>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikebrothers.co.uk/cefnila.htm|title=Cefn Ila Maternity Hospital|publisher=BikeBrothers.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140425150344/http://www.bikebrothers.co.uk/cefnila.htm|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Present==
As the house and estate fell into ruin, the surrounding lands and resultant naturally developed wood were bought at auction in 2007 by Coed Cadw.<ref name=WGCefdIla>{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/forestry/plantatree/visitplantsite/coedcefnila/?lang=en|title=Coed Cefn Ila|publisher=[[Welsh Government]]|date=31 October 2013|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The site is located a few miles away from [[Wentwood Forest]], which is the largest ancient woodland site in Wales.<ref name=WTAbout>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/wood-information/cefn-ila/|title=More about Cefn Ila|publisher=[[Woodland Trust]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

Since taking ownership, Coed Cadw have since planted an additional 36,000 broadleaf trees. The long term plan is to develop a mosaic of habitats, from grasslands through wild flower meadows to an [[arboretum]], which will be a combination of the original Victorian planting, local heritage fruit trees, plus new broadleaf varieties. The wildlife within the parklands includes a maternity roost for bats, and habitats for a number of birds including [[Song Thrush]] and [[Marsh Tit]]. Today the site is a [[Cadw]] designated Historic Park and Garden, and a priority habitat under the [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]].<ref name=HLF2014/>

Coed Cadw are working with the Usk Rural Life Museum, to record and communicate the history of the site to visitors. In April 2014, the trust received a [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant of £297,700,<ref name=HLF2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/news/Pages/DiscoveringCefnIla%E2%80%99sHabitats,HospitalsandHistory.aspx|title=Discovering Cefn Ila’s habitats, hospitals and history|publisher=[[Heritage Lottery Fund]]|date=22 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426214539/http://www.hlf.org.uk/news/Pages/DiscoveringCefnIla%E2%80%99sHabitats%2CHospitalsandHistory.aspx|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> to enable formal visitor groups and educational institutes to visit a fully restored walled garden and developed woodlands, together with associated visitor facilities.<ref name=BBC27114007>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-27114007|title=Cefn Ila woodland site boost by £297,700 heritage grant|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|date=24 April 2014|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>
