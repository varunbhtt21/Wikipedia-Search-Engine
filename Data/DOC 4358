== Early life ==
Dasa was born in Kapileswarpur Sasana (one of the 16 traditional Sasana villages in [[Puri]]) on [[Radhastami]] in 1491, in an established Brahmin family of Kaushiki Gotra. His mother was Padmabati Debi and his father was Bhagabana Dasa.

His father was a speaker of the [[Bhagavatam]] in Utkala. Pleased with Bhagbana Dasa's elucidation of the [[Bhagavatam]], King [[Purushottama Deva]], the then reigning [[Utkala Kingdom|king of Utkala]]{{citation needed|date= May 2017|reason=[[Purushottama Deva]] says Gajapati Kingdom}}, gave him the title “Purana Panda”. He trained Jagannatha to follow him as a Purana Panda. Jagannatha Dasa was almost the same age as [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]]. Soon after their chance meeting under the Kalpa Bata, a spiritual kinship grew between the two that developed into a warm, lifelong friendship. Chaitanya was an avid admirer of Dasa and called him "''Atibadi''."

== Literary works ==
Dasa wrote the Odia Bhagabata. It had a great influence in the standardizing of the [[Odia language]]. Its popularity in [[Odisha]] reached to the level of it being worshiped in many homes in Odisha. The villages in Odisha used to have a small house or room known as ''bhagabata tungi'', where villagers would gather to listen to recitations of Dasa's Bhagabata. Many of its verses have become [[proverb]]s and are cited by people throughout Odisha.

The work includes 12 [[volume]]s and each volume has 10-30 [[Chapter (books)|chapter]]s. Each chapter has 50 to 300 [[stanza]]s.

Gananath Das translated the Odia Bhagabata into English. The English translation is ''Readings from Bhagabata''<ref name="Das1996">{{cite book|first=G.
