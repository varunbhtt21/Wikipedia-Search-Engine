==Biography==
Clemens studied at the [[University of Vienna]], 1952–53, before graduating from [[Notre Dame University]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1955. Under a [[Ford Foundation]] fellowship Clemens studied at [[Columbia University]], 1955–61. He did research for his dissertation on Soviet disarmament policy under [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] at [[Moscow State University]] (1958–59), and at the [[Hoover Institution]] (1959). At Columbia, he received a master's degree and Certificate of the Russian Institute in 1957 and a Ph.D. in International Relations in 1961. Clemens grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, graduating first in his class in 1951 from Purcell High School, where he also played tackle on the state champion football team.

==Professional career==
Since the 1960s, Clemens has taught at a number of academic institutions, including [[Iolani School]] in Honolulu, Hawaii, the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and Boston University, where, since 2012, he is Professor Emeritus of Political Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/polisci/people/faculty/clemens/ |title=Walter Clemens » Department of Political Science &#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref>  Since 1963, Clemens has been an Associate at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu/people/bio_clemens.html |title=Walter Clemens Jr.|accessdate=2014-04-25|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922070315/http://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu/people/bio_clemens.html |archivedate=2011-09-22 }}</ref>  He was also an Associate at the Harvard University [[Belfer Center]] for Science and International Affairs, 1986–2003. Clemens’s papers are housed at the [[Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center]] at Boston University. His work has been supported by four major grants from the Ford Foundation and two from the Rockefeller Foundation. His research was supported also by the University of California, MIT, Columbia, Harvard, Boston University, and the East-West Center in Honolulu, and by several government agencies including [[NASA]], the U.S. [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], the [[U.S. State Department]], the [[Fulbright-Hays Program]], and [[NATO]]. Clemens has reviewed for ''New York Journal of Books'' since 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/reviewer/walter-clemens |title= William Clemens|work=New York Journal of Books |accessdate=2018-11-13}}</ref>

==Arms control and security studies==
Clemens has also made contributions to the study of arms control in U.S. relations with the USSR, China, and North Korea. As Executive Officer of the White House Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament for International Cooperation Year 1965, Clemens drafted the Committee’s proposal, "3-Year Moratorium urged on Antimissile Missiles."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kleiman |first=Robert |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/11/24/archives/3year-moratorium-urged-on-antimissile-missiles-a-delay-is-urged-on.html |title=3-Year Moratorium Urged On Antimissile Missiles - A DELAY IS URGED ON ANTIMISSILES - Front Page - NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=1965-11-24 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= OUR DEFENSE AGAINST MISSILES|date=2013-07-31 |doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.1966.tb00233.x |volume=5 |issue = 9|journal=The Sciences |pages=1–4}}</ref>  In the 1980s, Clemens conducted surveys showing that most Americans erroneously believed that their country was protected by an effective missile defense shield.<ref>"A Quiz for a Peaceful Sunday," ''Los Angeles Times'', March 22, 1981; cited also in ''Fortune'', 1981-10-19, p. 142.</ref>  Clemens treated this as a dangerous illusion.

==Soviet and post-Soviet studies==
Having participated in the first exchange of U.S. and Soviet graduate students in 1958–59, Clemens became one of the first specialists to study Soviet arms control policies and, later, one of the few scholars to anticipate the demise of the Soviet system.<ref>"Will the Soviet Empire Survive 1984?" ''Christian Science Monitor'', 1981-07-10.</ref>  As the Soviet system entered its final years, he wrote ''Can Russia Change? The USSR Confronts Global Interdependence'' (1990) and ''Baltic Independence and Russian Empire'' (1991). In reviewing Can Russia Change? for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', John C. Campbell wrote "the main argument for relations of '[[complex interdependence]]' is clear and convincing."<ref name="foreignaffairs">{{cite journal|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/45619/john-c-campbell/can-russia-change-the-ussr-confronts-global-interdependence|title=Can Russia Change?

==Scholarship on North and South Korea==
Clemens is also an authority on North Korea.  He has written many articles on North Korea and on China for the ''[[Journal of East Asian Studies]]'', ''[[Global Asia]]'' and ''[http://thediplomat.com/ The Diplomat]'' (on-line). His book ''[http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=3386#.WOqTdqK1uF4 North Korea and the World: Human Rights, Arms Control, and Strategies for Negotiation]'' was published by the University Press of Kentucky in 2016. Clemens is on the editorial board of ''[[Asian Perspectives|Asian Perspective]]'', where he writes a book review essay for each issue.  Analyzing events at the eastern edge of the former Soviet sphere, Clemens asked what lessons, if any, from the U.S.-Soviet experience might apply to arms control negotiations with North Korea. He published ''[https://www.routledge.com/Getting-to-Yes-in-Korea/Jr/p/book/9781594514074 Getting to Yes in Korea]'' (with a foreword by Gov. [[Bill Richardson]]) in 2010, followed by several articles in ''Global Asia'', ''The New York Times'', and ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''. ''Getting to Yes in Korea'' was the first book to systematically apply international relations, complexity and negotiation theories to the tensions on stemming from North Korea's nuclear program, and the book has been received praise from [[Graham Allison]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20140903090457/https://www.usnwc.edu/Academics/Faculty/Terence-Roehrig.aspx Terence Roehrig].<ref name="bu">{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/polisci/2010/10/13/professor-walter-clemens-new-book-getting-to-yes-in-korea/|title=New Book by Walter Clemens: Getting to Yes in Korea &raquo;  Department of Political Science  &#124; Blog Archive  &#124; Boston University|publisher=bu.edu|accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref><ref name="wordpress">{{cite web|url=http://vtncankor.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/book-review-getting-to-yes-in-north-korea-by-walter-c-clemens-jr/|title=Books: "Getting to Yes in Korea" by Walter C.

==Complexity science==
In 2004, Clemens published the second edition of ''Dynamics of International Relations'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2004). The book presents a new approach to the study of international relations and has become an increasingly popular alternative to more traditional international relations course texts. ''Dynamics of International Relations'' has received professional praise from a wide spectrum of scholars and practitioners, including Governor [[Bill Richardson]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], J. [[Ann Tickner]], [[Michael W. Doyle]] and [[J. David Singer|David Singer]].<ref name="amazon">{{cite book|title=Amazon.com: Dynamics of International Relations: Conflict and Mutual Gain in an Era of Global Interdependence (9780742530119): Walter C., Jr. Clemens: Books|isbn = 978-0742530119|last1 = Clemens|first1 = Walter C.|date = 2004-02-16}}</ref>

His most recent work is ''[http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5782-complexity-science-and-world-af.aspx Complexity Science and World Affairs]'' (State University of New York Press, 2013). This book, according to S. Fredrick Starr at the School for Advanced International Studies, “offers a fresh, even startling, paradigm and process for analyzing the seemingly unpredictable relations within and among human societies. With impressive clarity he proposes that ‘the capacity to cope with complexity’ has become a key determinant of success in our intricately interrelated world.” In a similar vein, [[Jacek Kugler]] (professor at Claremont Graduate University and former president of the International Studies Association) wrote that “this breakthrough book provides a new, promising general paradigm exploring and explaining the complexity of world politics. For scholars and analysts pushing the boundaries of our field, this is a must-read volume.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5782-complexity-science-and-world-af.aspx |title=Complexity Science and World Affairs |publisher=Sunypress.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref>
