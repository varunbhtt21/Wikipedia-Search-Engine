Swain was one of the most prolific wood-engravers of the nineteenth century. His own work is not always signed, and the signature "Swain sc" must be taken to include the engraving of assistants working for his firm. In the later 19th century his wood-engravings were generally printed from [[electrotype]]s; but those done for ''Punch'' were printed from the original wood-blocks.<ref name="DNB"/> 
 
Nearly all the illustrations in the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' were engraved by Swain, and he also worked largely for other periodicals such as ''Once a Week'', ''[[Good Words]]'', ''The Argosy'', and for the publications of the [[Religious Tract Society]] and the [[Baptist Missionary Society]]. He engraving extensively after [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Fred Walker]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[Frederick Sandys]], [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]], [[Richard Ansdell]], [[Fred Barnard]], and other major illustrators, from 1860 onwards.<ref name="DNB"/>

A series of articles on Fred Walker, [[Charles Henry Bennett]], [[George John Pinwell]], and [[Fritz Eltze]], which Swain wrote for ''Good Words'' (1888&ndash;89), were incorporated in ''Toilers in Art'', edited by Henry C. Ewart (1891).<ref name="DNB"/>

==Family==
In 1843 Swain married Martha Cooper. They had three daughters and a son, Joseph Blomeley Swain, who carried on the printing and engraving establishment.<ref name="DNB"/>
