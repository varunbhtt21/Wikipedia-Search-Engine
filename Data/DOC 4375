'''''The Susquehanna Breakdown Music Festival''''', formerly known as The Old Farmer's Ball, is a one-day music festival held at the [[Toyota Pavilion at Montage Mountain]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. The focus of the festival centers around the arts and spans musical genres including [[Folk music|folk]], [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[Roots rock|roots]], and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. The festival began in 2013 when Cabinet, a prominent regional band in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and [[Live Nation Entertainment]] started the festival to bring attention to not only their musical genre, but also to regional artists, farmers and craftsmen, who showcased and sold their wares throughout the festival. To bring further attention to the festival ''[[Weekender (Northeastern Pennsylvania weekly)|The Weekender]]'' and local pub The Backyard Alehouse signed on as sponsors, and thus the festival began. It was renamed in 2014 to reflect the name of a Cabinet song and to further personalize it for not only themselves, but both fans and concertgoers. <ref name="1st Annual OLD FARMERS BALL hosted by Cabinet">{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Forums/Thread.aspx?group=0&topic=8&thread=75498 |title=1st Annual OLD FARMERS BALL hosted by Cabinet |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>
