{{Campaignbox Second French intervention in Mexico}}
The '''Battle of Las Cumbres''' also known as the '''Battle of Acultzingo''' was a skirmish at the [[Acultzingo Pass]] between the French invasion force under [[Charles de Lorencez]] and Mexican republican forces under [[Ignacio Zaragoza]].  It took place on 28 April 1862.  Despite holding the high ground, Zaragoza was not willing to risk his forces by engaging the French Army in the open.  As the French troops seized the first line of Mexican entrenchments, Zaragoza withdrew his forces to their stronghold of [[Puebla]].<ref name="Harbottle">{{Cite book|title=Harbottle's Dictionary of Battles|edition=second|date =1979|publisher=Granada|id={{ISBN|0-246-11103-8}}|page=11|author=Thomas Benfield Harbottle, George Bruce}}</ref>
