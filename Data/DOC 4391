Title : Abusive supervision
Text : '''[[Abusive]] [[Supervisor|supervision]]''' is most commonly studied in the context of the workplace, although can arise in other areas such as in the household and at school. "Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome." <sup>[[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions|[weasel ]]]</sup><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B.

== Workplace bullying ==

{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Abusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.<ref name=Tepper>Tepper BJ Abusive supervision in work organizations: Review, synthesis, and research agenda Journal of Management June 2007 Vol 33 no 3 P261-289</ref>

== Workplace deviance ==

{{Main|Workplace deviance}}
Workplace deviance is closely related to abusive supervision. Abusive supervision is defined as the "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors".<ref name="Mitchell">{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = M. | last2 = Ambrose | first2 = M.L. | year = 2007 | title = Abusive Supervision and Workplace Deviance and the Moderating Effects of Negative Reciprocity Beliefs | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 4| pages = 1159–1168 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.4.1159 | pmid=17638473}}</ref> This could be when supervisors ridicule their employees, give them the [[silent treatment]], remind them of past failures, fail to give proper credit, wrongfully assign blame or blow up in fits of temper.<ref name="Larsen">James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings</ref> It may seem like employees who are abused by their supervisor will either directly retaliate or withdraw by quitting the job but in reality many strike out against their employer by engaging in organizational deviant behaviors. Since employees control many of the organization's resources, they often use, or abuse anything they can. This abuse of resources may come in the form of time, office supplies, raw materials, finished products or the services that they provide. This usually occurs in two steps. First step is that commitment is destroyed and employees stop caring about the welfare of the employer. The second step is that the abused employee will get approval (normally implied) of their coworkers to commit deviant acts.<ref name= "Larsen"/>

Workplace experiences may fuel the worker to [[act out]]. Research has been conducted demonstrating that the perception of not being [[respect]]ed is one of the main causes for workplace deviance; workplace dissatisfaction is also a factor. According to Bolin and Heatherly,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bolin | first1 = A. | last2 = Heatherly | year = 2001 | title = Predictors of Employee Deviance: The Relationship between Bad Attitudes and Bad Behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Business and Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| page = 405 | doi = 10.1023/A:1007818616389 }}</ref> "dissatisfaction results in a higher incidence of minor offenses, but does not necessarily lead to severe offense". An employee who is less satisfied with his or her work may become less productive as their needs are not met. In the workplace, "frustration, injustices and threats to self are primary antecedents to employee deviance".<ref>The past, present, and future of workplace deviance research.
Bennett, Rebecca J.; Robinson, Sandra L.Greenberg, Jerald (Ed), (2003). Organizational behavior: The state of the science (2nd ed.), (pp. 247-281).</ref> Although workplace deviance does occur, the behavior is not universal. There are two preventive measures that business owners can use to protect themselves.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first is strengthening the employee's commitment by reacting strongly to abusive supervision so that the employee knows that the behavior is not accepted. Holding the employee at high esteem by reminding them of their importance, or setting up programs that communicate concern for the employee may also strengthen employee commitment. Providing a positive ethical climate can also help. Employers can do this by having a clear code of conduct that is applied to both managers and employees alike.<ref name= "Larsen"/>

== Social undermining ==

{{Main|Social undermining}}
Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.<ref name=Hoobler>{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Brass | first2 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 1125–1133 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125 | pmid=16953773}}</ref> For example, abusive supervision includes a "boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = S.

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates’ reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat?

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person’s] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi & Norman, 1985, p.&nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.<ref>8. Hoobler, J. M., & Brass, D. J. (2006). Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 91(5), 1125-1133. {{DOI|10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125}}</ref>

== Machiavellianism ==

{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}
In research, the presence of ''[[Machiavellianism]]'' was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision.<ref>Kohyar Kiazada, Simon Lloyd D. Restubog, Thomas J.

Tang In pursuit of power: The role of authoritarian leadership in the relationship between supervisors’ Machiavellianism and subordinates’ perceptions of abusive supervisory behavior</ref>

== Context and Outcome Correlates ==
Abusive supervision has been investigated primarily in corporate and education contexts. In the ''corporate'' context, abusive supervision has been found to be negatively related to followers’ attitudes towards the leader, job satisfaction, job-related attitudes, justice, commitment, positive self-evaluation, and well-being. In addition, such corporate abusive supervision is positively associated with undesirable consequences such as follower resistance, turnover intention, counterproductive work behaviour, negative affectivity, and stress<ref>{{Cite journal|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Journal of Management|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1940–1965|language=en|doi=10.1177/0149206315573997|year = 2017|last1 = MacKey|first1 = Jeremy D.|last2=Frieder|first2=Rachel E.|last3=Brees|first3=Jeremy R.|last4=Martinko|first4=Mark J.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schyns|first=Birgit|last2=Schilling|first2=Jan|date=2013-02-01|title=How bad are the effects of bad leaders?
