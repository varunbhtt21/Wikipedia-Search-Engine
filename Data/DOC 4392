'''''Ratha Sapthami''''' (ರಥಸಪ್ತಮಿ) is a 1986 Indian-Kannada romantic musical film directed by [[M. S. Rajashekar]] and produced by S. A. Govindaraj. It stars [[Shivarajkumar]] in his second venture after ''[[Anand (1986 film)|Anand]]''. Debutant actress [[Niveditha Arjun|Asha Rani]] and playwright Parvathavani star in the lead roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celebritykick.com/kannada-actor/shivaraj-kumar-movies-list-biography|title=Shivaraj Kumar Movies list & Biography - Celebrity family wiki|publisher=}}</ref> The musical score was composed by [[Upendra Kumar]], while the lyrics, screenplay and dialogues were written by [[Chi. Udaya Shankar]]. [[P. Vasu]] was co-writer of this movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/shivalinga-mounts-kannada-news-121138.html|title=IndiaGlitz - Shivalinga Mounts - Kannada Movie News|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chitraloka.com/news/11433-shivalinga-launched.html|title=Shivalinga Launched - chitraloka.com - Kannada Movie News, Reviews - Image|publisher=}}</ref> The story is based on a Kannada novel of the same name by Vidyullatha Sasanoor.

''Ratha Sapthami'' opened on 12 December 1986 and was declared a musical blockbuster.

Co-screenwriter [[P. Vasu]] directed a thematically similar movie called ''[[Love Birds (1996 film)|Love Birds]]'' in 1996 in Tamil. The story line of ''[[Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai]]'' was also similar to that of ''Ratha Sapthami''. The interval twist — where the hero supposedly dies in an accident — and the second half of the movie — where the heroine is sent to her uncle's place to overcome her depression but is shocked to find a lookalike in a vehicle who is also seen later on in a discotheque dancing merrily — went on to be used in the Hindi movie ''[[Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai]]''.
