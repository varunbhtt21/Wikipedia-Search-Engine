This has had a tag on it for 33 months and I am beginning to wonder if this is the same company as [[Institute of Refrigeration]]. <span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 15:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''.  It appears to be a reputable, innocuous international organization.  It produces a journal on refrigeration, ''International Journal of Refrigeration'', that is published by [[Elsevier]], per [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-refrigeration/ http://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-refrigeration/].  AFD is not suitable for calls for cleanup, or for speculation. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 01:47, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::It is for notability tags, I should've been clearer in my message. My point was that other article had been ''deleted'' as non-notable at AfD.--<span style="background:#FF0;font-family:Rockwell Extra Bold">[[User:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">Laun</font>]][[User talk:Launchballer|<font color="#00F">chba</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Launchballer|<font color="#00F">ller</font>]]</span> 09:03, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Well, the International Institute of Refrigeration is not the same as the Institute of Refrigeration.  One has a respected journal.  Other has a newsletter.  Clear from short time browsing Google.  I think the nom is mistaken. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 11:04, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Call for closure with Keep then, the nomination is withdrawn and there are no !votes for deletion. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 09:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:::At [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion#How an AFD discussion is closed]], it is explained that a nominator can close a discussion under current situation (that no votes for deletion are present).  Follow instructions there.  If instructions there are not sufficient, please ask for guidance at [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion]] (and point out how you find the instructions inadequate, if you do find them inadequate).  It would be a service saving time of others likely to come consider this case in the next days and/or weeks, if you would figure it out and close this properly.
