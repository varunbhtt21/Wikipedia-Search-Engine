*'''Keep''' There is no requirement for anyone to die for an event to be notable. The reason why this event is notable is stated in the "Significance" section of the article. --[[User:Pontificalibus|<font style="color:#555555"><strong>Pontificalibus</strong></font>]] ([[User talk:Pontificalibus#top|talk]]) 21:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''merge to [[Jarvis plc]]''' given that this incident is only significantly notable as one of a series of incidents leading to that company's loss of contract and ultimate failure. Ordinarily this wouldn't be more than a passing episode in the papers and nightly news. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 03:10, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Merge''' to [[Jarvis plc]] per [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]]. The 'significance' section is mostly about the company rather this incident so there is considerable overlap. [[User:Qwfp|Qwfp]] ([[User talk:Qwfp|talk]]) 11:16, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
