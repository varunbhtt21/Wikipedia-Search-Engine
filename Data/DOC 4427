No notable wrestler. She won a title long time ago (less a onth) and the article is one line. [[User:HHH Pedrigree|HHH Pedrigree]] ([[User talk:HHH Pedrigree|talk]]) 15:33, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Her notability is not a function of how long ago her title was. I'm not saying she is notable, but the title being "a long time ago", whatever that may mean, proves nothing.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 23:26, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:I know. I said it for people outside wrestling. The article is one line and only says she won two titles, one of them, less than one month. No sources about her career. Even websites like Cagematch haven't a profile --[[User:HHH Pedrigree|HHH Pedrigree]] ([[User talk:HHH Pedrigree|talk]]) 12:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-I'm iffy on this one-if she did win a title then yes she should be kept, but still iffy. Maybe a redirect? [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:10, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I'm iffy on this too.  Title changes were rare back then, but what makes this significant is that she defeated The Fabulous Moolah for the belt, and she's recognized as having the longest title reign in history.  The problem is that WWE recognizes Moolah's reign as being interrupted, meaning that this reign technically doesn't exist.  So, I could go either way, but I'm siding with '''Abstain''' at the moment.[[User:LM2000|LM2000]] ([[User talk:LM2000|talk]]) 10:05, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[NWA World Women's Championship#Title history]]. I did a search online among the five reliable secondary sources (SLAM / Torch / Observer / Wrestleview / PWInsider)... the latter four turned up one result each, but for a grand total of two sentences (she beat Moolah for the title in 1968, and she lost the title back to Moolah in 1968). Google Books produces a few results... WWE Legends By Brian Solomon mentions (in one line) that the subject beat Moolah in 1968. The rest are based on sources online like Wikipedia, and one more is a book on Moolah. Therefore, her article is two sentences... which is summed up by the table in NWA World Women's Championship, which states when she beat Moolah for the title and lost to her for the title. <span style="border:2px solid #6E0121;">[[User:Starship.paint|<font style="color:white;background:#6E0121;">'''starship.paint'''</font>]]</span>  '''[[User talk:Starship.paint|"YES]][[Special:Contributions/Starship.paint|!"]]''' 13:37, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect to [[NWA World Women's Championship]]''' Not individually notable because she lacks the coverage to meet GNG, but redirects are cheap.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 14:31, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
