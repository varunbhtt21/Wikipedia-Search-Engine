No notable title. Even the promotion doesn't have an article. [[User:HHH Pedrigree|HHH Pedrigree]] ([[User talk:HHH Pedrigree|talk]]) 15:34, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - the professional wrestling promotion which owns this title is apparently not notable enough for an article here. A title can't be more notable than its promotion. <span style="border:2px solid #6E0121;">[[User:Starship.paint|<font style="color:white;background:#6E0121;">'''starship.paint'''</font>]]</span>  '''[[User talk:Starship.paint|"YES]][[Special:Contributions/Starship.paint|!"]]''' 10:22, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Not a notable promotion, not a notable championship.[[User:LM2000|LM2000]] ([[User talk:LM2000|talk]]) 01:48, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
