'''Bideford College''' is a [[Mixed-sex education|mixed]] [[secondary school]] and [[sixth form]] located in [[Bideford]] in the [[English county]] of [[Devon]].<ref>http://bidefordcollege.org/</ref>

==History==
It is the only state-funded secondary school in Bideford. In 2003, the college was awarded specialist science status as part of the [[specialist schools programme]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bideford.devon.sch.uk/bid_ssc_index.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306124725/http://bideford.devon.sch.uk/bid_ssc_index.htm |archive-date=2015-03-06 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> Due to its specialist status, it received extra funding from the government for extending its educational activities.

On June 28, 2014, the then [[Secretary of State for Education]], [[Michael Gove]], visited the college.<ref>[http://www.northdevonjournal.co.uk/MP-Michael-Gove-visits-Bideford-College-meets/story-19420132-detail/story.html "MP Michael Gove visits Bideford College and meets the governors of Route 39"], ''[[North Devon Journal]]'', 2015-20-24. Retrieved 2015-06-28.</ref>

Previously a [[foundation school]] administered by [[Devon County Council]], the school converted to [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] in March 2016. The school is now part of the [[Launceston College, Cornwall|Launceston College Multi Academy Trust]], but continues to coordinate with Devon County Council for admissions.

In January 2006, the college won its bid to build a new multimillion-pound school site. Construction began in the summer of 2008 and the first phase was completed in 2010, ready for the start of the academic year in September. The second phase of the building, the outdoor sport pitches, was completed in July 2011.<ref>[http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Demolition-signals-growing-pace-163-55m-school-rebuild/story-11807615-detail/story.html "Demolition signals growing pace of £55m school rebuild"], ''[[Express & Echo]]'', 2010-01-02. Retrieved 2015-07-24.</ref> The £55 million new school was built on the old site and includes a media suite, library, sports hall, a hall known as 'The Devon Hall', and an artificial grass sports pitch. £32 million was funded from the [[Building Schools for the Future]] (BSF) programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bideford.devon.sch.uk/home/ |title=:: Bideford College Online :: Welcome To Our Home On The Web :: |publisher=Bideford.devon.sch.uk |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>

==Performance==
Figures published by the UK Government in February 2008 showed Bideford College had made significant improvements in the key stage 3 exams taken by 14-year-old students. Over the previous four years (2004 to 2007) the school’s aggregate score for the exams in English, Maths and Science has risen from 177 to 237 out of 300. This placed Bideford College joint 21st nationally in the table of most improved secondary schools published by the DCSF. Bideford was also in the top 20 percent of schools nationally based on the progress made from year 7 to year 9.

The school's latest [[OFSTED]] inspection took place on January 14–15, 2015. The overall judgement of the school was that it is in an inadequate state and requires special measures.<ref>http://bideford.devon.sch.uk/home/pdf/ofsted.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.northdevonjournal.co.uk/Bideford-College-placed-special-measures-Ofsted/story-26134118-detail/story.html "Bideford College placed in special measures by Ofsted: Full report"], ''[[North Devon Journal]]'', 2015-03-07.
