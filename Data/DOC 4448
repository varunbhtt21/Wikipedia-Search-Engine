'''''Kraliçe''''' (''Queen'') is the tenth studio album by Turkish singer [[Hande Yener]]. It was released on 12 December 2012 by Poll Production. It was Yener's first studio album since the 2011 release of ''[[Teşekkürler]]'' and included elements of [[pop music]]. All of the songs on the album were written by [[Sinan Akçıl]], the third and last of Hande Yener's albums to have Akçıl as its sole songwriter. The album was produced by Polat Yağcı and Akçıl.

''Kraliçe'', which includes an introductory speech, eights songs and three remixes, was, in Hande Yener's opinion, an album that covered all of the music styles she had experimented with so far. The album was initially going to be titled ''Hasta'', but after Akçıl wrote the song "Kraliçe" they decided to name the work after this song. The album's title and release date were announced on the billboards in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]] match between [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]] and [[AEL Limassol|AEL]] teams in [[Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium]] on 8 November 2012. The album's content and photos received mixed feedback from music critics. Some compared the songs to the ones found in Yener's 2004 album ''[[Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor]]'' and 2006 album ''[[Apayrı]]'', while others criticized the use of the title ''Kraliçe'' believing that it should not have been chosen by Yener for this album. The music video for the lead single "Hasta" was released on 6 December 2012 and the song ranked second on [[Türkçe Top 20|Turkey's official music chart]]. The album's last and final music video was made and released for "Bir Bela".

''Kraliçe'' ranked third on D&R's list of best-selling albums in Turkey, sold 79,000 copies by the end of 2012 and received the Best Album award at the [[Mimar Sinan University]] Awards and ''Siyaset Dergisi'' Awards. The promotions for the album were interrupted due to the death of Yener's father, Erol Özyener, on 30 December 2012. Due to her father's death, Yener did not perform anywhere for two months. On 27 May 2013 ''Kraliçe'' together with the new single "Ya Ya Ya Ya" and its remixes were released as a two-disc edition under the title ''Kraliçe + Ya Ya Ya Ya''.

<blockquote>"When making the third album I realized that the first two albums were made during a period that we were just warming up. This is going to be a very surprising album.

After the album's preparation process was reported occasionally by Hande Yener on Twitter, new information about the publishing process started to emerge. On 4 November 2012, producer Polat Yağcı announced the name of the album's lead single as "Hasta".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/handeyener/status/265195820876455938|title=RT @PolatYagci: Madem sen yazmıyorsun bu sefer değişiklik...|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=9 November 2012|first=Polat|last=Yağcı|date=4 November 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.is/ypJ3|archivedate=6 December 2012}}</ref> The album's title, ''Kraliçe'', announced on the billboards in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]] match between [[Fenerbahçe S.K.

<blockquote>"[The song Kraliçe] came into the album very hardly. We were asking ourselves 'Should the album be named ''Hasta''? No, no, not ''Hasta'', let's not go with something negative.' One day Sinan Akçıl called me. He said: 'Don't think about the album's name. You've got another song now and you'll name the album after it'. I responded: 'How can a song be titled Kraliçe'. Just for the sake of conversation, I know you're not gonna write it, but I thought how romantic it could be. The song started to ring in my head, and that day I went into a feast mood at home."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/magazin/magazinhatti/22244210.asp | title = Müzik beni adam etti | first = Pınar | last = Yılmazerler | publisher = ''[[Hürriyet]]'' | date = 28 December 2012 | accessdate = 23 April 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121231163650/http://www.hurriyet.com.tr:80/magazin/magazinhatti/22244210.asp | archivedate = 31 December 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

== Critical reception ==
''Kraliçe'' received negative reviews from music critics. Aside from the album's content, the use of the name ''Kraliçe'' as the work's main title was criticized. ''[[Radikal]]''{{'}}s Sarp Dakni wrote that he could not find any queens in this album, and added that after releasing "excellent" albums between 2000-2007, Yener had now destroyed his last hopes for her with the release of this album. He believed that the album's lead single "Hasta" together with the song "Kraliçe" were attempts to resemble the pieces in ''[[Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor]]'' (2004).

He also noted that Yener had started to perform pieces that were similar to the syllabic songs found in Sinan Akçıl's own album.
