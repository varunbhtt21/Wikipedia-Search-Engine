Title : Dublin Live Art Festival
Text : {{update|date=October 2018}}

The '''Dublin Live Art Festival''' is an annual event, created in order to support and promote live ''Performance Art'' in Ireland.

== Dublin Live Art Festival History ==

The Dublin Live Art Festival was founded in 2012 and is curated by live performance artist Niamh Murphy. The aim of the festival is to "build on the thriving live art community working in Ireland today, while also making connections with international live art makers".<ref>{{cite web|title=dublinliveartfestival.com|url=http://www.dublinliveartfestival.com/2012/10/history.html?view=timeslide|accessdate=2014-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426200938/http://www.dublinliveartfestival.com/2012/10/history.html?view=timeslide|archivedate=2014-04-26|df=}}</ref> The first Dublin Live Art Festival took place in 2012 with its inaugural festival event, with further varied live performance art events and exhibitions taking place as part of Dublin Live Art Festival annually since.

Murphy is known for her collaborative and curatorial practice that forges links between live art practitioners and gives visibility to Irish Live Art. The concept and impetuous of the event developed from Murphy's previous curation Straylight, for [[Darklight Film Festival]] in 2008 & 2009. This led to the establishment of Performance Art Live (P.A. Live) with [[Amanda Coogan]] The manifesto of P.A. Live outlines performance art in Ireland as perhaps developing from an enthusiasm for the live that can be traced to social traditions of sport, music and storytelling and Ireland's history of uprising.<ref>{{cite web|last=Amanda|first=Coogan|title=Performance Live Art Foundation Ireland Manifesto|url=http://www.amandacoogan.com/performance-art-live-foundation-ireland.html|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>

In 2010 P.A. Live presented Right Here Right Now at Kilmainham Gaol which was viewed as a watershed exhibition in the calendar of events of Irish Visual arts. It featured some of Ireland's top contemporary artists working within the realm of performance art, north and south of the Border and focused on artists who have live performance as the central tenet of their practice and who work as artist-performers in duration. Right Here Right Now was distinctive, providing an in-depth focus on live performance art. Visitors to this free event experienced twenty live artists, performing simultaneously over a four-hour period throughout the cells and open areas of Kilmainham Gaol’s East Wing. The artists who performed on the night were, Aine Phillips, [[Amanda Coogan]], Brian Connolly, Dominic Thorpe, Frances Mezzetti, Brian Patterson, [[Sinead McCann]], Catherine Barragry, Fergus Byrne, Michelle Browne, Ann Maria Healy, Francis Fay, [[Pauline Cummins]], Victoria Mc Cormack, Alex Conway, Helena Walsh, Sandra Johnston, Meabh Redmond, Niamh Murphy and Alastair Mac Lennan.

== Dublin Live Art Festival (DLAF) ethos ==
The festival principles stated that it:
* recognises and celebrates the huge surge in interest and production of live performance art in Ireland and abroad today.
* invests in the future and sustainability of Irish live performance art by uniting artists and curators to produce new work for new audiences.
* believes that sharing skills, knowledge and experience through our seminar series serves to strengthen our live performance art community.
* maintains a cross-disciplinary approach to forge links between the many different facets of live performance art.
* invites overseas artists to make work in Ireland and build relationships with Irish artists and venues with a view to opening up possibilities for artistic exchange.

The festival also features seminars such as Sustaining Performance based Practices in 2013. In her article Sustaining the Ephemeral El Putnum notes debates arising such as those around performance as a potentially lone practitioners and the need for collectivity.<ref name="Putnum sustain">{{cite web|last=Putnum|first=EL|title=Sustaining the Ephemeral|url=http://visualartists.ie/van-ebulletin/van-januaryfebruary-2014-sustaining-the-ephemeral-el-putnam-discusses-nigel-rolfe-masterclass-at-live-art-festival/|publisher=Visual Artist's Ireland}}</ref>  Such debates underscore the aim and relevance of the festival to support the practices of Live Artists in Ireland.
