== Fair use rationale ==
This is a sound sample from a commercial recording. Its inclusion here is claimed as fair use because:

* It emphasizes the band's new sounds, and stylistic changes from their previous album.
* It illustrates an educational article that specifically discusses the song from which this sample was taken 
* It is a sample of about 30 seconds from a much longer recording, and could not be used as a substitute for the original commercial recording; and 
* It is not replaceable with an uncopyrighted or freely copyrighted sample of comparable educational value. 
* It is believed that this sample will not decrease the value of the original work or limit the copyright holder's rights or ability to distribute the original recording. 
*It is believed that the clip's inclusion enhances rather than reduces the commercial value of the recording from which it was drawn.
