==Description==
The height of the shell attains 5.2&nbsp;mm, its diameter 5.6&nbsp;mm. The solid shell has a depressed conoidal shape. It has a false umbilicus.The small protoconch contains 1Â½ flattened turns, smooth at the origin, and gradually developing four spiral lirae which become granulose cinguli on the adult [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s. The 4 adult whorls are very slightly convex, bearing four cinguli, three of approximately equal size, the fourth immediately above the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] being more strongly developed and producing a distinct carination in the [[body whorl]]. The [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] is deeply canaliculate. The cinguli are granulose. The interstices are axially lirate, three lirae corresponding generally to two granules on the cinguli. The periphery is roundly carinate. The convex base contains nine fine granulose cinguli with axially lirate interstices. The obliqua [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is tetragonal. The outer [[Lip (gastropod)|lip]] is thick, with two rows of denticles, the outer corresponding to the cinguli, the inner about six in number. The oblique [[Columella (gastropod)|columella]] is reflexed, with a bifid tooth at the lower edge. The umbilical cavity is deep, narrow and dentate.<ref name="Ludbrook" />
