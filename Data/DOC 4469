'''Amanda Heng Liang Ngim''' ({{zh|t=|s=王良吟|p=Wáng Liáng Yín}}; born 1951) is a female contemporary artist, curator and speaker from [[Singapore]], who works in Singapore and internationally.  As an artist she has a multidisciplinary practice, working collaboratively in contemporary art exhibitions, performance, forums, workshops and art interventions. Her practice explores themes of national identity, collective memory and social relationships, [[gender politics]] and other social issues in urban, contemporary Singaporean society.<ref name="tribute1">{{cite web|title=Amanda Heng|url=http://www.tribute.sg/artistprofile.php?displayname=Amanda+Heng|publisher=Trubute.sg|accessdate=9 May 2014}}</ref>

==Background==
Heng graduated from [[LASALLE College of the Arts]] with a Diploma in [[printmaking]]. In Singapore she helped to establish [[The Artists Village]], the first [[artist-run space]] in Singapore. 
In 1988, she then went on to pursue her further studies in art at [[London]], at the [[Central St Martins]] School of Art and Design, which is now under the [[University of the Arts London]] which she attained her Bachelor of Arts. Amanda has lectured in Nanyang Technology University and the National Institute of Education. She also supervises MA students in LaSalle College of the Arts. She sat on the selection and curatorial committee for the President's Young Talents Exhibition 2009 in Singapore. In 2010, she was presented with the [[Cultural Medallion]] and had her first solo retrospective show at the [[Singapore Art Museum]] (SAM) in 2011, titled "Amanda Heng: Speak To Me, Walk With Me".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artitute.com/2011/10/19/amanda-heng-speak-to-me-walk-with-me/ |title=Amanda Heng: Speak To Me, Walk With Me |publisher=Artitute |date=1 January 2012 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> In 2014 Heng appeared in the TV series A Journey Through Asian Art.<ref name="A Journey Through Asian Art">{{cite web|title=A Journey Through Asian Art|url=http://ajourneythroughasianart.com/|accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>

==Feminist work==
Heng introduced [[feminism|feminist]] discourse to the local art scene with provocative performance works that discussed [[gender inequality]] and social identity. This was despite performance art gaining notoriety in 1994, following a performance by Josef Ng, in which he snipped his [[pubic hair]] at the Parkway Parade Shopping Centre. Following the outcry, the National Arts Council of Singapore suspended all funding for performance art. When Amanda moved into the NAC's newly converted studios in 1997, she was asked to sign an agreement that she would not use the studio for performance.

Despite the circumstances, Amanda formed the collective, Women in the Arts (WITA) in 1999, whose main aim was to advance the feminist art movement, using her studio as a venue for performances and other media. WITA was the first artists-run women's collective in Singapore, and organised forums such as Women And Their Arts, The 1st Asian Film Appreciation workshop, Women About Women, Memories of Sense, TheFridayEvent, Exchange 05 and Open Ends. WITA currently holds an archive of women in the Arts in Singapore.<ref name="artasiapacific1">{{cite web|last=Rawlings |first=Ashley |url=http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/70/AmandaHeng |title=Amanda Heng |publisher=ArtAsiaPacific |date= |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://womeninphotographsymposium.com/speaker-10.html |title=Women in Photography Symposium 2014 – Singapore |publisher=Womeninphotographsymposium.com |date=28 March 2014 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

Heng's work sought to instigate conversations regarding the artistic practices of women, at a time where a feminist field or framework did not exist in Singapore.<ref>Amanda Heng: Speak to Me, Walk with Me, published by Singapore Art Museum, 2011 {{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}</ref>

Her other art activities include co-directing theatre production "Bernard's Story", and performed in the theatre production "A Woman On the Tree in the Hill" directed by Ivan Heng of The Wild Rice Theatre Company.

==Notable artworks==

* ''She and Her Dishcover'' (1991) - an [[Installation art|installation]] with a table, table cover, mirror and dish cover. Heng examines the words "dishcover" and "discover", while focusing on the preconceived role of women in the domestic sphere.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* ''Missing'' (1994) - installation in response to [[female infanticide]] in cultures where male offspring was valued above females. The installation consisted of a number baby girls' dresses, hung with fishing lines, hooks, black cloths, together with a black sofa, table, doorframe. This work enacted a commemoration of nameless female babies who are victims of this practice, and also attempted to examine the gender issues within the Asian context "where baby girls are frowned upon, and wives are pressured to produce a male heir for the family." The installation invited the audience to take with them notes containing the artist's thoughts, which were attached to the red strings.<ref name="artasiapacific1"/>
* ''S/HE'' (1994) - performance work which focused on questioning the role of being a woman within the cultural and political context of Singapore. Heng explored how power was embedded within influences that continuously encroached upon personal identity. This performance consisted of the artist making symbolic marks on her face, speaking the questions and Confucius sayings in front of a mirror to perform the deconstruction of language to its simplest phonemes and strokes, breaking down meaning to find new ways of expression. The artist also frequently used domestic objects such as baking dough, washing detergent, toy alphabets, and the audience was seated and stood around the performance space. S/He was performed again in 1995 and 1996, with developments in the performance, with the artist appropriating language, text, symbols, images, memories, Chinese classical music and Western choral singing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://franklinfurnace.org/research/related/caa/amanda_heng/heng.html |title=Amanda Heng |publisher=Franklinfurnace.org |date= |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>
* ''Tiger Balls, Myths and Chinese Man'' (1991) - installation consisting of basketballs painting with tiger stripes and laid out on a traditional Chinese wedding blanket. The artist, during a media tour of her work, stated that it was made in response to a sexist comment made about women, following fellow contemporary artist [[Tang Da Wu]]'s installation, "Tiger's Whip" in 1991. Tang's installation depicted the practice of Chinese men eating tiger penises as an aphrodisiac, which evoked the comment that this problem was due to women's expectations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sim |first=Fann |url=https://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/blogs/going-out-by-day/exploring-hard-issues-artist-amanda-heng-152911744.html |title=Exploring hard issues with artist Amanda Heng &#124; Going Out – By Day – Yahoo Entertainment Singapore |publisher=Sg.entertainment.yahoo.com |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

* ''Narrating Bodies'' (1999–2000) - an installation and performance using old and new photos and reconstructed photos, where the artist enlarged old photos by using laser print and rephotographrf them with the present body. During this process, the artist sought to search for evidence of contact between her mother and herself in the acts of remembering or reconnecting or reconstructing their relations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Universes in Universe – Pat Binder, Gerhard Haupt |url=http://universes-in-universe.de/car/habana/bien7/fototeca/e-heng-2.htm |title=Amanda Heng: Statement, Fototeca – 7th Havana Biennial |publisher=Universes-in-universe.de |date= |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>
