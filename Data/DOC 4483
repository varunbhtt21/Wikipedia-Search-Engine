Having found the truth, Bizon realized that Hina and Aoba are responsible for ruining his life and decides to kill them both, but he's stopped by  the combined attack of Dio, Hina and Aoba. Meanwhile, a counter coup d'etat occur at Zogilia, and Alfred Gallant is put in charge of the orbital battle, declaring a ceasefire and the arrest of Evgeni Kendar, alas Bizon, Bizon however instead of surrendering, decide (before his valiancer explode finally killing him) to active a killer-program in the satellite, causing it to begin the sequence of firing on three high-deposit of Nectoribium (the element of the nectar weapons and technology) in order to make them explode and causing a nuclear winter on Earth. Dio and Aoba are able for the last time to connect and reach the satellite destroying it (also killing Dr. Hahn in the process), after having literary save the world, another singularity is formed on the battlefield, and Aoba and Hina decide to reach it to return to their timeline, Aoba after having say his goodbye to Dio.
