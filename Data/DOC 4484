'''Angellore''' is a [[doom metal]]/[[gothic metal]] band from [[France]]. The name of the band comes from the title of the [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]] song ''Angellore''.<ref>Interview with Power Metal: ''[http://www.powerofmetal.dk/line_em_up14/angellore_lineemup.html powerofmetal.dk]''</ref>

==Biography==
Rosarius and Walran first met through the internet in March 2007. In July 2007, during the [[Festival d'Avignon]], they formed Angellore. Their first demo, ''Ambrosia'', was written and recorded August 2007. Rosarius played the guitars and some of the keyboards and vocals, while Walran played the other half and imposed himself as a producer. The band, however, became discontent with the quality of the final product. Despite this, the songs were put on MySpace. Through grabbing the attention of the Portuguese musician Marcos Marado, the band were part of a split CD with music project Merankorii, released in February 2009.

In the meantime, Angellore composed two more EPs, ''Les Promesses de l’Aube'' and ''Elégies aux Ames Perdues''. In Fall 2009, drummer Ronnie, an old friend of Walran, joined the band, and later, in December 2009, the band entered the Studio AV to start recording their debut album. ''[[Errances]]'' was released in 2012 as a digital version and in 2013 as audio CD,<ref>Aural Music catalogue: ''[http://www.auralmusic.com/stuff/auralmusic_catalogue.pdf Aural Music] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424200944/http://www.auralmusic.com/stuff/auralmusic_catalogue.pdf |date=April 24, 2014 }}''</ref> earning good reviews.<ref>Review on metal-archives.com: ''[http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Angellore/Errances/341052/ metal-archives.com]''</ref><ref>Review on doom-metal.com: ''[http://doom-metal.com/reviews.php?album=2384 doom-metal.com]''</ref>

==Music==
Angellore plays slow but melodic [[death/doom]], combined with elements of the [[gothic metal]]. Besides the usual instruments, they also use an [[acoustic guitar]] and a [[violin]] (played by [[session musician]] Catherine Arquez). The band makes use of three different vocal styles: clean-singing, baritone and [[death growl]]s.

They are influenced by [[Draconian (band)|Draconian]], [[Saturnus (band)|Saturnus]], [[Estatic Fear]], [[Empyrium]] and [[Shape of Despair]].<ref>Official website: ''[https://www.facebook.com/AngelloreDoom/info facebook.com/AngelloreDoom/info]''</ref>
