When the property was subdivided, Faubourg Livaudias was the name given to this neighborhood, founded in 1832. In the 1800s, many of the neighborhoods in the Jefferson Parish area were given the first name [[Faubourg]]. Faubourgs were sometimes named after the plantations owner’s last name.<ref>{{cite web|last=Soniat|first=Melony|title=The Faubourgs|url=http://www.neworleanspubliclibrary.org/~nopl/links/nolinks/faubourgs.pdf|publisher=The Louisiana Historical Society|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref>
