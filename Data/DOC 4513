'''Parliamentary elections''' took place in the [[Republic of Crimea]] on 14 September 2014.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/729621| title =Russian State Duma appoints parliamentary elections in Crimea on September 14, 2014| work =[[ITAR TASS]]|date=25 April 2014| accessdate = 25 April 2014}}</ref> These were the first elections since [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Crimea's annexation into the Russian Federation]] earlier that year. The outcome was an overwhelming victory for President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s [[United Russia]] party.

==Background==
After the [[2014 Crimean crisis]], following the passage of a [[2014 Crimean referendum|secession referendum]], which international community widely saw as illegal (See:[[International reactions to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]]),  the [[Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Crimea|declaration of independence]] of the [[Republic of Crimea]] from Ukraine and the [[Accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation|process of accession]] to [[Russia]] that followed it, on 11 April the [[State Council of Crimea]] approved a joint appeal from Crimea and Sevastopol's Legislative Assembly to [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]], asking him to bring forward parliamentary elections from 2015 to September 2014 "to accelerate the integration of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol into the system of government of the Russian Federation".<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.rg.ru/2014/04/25/vibori-site.html| title =Выборы в Крыму и Севастополе пройдут уже в 2014 году| work =[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]|date=25 April 2014| accessdate = 25 April 2014}}</ref>

On 17 April Putin submitted a draft law on parliamentary elections in Crimea and Sevastopol to the [[State Duma]], setting 14 September 2014 as the election date. On this day also election were held in 30 Russian regions and 14 regional (Russian) legislatures.<ref name=Cpe14NYT>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/world/europe/election-victories-strengthen-putins-grip-around-russia-and-crimea.html?_r=0 Election Victories Strengthen Putin’s Grip Around Russia and Crimea], [[nytimes.com]] (SEPT. 14, 2014)</ref>

==Electoral system==
According to Crimean State Council Chairman [[Vladimir Konstantinov (politician)|Vladimir Konstantinov]], the elections will be conducted according to a mixed system. Fifty deputies will be elected on [[Party-list proportional representation]] and 25 in [[First-past-the-post voting|majority constituencies]].

Russian [[Central Election Commission of Russia|Central Election Commission]] Chairman [[Vladimir Churov]] said that the commission  filed a request for funding with the government for 400 million roubles to conduct the election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/728509|title=Putin submits law on parliamentary elections in Crimea, Sevastopol to State Duma|date=17 April 2014|work=ITAR-TASS|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>

On 9 September 2014 [[Head of the Republic of Crimea]] [[Sergey Aksyonov]] announced that Crimean residents "who did not manage to obtain a [[Russian passport|passport of the Russian Federation]]" would be able to participate in the elections using their "Ukrainian local registration".<ref>{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/09/9/7037164 Crimeans in the "elections" allowed to vote with Ukrainian passport], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (9 September 2014)</ref>

==Issues==
The local [[Crimean Tatars]] had called for a boycott of the elections.<ref name=Cpe14NYT/>

Opposition figures in Crimea complained that they were deprived of a chance to win seats because of "[[Administrative resource]]-tactics" that made sure unapproved challengers would have no chance of gaining traction.<ref name=Cpe14NYT/>

==Results==
Only two parties overcame the election threshold: [[United Russia]] won 70 mandates of the Crimean Republic’s State Council 75 seats because its candidates won in all 25 single-member constituencies and it won 71.06% of the party-list vote; the other 5 mandates went to the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] who won 8.14% of the party-list vote.<ref name=Cpe14NYT/><ref name="en.ria.ru">[http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140916/192977607/Russias-Central-Election-Commission-Recognizes-Crimeas.html Russia's Central Election Commission Recognizes Crimea's Parliament Vote as Valid]</ref><ref name="en.itar-tass.com">[http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/749559 United Russia wins 70 out of 75 seats in Crimean parliament — preliminary count]</ref> The voter turnout was 53.61%.<ref name="en.ria.ru">[http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140916/192977607/Russias-Central-Election-Commission-Recognizes-Crimeas.html Russia's Central Election Commission Recognizes Crimea's Parliament Vote as Valid]</ref>
