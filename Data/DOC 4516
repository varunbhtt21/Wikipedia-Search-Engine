'''Roddy Hart & The Lonesome Fire''' are a 7-piece band from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].

==Origins==
The band were formed by Scottish songwriter [[Roddy Hart]] and released their debut eponymous album in September 2013 on Middle of Nowhere Recordings. The album was produced by [[Patti Smith]] and [[Morrissey]] producer Danton Supple.<ref>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity-interviews/singer-roddy-hart-on-his-famous-pals-1558460</ref> It was described by [[Uncut Magazine]] as "Widescreen…poetic…and [with] verve, evoking the epic rock of Springsteen". In April 2014 it was announced that the album ''Roddy Hart & The Lonesome Fire'' was on the longlist for the Scottish Album of the Year Award.<ref>http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music/revealed-the-20-records-on-the-longlist-for-scottish-album-of-2014-of-the-year.24034383</ref> The band were one of the very first Scottish acts to play the newly built 13,000 arena [[The SSE Hydro|The Hydro]], on a bill with [[Glasvegas]] and [[The Proclaimers]]. They also made a cameo appearance in the Scottish film [[Sunshine on Leith (film)|Sunshine on Leith]], on which Roddy Hart worked as Associate Musical Director.

Their second album, co-produced by [[Paul Savage (musician)|Paul Savage]] ([[Mogwai]], [[Emma Pollock]], [[Admiral Fallow]]) is due for release in 2016.

==The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson==
After US TV Host [[Craig Ferguson]] retweeted the video for their single ''Bright Light Fever'' the band were invited to make their American TV debut on [[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]].<ref>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/scots-comic-craig-ferguson-set-3137014</ref> They performed the song on 17 February 2014 on the show, which featured [[Gary Oldman]]. The performance proved to be so popular that Ferguson asked the band to return the following week to take up a rare week-long residency. From the 24–28 February the band performed a song from the album each night - ''Queenstown'', ''Cold City Avalanche'', ''High Hopes'', ''Forget Me Not'' and ''Bad Blood'' - on shows that featured guests including [[Zooey Deschanel]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Vera Farmiga]] and [[Alice Eve]].<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/craig-fergusons-late-late-show-681622</ref>

==Celtic Connections==
As part of Glasgow's [[Celtic Connections]] in January 2011, Hart curated Forever Young: A 70th Birthday Tribute To Bob Dylan.<ref>http://www.scotsman.com/news/gig-review-forever-young-a-70th-birthday-tribute-to-bob-dylan-1-1498326</ref>  The concert featured [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Josh Rouse]], [[Thea Gilmore]], [[Gemma Hayes]], [[James Grant (musician)|James Grant]], [[Tim O'Brien (musician)|Tim O'Brien]], [[Kris Drever]], [[Rab Noakes]], [[Laura Cantrell]], [[Eddi Reader]] and [[Tommy Reilly (Scottish musician)|Tommy Reilly]], with The Lonesome Fire performing and acting as house band for the evening. Highlights of the concert were broadcast on BBC Radio 2,<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/celticconnections/2011/concerts/bob_dylan_tribute/</ref> and the gig was filmed by Sky Arts and broadcast in April 2011.<ref>http://video.sky.com/skyarts/related/remap/video-celtic-connections-forever-young-dylan-70th-birthday-concert/</ref>

Following the success of Forever Young: A 70th Birthday Tribute To Bob Dylan, Roddy Hart & The Lonesome Fire acted as the house band for Celtic Connections' tribute to the late [[Gerry Rafferty]] in January 2012. The concert featured acts such as [[Jack Bruce]], [[Paul Brady]], [[Ron Sexsmith]], [[The Proclaimers]] and more. Hart performed a solo version of Rafferty's "Her Father Didn't Like Me Anyway".<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00nsfx0</ref> The concert was broadcast by BBC Radio 2, and edited highlights were shown on BBC 2 Scotland and BBC 4.

Hart now curates the ''Roaming Roots Revue'' each year at the [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]] for [[Celtic Connections]], which focuses on new and unusual collaborations between a transatlantic-spanning array of young musicians performing their own material and that of something from a themed songbook.  The shows have featured artists such as [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Frazey Ford]], [[Matthew E. White]], [[Justin Currie]], [[The Pierces]], [[Howe Gelb]], [[Beth Orton]], [[The Low Anthem]], LAU, [[Gemma Hayes]], [[Dawes (band)|Dawes]], [[Lindi Ortega]], [[Rachel Sermanni]], [[Roddy Woomble]], [[Grant Lee Phillips]], [[Dawn Landes]] and many more.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/vicente-amigo-and-others-celtic-connections-glasgow-8460666.html |title=Vicente Amigo and others, Celtic Connections, Glasgow – Reviews – Music |publisher=The Independent |date=21 January 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=e |url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/celtic-connections-review-roaming-roots-revue-glasgow-1-3274545 |title=Celtic Connections review: Roaming Roots Revue, Glasgow |publisher=The Scotsman |date=20 January 2014 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref>
