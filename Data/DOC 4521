This article is about a web tool that fails [[WP:N]] and [[WP:WEB]] as it hasn't received significant coverage in multiple, [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. The little existing coverage is routine web coverage, mostly by non-reliable sources. The best source available is [http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/06/bascamp-faces-competition-in-free-alternative/ this], which says something regarding the product's encyclopedic notability. Borderline A7 speedy, as there is little to no assertion of significance. As this was deleted four times before, I want to see if there is consensus here for salting.

'''KEEP''' - This article is about a software that has been mentioned in various reliable web sources:

http://projectmanager.com.au/education/tools/project-management-software-review-activecollab/

It has been mentioned in papers published on universities:

http://books.google.rs/books?id=W4JaHY-jYHoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=activecollab&f=false

More than 10000 companies and institutions use it, including numerous universities:

http://collab.uncc.edu/public/index.php/login?re_route=homepage
http://its.uiowa.edu/campus-software-program/activecollab-corporate-238

It has many more references than many other PM software tools that are featured on Wikipedia:

With all this in mind I strongly object the deletion of this article.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wiwriter|Wiwriter]] ([[User talk:Wiwriter|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wiwriter|contribs]]) 13:56, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Again, that coverage looks pretty routine, with quite a bit coming from press releases. I also don't believe any of those meet our criteria for [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

Sources are mostly [[Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources|secondary]], which is in accordance with the rules,  don't come from press releases, they are published on reputable and relevant sites such as http://techcrunch.com/ or /thenextweb.com. Sources include .edu and . government sites. Here is an example of the later - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2605024/. Here is another reputable source - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551012 by a researcher from [http://www.i3a.uclm.es/joomla2/index.php?option=com_groupsi3a&view=person&layout=projects&id=103006&groupId=0&lang=en University of Castilla La Mancha, Spain]. Further sources include other software companies that integrated their tools with activeCollab such as https://zapier.com/zapbook/activecollab/. It seems to be more than enough and much more that dozens of project management tools already included on Wikipedia.

::Sorry, but I'm still not seeing any ''significant discussion'' in those sources. Just a couple of sentences in passing won't cut it.

With non enterprise software, that is not funded in Silicon Valley you cannot expect massive coverage. This is quite enough for establishing validity of the topic and every sentence in the text has a reliable source. Here is another one I found - http://en.startit.rs/activecollab-3-project-management-saas/[[User:Wiwriter|Wiwriter]] ([[User talk:Wiwriter|talk]]) 17:44, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Weak delete''' - Several marginal sources, but mostly presence in lists and other minor coverage.
