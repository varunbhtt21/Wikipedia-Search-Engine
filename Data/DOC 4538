'''"South American Way"''' is a 1939 song with music by [[Jimmy McHugh]] and lyrics by [[Al Dubin]]. This tune is commonly associated with both the [[Andrews Sisters]] and [[Carmen Miranda]], who introduced the song in the 1939 stage musical ''Streets Of Paris'' (which starred [[Abbott & Costello]]). Carmen performed it on-screen a year later in her breakout role for U.S. audiences in the film ''[[Down Argentine Way]]'' (1940), causing it to become very popular in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://carmen.miranda.nom.br/grva_271.html "SOUTH AMERICAN WAY" - Carmen Miranda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200606/http://carmen.miranda.nom.br/grva_271.html |date=2014-02-26 }}</ref><ref>DUSSEK, Eduardo, '''Carmen Miranda: Melodias Cifradas para Guitarra, Violão e Teclados''', [[São Paulo]]:Publishing Irmãos Vitale, {{ISBN|85-740-711-02}}'''</ref>
