{{Nihongo||龍が如く 維新!|'''Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!'''|lit. "Like a Dragon Restoration!"|lead=yes}}, unofficially known as '''''Yakuza Ishin''''', is a spin-off game in the [[Yakuza (series)|''Yakuza'' series]]. The game was developed and published by [[Sega]] for [[PlayStation 3]] and was a [[launch title]] for [[PlayStation 4]].

Set in the chaotic [[Bakumatsu period]] (between 1853 and 1867), [[Sakamoto Ryōma]] is distressed resulting from conflicting pressures and uncertainty about one's self and role in the society. Being embroiled in the middle of a Tosa coup d'état and bent on finding the murderer who assassinated his mentor, Ryoma burrows himself with a hidden identity in the streets of Kyoto and joins the grim [[Shinsengumi]].

Despite being the second ''Yakuza'' series spin-off set in samurai era instead of modern-day Japan, this game is unrelated to ''[[Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!]]'', which was released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3. ''Kenzan!'' is set two centuries before ''Ishin!'', hence the plots are not related with each other since both games focus on different characters, the historical figures of [[Miyamoto Musashi]] (1584-1645) and [[Sakamoto Ryōma]] (1836-1867) respectively.
