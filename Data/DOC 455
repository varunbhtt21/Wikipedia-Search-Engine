The '''Monción Dam''' is an earth-fill [[embankment dam]] on the [[Mao River]] near [[Monción]] in [[Santiago Rodríguez Province]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]. At {{Convert|119|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, it is the highest dam in the country. The purpose of the dam is to produce [[hydroelectric]] power and supply water for irrigation. The dam's power station is located downstream and contains two 26 MW [[Francis turbine]]-generators for an installed capacity of 52 MW. The dam was completed and began filling its reservoir on 22 September 2001. Its power station was commissioned on 27 April 2002.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arqhys.com/construccion/moncion-presa.html | title=Presa Moncion | publisher=Arqhys Architecture | accessdate=23 April 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ansaldoksa.com/Data/Jeddah22072006/Reference%20List%2020067.pdf | title=Reference List | publisher=Ansaldoksa | accessdate=23 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424032959/http://ansaldoksa.com/Data/Jeddah22072006/Reference%20List%2020067.pdf | archivedate=24 April 2014 | df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hidroelectrica.gob.do/Central.aspx?IDCentral=4 | publisher=Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company | accessdate=23 April 2014 | title=Data Plant: Monción | language=Spanish}}</ref>
