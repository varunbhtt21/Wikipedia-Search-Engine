The beauty, Shui Bingxin, and the scholar, Tie Zhongyu, want to avenge their fathers and go against the bureaucracy, which is corrupt. Shui Bingxin's uncle wants her to marry a son of an official with a lot of power, but Shui Bingxin does not want to marry that man, who is dissolute. Tie Zhongyu rescues Shui Bingxin and the two begin to live in the same house. The uncle spreads rumors that suggest Shui Bingxin is not a virgin.<ref name=Epsteinp273/> Tie Zhongyu focuses on his studies after Shui Bingxin persuades him to.<ref name=Epsteinp289>Epstein, Maram.

==Characters==
* '''Shui Bingxin''' (C: 水冰心 P: ''Shuǐ Bīngxīn'', W: ''Shui Ping-hsin'') - Shui Bingxin is the beauty character. Epstein states that Shui Bingxin is "unrelentingly stern in her commitment to Confucian morality".<ref name=Epsteinp273/> In the 1761 version her name is written as '''Shuey-ping-sin''' (or "Shuey-ping-'''ſ'''in with a [[long s]]). In the ''Fortunate Union'' version her name is written as '''Shueypingsin'''.
* '''Tie Zhongyu''' (T: 鐵中玉, S: 铁中玉, P: ''Tiě Zhōngyù'', W: ''T'ieh Chung-yü'') - Tie Zhongyu is the scholar character. Epstein states that Tie Zhongyu is "unusually strong and daring compared with other characters of his type".<ref name=Epsteinp273/> "Tie" means iron.<ref>''Fortunate Union'', p. 2 (DJVU p. 35).</ref> In the 1761 version his name is written as '''Tieh-chung-u'''. In the ''Fortunate Union'' version his name is '''Teihchungyu'''.

==Style and approach==
''Haoqiu zhuan'' was written to easily allow the reader to follow the story by strengthening the internal consistency of the narrative, often by full and frequent recapitulations to third parties within the story. Starr stated that as a consequence, the novel "painfully" over-repeats itself. Chloë F. Starr writes that the novel has very little description of interior thought, a common feature in 17th Century Chinese novels. The novel often uses an eyewitness delivering a [[soliloquy]] as a way to recall events not seen by the principal characters. For instance a monk tells another character that there was a plot to poison the hero and that he himself had a part in this role; Starr states "the question of the addressee is left unresolved in this clumsy technique."<ref name=Starrp47>Starr, Chloë F. ''Red-Light Novels of the Late Qing'' (Volume 14 of China Studies). Brill, 2007. {{ISBN|9004156291}}. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sqXEbkKI0JcC&pg=PA47 47].</ref>

Keith McMahon comments that the lovers in ''Haoqui zhuan'' "are like stereotyped opposites of the characters in earlier works." The love of the scholar and the beauty "sharply contrasts" with depictions in late Ming fiction, where love is erotic rather than spiritual. Now "sentiment replaces libido" and "refined, internal feelings replace vulgar, external sensations." The very name of the beauty, Bing Xin (Ice-Heart), conveys her chastity and emotional control, though she is at the same time loyal and loving. Tie Zhongyu (Jade-within-iron) is in a sense a feminized hero, rather than the passionate and indulgent lover of the late Ming ideal.  Although there is only an implicit criticism  of ''qing ''(emotion) which was so prominent in late Ming fiction,  the lovers here maintain a balance between ''li ''(propriety) and feeling ''qing''. They marry only when her father grants permission, even though he urges her to decide for herself, and even after they are wed they do not consummate their marriage until the empress herself refutes the villains and confirms that Bingxin is a virgin.{{sfnb|McMahon|1988|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=RjaWNwaBa20C&dq=caizi+jiaren&q=stereotyping+the+attitude+of+the+early+Qing+fictionist#v=snippet&q=stereotyping%20the%20attitude%20of%20the%20early%20Qing%20fictionist&f=false 131-132]}}

==Translations==

===English===
The first European translations occurred in the 18th Century.<ref name=StAndrep39>St. André, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=o5oPBC2AfgAC&pg=PA39 39].</ref> With the exception of short works, this was the first Chinese novel translated into a Western language.<ref name=Rainierp109>Rainier Lanselle, dans [[André Lévy (sinologist)|André Lévy]] (editor), ''Dictionnaire de littérature chinoise'', [[Presses universitaires de France]], « [[Quadrige]] », 1994, rééd. 2000, p. 109. "L'ouvrage a connu une certaine fortune tant en Chine qu'à l'étranger : adapté par Takizawa Bakin sous le titre de ''Kyōkakuden (Les Chevaleresques)'', il fut premier roman chinois traduit dans une langue occidentale (en excluant le genre court)."</ref>

The first English edition was translated by a British merchant, James Wilkinson, resident in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton). Wilkinson translated about 75% into English and another person translated the remainder into Portuguese. James St. André, author of "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''", wrote that "[i]t is suspected that" the translation was written while Wilkinson did the translation as part of his learning Chinese.<ref name=StAndrep42>St. André, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=o5oPBC2AfgAC&pg=PA42 42].</ref> St. André stated that the person who completed the translation "is suspected" to be a Portuguese man living in [[Macau]], Wilkinson's tutor. In 1761 [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], the [[Bishop of Dromore]], had published this version anonymously; before Percy published it, the Portuguese portion was translated into English and the entire version had been edited. Percy published the second edition in 1774, and in it he revealed Wilkinson's identity and his own identity.<ref name=StAndrep42/> This was the first ever translation of a Chinese novel in a European language.<ref>Watt, James.
