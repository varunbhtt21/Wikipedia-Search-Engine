==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Zatoichi and the Doomed Man'' currently has three positive reviews, and no negative reviews at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|zatoichi_and_the_doomed_man|Zatoichi and the Doomed Man}}</ref>

Brian McKay, writing for [[eFilmCritic.com]], gave ''Zatoichi and the Doomed Man'' three out of five stars and said that "[w]ith the exception of one very funny Zatoichi impersonator, and one or two excellent action sequences, ''Zatoichi and the Doomed Man'' is a surprisingly lackluster installment, due to underdeveloped characters and a truncated ending that feels as if someone edited out the film's third act using a dull [[katana]]. [...] While I'll still take a mediocre ZATOICHI movie from thirty years ago over a crappy [[Hollywood film]] of the present day, this one leaves the viewer with a sense of unfinished business on the narrative side, and rushed work on the production side. Worth seeing for the bright points mentioned above, but overall a forgettable entry to the series."<ref name=eFilmCritic>{{cite web|last=McKay|first=Brian|title=''Zatoichi sakate giri''|url=http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=9275&reviewer=258|publisher=[[eFilmCritic.com]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=22 April 2004}}</ref>
