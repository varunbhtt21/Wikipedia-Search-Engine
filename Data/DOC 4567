The result was  '''SPEEDY DELETE'''. Just to note that I had already deleted the article before Arxiloxos posted their comment.

Not sure if this really deserves a page-he was accepted into these sports but never played the games. also a odd add on the top not sure why a sound cloud is there [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 16:46, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::Just noticed that oddly the name is different even in the article.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:50, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  Borderline [[WP:CSD#A7]] candidate.  Nothing here that would support a finding of notability even if verifiable, and as best I can determine, it isn't verifiable either.  --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 18:55, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Speedy delete''' as having no credible assertion of notability: notice that the user who created this (autobiog?) has had a page with the same content rejected several times as AfC: see [[User talk:Denfield21]] and [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Denfield baptiste]].

::I think a speedy be good also, or just close this AFD now even be great. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 19:02, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:::I'm OK with speedy here, but keeping in mind that CSD#A7 requires that there be no credible assertion of "importance or significance", not "notability", and the claim that he was in the NBA D-League ''might'' get over that lower barrier--but then there's only a vague assertion that he was on a "skills team", not an actual D-League roster, so even though ''playing'' in the D-League probably can get you past the A7 line, the assertions here don't make it. A [[WP:SNOW]] delete close of the AfD would be OK too, but I've read somewhere in the past that unless there's an urgency,  one should wait at least 24 hours before snow-deleting an article, just to make sure all time zones have a chance to chime in. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 19:36, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
