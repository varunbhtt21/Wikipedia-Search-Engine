Title : Cassils (artist)
Text : '''Cassils''' is a [[performance art]]ist, [[Bodybuilding|body builder]] and [[personal trainer]] from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada now based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States. Their work uses the body in a sculptural fashion, integrating [[feminism]], body art, and gay male aesthetics. Cassils is the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], a [[Creative Capital|Creative Capital Grant]], a [[United States Artists]] Fellowship, a [[California Community Foundation]] Visual Artist Fellowship (2012), several [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]] grants, and the [[Rema Hort Mann Foundation]] Visual Arts Fellowship.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/cassils/|title=John Simon Guggenheim Foundation {{!}}   Cassils|website=www.gf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/cassils/|title=United States Artists  » Cassils|website=www.unitedstatesartists.org|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cassils.net/cv-2/|title=CV « Cassils|website=cassils.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-06}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> Cassils is [[gender non-conforming]] and [[transmasculine]], and goes by [[singular they|singular ''they'']] pronouns.<ref name="cassils-about">{{cite web|title=About|url=http://cassils.net/about-2/|website=Cassils|accessdate=October 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109212841/http://cassils.net/about-2/|archive-date=November 9, 2017|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

==Education==
In 1997 Cassils received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] from [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] (NSCAD) in Halifax, Canada. The unconventional NSCAD curriculum, where figure drawing classes where nude models jumped on a trampoline, and the faculty [[Jan Peacock]] and [[Garry Kennedy|Garry Neil Kennedy]] influenced their early political and feminist work in video and performance.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Upon graduating from NSCAD in 1997, Cassils moved to New York City in 1997, interning at the [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]] assisting [[Martha Wilson]] with the digitization of the archive. In this context they created early exhibitions and performances at the Holland Tunnel Gallery (1998), the Limelight, and PS122. Cassils left in 2000 to attend [[California Institute of the Arts]] on a merit scholarship; they received an MFA in 2002. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Collaborative practice with the Toxic Titties==
At CalArts, Cassils, Clover Leary, and Julia Steinmetz co-founded the [[Toxic Titties]], a performance collective that was active for nearly a decade.<ref name="nscad">{{cite web | url=http://nscad.ca/en/home/abouttheuniversity/news/fallclassnotes.aspx | title=Class Notes | publisher=Nova Scotia College of Art and Design | accessdate=7 September 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918011759/http://nscad.ca/en/home/abouttheuniversity/news/fallclassnotes.aspx | archive-date=18 September 2016 | dead-url=yes }}</ref> Together they created a process oriented, and event-based practice, focused on conceptual performance. Their multidisciplinary practice generated a large body of work engaged with the problematics of identity politics.

Toxic Titties performed and exhibited nationally, at various locations such as: the Advocate Gallery (2000), Track 16 Gallery (2002), at the California Institute of the Arts (2001–02), Michael Dawson Gallery (2002), LA FreeWaves Festival (2002),<ref>{{cite web|title = Artists|url = http://freewaves.org/past-festivals/2002/artists/toxictitties.htm|website = freewaves.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Intersectional Feminisms conference at UC Riverside in Los Angeles (2002), [[REDCAT|REDCAT at the Walt Disney Concert Hall]] (2003), Center on Contemporary Art, Seattle<ref>{{cite web|title = neoqueer at CoCA|url = http://cocaseattle.org/Shows/neoqueer/neoqueer_seattletime_potterf.htm|website = cocaseattle.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112740/http://cocaseattle.org/Shows/neoqueer/neoqueer_seattletime_potterf.htm|archive-date = 2016-03-04|dead-url = yes}}</ref> (2005), USC Center for Feminist Research, Los Angeles (2006), Art in General (2006), Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions,<ref>{{cite web|title = Draw a Line and Follow It|url = http://welcometolace.org/lace/draw-a-line-and-follow-it/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Los Angeles (2008) and Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA)<ref>{{cite web|title = Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA) Exhibition {{!}} Art Knowledge News|url = http://artknowledgenews.com/200801144480/Yerba_Buena_Centerfor_the_Arts_YBCA.html|website = artknowledgenews.com|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> San Francisco, CA (2009).

Internationally Toxic Titties exhibited at Manifesta in Frankfurt, Germany (2000), Schnitt Ausstellungsraum in Cologne, Germany (2000), Outside Field: International Festival, Ex-Teresa Arte Actual, Mexico City (2003) and MUCA Roma, Mexico City (2003). In collaboration with artist [[Dorit Margrieter]], they created the 16mm film ''10104 Angelo View Drive'', a work set in John Lautner's modernist [[Sheats–Goldstein Residence|Sheats-Goldstein Residence]] in Beverly Hills exploring the relationship between architecture and desire. This project was featured in solo exhibitions at [[Art Basel Miami Beach]] and at [[Mumok|MUMOK]], the Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, Vienna, Austria (2006) as well as at Trinity Square Video in Toronto, Canada (2008).

The Toxic Titties' work received critical attention from significant scholars such as [[Amelia Jones]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = Live Art In LA: Performance in Southern California|last = Jones|first = Amelia|publisher = Routlage|year = 2012|isbn = 9780415684231|location = |page = 184}}</ref> [[Jennifer Doyle]],<ref>{{cite book|title = Sex Objects|url = http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/sex-objects|website = University of Minnesota Press|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> [[Christine Ross]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Aesthetics of Disengagement (Contemporary Art and Depression)|last = Ross|first = Christine|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 2005|isbn = 9780816645398|location = |pages = }}</ref> and [[José Esteban Muñoz]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Many of these scholars first encountered the work of the Toxic Titties when Cassils and Leary were hired to perform in [[Vanessa Beecroft]]'s VB46 at the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in Beverly Hills. Having infiltrated the behind the scenes process of Beecroft's practice, they launched a parasitical performance, ''Beecroft Intervention'' (2001). Undermining power structures of identity, class, feminism and art commerce, Toxic Titties hijacked Beecroft's piece by engaging the female performers, who had been homogenized and objectified, in critical dialogue. Their influence unionized the group and forced an increase in the cost of their labor. They documented this performance through the essay ''Behind Enemy Lines: Toxic Titties Infiltrate Vanessa Beecroft'' published in [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women and Culture in Society]] (2006), and reprinted in [[Art Metropole]]'s ''Commerce By Artists''<ref>{{cite web|title = Art Metropole / Commerce By Artists|url = http://artmetropole.com/shop/4823|website = Art Metropole|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> (2011).

==Emerging solo career==
In 2007, Cassils was awarded a merit scholarship to participate in a residency program at the [[Banff Centre|Banff Centre for the Arts]] and a Creation Grant from the Canada Council of the Arts Intra Arts department, which allowed them to create an experimental documentary and performance titled ''Simulation In Training''. This piece investigated the theater of war present in the American mass media, and demonstrated the overlap between the [[military–industrial complex]] and the Hollywood film industry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2009, Cassils won the [[Franklin Furnace Archive|Franklin Furnace]] Performance Art Fund<ref>{{cite web|title = FF Fund|url = http://franklinfurnace.org/artists/funded_projects/the_franklin_furnace_fund/index.php|website = franklinfurnace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> for the performance ''Hard Times'', their first piece integrating these aesthetic, physical and political concerns. The resulting film was subsequently screened at the Asian Experimental Video Festival in Hong Kong, China, Festival Ciné à Dos in Koulikoro, Mali, at Art Cinema Zawya in Cairo, Egypt. and Cultureel tetras de Kaaij, Nijmegen in the Netherlands.

Next Cassils created the performance ''Tiresias'', a five-hour durational performance for an exhibition at [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] called ''Gutted''<ref>{{cite web|title = Upcoming Events GUTTED: LACE's Annual Winter Benefit|url = http://welcometolace.org/event/gutted-laces-annual-winter-benefit/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> (2010). During the live performance they used their body heat to melt a neoclassical Greek male torso carved out of ice, recasting the myth of Tiresias as a story of endurance and transformation. Cassils has performed ''Tiresias'' at the ANTI International Contemporary Art Festival in Kuopio Finland (2012); at the FADO Performance Art Center<ref>{{cite web|title = FADO Performance Art Centre|url = http://www.performanceart.ca/index.php?m=gallery&id=177|website = www.performanceart.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in Toronto, Canada; at the City Of Women Festival in conjunction with The Kapelica Gallery<ref>{{cite web|title = # Galerija Kapelica|url = http://www.kapelica.org/index_en.html#event=814|website = www.kapelica.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in Ljubljana Slovenia; at the Performatorium Festival of Queer Performance,<ref>{{cite web|title = Queer City Cinema|url = http://www.queercitycinema.ca/performance2012/?s=performance2012|website = www.queercitycinema.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Regina, Canada (2013); and at Performance Studies International<ref>{{cite web|title = Performance Studies International Conference comes to Stanford University, June 26–30 {{!}} Stanford Arts|url = http://arts.stanford.edu/performance-studies-international-conference-comes-to-stanford-university-june-26-30/|website = arts.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> at [[Stanford University]] (2013). Most recently the piece was installed at the National Gallery of Art in Sopot, Poland (2015). Articles about ''Tiresias'' have appeared in well respected academic journals, including an essay in ''[[TDR (journal)|The Drama Review]]'' by Maurya Wickstrom,<ref>{{cite journal|title = Desire and Kairos: Cassils's Terisias|journal = TDR/The Drama Review|volume = 58|pages = 46–55|url = https://www.academia.edu/10281646|accessdate = 2015-09-27|last1 = Wickstrom|first1 = Maurya}}</ref> and another in ''Performance Research Journal'' by Megan Hoetger.<ref>{{cite web|title = Past Issues - Performance Research Volume19, Issue3 - CPR|url = http://www.performance-research.org/past-issue-detail.php?issue_id=77|website = www.performance-research.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Both journals featured images from the performance on their cover (2014).

==Mid-career achievements==
In 2010, Cassils was awarded a Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Artist Research Grant as part of LACE's contribution to [[Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945-1980|Pacific Standard Time]], an initiative of the Getty with arts institutions across Southern California, showcasing cultural production from 1945-1980. LACE chose Cassils to make a new performance for their exhibition ''Los Angeles Goes Live: Exploring a Social History of Performance Art in Southern California (LAGA)''<ref>{{cite web|title = Los Angeles Goes Live: Performance Art in Southern California 1970-1983|url = http://welcometolace.org/lace/los-angeles-goes-live-performance-art-in-southern-california-1970-1983/|website = welcometolace.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> in which they were invited to use LACE's archive as a springboard from which to create a new work. Cassils created ''Cuts: A Traditional Sculpture'', a large body of work that began with a six-month durational performance and generated video installations, photographs, watercolors, and a magazine. This performance is a reinterpretation of Eleanor Antin's 1972 performance ''Carving: A Traditional Sculpture'', in which Antin crash dieted for 45 days and documented her body daily with photographs from four vantage points. Instead Cassils used their mastery of [[bodybuilding]] and nutrition to gain 23 pounds of muscle over 23 weeks, transforming their physique into a traditionally masculine muscular form. Elements from ''CUTS'' have been exhibited at Rutgers University,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://iwa.rutgers.edu/media/uploads/TransTechnology_ExhibitionCatalogue.pdf|title = Trans Technology Exhibition Catalogue|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140430211110/http://iwa.rutgers.edu/media/uploads/TransTechnology_ExhibitionCatalogue.pdf|archive-date = 2014-04-30|dead-url = yes}}</ref> the Stamp Gallery at the University of Maryland,<ref>{{cite web|title = Queer Objectivity|url = http://thestamp.umd.edu/stamp_gallery/past_exhibitions/queer_objectivity|website = thestamp.umd.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (2013),<ref>{{cite web|title = Battleground States {{!}} UMOCA|url = http://www.utahmoca.org/past/battleground-states/|website = www.utahmoca.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> as well as at SOMArts <ref>{{cite web|title = Projected Personae — SOMArts|url = http://www.somarts.org/personae/|website = www.somarts.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150910193206/http://www.somarts.org/personae/|archive-date = 2015-09-10|dead-url = yes}}</ref> San Francisco, and MU Art Space,<ref>{{cite web|title = GenderBlender {{!}} past {{!}} MU Eindhoven|url = http://www.mu.nl/uk/exhibitions/past/genderblender/|website = www.mu.nl|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150928210430/http://www.mu.nl/uk/exhibitions/past/genderblender/|archive-date = 2015-09-28|dead-url = yes}}</ref> Eindhoven, the Netherlands (2014).

Cassils also collaborated with photographer and makeup artist Robin Black to create ''Advertisement: Homage to Benglis'', in which Cassils staged a series of self-empowered representations of trans embodiment, substituting a ripped masculine physique for Benglis's double-ended phallus.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bend It Like Benglis|url = http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/bend-it-like-benglis/|accessdate = 2015-09-28|date = 2014-10-20}}</ref> This piece received critical acclaim and became the subject articles in the ''LA Weekly'' (2011),<ref>{{cite web|title = Heather Cassils Gets Ripped for LACE Performance Art Show|url = http://www.laweekly.com/arts/heather-cassils-gets-ripped-for-lace-performance-art-show-2172171|accessdate = 2015-09-27|first = Catherine|last = Wagley|date = 2011-09-29}}</ref> and ''X-Tra Contemporary Art Quarterly'' (2012).<ref>{{cite web|title = Re-performance: History as an Experience to Be Had|url = http://x-traonline.org/article/re-performance-history-as-an-experience-to-be-had/|website = x-traonline.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> It is a key subject of Lianne McTavish's book ''Feminist Figure Girl Look Hot While You Fight The Patriarchy'' (2015),<ref>{{cite web|title = Feminist Figure Girl|url = http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5981-feminist-figure-girl.aspx|website = www.sunypress.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> and was featured in the publication ''Art and Queer Culture'' by Richard Meyer and Catherine Lord (2013).<ref>{{cite web|title = Art and Queer Culture {{!}} Art {{!}} Phaidon Store|url = http://www.phaidon.com/store/art/art-and-queer-culture-9780714849355/|website = Phaidon|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> ''Advertisement: Homage to Benglis'' was featured in Cassils's solo exhibition at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, BODY OF WORK, and it is currently on view and being used as the key art for an exhibition in Berlin at the Schwules Museum* and Deutsches Historisches Museum called Homosexualities (2015).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Deutsches Historisches Museum: Homosexualität_en|url = https://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/homosexualitaet-en.html|website = www.dhm.de|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}</ref> The film ''Fast Twitch// Slow Twitch'', also part of the CUTS series, was screened at Moving Image Fair,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fast Twitch// Slow Twitch|url = https://www.artsy.net/article/moving-image-london-2013-heather-cassils-fast-twitch-slash-slash-slow-twitch|accessdate = 2015-09-28|date = 2013-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title = Artist - Heather Cassils|url = http://www.moving-image.info/artistheathercassils/|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> and the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA London,]] UK in 2013,<ref>{{cite web|title = Artists' Film Club: Masculine/Feminine {{!}} Institute of Contemporary Arts|url = https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/artists-film-club-masculinefeminine|website = www.ica.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150928141207/https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/artists-film-club-masculinefeminine|archive-date = 2015-09-28|dead-url = yes}}</ref> as well as at screenings at the [[Armory Center for the Arts]] in Pasadena,<ref>{{cite web|title = Moving Image Art: HUMAN ANIMAL » Armory Center for the Arts|url = http://www.armoryarts.org/visit/2012-armory-events/moving-image-art-human-animal/|website = www.armoryarts.org|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150928073227/http://www.armoryarts.org/visit/2012-armory-events/moving-image-art-human-animal/|archive-date = 2015-09-28|dead-url = yes}}</ref> the This Is What I Want Festival in San Francisco (2012)<ref>{{cite web|title = 2015 Festival|url = http://www.thisiswhatiwantfestival.com/festival-2015/|website = THIS IS WHAT I WANT FESTIVAL|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> the Dirty Looks On Location Festival in NY, and Festival Everybody's Perfect in Geneva, Switzerland.

===Becoming an Image===
In 2012 Cassils commenced a new body of work called ''Becoming An Image'', originally conceived as a site-specific work for the [[ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives]] in Los Angeles, the oldest active LGBTQ archive in the United States. Cassils delivers a series of kicks and blows to a 2000-pound block of clay in total darkness. The performance is only illuminated by a photographer's flash which leaves an afterimage on the viewer's retina, raising questions of witnessing, documentation, memory and evidence. ''Becoming an Image'' has been exhibited widely, including: ''Material Traces: Time and Gesture in Contemporary Art'' curated by Amelia Jones (2013);<ref>{{cite web|title = Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery|url = http://ellengallery.concordia.ca/en/expositions_materialtraces.php|website = ellengallery.concordia.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-27|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150928213519/http://ellengallery.concordia.ca/en/expositions_materialtraces.php|archive-date = 2015-09-28|dead-url = yes|df = }}</ref> The Edgy Woman Festival in Montreal, Canada;<ref>{{cite web|title = Heather Cassils {{!}} edgy women blog|url = http://edgywomenblog.com/tag/heather-cassils/|website = edgywomenblog.com|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> SPILL International Performance Festival in London,<ref>{{cite web|title = Becoming An Image {{!}} SPILL Festival|url = http://spillfestival.com/show/becoming-an-image/|website = spillfestival.com|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}</ref> Fierce Festival in Birmingham, UK.
