:({{Find sources|Dream report}})
This article is about a computer program that fails [[WP:N]] as it hasn't received significant coverage in multiple, [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], nor has it made a significant impact in its field.  Coverage on the product is scant and promotional. Its only real claim-to-fame is a minor, nonnotable award [http://www.automationworld.com/information-management/ocean-data-systems-invensys-names-dream-report-2013-productivity-partner]. Furthermore, it reads like an advertisement and its creator has a history of creating promotional content.

Please keep.  I have made significant edits that are intended to remove the appearance of advertisement while still highlighting the specialized nature of industrial reporting and this unique product for that market.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/69.64.102.104|69.64.102.104]] ([[User talk:69.64.102.104|talk]]) 19:06, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

* Still '''speedy delete'''. Unless you have third party [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to demonstrate [[WP:CORP|corporate notability]]. -[[User:Sigeng|Sigeng]] ([[User talk:Sigeng|talk]]) 22:52, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - software article lacking significant independent coverage to establish notability. a search turned up no significant RS coverage.[[User:Dialectric|Dialectric]] ([[User talk:Dialectric|talk]]) 21:53, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
