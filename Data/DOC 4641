* ... that in 1888, in [[San Francisco Bay]], {{RMS|Oceanic|1870|6}} rammed '''{{SS|City of Chester||6}}''' and cut through her "as though she was a cheese" ''(accident pictured)''?
:* ''Reviewed'': Nominating someone else's article.
<small>Created by [[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]), [[User:Yngvadottir|Yngvadottir]] ([[User talk:Yngvadottir|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) at 17:18, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* The prefixes were in italics, when they should not be. Fixed that for you. How about linking ''Oceanic''? Would be nice to know which ''Oceanic'' did the ramming. [[User:Manxruler|Manxruler]] ([[User talk:Manxruler|talk]]) 21:40, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:** [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Tweaked hook for grammar and linked ''Oceanic''. Date and size check out OK, hook fact and quote verified, DD check shows no apparent CP/CV concerns. Should be good to go. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub>[[User talk:The Bushranger|<span style="color:maroon;">One ping only</span>]]</sub> 07:16, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
