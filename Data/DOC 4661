Title : Leasehold Reform Act 1967
Text : '''Leasehold Reform Act 1967''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/88/contents c 88]) is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]], which concerns [[English land law]] and [[Compulsory purchase in England and Wales|compulsory purchase]].

==Contents==
The Act granted the right to long leaseholders of houses let at a low rent to buy their homes compulsorily from their landlords at a fair price.

Initially the 1967 Act applied only to homes below a certain rateable value (£400 pa in London and £200 pa elsewhere) (targeting working class homeowners).

The Act was subsequently amended numerous times to expand these rights, to homeowners having higher rateable values.
