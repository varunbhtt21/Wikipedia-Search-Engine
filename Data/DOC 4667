Rae flashes back to when she was first released. Her mum picks her up from the hospital and on the car ride home, they run into Rae's old friend, Chloe, who invites Rae to hang out with her and her friends. Rae initially refuses, but agrees when she sees Chloe's attractive friend, Archie. Rae goes to a local pub with Chloe and is introduced to her friends, Izzy, Chop, Finn and Archie. The next day, Rae gets upset when Chloe and her friends don't call and ask her to hang out again. She goes to the pub, where she finds them. After Chloe apologises, Rae has her first conflict with Finn as they both want to choose the music. She then goes on to impress the rest of the gang with her music taste by playing [[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]] by [[Beastie Boys|The Beastie Boys]]. Her new friends invite her to a pool party and she goes shopping with Chloe for a suitable swimming costume to wear. In the changing room, Chloe's cigarette causes the fire alarm to go off, forcing Rae leave the shop in a bikini top, where she is made fun of and spotted by Archie. She then tries to return to the psychiatric hospital, where her friend, Tix, reminds her that she has a chance for a new life outside the hospital. Tix convinces Rae to go to the pool party where she finds Archie sitting outside. He confides in her that he is nervous about swimming as he's embarrassed that he has back [[acne vulgaris|acne]]. She convinces him to go in and agrees to swim if he does. When she tries to enter the pool by going down the slide, she gets stuck, showing the [[self-harm]] marks all over her legs. She laughs it off, joking about her size and gets Chop to help her into the pool. The episode ends with Chloe finding Rae's customised hospital bracelet from Tix.

 |ShortSummary=Rae is invited by the boys to go to [[Knebworth]] with them to see [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] perform.

Rae disapproves and she and Chloe argue. Chloe confides in her that she is pregnant. She then tells Rae she is going to have an [[abortion]], and is going to tell Mr. Carrisford. When out with the boys, Chop takes out Oasis T-shirts that he has got printed for everyone, with Rae's saying "Raemundo" on the back. She gets mad and refuses to try it on saying that she doesn't like the nickname. She goes to the toilets and discovers there is blood on the back of her skirt caused by her [[menstruation|period]]. She covers the back of her skirt with a sheet of paper and leaves the bathroom to find everyone has left except for Finn, who has his back to her. She sneaks out without him seeing her and once outside, she drops the piece of paper and starts to walk home. A group of boys, who have bullied Rae in the past, appear and make fun of her. Finn shows up and punches the leader, and makes him apologise. As the gang runs off, Finn makes sure Rae is okay. She realises her first impression of Finn was wrong and starts to develop feelings for him. Rae goes to meet the boys to go to Knebworth and thanks Finn for what he did.

Chloe begins to question Rae, asking why she would want to hurt herself, but is interrupted by a phone call. It's Mr. Carrisford and he says he wants to talk, so Chloe says she has to go to his house. She asks Rae to stay in her bedroom so her parents think that she is in, leaving Rae alone.

 |ShortSummary= In the final episode, Rae is in a very dark place following Tix's deterioration. When she meets the gang in the Fish & Chip shop for a 'de-brief', Chop and Archie leave, and she finds herself feeling awkward after witnessing the kiss between Chloe and Finn. While Finn is in the bathroom, Chloe tells Rae that she has actually started to develop real feelings for Finn. She has a daydream about running Chloe over with a truck, but it is broken when Finn returns. The three sit in silence until Rae decides to leave, forgetting her bag. After she tells her mother she had seen Karim with another family, she finds out that Karim had not cheated on her mother, and that it was just his sister and her children. She finally realizes that she has left her diary at the Fish & Chip shop. When she goes to get it back, the woman behind the counter tells her that her "pretty" friend took it for her. She runs to Chloe's, but is too late as she has already read its contents — including insults about Chloe, Rae's love for Finn and Archie's homosexuality — and Rae is alienated from the group. Rae becomes gradually more and more depressed from having no one to talk to, and tries to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge, only to be run over by a car before she can jump. She enters a dream-like state in which Tix acts to be some sort of guardian angel and shows her what the world would be like without her. After being told that she is in a coma and that her mother, Karim, and Finn are at her beside, she agrees to wake up, only to find she is not in a coma, but still lying on the side of the road. One of the boys who had previously bullied Rae shows remorse for running her over and drives her to the hospital. Rae then goes to see Kester, and they have a heart to heart about Rae's father, who is not around, and about why she had just tried to commit suicide again. He tells her to go to her mother's wedding reception and Rae agrees, changing into the dress her mother had bought her. After Chloe tells Rae to stay away from her and her friends at the reception, Rae decides to give a speech and finally reveals the truth about herself. Chop reveals how he feels about Izzy, and Archie tries to reveal the fact that he is gay, but decides against it. Rae and Chloe make up, Chloe stating that Finn is not interested in her. When she goes looking for Finn, she finds him at the Fish & Chip shop and he tries to tell her something, but fails, so instead he uses their special language and writes "I love you" on her back. She tells him not to say it if he doesn't mean it, but he confirms that he doesn't care if she believes him or not, implying that he does in fact love her. The next day, Rae starts to make an effort to connect with Karim, and they share a tender moment in which Karim tries to explain about the birds in English, but soon converts back to French as he has no clue how to speak English. Rae goes back to Kester for her sessions, and asks whether she needs to be admitted again as she had tried to kill herself. He replies with, "No," so she asks whether she is better to which he replies again, "No." He then goes on to tell her she is in fact ready for therapy. Rae smiles knowing that she is one step closer to getting better.

There is a flashback to the day after her mother's wedding, where Chloe gathered the gang to discuss Rae's illness. Rae assures everyone that she is happy and healthy and she finally begins a relationship with Finn. With the events of the summer recounted, Rae returns to the present day. In a session with Kester, she informs him that she has stopped keeping a diary, and he brings up the idea of a group therapy session so Rae can discuss an important issue but she quickly rebuffs his suggestion. With the gang, Rae is horrified to discover that college is beginning soon and she and Izzy are still virgins. Chloe suggests the gang go on a camping trip so the girls can have privacy with their boyfriends. Rae prepares for sex by buying lingerie, watching a pornographic movie left in her mother's VCR, and getting a bikini wax. In another therapy session with Kester, she accidentally reveals that she is still suffering from body image issues and worries that she is not beautiful enough for Finn. The gang goes on their camping trip and Rae fears her efforts have been futile: Finn doesn't pick up her hints for sex, Chop only got two tents instead of three, and Izzy admits that she and Chop already had sex. However, Finn shows Rae a secluded, romantic spot where they can have sex and she is reassured. However, she changes her mind and realizes that she is not ready for sex. Meanwhile, Archie rebuffs several of Chloe's attempts to seduce him. The gang finally begins college and Rae fears being teased for her weight again. She becomes anxious and runs out a fire door, accidentally setting off the alarm. In the confusion, Rae ditches school altogether. Rae attends another therapy session with Kester where it is revealed that Tix has died. Rae agrees to attend group therapy to cope with her loss. There, she recognizes a boy from college who saw her set off the alarm.
