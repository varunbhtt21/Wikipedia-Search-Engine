'''Lang Jingshan''' ({{zh|t=郎靜山}}; 4 August 1892 – 13 April 1995), also romanized as '''Long Chin-san''' and '''Lang Ching-shan''', was a pioneering photographer and one of the first Chinese photojournalists. He has been called "indisputably the most prominent figure in the history of Chinese art photography",<ref name="LaiLang2000">{{cite book |last1=Lai|first1=Kin-Keung Edwin |last2=Lang|first2=Jingshan |title=The Life and Art Photography of Lang Jingshan (1892–1995) |year=2000 |publisher=University of Hong Kong|doi=10.5353/th_b3023021 }}</ref> and the "Father of Asian Photography".<ref name=zhang>{{cite news |url=http://beijing.china.org.cn/2013-11/29/content_30741109.htm |title=China's first nude photographer |author=Zhang Junmian |publisher=China.org.cn |date=2013-11-29 }}</ref> He joined the [[Royal Photographic Society]] in 1937 and gained his Associateship in 1940 and Fellowship in 1942.<ref>Information from the Royal Photographic Society's membership records supplied by the Director-General.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Shanghai Bridge, by Lang Jingshan.jpg|thumb|Lang's photograph of Shanghai's [[Waibaidu Bridge]]]]
Lang Jingshan was born in [[Huai'an]], [[Jiangsu]] province, in 1892, but was considered a native of his [[Ancestral home (Chinese)|ancestral hometown]] [[Lanxi, Zhejiang]], by Chinese convention. His father, Lang Jintang (郎錦堂), was a [[Qing dynasty]] military officer who was interested in art and photography, and Jingshan grew up influenced by the arts.<ref name=zhou>{{cite web |url=http://beaver.ncnu.edu.tw/projects/emag/article/200310/%E9%83%8E%E9%9D%9C%E5%B1%B1.pdf |author=Zhou Yuling (周郁齡) |title=一個世紀的見證－郎靜山其人與其藝 |trans-title=Witness of a century: Lang Jingshan and his art |date=October 2003 |publisher=National Chi Nan University}}</ref> At age 12, while a student at Nanyang Middle School in [[Shanghai]], he received his first training in photography from his art teacher Li Jinglan (李靖蘭), who instructed him in the principles of composition and in the techniques of photography.<ref name=zhou/>

==Career==
In 1911, Lang began working for Shanghai's ''[[Shen Bao]]'' newspaper in advertising design. In 1926, he joined the ''Eastern Times'' (時報) newspaper as one of China's first photojournalists.<ref name=zhou/> In 1928, Hu Boxiang (胡伯翔), Chen Wanli (陳萬里), and Zhang Xiuzhen (張秀珍) founded the China Photography Association, China's first art photography association, in Shanghai. Lang, Hu, and [[manhua]] artist Ding Song were key participants of the society.<ref name=zhou/>{{sfnb|Roberts|2012|p=83}}

Lang's work was multifaceted. Commercial newspaper jobs made him one of China's first photojournalists, but his work in other areas put artistic values first. In 1928, he took what is considered the earliest surviving Chinese artistic nude photograph, "Meditation" (the model's father beat her when he heard what she had done).<ref name=zhang/>{{sfnb|Roberts|2012|p=85}} In 1930, he published the ''Album of Nude Photographs'', the first in China.<ref name=zhang/> He exhibited his own work widely including ''After the Tang Masters'' in the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s 1937 Exhibition<ref>Number 69 listed in 'Catalogue', ''Photographic Journal'', 1937.</ref> and ''Majestic Solitude'' (1937) in the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s 1940 Exhibition.<ref>The image was reproduced in the exhibition catalogue, ''The Year's Photography 1940-1941'', plate XIV.</ref>

He experimented briefly with modernist style, such as architectural photos which emphasized abstract forms. On the other hand, the texture and composition of Lang's landscape photography drew on traditional [[Chinese ink painting]] of scenery and landscape. He achieved these effects by superimposing several images onto one print and by using a brush and ink on the print. Together with his friend, Hu Boxiang, he established several photography groups and organized a series of exhibits which also traveled to Japan, the United States, and England.{{sfnb|Kent|2013}}

In 1939, [[Aurora University (Shanghai)|Aurora University]] in Shanghai staged an exhibition of his works which demonstrated the concepts of Chinese painting in photography. When the Japanese [[Battle of Shanghai|occupied Shanghai]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he moved to inland [[Sichuan]] province, and returned to Shanghai after the war. With the Communist takeover of mainland China, he moved to Taiwan in the summer of 1949, but had to leave most of his photography equipment behind.<ref name=zhou/> Lang cofounded the Chinese Writers’ and Artists’ Association in 1950.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Han Cheung |title=Taiwan in Time: Master artist in exile |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2019/04/14/2003713362/2 |accessdate=14 April 2019 |work=Taipei Times |date=14 April 2019}}</ref> In March 1953, the China Photography Association was reestablished in Taipei, and Lang served as its director for 42 years.<ref name=zhou/>

Beginning in the 1960s, Lang Jingshan's photography turned to creative landscape with figures, many modeled on paintings by [[Zhang Daqian]], showing [[Taoist]] influence. He received awards from the Ministry of Education. In 1968 he visited the United States and the [[Kodak]] factories in New York state. In 1981 and 1983 he had solo retrospectives exhibitions in France, and in 1984 in Hong Kong. The 1991 "Lang Ching-shan Centenary Exhibition" was held in Beijing at the [[Palace Museum]].<ref name=zhou/>

In October 2013, the [[National Art Museum of China]] (NAMOC) staged a special exhibition of Lang's art entitled "Distant Melody from Quiet Mountains".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.cafa.com.cn/distant-melody-from-quiet-mountains-special-exhibition-of-lang-ching-shan-photography-art-debut-at-national-art-museum-of-china.html |author=Sue Wang |title='Distant Melody from Quiet Mountains – Special Exhibition of Lang Ching-shan Photography Art' Debut at National Art Museum of China |publisher=CAFA Art Info |date=October 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref> Lang Jingshan's daughter, Lang Yuwen, donated 134 of his artworks, including "Meditation", to NAMOC.<ref name=zhang/>

==Style and influences==
Lang committed himself to teaching and spreading his ideas of a Chinese photography. He was influenced by the pioneering photographer and literary statesman [[Liu Bannong]], who argued as early as 1928 that China should have its own style rooted in Chinese culture.<ref>LO Yan-yan "[http://www.heritagemuseum.gov.hk/downloads/materials/curatorial_statement_tchan.pdf Tchan Fou-li: Inventing Hong Kong Pictorial Photography with the Charm of Chinese Culture]"</ref> In turn he and his style influenced such younger photographers as [[Liu Xucang]], and [[Tchan Fou-li]], who worked in Hong Kong. He published an important article titled 'Composite Pictures and Chinese Art' in the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s Journal in February 1942 which reproduced and discussed his photograph ''Au Printemps''.<ref>Chin-San Long FRPS, 'Composite Pictures and Chinese Art', ''Photographic Journal'', February 1942, pp. 30-32. </ref>
