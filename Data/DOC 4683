'''Editors with article requests involving significant policy and/or POV concerns or edit wars''' should use [[Wikipedia:Third opinion]], [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment]], and/or Noticeboards ([[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard]] for living persons and [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents]] for others.) before a peer review.

All reviews are conducted by fellow editors&mdash;usually members of the WikiProject.
