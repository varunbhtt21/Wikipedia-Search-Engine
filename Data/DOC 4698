== Summary ==
The documentary film deals with lovesickness, often laughed off as nothing more than an affliction of adolescence. Oscar-nominated director Christian Frei and award-winning cinematographer Peter Indergand dive into the frenzied nights of three people who have recently been rejected: nights full of pain and tears, yet also of wakefulness and creativity. Anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher reveals the processes that unfold in the brain of the lovesick. She says: "The game of love matters. It matters big time." Exploring the difficult path out of self-destructive, obsessive behavior, toward a new self, "Sleepless in New York" was promoted as "a film for those in love, out of love or looking for love."<ref name="sleepless in new york presskit">{{cite news | url=http://sleepless-in-new-york.com/downloads/sleepless-in-new-york_documentary_presskit-english.pdf | title=Sleepless in New York | accessdate=6 May 2014 | author=Frei, Christian | type=Presskit}}</ref>

{{quote|Proof that you can find beauty even in the darkest areas. It’s not the depressing look at love you may be imagining, and we’re witness to people coming through these hard times with a fiery, new spirit, 
and a renewed outlook on life.|William Brownridge, The Film Reel<ref name="Hot Docs Review: Sleepless in New York (2014) – or – Heartbreak on film">{{cite news | url=http://www.the-filmreel.com/2014/04/28/review-sleepless-in-new-york-2013/| title=Hot Docs Review: Sleepless in New York (2014) – or – Heartbreak on film | accessdate=6 May 2014 | author=Brownridge, William}}</ref>}}

{{quote|Sleepless in New York is able to superbly personalize those feelings of desertion and anxiety we’ve all felt after a major breakup. The filmmaker takes matters further by welcoming anthropologist Helen Fisher to introduce psychological theories that explain the hurt and why we react the way we do. Her opinions are astounding and the results she delivers are unbelievable.|Addison Wylie, Wylie Writes Movie Reviews<ref name="Wylie Writes @ Hot Docs 2014: Hunky-Dory Heartbreak Doc">{{cite news | url=http://wyliewrites.com/wylie-writes-hot-docs-2014-hunky-dory-heartbreak-doc/ | title=Wylie Writes @ Hot Docs 2014: Hunky-Dory Heartbreak Doc | accessdate=6 May 2014 | author=Wylie, Addison | type=Review}}</ref>}}
