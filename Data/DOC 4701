Title : Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award
Text : The '''Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award''', instituted in 2012 during the 46th [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA Awards]], is given by the  [[Country Music Association]]. The presentation of the award is intended to "honor an iconic artist who has attained the highest degree of recognition in Country Music (that) achieved both national and international prominence and stature through concert performances, humanitarian efforts, philanthropy, [[record sales]], and public representation at the highest level", with the condition that the recipient  "must have positively impacted and contributed to the growth of the genre over time".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cmaworld.com/news/2013/11/kenny-rogers-presented-willie-nelson-lifetime-achievement-award/|title=Kenny Rogers Presented With the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=April 25, 2014|work=CMA World|publisher=Country Music Association}}</ref>

The award, first presented to [[Willie Nelson]], and named after him, was designed by [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] manufacturer  [[R.S. Owens & Company]]. The trophy was built resembling the "bullet shape" of a regular CMA award, formed by two aluminum struts that support a  bronze medallion on top, with the entire structure attached to a walnut base.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://a-e-mag.com/news/rs-owens-completes-willie-nelson-cma-lifetime-achievement-award|title=R.S.
