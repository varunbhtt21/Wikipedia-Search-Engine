'''Creations Unlimited''' was a game publisher founded by [[Robert J. Kuntz]], which published [[role-playing game]]s in the 1980s.

==History==
[[Robert J. Kuntz]] left [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] when [[Gary Gygax]] was forced out, and was very protective of his IP, not having signed over the rights to his world of Kalibruhn over to anyone.<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|241}} Kuntz created his own company to hold and protect his game world and other creations, and thus formed Creations Unlimited in 1986.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|241}} The company produced a linked set of four adventures: ''The Maze of Zayene, Part 1: Prisoners of the Maze'' (1987), ''The Maze of Zayene Part 2: Dimensions of Flight'' (1987), ''The Maze of Zayene, Part 3: Tower Chaos'' (1987) and ''The Maze of Zayene, Part 4: The Eight Kings'' (1987); Kuntz created the first two adventures while he was at college, and had subsequently run them at EastCon in 1983.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|241}} The company's fifth and final publication was ''Garden of the Plantmaster'' (1987); Kuntz had other publications planned for Creations Unlimited, the first of which was to be RPGA tournament adventure "(To the) City of Brass", followed by "Hidden Realms of Zayene", but Creations Unlimited never printed any of these.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|241}}

The company published five adventures/supplements before shutting its doors in 1988:

* The Maze of Zayene, Part 1: [[Prisoners of the Maze]] (1987)
* The Maze of Zayene, Part 2: [[Dimensions of Flight]] (1987)
* The Maze of Zayene, Part 3: [[Tower Chaos]] (1987)

Kuntz had planned to publish a sourcebook on the [[City of Brass (Dungeons & Dragons)|City of Brass]] in 1988 (and commissioned cover art and flyers for distribution at game conventions), but it did not see print.
