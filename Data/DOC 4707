The '''2014–15 TCU Horned Frogs basketball team''' represented [[Texas Christian University]] in the [[2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]]. This was head coach [[Trent Johnson]]'s third season at TCU. They were members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Due to construction on [[Daniel–Meyer Coliseum]], which has been the Horned Frogs' home arena since 1961–62, TCU played all of their home games at [[Fort Worth Independent School District]]'s Wilkerson-Greines Activity Center for the 2014–15 season.<ref>{{cite web| last =Osborne| first =Ryan| title =Fort Worth ISD agrees to host TCU basketball at Wilkerson-Greines in 2014–15| work =[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]| publisher =| date =April 24, 2014| url =http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/04/24/5765043/fort-worth-isd-agrees-to-host.html?rh=1| accessdate = April 25, 2014}}</ref>
