The '''2008 1000 Guineas Stakes''' was a [[horse racing|horse race]] held at [[Newmarket Racecourse]] on Sunday 4 May 2008. It was the 195th running of the [[1000 Guineas]].

The winner was Stefan Friborg's [[Natagora]], a French-bred [[gray (horse)|grey]] [[filly]] trained at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] by [[Pascal Bary]] and ridden by [[Christophe Lemaire]]. Natagora's victory was the first in the race for her owner, trainer and jockey.

==The contenders==
The race attracted a field of fifteen runners, ten trained in the United Kingdom, four in Ireland and one in France. The favourite was the French challenger Natagora who had been named [[Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly|European Champion Two-year old Filly]] in 2007 when she had won the [[Prix Robert Papin]] in France and the [[Cheveley Park Stakes]] in England. The [[Ballydoyle]] stable had two representatives in Kitty Matcham, the winner of the [[Rockfel Stakes]] and Savethisdanceforme, whilst the other two Irish runners were the dual [[Group races|Group One]] winner [[Saoirse Abu]] ([[Phoenix Stakes]], [[Moyglare Stud Stakes]]) and the [[Curragh Racecourse|Curragh]] [[maiden race]] winner [[Lush Lashes]], neither of whom were fancied in the betting. The leading British-trained runners appeared to be two fillies bred and owned by the [[Cheveley Park Stud]]: the [[Nell Gwyn Stakes]] winner Infallible, and Spacious, the winner of the [[May Hill Stakes]]. The most fancied of the other fillies was the [[John Dunlop (racehorse trainer)|John Dunlop]]-trained Muthabara, the undefeated winner of the [[Fred Darling Stakes]]. Natagora headed the betting at odds of [[Fractional odds|11/4]] ahead of Infallible (7/2) and Spacious (11/2) with Muthabara and Kitty Matcham on 8/1.<ref name="racingpost1">{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=450434&r_date=2008-05-04&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=1000 Guineas result |work=[[Racing Post]] |date=4 May 2008 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

==The race==
The 80/1 outsider Francesca d'Gorgio, who had been unruly in the [[starting stalls]] broke quickly and led two furlongs but was overtaken by Natagora. Most of the fillies raced up the stands side (the left of the course from the jockeys' viewpoint) with Natagora racing along the stands rail. The favourite set the pace from Muthabara with Infallible, Saoirse Abu, Lady Deauville and Laureldene Gale close behind. Natagora began to come under pressure a furlong from the finish, at which point several fillies, including Spacious, Nahoodh and Lush Lashes began to make progress. In the closing stages Natagora ran on to win by half a length from Spacious, with Saoirse Abu a further half length away in third. Infallible, Nahoodh, Lush Lashes, Royal Confidence and Muthabara came next, with less than three and a half lengths separating the first eight finishers.<ref name="racingpost1"/>
