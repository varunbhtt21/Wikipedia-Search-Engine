*'''Delete'''.  Nothing but social media and blogging sites.  Might be [[WP:MADEUP|made up by the creator]]. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 19:52, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

Dorm Soccer exists all over the world, but there isn't a standard name for it. That's why it was put up here,  to have a standard name and definition.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Damiobash|Damiobash]] ([[User talk:Damiobash|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Damiobash|contribs]]) 23:39, 25 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Delete''' - completely non-notable. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 13:52, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - completely non-notable and borderline nonsense -- [[User:ChrisTheDude|ChrisTheDude]] ([[User talk:ChrisTheDude|talk]]) 20:06, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Could not be less notable or more nonsensical if it tried. Per the above arguments. [[User:Fenix down|Fenix down]] ([[User talk:Fenix down|talk]]) 12:01, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Even if it becomes notable in the future, and there are several people trying to force the trend, it's not notable yet. [[User:SPACKlick|SPACKlick]] ([[User talk:SPACKlick|talk]]) 12:16, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
