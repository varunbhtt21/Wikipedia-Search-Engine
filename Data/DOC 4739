During the 1940s Szaton created several other sculptures: a War Memorial (1940) at the Northwest Armory, Chicago; ''Indian Shooting the Stars'' (1947) for Lane Tech High School, Chicago, as a tribute to students who died in World War II; and ''Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep'' (1947) for Cedar Park Cemetery, Calumet Park, Illinois.<ref name="chicagotribune2002"/> Szaton continued to work at Taft's studio until it disbanded in 1947, then moved his family to [[Tinley Park]], at that time a small rural suburb of Chicago, and commuted to Chicago to work during the week as a greeting card engraver; income from art commissions was not sufficient to sustain his family.<ref name="chicagotribune2002"/> In 1948 Szaton built a large, vaulted-ceiling garage studio behind his home and continued to work on art projects.<ref name="chicagotribune2002"/>

==''The Coal Miner''==

In 1963 Szaton collaborated with artist [[Vachel Davis]] to reinterpret Davis's iconic 1946 painting ''American Coal Miner'' into a permanent, sculptural memorial to coal miners. Szaton's 7-ft. bronze statue, ''[[Coal Miner (statue)|The Coal Miner]]'', is displayed on the lawn of the [[Illinois State Capitol]] in Springfield. It was dedicated on October 16, 1964, and became his most widely known sculpture.<ref name="chicagotribune2002"/> A second ''The Coal Miner'' statue, cast in 1966, is installed on the west side of the [[Indiana Statehouse]] and was dedicated in 1967.

==Death==
Szaton died in 1966 and is buried in Cedar Park Cemetery, [[Calumet Park, Illinois]].<ref name="chicagotribune2002"/>
