==Background==
[[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]] was the incumbent [[List of heads of state of Mauritania|President of Mauritania]] at the time of the election and had been in office since 2009. A career soldier and high-ranking officer, he was a leading figure in [[2005 Mauritanian coup d'état|the August 2005 coup]] that deposed President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], and in August 2008 he led [[2008 Mauritanian coup d'état|another coup]], which toppled President [[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]]. Following the 2008 coup, Abdel Aziz became [[Heads of state of Mauritania|President of the High Council of State]] as part of what was described as a political transition leading to a new election.<ref name=Haut>[http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2008/Aout/07/01.html "Le Haut Conseil d'Etat rend public un nouveau communiqué"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812014816/http://www.ami.mr/fr/articles/2008/Aout/07/01.html |date=2008-08-12 }}, AMI, 7 August 2008 {{fr icon}}.</ref> He resigned from that post in April 2009 in order to stand as a candidate in the [[2009 Mauritanian presidential election|July 2009 presidential election]], which he won.
