'''Peter Chartier''' (1690{{mdash}}{{circa}}1759) (Anglicized version of '''Pierre Chartier''', sometimes written Chartiere, Chartiers, Shartee or Shortive) was a [[fur trade]]r of [[French people|French]] and [[Shawnee]] parentage who became a [[tribal chief]] and was an early advocate for [[Native American civil rights]], speaking out against the sale of alcohol in indigenous communities in [[Pennsylvania]]. He first attempted to limit the sale of [[rum]] in Shawnee communities in the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], then launched a movement to prohibit it altogether. Conflict with the colonial government motivated him to lead his community of over 400 [[Pekowi]] Shawnees on a four-year odyssey through Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama and Indiana, eventually resettling in Illinois. He later fought on the side of the French during the [[French and Indian War]].

Two communities ([[Chartiers Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania|Chartiers Township]] and [[Chartiers (Pittsburgh)]]), several rivers including [[Chartiers Creek]], [[Chartiers Run (Allegheny River)]] and [[Chartiers Run (Chartiers Creek)]], and two school districts ([[Chartiers-Houston School District]] and [[Chartiers Valley School District]]) are named after him.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5lyLDwAAQBAJ&pg= George P.

==Early career as a trader==
[[File:Iroquois western goods.jpg|thumb|right|1722 woodcut of Native Americans with various western goods that they received in trade for furs.]]On 3 November 1730 Peter Chartier was licensed by the English court in Lancaster County to trade with the Indians in the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|south-western Pennsylvania area]].<ref name = "Egle"/><ref name="Crumrine, 1882"/> By 1732 Chartier had become well known as a negotiator between the Shawnees and the traders who came to sell them goods. The [[Quaker]] trader Edmund Cartlidge wrote to [[Patrick Gordon (governor)|Governor Patrick Gordon]] on 14 May 1732:

<blockquote>I find Peter Chartiere well inclined, and stands firm by the interest of Pennsylvania, and very ready on all accounts to do all the service he can. And as he has the [[Shawnee language|Shawnise Tongue]] very perfect, and [is] well looked upon among them, he may do a great deal of good.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jLoCqlkZ3U4C&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345&dq James H.

In September and October 1732, Chartier and Cartlidge served as interpreters during a conference in [[Philadelphia]] attended by Opakethwa and Opakeita, two Shawnee chiefs, with [[Thomas Penn]], Governor Gordon and the 72-member [[Province of Pennsylvania#Government|Pennsylvania Provincial Council]]. With Chartier and the two chiefs was Quassenung, son of the Shawnee chief Kakowatcheky.

==Conflict with the colonial government==

===Alcohol abuse and Native Americans in Pennsylvania===
{{main|Alcohol and Native Americans}}
[[File:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|thumb|right|Fur traders doing business with Native Americans in 1777, with a barrel of rum to the left.]]Beginning around 1675 traders had been selling rum in Shawnee communities which had resulted in more than one incident of violence resulting in death.<ref name = "Mancall">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qd3HTX6Cid0C&printsec=frontcover&dq Peter C.

Together with the Royal, Proprietary, City, and Borough Charters,'' Pennsylvania, Hall and Sellers, 1775.]</ref> however as the law was poorly enforced and the penalty was light—a fine of ten [[Pennsylvania pound|pounds]] and confiscation of any illegal supplies—rum continued to be used to [[barter]] for furs. Traders soon began selling rum on [[Credit (finance)|credit]] in order to [[Extortion|extort]] [[North American fur trade|furs and skins]] and labor out of the Shawnees.<ref name = "Hanna"/>

The minutes of the [[Provincial Council of Pennsylvania]] for 16 May 1704 record a complaint submitted by Chief Ortiagh of the [[Conestoga people|Conestoga Indians]]:

<blockquote>Great quantities of rum [are] continually brought to their town, insomuch as they [are] ruined by it, having nothing left but have laid out all, even their clothes, for rum, and may now, when threatened with war, be surprised by their enemies when beside themselves with drink, and so be utterly destroyed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qas-AAAAYAAJ&dq= ''Colonial Records: Minutes of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania from the organization to the termination of the proprietary government,'' v. 11-16: Minutes of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania from its organization to the termination of the revolution, Volume 2. J. Severns & Company, 1852; p. 141]</ref></blockquote>

By the 1730s the effects of [[alcohol abuse]] were damaging Shawnee communities. Rum as well as [[brandy]] and other [[distilled beverage]]s had become important trade items and essential elements in diplomatic councils, treaty negotiations, and political transactions and had become part of Native American gift-giving rituals. The result was the [[Incivility|erosion of civility]], an increase in violence and widespread [[Alcohol and health|health problems]]. Alcohol made men less reliable hunters and allies, destabilized village economics and contributed to a rise in poverty.<ref name = "Friend">[https://books.google.com/books?id=iiVuxbcD4TAC&pg=PA25&dq A.

===Attempts to control the sale of alcohol to the Shawnee===
On 24 April 1733 the Shawnee chiefs at "Allegania" sent a petition to Governor Gordon complaining that "There is yearly and monthly some new upstart of a trader without license, who comes amongst us and brings with him nothing but rum ..." and asking permission to destroy the casks of rum: "We therefore beg thou would take it into consideration, and send us two firm orders, one for Peter Chartier, the other for us, to break in pieces all the [casks] so brought."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=S2WDFEj0pcYC&dq Randolph Chandler Downes, ''Council Fires on the Upper Ohio: A Narrative of Indian Affairs in the Upper Ohio Valley Until 1795: Vol 42,'' Western Pennsylvania Historical Survey, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1940.] {{ISBN|0822971267}}</ref>

On 1 May 1734 this was followed by another letter dictated by several Shawnee chiefs to a trader, probably Jonah Davenport, listing the names of some fifteen traders who either had no license or had exhibited undesirable behavior such as frequent disputes or violence. Another seven, including Chartier, were named as being in [[good standing]], and these would be permitted to bring up to 60 gallons of rum a year, as long as they could show a license. Chartier was described as "one of us, and he is welcome to come as long as he pleases ... [and] to bring what quantity [of rum] he pleases ..." The letter concludes, "And for our parts, if we see any other traders than those we desire amongst us, we will stave their [casks] and seize their goods."<ref name = "Hanna"/> The Shawnee evidently felt that control over the sale of rum would reduce problems resulting from its abuse.

===The prohibition of rum in Shawnee communities===
By 1737 Chartier had become [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the Pekowi Turtle Clan, with whom he was living.<ref name = "Sipe">[https://archive.org/stream/indianchiefsofpe00sipe/indianchiefsofpe00sipe_djvu.txt C. Hale Sipe, ''The Indian Chiefs of Pennsylvania,'' Pennsylvania: Wennawoods Publishing, 1995.]</ref> He apparently made the decision to prohibit the sale of rum in Shawnee communities in his area, and persuaded other chiefs to do the same. In a letter of 20 March 1738, addressed to [[Thomas Penn]] and Acting Governor [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], three Shawnee chiefs stated:

<blockquote>All our people being gathered together, we held a council together, to leave off drinking for the space of four years, and we all in general agreed to it, taking into consideration the ill consequences that attend it and what disturbance it makes, and that two of our brothers, the [[Mingo]]es, lost their lives in our towns by rum, and that we would live in peace and quietness and become another people ... The proposal of stopping the rum and all strong liquors was made to the rest [of the tribe] in the winter, and they were all willing. As soon as it was concluded of, all the rum that was in the Towns was all staved and spilled, belonging both to Indians and white people, which in quantity consisted of about forty gallons, that was thrown in the street, and we have appointed four men to stave all the rum or strong liquors that is brought to the Towns hereafter, either by Indians or white men, during the four years. We would be glad if our brothers would send strict orders that we might prevent the rum coming to the hunting cabins or to the neighboring towns. We have sent [[wampum]] to the French, to the [[Iroquois|Five Nations]], to the [[Lenape|Delaware]] ... to tell them not to bring any rum to our towns, for we want none ... so we would be glad if our brothers would inform the traders not bring any for we are sorry, after they have brought it a great way, for them to have it broke, and when they're once warned they will take care.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_xcUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA552&lpg=PA552&dq ''Pennsylvania Archives,'' first series, Harvard University, 1852; p. 551.]</ref></blockquote>

This letter was accompanied by a pledge, signed by ninety-eight Shawnees and by Chartier, agreeing that all rum should be spilled, and four men should be appointed for every town to see that no rum or strong liquor should be brought into their towns for the term of four years.<ref name = "Sipe2"/><ref name = "Grondine"/> Governor Patrick Gordon sent Chartier a reprimand,<ref>[http://www.chartiers.com/pages-new/misc/chartiers.html Where Did the Name Chartiers Come From?]</ref> and traders continued to bring rum into Shawnee communities, including several traders who the Shawnees had requested be barred from their territory.

For several years the French government had been trying to win the support of indigenous communities for a [[French and Indian War|war against the British]], and in 1740 the [[Governor of New France]], [[Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois]], attempted to persuade Chartier and other Shawnee leaders to meet in [[Montreal]] to discuss relocating to Detroit and forming an alliance.<ref name = "McConnell">[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=lpEBUfQjoIAC&dq Michael N.

Tensions with the Pennsylvania government escalated in 1743 when on 6 June three traders appeared before the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Council]] saying that two others had been murdered and that they had been advised by the Shawnees to leave or they too would be killed.<ref name = "Hanna"/><ref name = "Sipe2"/> The governor regarded this as an act of provocation to violence, and sent a letter to the Pennsylvania Assembly alleging that Chartier's Native American heritage inclined him to have a "brutish disposition ... and it is not to be doubted that a person of his savage temper will do us all the mischief he can."<ref name = "Grondine"/>

In 1743 Chartier moved to Shannopin's Town, and established a [[trading post]] on the Allegheny River about twenty miles upstream from the forks of the Ohio near the mouth of [[Chartiers Run (Allegheny River)|Chartiers Run]] at what is now [[Tarentum, Pennsylvania|Tarentum]], a place which later became known as Chartier's Old Town.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.tarentumboro.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=4&Itemid=26|website=Borough of Tarentum|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?idno=00hc17099m;view=toc;c=pitttext Boyd Crumrine, Franklin Ellis, and Austin N.

In 1747 Chartier appeared in [[Detroit]]<ref name = "Egle"/> (although this may actually have been one of his sons)<ref name = "Greene"/> to meet with [[Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière]] and explain why his Shawnees had chosen not to move to Detroit. The French had hoped to lure large numbers of Shawnees and other tribes away from British influence, but Chartier was the only leader to accept French patronage.<ref name = "McConnell"/> His band preferred to settle on the Wabash, which is where they had been living when Martin Chartier first encountered them in 1674. After leaving Detroit, Chartier visited [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]<ref name ="White"/> and in 1749 he met Captain [[Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville]] at the [[Point State Park#French and Indian War|forks of the Ohio]], during the Colonel's "lead plate expedition".<ref name = "Greene"/> Céloron also reported passing through the abandoned ruins of Chartier's Old Town.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OfUuAAAAYAAJ Orsamus Holmes Marshall, Andrew Arnold Lambing, Joseph Pierre de Bonnécamps, Charles Burleigh Galbreath, eds.

Chartier's Shawnee band split several times; many returned to Pennsylvania to join the British during the French and Indian war.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekgVAAAAYAAJ&dq Israel Daniel Rupp, ''Early History of Western Pennsylvania, and of the West, and of Western Expeditions and Campaigns, from MDCCLIV to MDCCCXXXIII.''

Chartier encouraged Vaudreuil to consider the Shawnees a unified nation (although this was not strictly accurate), and reaffirmed Shawnee loyalty to the French: "[H]is entire nation was entirely devoted to us [the French]," the Marquis later wrote. "[I]t is well to show this nation certain considerations in view of the fact that it has always been strongly attached to us." This was significant as the French tried to garner Native American loyalty in preparation for war.<ref name = "Warren"/>

==Participation in the French and Indian War==
In June 1754 Chartier was present with his Shawnee warriors and his two sons, Francois and René, at the death of Captain [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]] at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]].<ref name = "Greene"/> In July 1754 he and his sons participated in the French victory over [[George Washington]] at the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]].

Transcribed by Valerie F. Crook, 1998.]</ref>

==Death==
Peter Chartier was last seen in 1758 in a village on the [[Wabash River]],<ref name = "Hanna"/> however he is mentioned later in a 1760 letter from [[Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Governor-General Vaudreuil-Cavagnial]]:

<blockquote>"In the last days of the month of June of [1759], five Chaouoinons [Shawnees] of [Chartier]'s band came...to ask him for a piece of ground, as theirs was not good. M. de MacCarty sent some provisions to those Indians, whom he placed near [[Fort Massac]]. They were more useful and less dangerous there than when collected together at Sonyote [Lower Shawneetown].<ref name = "Hanna"/></blockquote>

There is evidence that Chartier (as well as his mother Sewatha Straight Tail) died in an outbreak of smallpox<ref name = "Greene"/> that had originated in 1757 in [[Quebec]]<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/smallpox/ "Smallpox", in ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'']</ref> and later spread to Native American communities across North America.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9iQYSQ9y60MC&pg Russell Thornton, ''American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492,'' Volume 186 of Civilization of the American Indian series; University of Oklahoma Press, 1987.] {{ISBN|080612220X}}</ref>

==Chartier's legacy==

Historian [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]] characterizes Chartier's rise to power as unique among the Shawnee:

<blockquote>Chartier was a political [[chameleon]] whose changes in coloring reflected opportunities rather than convictions, but it is the scope of his transformation that is most revealing. Chartier's switch from a British to a French [[Partisan (politics)|partisan]] is perhaps less significant than his metamorphosis from ''[[métis]]'' trader to Shawnee factional leader. Originally he was an important but marginal political figure, a man who acted through the chiefs, tying them to him through debts or gifts. Eventually he became a man who challenged chiefs, and ultimately, he acted like a chief himself...By 1750 he had legitimized his position.<ref name = "White"/></blockquote>

===Regulation of the sale of alcohol in Native American communities===
Chartier's decision to join the French and to lead his community out of Pennsylvania sparked fears that French influence over Native Americans would motivate them to attack British settlements. Accordingly, the Pennsylvania provincial government took measures to comply with the repeated requests of Shawnee leaders to control the practice of trading rum for furs. On 7 May 1745, shortly after Chartier had announced his [[defection]] to the French, [[Deputy Governor|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[Sir George Thomas, 1st Baronet|George Thomas]] issued a proclamation stating:

<blockquote>Whereas frequent complaints have been made by the Indians, and of late earnestly renewed, that divers gross irregularities and abuses have been committed in the Indian countries, and that many of their people have been cheated and inflamed to such a degree by means of strong liquors being brought and sold amongst them contrary to the said laws, as to endanger their own lives and the lives of others ... I do hereby strictly enjoin the [[magistrate]]s of the several counties within this province, and especially those of the [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|county of Lancaster]], where these abuses are mostly carried on, to be very vigilant.<ref name = "Hazard"/></blockquote>

Thomas strengthened the law against the sale of rum in indigenous communities, doubled the fine to twenty pounds, required a [[surety bond]] of one hundred pounds from anyone applying for a license to trade furs with Native Americans, required that the goods of traders traveling to indigenous communities be searched, and gave

<blockquote>...full power and authority to any Indian or Indians to whom rum or other strong liquors shall be hereafter offered for sale contrary to the said laws, to stave and break to pieces the cask or vessel in which such rum or other strong liquor is contained.<ref name = "Hazard">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gk0OAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq Samuel Hazard, ed. ''Minutes of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania: From the Organization to the Termination of the Proprietary Government, Mar. 10, 1683-Sept. 27, 1775,'' Vol 4 of Colonial Records of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Provincial Council, Pennsylvania Committee of Safety; J. Severns, 1851.]</ref>
</blockquote>
 
Although this was the most severe proclamation yet implemented to control the distribution of alcohol to Native Americans, it was also not strictly enforced and alcohol abuse continued to be an increasing problem in indigenous communities.<ref name = "Mancall"/>

===Native American self-determination===
Historian Stephen Warren describes Peter Chartier as an "audacious example of independence [which] infuriated Englishmen and Frenchmen alike," saying that Chartier 
<blockquote> ...encouraged Pan-Indian expressions of unity ... He discovered valuable lessons in movement and reinvention and ... turned Shawnee histories of migration and violence toward adoption of a new racial consciousness for Indian peoples in the eastern half of North America.<ref name = "Warren"/></blockquote>

Warren argues that both Peter and his father Martin Chartier influenced the Shawnee attitudes towards their neighbors and rivals, both European and Native American:

<blockquote>The Shawnees ... modeled themselves after men such as Martin and Peter Chartier, who moved between regions and empires in a single lifetime. Like the Chartiers, the Shawnees refused to acquiesce to French, English, or Iroquois "overlords." Frustratingly independent, Shawnee migrants made deliberate choices based on the realities of [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slavery]], intertribal warfare, and access to European trade goods.<ref name = "Warren"/></blockquote>
