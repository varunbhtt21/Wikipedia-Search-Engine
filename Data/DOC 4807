==Life==
The eldest son of John Wiffen, an ironmonger, by his wife Elizabeth Pattison, both from [[Quaker]] backgrounds, he was born at [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]], [[Bedfordshire]], on 30 December 1792; [[Benjamin Barron Wiffen]] was his younger brother, and his youngest sister Priscilla married [[Alaric Alexander Watts]]. His father died young, leaving six children to Elizabeth's care. At the age of ten Jeremiah entered [[Ackworth School]] in [[Yorkshire]], where he acquired some skill in [[wood engraving]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Wiffen, Jeremiah Holmes|volume=61}}</ref>

At age 14, Wiffen was apprenticed to Isaac Payne, a schoolmaster at [[Epping, Essex|Epping]], [[Essex]]. In 1811 he returned to Woburn and opened a school in Leighton Road. By hard study he made himself at home in the classics and Hebrew, French, and Italian, and later, Spanish and Welsh. On a visit to the [[Lake District]] with his brother in the summer of 1819 he made the acquaintance of [[Robert Southey]] and of [[William Wordsworth]], whose "white pantaloons" and "hawk's nose" are described in his diary. In the summer of 1821 he was appointed librarian at [[Woburn Abbey]] to [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford]].<ref name="DNB"/>

Wiffen declined the degree of LL.D. from Aberdeen University in 1827. His death was sudden, at [[Froxfield, Bedfordshire|Froxfield]], near Woburn, on 2 May 1836; he was buried on 8 May in the Friends' graveyard, [[Woburn Sands]], Buckinghamshire.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Works==
Wiffen's first appearance in print was in the ''[[European Magazine]]'' of October 1807, with an ''Address to the Evening Star'' versified from [[Ossian]]. His first contribution on an antiquarian subject was an account of [[Broxbourne]] church, [[Hertfordshire]], with an etching by himself.<ref name="DNB"/>

With [[James Baldwin Brown the elder]] and [[Thomas Raffles]], Wiffen published ''Poems by Three Friends'' (1813); the joint authorship was acknowledged in the second edition (1815). With his brother he published ''Elegiac Lines'' (1818) commemorating William Thompson, Quaker schoolmaster of [[Penketh]], Lancashire. His earliest independent volume was ''Aonian Hours'' (1819, dedicated to his brother; 2nd ed. 1820). His next book was ''Julia Alpinula … and other Poems'' (1820, dedicated to Alaric Watts; 2nd ed. 1820).<ref name="DNB"/>

In 1821 Wiffen issued "Proposals" for publishing by subscription a new translation of Tasso in [[Edmund Spenser|Spenserian]] verse. As a specimen, the fourth book of ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' was published in 1821, with a dissertation on existing translations. His next work in verse was a translation of ''The Works of Garcilasso de la Vega'', 1823, dedicated to the Duke of Bedford, with a life of [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], and an essay on Spanish poetry. The publication of the completed version of ''Jerusalem Delivered'' was delayed by a fire in the printing office; it appeared in 1824, dedicated to the Duchess of Bedford, with a life of Tasso and a list of English crusaders, 2 vols.<ref>There was another edition the same year, 3 vols.; reprinted 1830, 2 vols.; and in [[Bohn's series]], 1854, 1 vol., in addition to several American editions.</ref> The ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' concluded that Wiffen, as a translator of Tasso, was ahead of [[John Hoole]] and [[James Leigh Hunt]], but some way behind [[Edward Fairfax]].<ref name="DNB"/>

Wiffen's other poetical works were:<ref name="DNB"/>

* ''Verses … on the Alameda'', 1827,; 
* ''Appeal for the Injured African'', Newcastle upon Tyne, 1833; and

Eight years' work went into Wiffen's compilation of ''Historical Memoirs of the House of Russell'', 1833, 2 vols. He made some of the researches over a four months' tour in [[Normandy]]. Other publications were a ''Geographical Primer'' (1812), and ''Thoughts on the Creation, Fall, and Regeneration'', 1826, by John Humbles, "a Bedfordshire peasant" which Wiffen edited. A selection of his poems and ballads was given in ''The Brothers Wiffen'' (1880), by S. R. Pattison.<ref name="DNB"/>
