The result was    '''delete'''. The policy arguments clearly show that this is not independantly notable.

*'''Keep''': Per [[WP:OUTCOMES]], this is a Regional Shopping Center per the definition [http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/regional-shopping-center/4965203-1.html here]. Malls are inherently notable. [[User:Me5000|Me5000]] ([[User talk:Me5000|talk]]) 23:38, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
**Malls are not inherently notable. WP:OUTCOMES says: "Larger malls are generally considered notable. Very small malls, strip malls, and individual shops are generally deleted unless significant sourcing can be found." From their website, they seem to have 45 shops, which may not be "very small", but it's equally not large enough to establish notability on its own. Where is the "significant sourcing"?

**Being the most important shopping feature in a city is not a mark of independent notability. The only independent in-depth coverage you point to is in the ''Sumter Daily Item'', which is a local paper covering a few counties. There is no evidence of significant coverage in regional or national publications. Also, this is a pretty average size mall, so I don't think we can assume notability on basis of its size.

*'''Delete'''. Not notable. [[Mall of America]], [[South Coast Plaza]], [[Fashion Island]] are notable. But a regional mall, with it's only coverage from a local paper, and not tied to any major development company, sadly, is not.

'''Delete or redirect per NorthAmerica'''.  Mall-cruft.  I checked out the sources cited by various people above.  Sorry, but a dozen perfunctory articles in a local newspaper doesn't add up to being notable.  Show me some sources in national mainstream media.  -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 12:51, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Consensus is that malls do not need national coverage to be notable per these discussions: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Southgate Mall (Missoula)]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Middlesboro Mall (Middlesboro, Kentucky)]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Mall at Westlake]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Columbia Mall (Missouri)]] Almost no malls have national coverage. The sources I provided are not "perfunctory"(did you look at all of the source I provided or just a few?)  and easily satisfy [[WP:GNG]]. Additionaly, consensus is that enclosed shopping malls and Regional Shopping Centers (this mall is both) are inherently notable. [[User:Me5000|Me5000]] ([[User talk:Me5000|talk]]) 14:32, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
:: Consensus can change.  If you tell me that most malls do not have national coverage, then my response is that most malls are not notable.  It's a building.  With a parking lot.  It's got a couple of department store anchors, and a food court, and a shoe store, and a couple of clothing stores, and a bank, and book store, and it's just like any other of a zillion malls around the world.  -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 18:31, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
:::"A zillion" sounds like a number made up out of thin air, but one of the key words in WP:N is "evidence".&nbsp; What evidence do you have to support your position?&nbsp; Do you object to the icsc.org or allbusiness.com definitions?&nbsp; Do you have another metric to define "larger"?&nbsp; [[User:Unscintillating|Unscintillating]] ([[User talk:Unscintillating|talk]]) 19:23, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
::::I will stipulate to your assertion that I did not do an accurate count.  It might have been a jillion. Mostly what I object to is that there is no non-local coverage.  I see a lot of articles in a local newspaper (The Sumpter, SC Daily Item).  They do not impress me as meeting [[WP:N]].  I would be much more impressed if you could provide me with a couple of articles in national newspapers or similar sources.  -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 19:58, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::The keep !votes, to my knowledge, didn't task themselves with looking for non-local sources.&nbsp; If you want to and can provide evidence that there are no non-local sources, you also need to show how that is a policy/guideline/essay based argument.&nbsp; A point that you've not explored other than by saying that consensus can change, is why does WP:OUTCOMES indicate that "larger" malls are generally kept?&nbsp; [[User:Unscintillating|Unscintillating]] ([[User talk:Unscintillating|talk]]) 22:11, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
