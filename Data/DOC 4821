Non notable minor league baseball player [[User:Spanneraol|Spanneraol]] ([[User talk:Spanneraol|talk]]) 18:39, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per [[WP:NCOLLATH]]. Negrych won All-American status as a college baseball player twice.--[[User:Namiba|TM]] 10:31, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' Not notable. Being an All-American in college baseball doesn't mean automatically notable.--[[User:Yankees10|Yankees10]] 18:02, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' There's enough coverage here to pass [[WP:GNG]]. And, [[WP:GNG]] trumps all other WikiProject-specific notability guidelines. [[User:Ejgreen77|Ejgreen77]] ([[User talk:Ejgreen77|talk]]) 01:54, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*:I don't see how it passes GNG. All of the coverage seems to be routine to me.--[[User:Yankees10|Yankees10]] 02:06, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::: ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' ran multiple front-page "hometown-boy-does-good" feature articles about him during the time he spent playing for the Bisons. There's nothing "routine" about that. [[User:Ejgreen77|Ejgreen77]] ([[User talk:Ejgreen77|talk]]) 02:18, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::::I see two there. Hardly "significant" coverage.--[[User:Yankees10|Yankees10]] 02:22, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Seems significant to me.--[[User:Namiba|TM]] 11:33, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::No sorry but two is most certainly not enough to pass GNG.--[[User:Yankees10|Yankees10]] 16:06, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::Per [[WP:GNG]] "There is no fixed number of sources required since sources vary in quality and depth of coverage, but multiple sources are generally expected."  Two is certainly "multiple" sources, so that can certainly be enough to pass GNG.  And even "multiple" sources are not necessarily required, but rather "generally expected," although I agree with you to the extent that in this case that I see no reason to dispense with the general expectation. [[User:Rlendog|Rlendog]] ([[User talk:Rlendog|talk]]) 18:02, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::The bigger problem with the Buffalo News articles is that they are both from the same publisher, and thus essentially only one source. On the other hand, there is some non-trivial coverage from the Pittsburgh newspaper. [[User:Rlendog|Rlendog]] ([[User talk:Rlendog|talk]]) 18:16, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - in addition to the sources discussed above, I found a story by Yahoo! Sports [http://sports.yahoo.com/news/jim-negrych-could-spark-torontos-sleeping-bats-225000930--mlb.html] and two from the Orchard Park Bee [http://www.orchardparkbee.com/news/2010-06-24/Sports/OP_native_Negrych_shines_in_return_to_Buffalo.html] [http://orchardparkbee.our-hometown.com/news/2012-07-19/Sports/Negrych_receives_warm_welcome_at_TripleA_AllStar_G.html].  So I think he has enough to meet GNG. [[User:Rlendog|Rlendog]] ([[User talk:Rlendog|talk]]) 18:45, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''.  Meets GNG per Rlendog and Namiba. --[[User:doncram|<font color="maroon">do</font>]][[User talk:Doncram|<font color="green">ncr</font>]][[Special:Contributions/doncram|<font color="maroon">am</font>]] 03:51, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
