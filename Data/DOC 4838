== Plot ==
Akira, the main character, is trying his best to become the strongest in his high school, not in terms of intelligence but through fighting since this high school revolves around fighting for the top spot instead of education. Even teachers can't resist the fighting and are nearly forced to overlook the violence. Akira wants to dethrone the current No.1 Tsutomu but to get there he has to take on a few more challengers since most of them want to take the spot for themselves.

==Characters==
*Akira ([[Ryota Ozawa]])
*Tsutomu ([[Yasuhiro Kidō]])
