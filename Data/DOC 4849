'''Lorna Shore''' is an American <!-- they are not "blackened deathcore"-->[[deathcore]] band from [[Warren County, New Jersey]]. Formed in 2010, the group currently consists of lead guitarist Adam De Micco, drummer Austin Archey and vocalist CJ McCreery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/LornaShore/status/1011741301082132480|title=IMPORTANT UPDATE pic.twitter.com/mVqYQELCSw|first=Lorna|last=Shore|date=26 June 2018|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref> They have released three [[Extended play|EPs]] and released their debut full-length ''Psalms'' in June 2015 and their second album ''Flesh Coffin'' in February 2017.

During spring of 2018, vocalist and founding member Tom Barber left the band to join deathcore act [[Chelsea Grin]]. The band immediately afterward confirmed that they were not splitting up as a result of Barber’s departure and CJ McCreery (of the Pennsylvania deathcore act Signs of the Swarm) was revealed as his replacement.

== History ==
The band's first EP entitled ''Triumph'', released in 2010, carried a distinct [[metalcore]] sound before leading into the band's progressively heavier style. The band's second EP ''Bone Kingdom'' was the first to carry their current deathcore sound and was released in 2012. ''Maleficium'' (2013), the band's third EP, reached number 3 on the [[iTunes]] Metal Chart and was also released as a [[digipak]] CD making it the first non-digital Lorna Shore release. The band distances and disregards themselves from any releases prior to ''Maleficium'' and considers the EP the "rebirth and true starting point of their career." The band to this day still perform songs from the EP, and it's the earliest material that they will still willingly play live.

Lorna Shore followed the release of ''Maleficium'' by opening the [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex's]] Die Without Hope Tour featuring [[I Declare War (band)|I Declare War]], and [[Here Comes the Kraken]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/carnifex/status/434105405153628160|title=Lorna Shore is now on the DIE WITHOUT HOPE Tour! Fucking heavy! @LornaShore |date=13 February 2014|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref> Since then, before releasing their debut album they have toured with acts such as [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]], [[Archspire]], [[Oceano (band)|Oceano]], [[Fallujah (band)|Fallujah]], [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]], [[Upon a Burning Body]], [[Chelsea Grin]], and [[Within the Ruins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalblade.com/us/news/the-black-dahlia-murder-announce-september-shows/|title=The Black Dahlia Murder announce September shows with Lorna Shore - Metal Blade Records|website=Metalblade.ocm|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/upon_a_burning_body_announce_headlining_tour_with_sylar_and_lorna_shore/|title=Upon A Burning Body announce headlining tour with Sylar and Lorna Shore|date=17 March 2014|website=Altpress.com|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/22565/Within-The-Ruins-Lorna-Shore-tour-dates|title=Within The Ruins, Lorna Shore tour dates|website=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.thecirclepit.com/2015/01/oceano-the-last-ten-seconds-of-life-lorna-shore-boris-the-blade-and-martyr-defiled-tour</ref><ref>https://lambgoat.com/news/comments.aspx?id=23973#0</ref>

''Psalms'', their debut, full-length album was released on June 9 through Density Records. The album was produced by [[Fit for an Autopsy]] guitarist [[Will Putney]] at The Machine Shop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://highwiredaze.com/lornashorenews5 |title=Lorna Shore announce June 9, 2015 release date for debut full-length ''Psalms'' |author=Ken |date=April 23, 2015 |website=Highwiredaze.com |access-date=April 25, 2015}}</ref>

On September 21, 2016, Lorna Shore announced that they had signed with Outerloop Records and would release their sophomore album ''Flesh Coffin'' on February 17, 2017. They released a single entitled ''Denounce The Light'' on November 17, 2016.

In the early goings of 2017, bassist and founding member Gary Herrera announced his departure from the band, citing his lack of desire and passion for the music as his main reasons. Flesh Coffin would subsequently be the last release to include Barber and Herrera the only original members from every release in the catalog thus far.

Vocalist and founding member Tom Barber confirmed that he had left Lorna Shore in April 2018 to join [[Chelsea Grin]] as their vocalist, replacing Alex Koehler, who departed earlier in the year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/80273/news-vocalist-tom-barber-confirms-he-has-left-lorna-shore |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428011951/http://www.deadpress.co.uk/80273/news-vocalist-tom-barber-confirms-he-has-left-lorna-shore |archive-date=2018-04-28 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> Lorna Shore have assured their fanbase that they are going to continue, and CJ McCreery of Signs of the Swarm was eventually confirmed as his replacement after being rumored for some period of time.
