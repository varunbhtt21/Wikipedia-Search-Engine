Title : Marois government
Text : {{more footnotes|date=April 2014}}

The '''Marois Government''' was formed by [[Premier of Quebec|Quebec Premier]] [[Pauline Marois]] and held power from September, 2012 to April, 2014. The administration of the [[Parti Quebecois]] was officially formed on September 19, 2012 after the [[2012 Quebec general election]]. This election brought 54 MNAs to the [[National Assembly of Quebec]]. As these MNAs did not occupy more than half of the seats, the government formed was a minority. The administration was defeated during the [[2014 Quebec general election|
general election on April 7, 2014]].

== Characteristics ==

The first cabinet of Pauline Marois consisted of 24 ministers - including the premier - of which 9 were women and 15 were men. The Chief Whip and the President of the caucus also participate in the Executive Council.

Political analysts in Quebec have, for the most part, identified that the minority government of the Parti Quebecois underwent two important stages. The first year in power was difficult for the party. Certain governmental actions were perceived incoherently by the populace, causing a drop in approval rating. Afterwards, however, the government improved in regards to public acceptance, a trend that began to appear halfway through 2013. The true turning point for Marois was the [[Lac-Mégantic derailment]], in July 2013, which debuted the refocusing of governmental actions.<sup>1</sup>

Political scientist Jean-Herman Guay notes that this change in approach occurred in unison with a swing towards the center of the political spectrum. This alteration was associated with two budgets that controlled spending and raised certain prices. The recovery of the government also ameliorated with the tabling of the [[Charter of Values of Quebec|Charter of Values]]; hereafter, the government began to stand on its own two feet. "[The party] cornered the CAQ, which proposed a compromise, was not prepared for a political debate meant to destabilize the PQ", said political journalist Alec Castonguay in an article published at the beginning of the electoral campaign.<sup>1</sup>
