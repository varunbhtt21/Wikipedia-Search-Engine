Rather new company that just launched in March, maybe in the future if ever this be a good article, but for now it's a AFD. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 19:01, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''': The references show the company founder is one Bruno Duarte; this article was contributed by [[User:Duartebruno]]; I have added a [[:WP:COI]] warning. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 05:55, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': The M2MEvolution and MVNODynamics pieces are the closest to being [[:WP:RS|references]], but are effectively just typical coverage that any start-up needs, not evidence of attained [[:WP:CORPDEPTH|encyclopaedic notability]].
