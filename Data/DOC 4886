So he is a businessman and a CEO-but is it notable enough to have a page? [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 19:05, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' you should check whether at least two sources are to be considered [[WP:RS|reliable]]. They seem to be news websites, but I can't vouch for them. If they're independent news outlets, then [[WP:GNG]] seems to be satisfied. [[User:Qwertyus|Q<small>VVERTYVS</small>]] <small>([[User talk:Qwertyus|hm?]])</small> 12:58, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''', I could if I knew Arabic though. Since I don't understand those pages though. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:08, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::At least one of them has a GTranslate button at the top and for the others you can get a rough translation easily enough; the thing is finding out who runs these websites and what their editorial policy is.

* '''Keep'''. I'm actually really surprised. From the quality of the article here, I didn't expect much, but this guy has racked up a ''lot'' of coverage in the Arabic media and even some in English, not least for his marriage with and [http://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/haifa-wehbe-divorce-454532 divorce from] superstar [[Haifa Wehbe]]. In more staid news, he and his company have recently been covered by [http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/28/us-meast-investment-egyptiansteel-idUSBRE99Q05C20131028 Reuters] and [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/naturalresources/article3975049.ece The Times].—[[User:Neil P.
