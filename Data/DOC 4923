'''Samuel Smith''' (ca. 1646 – ca. 1735) was an early [[settler]] of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Connecticut]]. He was a deputy of the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[Connecticut Colony|Colony of Connecticut]] from [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] in the May 1691 session.

Due to the commonality of the name, and conflicting records, it is difficult to determine the exact origins of Samuel Smith. He was, perhaps, the son of Captain William Smith, a magistrate in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. He moved to Norwalk as a young man, and he listed among its earliest settlers.<ref name="hr">Norwalk, Fairfield County, Connecticut: Historical Records, 1847.</ref> His father-in-law, [[Matthew Marvin, Sr.]] gave Smith half of his home lot and orchard. <ref name="hr"/>

In 1672, he owned "a parcel of land in Indian Field," not far from the Norwalk-Westport boundary. 

He was named a [[Freeman (Colonial)|freeman]] in 1674. In 1679, he served as town treasurer. He was on a committee, along with [[Matthew Marvin, Sr.]], and [[John Bowton]] to obtain a minister for the settlement, which appointed Reverend [[Thomas Hanford]]. He served as a deputy of the Connecticut General Court in 1691. He was a townsman in 1698, 1702, 1706, and 1712. In 1702, he was selectman.

In 1680 or 1681 he owned a home-lot of four acres adjacent to Strawberry Hill.
