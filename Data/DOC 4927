'''''What's My Name?''''' was a 30-minute radio program in the United States. The program was hosted by [[Arlene Francis]] and was among the first radio shows to offer cash prizes to contestants.<ref>Reinehr, Robert C. and Swartz, Jon D. (2008).

==Format==
Contestants on ''What's My Name?'' had to identify a person from a maximum of 10 clues given by the show's two hosts. People to be identified were celebrities and historical characters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Radio Note|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19380325&id=1LU0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=qmkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=803,6809293|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Lewiston Evening Journal|date=March 25, 1938}}</ref>  In the show's early days, a correct guess on the first clue earned the contestant $10; the amount earned dropped by $1 with each additional clue. In 1948, the top prize was increased to $100, with $50 and $25 prizes, respectively, for identification on the second and third clues.<ref name="dunningota">Dunning, John. (1998).

The program also involved listener participation to some extent, as listeners could send in questions to be used on the air.<ref name="miaminews">{{cite news|last=McLean|first=James|title=On The Air Waves|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19390705&id=hQotAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4tcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6152,5833868|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=The Miami News|date=July 5, 1939}}</ref> People who submitted questions received $10 for each question used.<ref name="tvrm">{{cite journal|title=Friday's Highlights|journal=Radio and Television Mirror|date=August 1940|volume=14|issue=4|page=50|url=https://archive.org/stream/radiotelevision00macf#page/n335/mode/1up|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>

A review of the first episode of ''What's My Name?'' offered little hope for its future, calling it "a rather drab show." The reviewer explained: "The program got off to a bad start in that the participants, for the most part, were unable to guess the identities of the characters asked for in the game until long after the listeners got the drift of the proceedings." The reviewer did, however, note that the show was "ably conducted by Bud Hulick and Arlene Francis."<ref>{{cite news|last=Banner|title=New Shows On the Air: "What's My Name?"|url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturedai43unse#page/n659/mode/1up|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Motion Picture Daily|date=March 28, 1938}}</ref>

Francis was a constant on ''What's My Name?'', serving as the hostess in all eight of its iterations on radio while her male counterparts changed. Hulick was the host in three versions. Other hosts over the years were Fred Uttal, [[John Reed King]], Ward Wilson and Carl Frank.<ref name=dunningota/> Harry Salter and his orchestra provided the music.<ref name="grunwald">Grunwald, Edgar A., Ed.

One source noted that ''What's My Name?'' "helped make a broadcasting fixture out of Arlene Francis."<ref>{{cite web|title=14 April: Up and down with The Aldrich Family|url=http://kallmansalley.com/2014/04/14/14-april-up-and-down-with-the-aldrich-family/|work=Kallman's Alley|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

A 1942 review gave ''What's My Name?'' a much better evaluation than the earlier review mentioned above. Paul Ackerman wrote in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]'', "''Name'' is well produced, moves quickly and manages to maintain an informal atmosphere directly traceable to Miss Francis's and Mr. King's manner with the contestants."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Paul|title=Program Reviews: "What's My Name?"|journal=The Billboard|date=January 17, 1942|volume=54|issue=3|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwwEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&rview=1&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

==Background==
''What's My Name?'' was the brainchild of radio writers Joe Cross and Ed Byron. An August 1940 magazine article related that, after listening to a program called ''[[Professor Quiz]]'', "the two of them shut themselves up in a hotel room, vowing they wouldn't come out until they'd thought up a game program that was as much fun as ''Professor Quiz''. ''What's My Name?'' was the result." <ref name=tvrm/>

==Television==

A version of ''What's My Name?'' was incorporated into the ''Paul Winchell-Jerry Mahoney Show'' on television. The program (originally titled ''The [[Speidel]] Show'' after its sponsor) ran from September 18, 1950 to May 23, 1954. In the show's early years, each episode began with a comedy skit featuring Winchell and Mahoney. That skit was followed by a quiz segment, ''What's My Name?'', similar to the radio program.<ref name="brooks">Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle (1979). ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows: 1946-Present''. Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|0-345-25525-9}}. P. 480-481.</ref> The host for the quiz was Ted Brown.<ref>McNeil, Alex (1996). ''Total Television''. Penguin Books USA, Inc. {{ISBN|0-14-02-4916-8}}. P. 647.</ref>

The TV version of the quiz failed to achieve the success of its radio predecessor. A review in ''The Billboard'' in August 1951 said: <blockquote>Speidel has tried hard all season to combine the very accomplished Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney team and the former ''What's My Name?'' format into a successful stanza. The attempt has failed and, if anything, the talents of the ventriloquist and his little pal have been blunted by misuse."<ref>{{cite news|last=Morse|first=Leon|title=Paul Winchell-Jerry Mahoney Show|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OR8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=%22What%27s+My+Name?%22+Arlene+OR+Francis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I6VZU_LZKKba2AXKn4CoCw&ved=0CHwQ6AEwETgU#v=onepage&q=%22What's%20My%20Name%3F%22%20Arlene%20OR%20Francis&f=false|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=The Billboard|date=March 17, 1951}}</ref></blockquote>

By 1953, the ''What's My Name?'' component  of the ''Paul Winchell-Jerry Mahoney Show'' had been removed.<ref name=brooks/>
