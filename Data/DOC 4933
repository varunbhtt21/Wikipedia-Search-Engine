The result was  '''Speedy delete'''. In view of the several hoax and joke articles created by [[User:This is not my last name]], who I've blocked, I have deleted this as vandalism (G3). No prejudice to re-creation if it can be shown to be notable. &nbsp;—[[User:Smalljim|S<small>MALL</small>]][[User talk:Smalljim#top|<small>JIM</small>]]&nbsp; 13:05, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

Cartozoology is a fictitious field (finding animal shapes in street layouts), coined in the satire/humor publication  [http://www.improbable.com/2010/06/30/cartozoology/ Improbable Research]. The joke has been covered and repeated around the web, but it should never be construed as a legitimate field.

*If it were a [[WP:N|notable]] joke it could still have an article.  But in the absence of evidence for that then '''Delete'''.

*'''Delete'''. Essentially [[WP:MADEUP]], the sites that have picked this up word for word icluding the smoking-gun pretentious use of "paradigmatically " do not establish real notability.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 23:55, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*<b>Proposed speedy delete</b> per [[WP:G12]]. The article is an exact match of [http://www.kartozoologi.no/English/Friends.html the text at the top of this page]. [[WP:COPYPASTE]] states that if a website has no mention of copyright status (such as is the case here), the website is assumed to be copyrighted. However, I would like TheLongTone to explain his concerns about copyright first, as there must have been some reason why the article was not speedily deleted immediately.

::There were so many hits including the exact text that I could not be bothered to track it down to it's original source & see what the copyright status was.  There seemed to be ample grounds for deletion on other grounds.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 11:39, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
