=== Attitude towards gay people ===
In a radio interview on 6 August 2014 Ibrahim Sverrir answered questions on the status of gay people within Islam. Ibrahim Sverrir said that those that are for gay marriages could never rally support among Muslims in Iceland. From his perspective, the question was whether gay people could adjust to Islam.
