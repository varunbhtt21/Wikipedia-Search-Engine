'''John Bell Young''' (July 8, 1953, [[New York City]] - April 2017, [[Brattleboro, Vermont]]<ref name="sister">{{cite web|title=John Bell Young's death certificate and statement from his sister|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/353291673/John-Bell-Young-Obituary|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>) was an American [[concert pianist]], [[music critic]] and [[author]], best known for his performances and recordings of the music of the Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].

==Early years, education and training==
Young spent his childhood on the north shore of Long Island.<ref name="JBY">{{cite web|title=John Bell Young|url=http://johnbellyoung.com/frame-short-biography.html|website=johnbellyoung.com|publisher=johnbellyoung|accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref> His mother was a librarian, and his father, a native American Cherokee, was an amateur pianist and inventor.<ref name="JBY"/><ref name="fanfare">{{cite web|title=John Bell Young|url=http://www.fanfaremag.com/content/view/59920/10233/| publisher=Fanfare Magazine|accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref> As a child, his first piano teachers were Miriam Freundlich, whose brother-in-law Irwin was chair of the piano division at Juilliard, and later Kyriena Siloti, the daughter of  Russian pianist [[Alexander Siloti]].<ref name="JBY"/>

Following his graduation from Putney, Young continued his studies at the [[Oberlin College Conservatory of Music]] studying music, Russian, and philosophy.<ref name="JBY"/>  He attended [[Bennington College]] studying philosophy, French and Russian literature, and semiotics, and the [[Mannes College of Music]] where he was a student of [[Bruce Hungerford]].<ref name="fanfare"/>

== Musical career ==

Best known for his performances and recordings of the music of [[Alexander Scriabin]],<ref>{{cite book|last=McIntire|first=David|title=Classical Music: Third Ear -- The Essential Listening Companion|publisher=Backbeat Books}}</ref> Young performed frequently throughout [[Russia]] and the Baltics. Endorsed by Scriabin's daughters, Marina Scriabine<ref>{{cite web|last=Scriabine|first=Marina|url=http://www.johnbellyoung.com/frame-reviews.html|title=Marina Scriabine's endorsement of John Bell Young}}</ref> and Yelena Scriabina Sofronitsky, he was also a consultant to the first Scriabin International Piano Competition in [[Moscow]] in 1995, where a special prize was awarded in his name. Young first came to prominence in 1990 with his critically acclaimed recordings, on the [[Newport Classic]] label, of the little known musical compositions of the controversial 19th century German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], which were the first commercially issued discs of his piano and chamber music.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ravetz|first=Elliot|title=The Melodies of Nietzsche|journal=Time (USA)|date=April 24, 1995|volume=145|issue=17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kosman|first=Joshua|title=Composer Nietzsche|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle (USA)|date=August 16, 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=That 'New' Composer, Nietzsche|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/07/arts/classical-view-that-new-composer-nietzsche.html|newspaper=New York Times (USA)|date=June 7, 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Schonstein|first=Jurgen|title=Die spate Karriere des Komponisten Friedrich Nietzsche|journal=Hamburger Abendblatt|volume=38|pages=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Girardi|first=Maria|title=Friedrich Nietzsche Piano Music|journal=Nuova Rivista Musicale Italiana (Italy)|date=September 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Steve|title=The Philosopher as Composer|journal=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 2, 1993|volume=CCXX1|issue=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bauman|first=Carl|title=Nietzsche: A Sylvester Night|journal=The American Record Guide (USA)|date=July 1994|volume=57|issue=4}}</ref> [[Sony Classical]] has since acquired these recordings for eventual re-release.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bauman|first=Carl|date=1999|journal=The American Record Guide (USA)}}</ref>  In 1992 he performed Nietzsche's music in [[Russia]], thus ending a nearly 75-year ban of the philosopher's work. He was widely regarded as a champion of rarely performed repertoire by underrated composers, several of whom were amateurs who became famous in professions outside of music.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Madison|first=William|title=The Will to Music|journal=Lingua Franca (USA)|date=April 1992|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Miklowitz|first=Paul S.|title=Also Sang Zarathustra|journal=Piano Quarterly (USA)|date=Summer 1992|issue=158|pages=43–44+46–48}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kleiner|first=Carolyn|title=New Orchestral Maneuvers win Fans|journal=US World and News Report (USA)|date=2000|volume=129|issue=10|page=87}}</ref>

In 2001, in collaboration with the British actor [[Michael York]], he recorded ''[[Enoch Arden (Strauss)|Enoch Arden]]'', a melodrama for narrator and piano by [[Richard Strauss]], set to the narrative poem of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Power Helps A Classic Set Sail|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/10/27/Floridian/Star_power_helps_a_cl.shtml|website=sptimes.com|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref>

== Writing career and later life==
Young was a critic for a number of leading newspapers and magazines, including: the ''St. Petersburg Times'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Judging the Competition|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/062401/news_pf/Floridian/Judging_the_competiti.shtml|website=sptimes.com|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> ''The [[American Record Guide]]'', the ''Brattleboro Reformer'', ''Music and Vision'', ''Clavier'', ''Piano'', and ''Opera News''.

Following a stroke in 2013, Young retired from the concert stage, no longer able to play. He continued to produce recordings for other artists as well as to endorse and advise young aspiring artists about their careers through his group Artistic Spirits Productions.<ref name="Artistic">{{cite web|title=Artistic Spirits Productions|url=http://artisticspiritsproductions.com/|website=artisticspiritsproductions.com|publisher=Artistic Spirits Recording Production Services|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>  Young suffered from mental illness and emotional problems in his later years, which caused him to become infamous in musicians' circles for his online bullying and threats.

Young died in April 2017.<ref>{{cite web | title=John Bell Young | url=http://www.mvdaily.com/articles/y/j/john-bell-young.htm | website=MV Daily | accessdate=2019-04-18}}</ref>.  He was pronounced dead on April 8, but indications are that he died some time before then, as he lived alone. By the time he died, he was insolvent and intestate.<ref name="sister"/>
