Title : Milo-Grogan
Text : '''Milo-Grogan''' is a neighborhood of [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The neighborhood was settled as the separate communities of Milo and Grogan in the late 1870s. Large-scale [[Industrial development|Industrial Development]] fueled the neighborhood's growth until the 1980s, when the last factories closed. The community has received [[Urban renewal|urban revitalization]] efforts in recent years fueled by the Columbus Department of Development and Milo-Grogan Area Commission.

== History ==

=== Prior to 1900 ===

Separate communities of Milo and Grogan were established by Jonathon Fallis Linton, one of Columbus's largest land [[broker]]<nowiki/>s, just before the turn of the twentieth century. “Milo” originates from a man named Milo Streets who owned a [[brickyard]] at the corner of St. Clair and Third Avenue. “Grogan” derives from John Patrick Grogan who opened a grocery store and post office on Cleveland Avenue. Milo stretched from First Avenue along Cleveland Avenue and west to the railroad tracks. Grogan was east of Milo and extended to eleventh Avenue on both sides of Cleveland Avenue.<ref name=thirtynine>{{cite book|last=Dunham|first=Tom|title=Columbus's Industrial Communities: Olentangy, Milo-Grogan, Steelton|date=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4520-5970-9|page=39}}</ref>  The boundaries of Milo and Grogan were never clear, so identifying the area as “Milo-Grogan” became popular. The unification of Milo-Grogan was further promoted by Cleveland Avenue which was shared by the communities and used as a business strip.<ref name=development>{{cite web|last=Department of Development|title=Milo-Grogan Neighborhood Plan|url=http://assets.columbus.gov/development/planning/MiloGroganPlan.pdf|publisher=City of Columbus|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}</ref>

Milo-Grogan developed in response to [[Factory|factories]] that settled in the late nineteenth century. [[Kilbourne and Jacobs Manufacturing Co.]], a [[wheelbarrow]] company, was the first to move into the area. The factory opened a plant half a mile northeast from [[Union Station (Columbus, Ohio)|Union Station]] on the west side of [[Union Station (Columbus, Ohio)#Railroads in the order they entered Union Station|the railroad tracks]]. In 1880, the [[Berry Brothers Bolt Works]] established a factory just north of Kilbourne and Jacobs and later built a second, smaller factory next to the original. The [[Jeffrey Manufacturing Company]] also moved into the area around the same time and built a massive industrial factory along the northbound rail line. Jeffery Manufacturing eventually took over most of the area from First Avenue to [[Lincoln Village, Ohio|Lincoln]] towards Second Avenue and Fourth Street.<ref name=thirtynine /> [[Timken Company]], Columbus Dye, and the Columbus Transit Company were other companies that were located in the Milo-Grogan area.<ref name=development />

=== After 1900 ===

The Jeffery Manufacturing Company flourished in Milo-Grogan and provided many services for its employees. J.A. Jeffery, owner of Jeffery Manufacturing, established one of the earliest industrial infirmaries in 1889 and a cooperative store in 1904 in the factory block.<ref name="Dunham 2010 37">{{cite book|last=Dunham|first=Tom|title=Columbus's Industrial Communities: Olentangy, Milo-Grogan, Steelton|date=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4520-5970-9|page=37}}</ref> In 1912, Jeffery also set up an employee cafeteria and a Building and Loan Association that helped financially assist its employees in building their homes. The employee population was quickly growing in Milo- Grogan and Columbus could not keep up with its police force, water, electricity, and fire services, causing an annexation from the city.<ref name=development />

The Jeffery Manufacturing Company steadily grew until 1940. In 1904, Jeffery purchased the Ohio Malleable Iron Company to ensure a reliable supply of iron for the production of their barrows and hand trucks. Ohio Malleable was located along the same railroad track as Jeffery a few blocks north of First Avenue. In 1926, Jeffery purchased a British company called the Diamond Coal Cutter Company, which was renamed the British Jeffery Diamond Limited.<ref name="Dunham 2010 37"/> A couple years later, J.A. Jeffery retired and president of the company, Robert Gillespie stepped up. His first action as the figurehead was to invest two million dollars into the purchase of [[Galion Iron Works]], a manufacturer of [[road roller]]<nowiki/>s and [[grader]]<nowiki/>s for sale to local and state governments. Jeffery Manufacturing survived the [[Great Depression]] and company prosperity continued into the immediate post war years. However, a new company called Jay Manufacturing moved into [[central Ohio]] and began challenging Jeffery Manufacturing. Jeffery began to fail when the company neglected to replace its underground coal hauler with the new rubber tired hauler, an innovation that would save the company time and money because the rubber tires did not require built tracks as mine shafts were extended. As the Jeffery main branch began to fail, its subsidiaries excelled and kept the company afloat.<ref name=thirtynine /> In 1961, Jeffery Manufacturing completely merged with the British Galion Company, creating the new corporate name of Jeffery Galion, Inc.

The factories of Milo-Grogan were very successful and its employee-based neighborhoods were large, but the introduction of the [[Interstate 71]] corridor caused a strain on the neighborhood. The interstate split the area nearly in half and several homes and businesses were demolished in the process. Layoffs were frequent after the demolition of many Milo-Grogan factories. Decreased housing availability due to I-71 construction caused the population to fall from 3850 to 3000 from 1970-1980. Many of the remaining families moved out of the Milo-Grogan area and into the nicer homes of the suburbs. Over 400 homes and businesses were lost to the completion of the freeway by 1964.<ref name=development />

== Geography ==
The Milo-Grogan community area is defined by the rail corridor to the north, east, and west, and [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] to the south. For some purposes, Milo-Grogan's community area is often expanded to include a small community just northwest bounded by Eleventh Avenue to the north, Interstate 71 to the east, and a rail corridor to the south and west. Historically, Milo-Grogan was the separate communities of Milo and Grogan. Milo was located on the west side of present-day Milo-Grogan, while Grogan was located on its east side. Milo-Grogan is directly north of Downtown Columbus. It is bordered by [[Italian Village]] and [[Weinland Park]] to the west, The Fairgrounds and South Linden to the north, and Amercrest and [[Neighborhoods in Columbus, Ohio#Devon Triangle|The Devon Triangle]] to the east.

== Milo-Grogan Area Commission ==
The Milo-Grogan Area Commission serves the area as the community link to the city of Columbus. It holds monthly meetings that present information about topics that directly affect the Milo-Grogan Neighborhood, including information related to neighborhood redevelopment. The Milo-Grogan Area Commission, in partnership with the city of Columbus, also published the Milo-Grogan 2007 Neighborhood Plan, which established goals for the community for the next 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milo-Grogan AC- Chair|url=http://columbus.gov/Templates/Detail.aspx?id=29912|publisher=The City of Columbus Department of Development|accessdate=20 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010406/http://columbus.gov/Templates/Detail.aspx?id=29912|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=}}</ref>
