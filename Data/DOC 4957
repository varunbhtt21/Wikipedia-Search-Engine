==History==
After the [[Qing dynasty]] conquest of the [[Dzungar Khanate]] in 1755, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] established the city of Dihua (Ürümqi) in [[Dzungaria]]. Outside the city walls, a lake on the former course of the [[Ürümqi River]] was made into a recreational area for Qing officials. Several years later, the [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] official Wumi Tai ([[:zh:伍彌泰|伍彌泰]]) built the Xiuye Pavilion ({{lang|zh-hans|秀野亭}}), the first structure in the area, which became a major attraction in Dihua. The lake was later called Guan Lake ({{lang|zh-hans|关湖}}).<ref name=elong>{{cite web |script-title=zh:乌鲁木齐人民公园简介 |trans-title=Introduction to People's Park, Ürümqi |url=http://trip.elong.com/wulumuqirenmingongyuan/jianjie/ |publisher=Elong |accessdate=26 April 2014 |language=Chinese}}</ref>

After [[Tajik people|Tajik]] adventurer [[Yakub Beg]]'s brief rule in Dzungaria, Qing general [[Zuo Zongtang]] successfully [[Qing reconquest of Xinjiang|reconquered the area]] in 1878, and the Qing court established the new province of Xinjiang in 1884.<ref name=elong/> To demonstrate its goodwill, the provincial government built a [[Dragon King]] Temple on the lake.<ref name=gaubatz>{{cite book |last=Gaubatz |first=Piper Rae |title=Beyond the Great Wall: Urban Form and Transformation on the Chinese Frontiers |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-2399-2 |page=268 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&pg=PA268}}</ref> [[Liu Jintang]] ([[:zh:刘锦棠|刘锦棠]]), the first governor of Xinjiang, made improvements to the lake area, and renamed the lake Jian Hu ({{lang|zh-hans|鉴湖}}, Mirror Lake).<ref name=elong/> In 1898, minister [[Zhang Yinhuan]] ([[:zh:張蔭桓|張蔭桓]]) was exiled to Xinjiang for supporting the failed [[Hundred Days' Reform]] movement. Zhang donated funds to build a pavilion in the middle of Jian Hu, which still stands today.<ref name=elong/>

In 1912, [[Yang Zengxin]] was appointed governor of Xinjiang by the newly established [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. Yang converted Jian Hu into a public park, which was variously called '''Jianhu Park''', '''West Lake Park''', or '''West Park'''. It was later renamed '''Dihua Park''' and then '''Zhongshan Park''', in honour of President [[Sun Yat-sen]] (Zhongshan).<ref name=elong/>

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] government closed the Dragon King Temple and converted it to a cultural palace. The temple buildings have been preserved, including an elaborate front gate that commemorates Zhang Jingchou, a Qing-era scholar and poet.<ref name=gaubatz/> The park was renamed as People's Park.<ref name=elong/>

==Features==
In 1953, the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Museum]] was established in People's Park. The museum was later moved to Xibei Road.<ref name="LiLuo2011">{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Xianyao|last2=Luo|first2=Zhewen|title=China's Museums|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O7LE3XfgDOsC&pg=PA50|date=3 March 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18690-2|page=50}}</ref>
