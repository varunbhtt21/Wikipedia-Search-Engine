If an advocate wants to practice as an advocate-on-record in the Supreme Court he or she needs an additional qualification. The advocate has to practice for 4 years as an advocate and thereafter has to intimate to the Supreme Court that he or she has started taking training with a Senior Advocate on record because he or she intends to become an Advocate-on-record. After the expiry of one year's training, the advocate has to appear for an examination conducted by the Supreme Court itself. After an advocate passes this examination he or she must have a registered office within a radius of 10 miles from the Supreme Court building and a registered clerk. It is after this that the Chamber Judge of the Supreme Court accepts him as an advocate-on-record.<ref name=scaoura-aboutus /><ref name="Delhi HC" />
