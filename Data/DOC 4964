Title : Muskrat French
Text : The '''Muskrat French''' (also known as the '''Detroit River French Canadians''') are an ethnic group and language found along the [[Detroit River]] and around [[Lake St. Clair]] in [[southeastern Michigan]] and [[southwestern Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Au|first=Dennis|title=The Mushrat French: The Survival of French Canadian Folklife on the American Side of le Détroit|url=https://hrgpapers.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/HRG/article/viewFile/355/307}}</ref>  Like many [[Franco-Ontarian]]s, this group is characterized by a common history as descendants of the area's earliest European [[habitants]], [[voyageurs]], and [[coureurs des bois]] who settled in the [[Pays d'en Haut]], often forming relationships with local Indigenous women. Their name comes from their tradition of eating [[muskrat]] during [[Lent]] due to a special dispensation by the [[bishop]].

==History==
{{see also|History of Michigan|Pays d'en Haut}}
In the context of the [[North American fur trade]], French traders and settlers established vast networks of trading posts for [[Indian trade|trade with the Native Americans]]. Many [[voyageurs]] and [[coureurs des bois]] entered into formal or informal unions with Native women, fathering a large population of [[Métis]] across many parts of [[New France]]. Most of New France is now part of the United States.

{{see also|Franco-Ontarian}}
Contemporary expressions of the Muskrat French culture and community can be found both within the "Muskrat French" population, a subculture that is not widely known beyond the region or outside of its members, and within the broader community of Detroit residents who draw on local history for events. Within the general community, the Marche du [[Nain Rouge]], an annual early Spring festival draws on the early Detroit folkstory of the Nain Rouge (Red Dwarf) to "expiate" bad influences from the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marchedunainrouge.com/|website=Marche du Nain Rouge|accessdate=4 September 2015|title=Marchedunainrouge}}</ref> A local historical society, the Detroit Drunken Historical Society, used the collection of folklore ''Legends of le Détroit'' to create a community event celebrating Detroit's birthday in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrate the Motor City's 314th with the Detroit Drunken Historical Society|url=http://detroit.curbed.com/archives/2015/07/detroits-birthday-at-jam-handy.php|website=Curbed|accessdate=4 September 2015|date=2015-07-24}}</ref> In the community of French Canadians, annual dinners featuring muskrat are held around Detroit, Monroe, and Windsor, continuing a tradition stretching back to the earliest days of settlement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Naveaux|first1=Ralph|title=Remnants of Mushrat French Cuisine in Monroe County Michigan|url=http://cooks.aadl.org/files/cooks/repast/2004_Winter.pdf|journal=Repast|date=Spring 2007|volume=XXIII|issue=2|pages=3–6}}</ref> In Monroe, Michigan the folklore figure [[loup-garou|Loup Garou]] has been featured in events for children sponsored by the Monroe County Museum at the early French site, the Navarre Trading Post.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calendar of Events|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Hunt+for+Loup+Garou&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=Hunt+for+Loup+Garou+Monroe|website=Monroe County|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref>  Monroe, Michigan community organizations have long featured a muskrat as mascot, highlighting the local Muskrat French culture and its prominence in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Major Muskrat Youth Programs|url=http://www.battlefieldfoundation.com/about/how-you-can-help/major-muskrat-youth-programs/index.html|website=River Raisin National Battlefield Park Foundation|publisher=River Raisin National Battlefield Park Foundation|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref>

While the Muskrat French culture is associated mostly with the Detroit River region, [[Indian trade|Indian]] [[fur trade]] culture, in which many Muskrat French families originate, was widespread in the Great Lakes. Families associated with the Fur Trade were part of kinship networks that often had members in towns throughout the region, such as in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Cahokia]], [[Kaskaskia]], St. Ignace, and [[Michilimackinac]] as well as Detroit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sleeper-Smith|first1=Susan|title=Indian Women and French Men|date=2001|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=978-1-55849-310-0|pages=3–5}}</ref> Some scholars use the term Muskrat French to refer to the widespread articulation of French Canadian and French Métis cultures as expressed in the Great Lakes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=LaForest|first1=James|title="Muskrat French": Origins of a Culture, a Language, and a People|journal=Michigan Historical Review|date=Fall 2014|volume=40|issue=2|pages=98–99}}</ref> French Canadian culture in other parts of the Great Lakes is often undifferentiated from the Muskrat French culture, tapping similarly into folklore, cuisine, rural culture, and hunting for popular events. For example, in [[St. Ignace, Michigan]], the local community draws on a different traditional food, glissants, to bring together the local French Canadian community.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stuit|first1=Martha|title="Yooper Deer Camp" is the Theme of Glissant Cook-off, Cabin-Fever Relieve, Feb. 8|url=http://www.stignacenews.com/news/2014-02-06/News/Yooper_Deer_Camp_Is_Theme_of_Glissant_Cook_Off_Cab.html|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=St. Ignace News|publisher=St. Ignace News|date=2 February 2014}}</ref>

Beginning in 2013, cultural advocates successfully sought resolutions from the State of Michigan Legislature naming the last week in September French Canadian Heritage Week in Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Senate Resolution 0182 (2014)|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28wyiudajsx0fssaqthnyqzwcq%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=2014-SR-0182&query=on|website=Michigan Legislature|publisher=State of Michigan|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=House Resolution 0173 (2013)|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%2851ozyafoorhfffrq2vu5vf2o%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=2013-HR-0173|website=Michigan Legislature|publisher=State of Michigan|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> Promoted by volunteer advocates around the state, the heritage week is an example of the continuity of French Canadian culture in the Great Lakes region, particularly in Michigan where events in 2015 were scheduled from Houghton to Monroe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan French Canadian Heritage Week Schedule of Events|url=https://voyageurheritage.wordpress.com/2015/08/28/michigan-french-canadian-heritage-week-schedule-of-events/|website=Voyageur Heritage|publisher=James LaForest|accessdate=4 September 2015|date=2015-08-28}}</ref> The House and Senate Resolutions were submitted by Representatives [[Bill LaVoy]], [[Andrea LaFontaine]], and Senator [[Jim Marleau]] along with a coalition of several dozen co-sponsors.

French-Canadian cultural advocacy is exemplified by a loose collective of volunteers whose work is published in the community journal Voyageur Heritage, an online publication that began in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voyageur Heritage: Community Journal and Resource Guide|url=https://voyageurheritage.wordpress.com/|website=Voyageur Heritage: Community Journal and Resource Guide|publisher=James LaForest|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> This journal contains folklore, traditions, recipes, and an array of articles on art, the environment, language, and history. "The Storykeepers Project" contained within Voyageur Heritage is a collection of family stories and first-hand accounts of French Canadian and French Métis culture rooted in Detroit and the rest of the Great Lakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Storykeepers Project|url=https://voyageurheritage.wordpress.com/storykeepers-your-voices/|website=Voyageur Heritage: Community Journal and Resource Guide|publisher=James LaForest|accessdate=4 September 2015|date=2013-06-28}}</ref>

Not all people of French-Canadian heritage in the Detroit River region identify with this regional subculture and may identify as simply French Canadian or French.<ref>{{cite news|last1=William|first1=Loomis|title=Descendants track their French connections back to Detroit's birth|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130929/METRO08/309290004|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=The Detroit News|agency=Gannett|publisher=Michigan Media Solutions|date=23 September 2013}}</ref> Muskrat French people might describe themselves or legitimately identify as French Canadian, French, French Métis, "Part Indian" and [[Métis]]. The genealogies of many descendants of French settlers of Detroit and the Great Lakes region include Indigenous peoples. The community organization Voyageur Métis founded in Canada in 2013 underscores the Muskrat French community's roots in both [[French Canadian]] and Indigenous cultures, emanating from the cultural métissage that was a hallmark of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voyageur Metis|url=http://www.voyageurmetis.org/|website=Voyageur Metis|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref>
