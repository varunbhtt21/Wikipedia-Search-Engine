'''[[Sigi Schmid]]''' (born 1953) is a German-American [[Manager (association football)|soccer coach]].  Born in [[Tübingen]], West Germany, he moved to the United States with his family when he was a child. He played college soccer as a [[midfielder]] from 1972 to 1975 at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]&nbsp;(UCLA). He coached his former college team between 1980 and 1999 and became one of the most successful collegiate coaches of all time. The [[UCLA Bruins]] made 16 consecutive playoff appearances from 1983 to 1998, winning the [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|national championship]] in 1985, 1990, and 1997. Schmid also worked with [[United States Soccer Federation|US Soccer]] throughout the 1990s. Schmid has coached the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and the [[Columbus Crew]] in [[Major League Soccer]]&nbsp;(MLS). He became the head coach of [[Seattle Sounders FC]] in 2009. Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded in the press, although their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract. Despite never having played soccer at a professional level, he has the most coaching wins in MLS history, and was the recipient of the [[MLS Coach of the Year Award]] in 1999 and 2008. {{TFAFULL|Sigi Schmid}}
