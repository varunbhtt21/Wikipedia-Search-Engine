'''[[Millennium Force]]''' is a [[steel roller coaster]] at [[Cedar Point]] amusement park in [[Sandusky, Ohio]], United States. Completed in 2000, it has broken and helped to break ten world records. It was also the first [[Roller coaster#By height|Giga Coaster]] (any complete circuit roller coaster that exceeds {{convert|300|ft|m}} in height) in the world. It was briefly the [[List of roller coaster rankings#Tallest steel roller coasters|tallest]] and [[List of roller coaster rankings#Fastest steel roller coasters|fastest]] complete circuit roller coaster in the world, before being surpassed by [[Steel Dragon 2000]] in August 2000. The ride is also the second-longest roller coaster in North America after [[The Beast (roller coaster)|The Beast]] at [[Kings Island]], and was the first roller coaster to use a [[Lift hill|cable lift]] system, rather than a traditional chain lift. The coaster has a {{convert|310|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 45 degree inclined lift hill with a {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} drop, and features two tunnels, three [[Roller coaster elements#Overbanked turn|overbanked turns]], and four hills. It has a top speed of about {{convert|93|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Since 2001, Millennium Force has been voted the number one steel roller coaster in the world eight times in [[Amusement Today|''Amusement Today'']]'s [[Amusement Today#Golden Ticket Awards|Golden Ticket Awards]], and has never been ranked lower than number two. Although it is no longer the tallest or fastest roller coaster at Cedar Point, it is still one of the tallest and fastest in the world. {{TFAFULL|Millennium Force}}
