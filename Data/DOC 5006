Doubtful notability.  POV article created by an editor blocked for POV editing [[User:John from Idegon|John from Idegon]] ([[User talk:John from Idegon|talk]]) 19:55, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Comment'''. Most of the "references" cited do not appear to even mention the subject of the article; they only appear to be tangentially related. No !vote yet, but this might actually be a [[WP:COATRACK]] on the hunting of marine species. --<font face="Book Antiqua">[[User:Kinu|<font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font>]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Kinu|<font color="red">''t''</font>]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Kinu|<font color="red">''c''</font>]]</sub></font> 20:01, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Fixable''' This is a copy of the program site, which is Public Domain as a US government site. But it still was written in the promotional manner of any web site for any program or organization. I think it can be rewritten, and the program is sufficiently notable for the purpose. As its resultsare used in enforcement, there should be sources.

*'''Merge''' into [[Marine forensics]]. Maybe it can be fixed (although I can find little aside from the program's own home page), but a merged article would cover the subject better. NOAA has two forensics programs, the other being in the [http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/cb/genetics/forensics.cfm Northwest Fisheries Science Center], and much that can be said of one can be said of both. At the same time, [[Marine forensics]] is in poor shape and the material from this page would help a lot.
