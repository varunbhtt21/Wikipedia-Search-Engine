==Early Life & College Years==

Woods was born in [[Rock Hill, Missouri|Rock Hill]], [[Missouri]], a suburb of [[St. Louis]]. She explored many different career options as an adolescent but ultimately decided to study education and subsequently enrolled at [[Howard University]] in pursuit of that goal. However, Woods discovered during her time teaching in Missouri and in [[Jamaica]] that education was not her true passion<ref>{{cite web|last=Franks-Hunt|first=Aprille|title=Motherhood, Success, Balance & Getting Fired - Aprille interviews Nikki Woods|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8YMJ22xcBc|publisher=Real Life Matters with Aprille|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> and returned home to Rock Hill to weigh other professional options.

While back home in Missouri, Nikki began to pay more attention to how people earned their livings and which of those career fields overlapped with her strengths. This period of introspection coincided with Nikki’s increased exposure to [[KSLZ|Magic 108]] in St. Louis and sparked her interest in the world of [[broadcast journalism]]; Woods was fascinated by the opportunity [[Disc jockey|Disc Jockeys]] had to regularly speak to so many people on such an intimate level.<ref>{{cite web|last=Franks-Hunt|first=Aprille|title=Motherhood, Success, Balance & Getting Fired - Aprille interviews Nikki Woods|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8YMJ22xcBc|publisher=Real Life Matters with Aprille|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> This newfound interest sent Nikki back to school, this time at [[St. Francis University]] in [[Joliet, IL]] where she graduated with a BA in [[journalism]] and a concentration in broadcast journalism in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=She Walks the Talk at CSF – Now, She Talks the Talk at WGCI|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-0EB096393494EC63.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611124621/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-0EB096393494EC63.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 June 2014|publisher=The Joliet Herald News|accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>

==Early career==

After graduating from the University of St. Francis, Nikki got her first job in radio as a co-host and news director at [[WILD (AM)|WILD]] in [[Boston]], a station that at the time served as a staple amongst the Boston area [[African American]] community for being a reliable outlet for [[R&B]] and its subgenres. It has since converted to air programming from [[China Radio International]].

Woods stayed at WILD for only one year, then moved back to the Midwest and landed a job at the legendary [[Chicago]] urban radio station [[WGCI-FM|WGCI]]. Here, Nikki co-hosted the Crazy Howard McGee morning show and produced news & traffic for 10 years until station ownership controversially replaced GCI’s local morning show with the nationally syndicated [[The Steve Harvey Morning Show|Steve Harvey Morning Show]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Former WGCI Star, "Crazy" Howard McGee Breaks His Silence|url=http://chicagoradioandmedia.com/news/143-former-wgci-star-qcrazyq-howard-mcgee-breaks-his-silence|publisher=Chicagoland Radio and Media|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>

==Tom Joyner Morning Show==

Once the Crazy Howard McGee morning show staff and crew were ousted from WGCI, Nikki began working at the nationally syndicated ''Tom Joyner Morning Show'' in 2008, an urban program broadcast to approximately 8 million listeners daily in more than 115 U.S. markets.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tom Joyner Morning Show|url=http://mymajicdc.com/author/tjms1023/|publisher=Majic 102.3|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> In her new setting, Nikki transitioned away from hosting and into the role of producer, working predominantly behind the scenes though she does occasionally make appearances on the TJMS airwaves to contribute “info-tainment” on weekend activities and events, as well as through Joyner’s online TV series ''Mama’s Gone Wild''<ref>{{cite web|title=Mama's Gone Wild|url=http://blackamericaweb.com/category/tom-joyner-tv/mamas-gone-wild/|publisher=Black America Web|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref> and ''Beyond the Studio''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beyond the Studio|url=http://blackamericaweb.com/tag/beyond-the-studio/|publisher=Black America Web|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>  Though she is no longer based in Chicago, Woods can still be heard through TJMS’ Chicago affiliate, [[WSRB|WSRB Soul 106.3]], where she contributes regularly to the station’s TJMS Community Watch program.

Woods’ efforts have won her praise from many in the world of radio, including from [[Tom Joyner]], himself known as “the hardest working man in radio”, who’s called Nikki “the hardest working senior producer in radio.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Testimonials - Tom Joyner|url=http://www.nikkiwoodsmedia.com/#|publisher=Nikki Woods Media|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>

==Nikki Woods Media==

In addition to her work on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, Woods runs her own business Nikki Woods Media. Woods’ primary service under this company is training her clients, which range from everyday individuals to [[corporations]], in effective [[personal branding]], message delivery, and platform development. This training takes form in one-on-one coaching sessions as well speaking engagements at workshops and large events.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Visibility: Speaking, Workshops and Live Events|url=http://www.nikkiwoodsmedia.com/speaking-live-events-coaching-consulting/|publisher=Nikki Woods Media|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>

Nikki’s work through her own company has earned her a reputation as a “Global Visibility Expert”, a reputation supported by her books, Top [[Twitter]] Tips for Global Visibility and Quick and Dirty Twitter Tips to Global Visibility, both of which focus on increasing visibility via the social network website Twitter.

==Literary Works==

Woods has published one [[fiction]] work and is currently in the process of writing her second novel. Her first - a romance novel titled Easier Said Than Done originally published by Ebony Energy in 2005 and recently reissued by Brown Girls Publishing in 2014 - follows an entertainment executive struggling to balance family and career all at once.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Nikki|title=Easier Said Than Done|date=4 April 2014|publisher=Brown Girls Publishing|location=Fresno, TX|isbn=0991532244|url=http://browngirlspublishing.com/catalog-item/easier-said-than-done-by-nikki-woods/}}</ref>   The [[novel]] received positive reviews, averaging 4 out of 5 stars on [[goodreads.com]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Easier Said Than Done - Community Reviews|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1392516.Easier_Said_Than_Done|publisher=Good Reads|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>  and 4½ out of 5 stars on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Easier Said Than Done - Customer Reviews|url=https://www.amazon.com/Easier-Said-Than-Nikki-Woods/product-reviews/0991532244/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref>
