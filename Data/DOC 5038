'''[[AHS Centaur|Australian Hospital Ship ''Centaur'']]''' was attacked and sunk by a Japanese submarine off [[North Stradbroke Island]], [[Queensland]], Australia, on 14 May 1943, killing the majority of those on board. She had been launched in 1924 as a combination passenger liner/freighter, operating between Western Australia and Singapore. Following her early-1943 conversion to a [[hospital ship]], ''Centaur'' served as a medical transport between [[New Guinea]] and Australia. Before dawn on 14 May 1943, while on her second voyage, ''Centaur'' was torpedoed. Of the 332 medical personnel and civilian crew aboard, 268 died, including 11 of the 12 nurses. The 64 survivors were discovered 36 hours later. The incident resulted in public outrage, as attacking a hospital ship was considered a [[war crime]] under the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]]. In the 1970s the identity of the attacking submarine, {{nowrap|[[Japanese submarine I-177|''I-177'']]}}, became public. The reason for the attack is unknown, although there are claims that the ship may have been in breach of the international conventions that should have protected her. The wreck was found in 2009, although the incorrect identification of another wreck as ''Centaur'' stood from 1995 to 2003. {{TFAFULL|AHS Centaur}}
