'''''[[Mycena aurantiomarginata]]''''', commonly known as the golden-edge bonnet, is a species of [[agaric]] fungus in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. First formally [[species description|described]] in 1803, it was given its current name in 1872. It is common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in North Africa, Central America, and Japan. The fungus produces [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) that grow on the floor of [[coniferous forest]]s. The mushrooms have a bell-shaped to conical [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, set atop a slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long with yellow to orange hairs at the base. The fungus is named after its characteristic bright orange [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] edges. A microscopic characteristic is the club-shaped [[cystidia]] that are covered with numerous spiky projections, resembling a [[mace (club)|mace]]. The [[edible mushroom|mushroom's edibility]] has not been determined. It can be distinguished from similar ''[[Mycena]]'' species by differences in size, color, and [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. A 2010 publication reported the discovery and characterization of a novel [[pigment]] named mycenaaurin&nbsp;A, isolated from the mushroom. The pigment is responsible for its color, and it has [[antibiotic]] activity that may prevent certain bacteria from growing on the mushroom. {{TFAFULL|Mycena aurantiomarginata}}
