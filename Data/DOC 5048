'''''Debaryomyces hansenii''''' is a species of [[yeast]] in the family [[Saccharomycetaceae]]. Also known as ''Candida famata'', it accounts for up to 2% of invasive [[candidiasis]] cases<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garey|first=Kevin W.|last2=McCaskey|first2=Laurie|last3=Ng|first3=Tat Ming|last4=Shah|first4=Dhara N.|last5=Alam|first5=M.

==Ecology==
''Debaryomyces hansenii'' is an [[Osmotic pressure|osmo-]], [[Halophile|halo-]] and [[Xerophile|xerotolerant]] [[yeast]]<ref name=Yeast>{{cite journal|author1=Uta Breuer |author2=Hauke Harms|title=''Debaryomyces hansenii'' — an extremophilic yeast with biotechnological potential|journal=Yeast|year=2006|volume=23|issue=6|pages=415–437|doi=10.1002/yea.1374|pmid=16652409}}</ref> that produces toxins, including [[Killer yeast|mycocins]], to destroy competitive yeast species.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Nabaraj Banjaraa|author2=Kenneth W.

Harvey's head brewer speculates that it is either airborne in the brewery or a slow-growing component of their house yeast blend.<ref>{{cite | url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001504.html | title=Washington hosts historic tasting of British and Irish classics | first=Michael | last=Jackson | authorlink=Michael Jackson (writer) | date=6 April 2001}}</ref> ''D. hansenii'' is also found in hyper-saline waters such as the [[saltern]]s on the Atlantic coast of [[Namibia]] or in the [[Great Salt Lake]] of [[Utah]].<ref name=Yeast />

==Nutritional requirements==
The species can be cultivated in media with up to 25% [[NaCl]] or 18% [[glycerol]].<ref name=Yeast /> Growth rate increases in solutions with ≥ 1[[Molarity|M]] NaCl or [[KCl]], with sodium and potassium ions playing a very important role in the mechanisms involved in maintaining [[Osmoregulation|osmobalance]]. The species can survive a [[pH]] range between 3 and 10.

==Reproduction==
Most strains are [[haploid]], mating very rarely and [[diploid]]ize transiently by somatogamous [[autogamy]] (i.e. fusion of two cells but excluding their [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]]). Sexual reproduction proceeds via [[heterogamous]] conjugation (i.e. the conjugation of two cells of different form or size) leading to short diplophase followed by [[meiosis]] and [[ascospore]] formation.<ref name=Yeast /> Haploid yeasts reproduce [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] by multilateral budding.

==Differentiation==
The ability of this species to grow at 10% NaCl or 5% glucose is used to discriminate ''D. hansenii'' from other ascomycetous yeasts.<ref name=Yeast /> The species comprises two [[Subspecies|varieties]]: ''D. hansenii'' var. ''hansenii'' and var. ''fabryii''. These two groups can be differentiated via [[rRNA]], the [[electrophoretic mobility]] of their [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], or by their maximum grow temperatures (35&nbsp;°C for var. ''hansenii'' and 39&nbsp;°C for var. ''fabryii'').

==Biotechnology==
The species has been demonstrated to synthesize useful quantities of [[D-arabinitol]], [[riboflavin]], [[xylitol]], and [[pyruvic acid]] under thiamine
limitation.<ref name=Yeast /> The species has also been used to [[decarboxylation|decarboxylate]] [[Ferulic acid]]
to [[2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol]] via [[biotransformation]] (a 95.07% yield, 1470.8&nbsp;mg/l, within 10 hours).<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sindhu Mathewa |author2=Emilia Abrahama |author3=S. Sudheesh |title=Rapid conversion of ferulic acid to 4-vinyl guaiacol and vanillin metabolites by ''Debaryomyces hansenii''|journal=Journal of Molecular Catalysis B: Enzymatic|date=2007|volume=44|issue=2|pages=48–52|doi=10.1016/j.molcatb.2006.09.001}}</ref>
