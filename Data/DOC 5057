'''Stephen Robert Sutton''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (16 December 1994 – 14 May 2014), was an English blogger and charity activist known for his blog ''Stephen's Story'' and his fundraising efforts for the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] charity for the aid of teenagers with cancer. By the second anniversary of his death, £5.5 million had been raised in his memory.<ref name=memory>{{cite news|title=Stephen Sutton's legacy: £5.5m raised in his memory|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-36288677|accessdate=15 May 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=14 May 2016}}</ref>

Born in [[Burntwood]], [[Staffordshire]], Sutton performed well at school, but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for [[colorectal cancer]]. His father had fought the disease twice, and both were predisposed to it through [[Lynch syndrome]]. Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as doctors did not believe that colorectal cancer could occur in a teenager.

Sutton made a "bucket list" of things to do in his final months, successfully achieving many of them including becoming a ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' holder. He began fundraising for the Teenage Cancer Trust, receiving support from celebrities and politicians. In 2013, he met filmmaker [[Grigorij Richters]], who recorded him for a documentary. Sutton died in hospital on 14 May 2014, at age 19. A memorial service to him at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] was attended by over 10,000 mourners. After his death, Sutton was posthumously recognised for his activism with awards including an MBE and an honorary doctorate from [[Coventry University]].

==Early life==
Sutton was born on 16 December 1994,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stephensstory.co.uk/about-stephen/ |title=About Stephen |publisher=Stephensstory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> and attended primary and secondary school in his home town of [[Burntwood]], Staffordshire. During his youth, Sutton was a very active child, participating in sports and athletics, particularly long-distance running and [[association football|football]];<ref name=how/> he was at one point a trialist at [[Walsall F.C.]], and set a record in under-15 400 m at his school.<ref name=speech>{{cite news|last1=Lockley|first1=Mike|title=Remembering Stephen Sutton – in his own words – the speech that inspired the world|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/remembering-stephen-sutton---words-9249268|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=Birmingham Mail|date=14 May 2015}}</ref>

Sutton received straight A grades from [[Chase Terrace Technology College]] in August 2012, and had interviews at [[Cambridge University]] to study medicine, as well as universities in Leicester and Leeds. He later withdrew his applications before getting a verdict, after his cancer was determined to be incurable.<ref name=how>{{Cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-27408908 | title = How Stephen Sutton raised £3m for Teenage Cancer Trust | date= 14 May 2014 | accessdate = 14 May 2014 | publisher = BBC News}}</ref>

Sutton, like his father Andy, had [[Lynch syndrome]], a genetic predisposition to [[colorectal cancer]]. The elder Sutton had surgery to remove part of his intestine after a cancer diagnosis in 1989. Twenty years later, he had another tumour removed, and a second course of [[chemotherapy]], receiving an all-clear only months before Stephen was first diagnosed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Father of Stephen Sutton: My son's legacy helped me in my own battle against cancer|url=http://www.itv.com/news/central/2015-10-29/father-of-stephen-sutton-my-sons-legacy-helped-me-in-my-own-battle-against-cancer/|accessdate=1 November 2015|publisher=ITV News|date=29 October 2015}}</ref> Doctors initially diagnosed Stephen with constipation and prescribed [[laxatives]], despite Andy's insistence that there was a risk of colorectal cancer in the family; he was repeatedly told that teenagers were too young to have the illness.<ref name=listened>{{cite news|last1=Perry|first1=Kath|title=Stephen Sutton's father: If doctors had listened to me, he might still be with us|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11227707/Stephen-Suttons-father-If-doctors-had-listened-to-me-he-might-still-be-with-us.html|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 November 2014}}</ref> In his final interview, published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 11 May 2014, Sutton confessed that he had a degree of "anger" towards the amount of time taken for his cancer diagnosis, but would not lament it.<ref name=walker/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hardy|first1=Rebecca|title='I'm so lucky to be here.

==Illness and activism==
Sutton was diagnosed with [[cancer staging|stage 3B]] [[colorectal cancer]] at the age of 15, and subsequently went through aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments. He was declared cancer-free, but a tumour returned behind his knee, which was treated by further chemotherapy. Doctors considered an amputation of Sutton's left leg, but the tumour had already [[metastasis|spread]] to other parts of his lower body. In December 2012, two years after the initial diagnosis, the cancer was deemed incurable after spreading to the lungs and liver. Sutton did not ask how long he was expected to survive, choosing to measure his life in the difference he could make, rather than in time. On 24 January 2014, in a speech at London's [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], he called his first diagnosis "a good thing. It was a huge kick up the backside, it taught me to take nothing for granted, and gave me a lot of motivation for life".<ref name=speech/>

[[File:Jason Manford comedy masterclass crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Comedian [[Jason Manford]] is an active supporter of Sutton's campaign.]]
After his diagnosis, Sutton began participating in charity events with the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]], and later started his own website and blog in January 2013. At the same time, he began fundraising for the trust, with an initial goal of £10,000. Following unexpected support, the goal was raised to £100,000 and £500,000 the same year, before being raised to £1,000,000 in March 2014 and went over the £4,000,000 mark by the end of May 2014. During his fundraising campaign, Sutton was supported by several celebrities, most notably [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Jonathan Ross]] and [[Jason Manford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stephensstory.co.uk/timeline/ |title=Timeline |publisher=Stephensstory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Manford donated £10,000 and gave all the turnover from his own comedy clubs for the entire month of May to the charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10152084185769352&id=9212109351&stream_ref=10 |title=Jason Manford – I have a few comedy clubs dotted around... |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Following Sutton's hospitalisation in April 2014, Manford became the unofficial spokesperson for the charity, appearing in interviews promoting the cause. He also launched the campaign "#thumbsupforStephen", asking people to share [[selfies]] of themselves promoting the campaign.<ref name=how/>

Sutton's goal of £1,000,000 was reached on 23 April 2014, and on 2 May, he was discharged from the hospital following an improvement in his condition. Later that same day he also met with prime minister [[David Cameron]], who voiced his support for the campaign. On 4 May, Sutton helped break the [[Guinness World Record]] for 'The most number of people making heart-shaped hand gestures', with 554 people at Chase Terrace Technology College.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-27263082 |title=Stephen Sutton: Fundraising cancer teen breaks world record |publisher=BBC News |date=4 May 2014 |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>

In September 2014, £2.9 million of the £4.96 million raised was invested in specialist cancer units for young people at seven British hospitals. A further £1.2 million was put towards 50 care scholarships at [[Coventry University]], and £700,000 invested in improving cancer awareness information and helping patients attend the charity's annual weekend conference.<ref name=september>{{cite news|title=Stephen Sutton: £5m charity fund plan revealed|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-29210431|accessdate=18 September 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 September 2014}}</ref> On 14 May 2016, the second anniversary of Sutton's death, £5.5 million had been raised.<ref name=memory/>

Skydiving and entering the Guinness Book of Records were two goals which Sutton achieved before his death. On 10 July 2015 at [[Hibaldstow Airfield]] in [[Lincolnshire]], 402 people made 403 tandem jumps of at least 10,000 feet in 24 hours for the Teenage Cancer Trust in his honour, breaking the previous record of 286.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stephen Sutton skydive breaks a Guinness World Record|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-33483837|accessdate=6 November 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2015}}</ref> His mother, an official ambassador for the trust, also ran a marathon and plans to climb [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in her son's memory.<ref name=memory/>

==Documentary==
In April 2013, Sutton met [[Kevin Spacey]]'s filmmaker-in-residence [[Grigorij Richters]] while rehearsing as part of the drummer group for the [[opening ceremony]] of the 2013 [[UEFA Champions League]] final at [[Wembley Stadium]]. They quickly became friends. Richters and his team began following him around for several months, filming Sutton at home with his family and at several fundraisers. In the summer of 2013 Sutton went on holiday to [[Ibiza]] (his last travel) with his close friends. Richters equipped him with several GoPro cameras. The documentary is in development, as of 2016, and will be made into a feature-length film.<ref name=ibiza/><ref name=film/>

Richters said:
{{quote|"Two days before Stephen passed we talked about his legacy. He wanted to make sure that we remember him as the positive person he was and not as a cancer sufferer".}}

Besides making the documentary for Sutton, Richters and his team were tasked to rebrand his [[Facebook page]] and have been managing most of his media and backend.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stephen Sutton: £400,000 raised since his death|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-27421493|accessdate=4 April 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=film>{{cite news|title=Film tribute for Stephen Sutton underway|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2014/05/19/film-tribute-for-stephen-sutton-underway/imgid3423104/|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=Express & Star|date=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=ibiza>{{cite news|title=Stephen Sutton: Footage of Ibiza holiday 'will be film'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-27434091|accessdate=4 April 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Stephen Sutton's 28th bucket list tick: a holiday in Ibiza|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10835608/Stephen-Suttons-28th-bucket-list-tick-a-holiday-in-Ibiza.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=televigil>{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Claire|title=Stephen Sutton's vigil to be 'fun' and awash with colour|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10861235/Stephen-Suttons-vigil-to-be-fun-and-awash-with-colour.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Stephen Sutton GOPRO footage at CL Final 2013.png|thumb|right|Stephen Sutton at the [[2013 UEFA Champions League Final]]]]
The opening ceremony, titled "The Battle of Kings" was directed by Spacey's executive Assistant and [[Prince's Trust]] ambassador Hamish Jenkinson and his business partner Jonny Grant who had previously directed the opening ceremony at the same venue for the 2011 final. It was produced by Films United and directed and produced by Richters and his producing partner Alex Souabni. Both were the former filmmakers-in-residence of Spacey and Jenkinson at [[The Old Vic Theatre]] in London. The film focused around the story of Sutton who was part of the group of performers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Champion's League Final 2013 at Wembley Stadium|url=http://www.pandemoniumdrummers.co.uk/2013/05/champions-league-final-2013-at-wembley.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|date=25 May 2013}}</ref>

{{quote|"I met with Stephen a year ago at Wembley, I couldn't believe how committed he was to following his dream – being part of the 400 drummers we had last year for the opening ceremony. I remember on the eve of the ceremony, his knee was hurting him so bad that he couldn't walk without crutches. He was watching the dress rehearsal from the stands with a constant smile on his face and told me: 'Don't worry Julien, tomorrow I'll be there whatever it takes!' Indeed, he took a double dose of painkillers and performed with all his passion for our ceremony. Stephen inspired me. I'm so proud to have met you and to have been even just a small part of your story".}}

==Death and reaction==
[[File:LichCathedral5.jpg|thumb|A public vigil for Sutton was held at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]]]

By the time of his death, he had raised over £3.2 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust.<ref name=bbc19/>  David Cameron praised Sutton for his "spirit and bravery" while [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition Leader]] [[Ed Miliband]] said Sutton was an "inspiration". Manford said:

{{quote|"Stephen Sutton was the most inspiring person I've ever met and touched more lives than he will ever know. He was an incredibly positive young man and a credit to his family, to Burntwood and to humanity itself.
