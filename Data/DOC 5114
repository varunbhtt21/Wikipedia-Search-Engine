'''[[Oxbow (horse)|Oxbow]]''' ([[foal]]ed 2010) is an American [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse best known for winning the [[2013 Preakness Stakes]]. A [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[colt (horse)|colt]] sired by [[Awesome Again]], a winner of the [[Breeders' Cup Classic]] and out of a full sister to [[Tiznow]], another Breeders' Cup Classic winner, he was sold as a [[yearling (horse)|yearling]] at [[Keeneland]] for $250,000. Oxbow is owned by [[Brad Kelley]] of [[Calumet Farm]], was trained by [[D. Wayne Lukas]], and was ridden in his [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] races by [[Gary Stevens (jockey)|Gary Stevens]]. His Preakness win was Calumet Farm's first win in a Triple Crown race in 45 years and breeder [[Richard Santulli]]'s first win in a Triple Crown classic race. It also was Stevens' first Triple Crown win since 2001, following his return to riding in early 2013 after a seven-year retirement, and Lukas' first Triple Crown win since 2000. Oxbow's second-place finish in the [[2013 Belmont Stakes|Belmont Stakes]] in June made him only the third horse to have $1&nbsp;million in [[Purse distribution|purse]] wins for 2013.  Later in the season, he was pulled up shortly after finishing fourth in the [[Haskell Invitational]], whereupon he was found to have suffered a [[soft tissue injury]], was taken out of competition for the remainder of his three-year-old season, and retired to stud in October 2013. {{TFAFULL|Oxbow (horse)}}
