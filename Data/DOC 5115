'''Jovan Ćirković''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Ћирковић}}; 1871 &ndash; 1928), known as '''Čifa''' (Чифа) or '''Ćirko-paša''' (Ћирко-паша), was a Serbian teacher, revolutionary (Chetnik) during the [[Macedonian Struggle]], and politician.

==Life==
Ćirković was born in [[Pljevlja]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (now [[Montenegro]]), into a Serbian Orthodox family. He finished primary school in his hometown. He graduated from the Teacher's College of the [[Society of Saint Sava]] in 1891, and worked as a teacher in the surroundings of Pljevlja, in [[Kumanovo]], [[Tetovo]], [[Skoplje]], [[Municipality of Veles|Veles]] and [[Prilep]]. He was also a superintendent and inspector of Serbian schools in the [[Manastir Vilayet]] ([[Bitola]]). Since 1901 he was secretary of the Patriarchatic Veles-Debar bishop Polikarp.

In 1903, he and [[Aleksa Jovanović-Kodža]] established the Bitola Board of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]], in which he would have the task of forming, supplying, managing and coordination of Serb bands (''četa'') in the Bitola Vilayet. After the [[Young Turk Revolution]] (1908), he became the president of the [[Serb National Board]] of the Manastir Vilayet, a post he held until 1910 when he was appointed head of the [[Serbian National Office in Istanbul]]. After the [[Balkan Wars]], he became the head of the Ohrid Oblast (region), and after the [[First World War]], the head of the Oblast of Bitola (1918). He was a [[Member of Parliament|MP]] from 1920 to 1927 in the Bitola Okrug.
