'''Do It Again''' is a song by British rock band [[the Kinks]]. Written by lead singer [[Ray Davies]], the song was released as the first track on [[The Kinks]]'s album, ''[[Word of Mouth (The Kinks album)|Word of Mouth]]''. It was released as a single after the album's release.

Written by Davies as an observation on the stressful working schedules that he and others had to face, the song was recorded during the sessions for ''Word of Mouth'' and sent out as a promotional single soon after. Musically, the song is in the guitar-driven style of others on the album and features an opening guitar chord and echoed vocals.

Released as a single in both America and Britain, the song found moderate success in the United States on the Top 100 and Mainstream Rock charts. The single was accompanied by a [[Julien Temple]]-directed video, featuring the band as well as former Kinks drummer [[Mick Avory]]. The song was positively received by critics and has since appeared numerous times on compilation albums and other media.

==Background and recording==
"Do It Again" was written by Kinks front-man [[Ray Davies]] about his strenuous touring schedule and anyone who has a busy schedule.<ref name="daily cut">{{cite web|title=The Daily Cut: The Kinks “Do It Again”|url=http://wncx.cbslocal.com/2016/11/16/the-daily-cut-the-kinks-do-it-again/|website=98.5 WNCX|publisher=CBS|accessdate=25 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517163156/http://wncx.cbslocal.com/2016/11/16/the-daily-cut-the-kinks-do-it-again/|archive-date=12 March 2019}}</ref> Davies later said of the song,

{{quote|I think it applies to everybody who gets up in the morning and has to go out and do their job. Sometimes it’s not great being on tour. It’s a cliché now, but everyone knows what happens on the road. You have very little sleep, I usually go to sleep about four or five o’clock, then I have to get up at eight or nine o’clock, get a plane and go somewhere else and play. When the knock comes on the door, I know I have got to get up. It’s not just in my job, people who are electricians and work in Woolworth’s have to do it.<ref name="daily cut" />|}}

"Do It Again" had been recorded between June 1983 and September 1984, with mixes of the song being completed from 9 to 11 October of the same year.<ref name="All Day" /> A promotional single was mastered on 15 October and sent to radio stations in November.<ref name="All Day" />

==Music and lyrics==

"Do It Again", unlike the previous Kinks singles released from 1983 to 1984, is a hard rock track, very much in line with the musical qualities of the rest of the tracks on ''Word of Mouth''. It is sung by [[Ray Davies]], similarly to many other Kinks tracks. It opens with a single guitar chord, which many found reminiscent of the opening chord on ''[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', and Davies voice is often echoed throughout the track. On the album ''[[To the Bone (The Kinks album)|To the Bone]]'', two versions of the track appeared, one being an acoustic styled version of the track.

The lyrics of "Do It Again" have a simple theme of "get up and do it again."

==Release and reception==

"Do It Again" was the lead-off track from "Word of Mouth" as well as the second U.K. (and first U.S.) single from that album. The song peaked at #41 in America (and #4 on the U.S. [[Mainstream Rock Tracks chart]]) and #91 in Canada. Prior to this release, however, the track was issued as a 12-inch single for promotional purposes on 1 November 1984.<ref name="All Day">{{cite book|last=Hinman|first=Doug|title=All Day and All of the Night|pages=272-273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBlkaDf49M0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Sixteen days later, the track was performed on [[Saturday Night Live]], along with "Word of Mouth".<ref name="All Day" /> A promotional video, directed by [[Julien Temple]] for Nitrate Films, was filmed for the song, starring [[Ray Davies]] with appearances by the rest of the band.<ref name="All Day" /> Recently departed Kinks drummer [[Mick Avory]] also made a guest appearance in the video as a "hapless busker that Ray has to part ways with".<ref name="All Day" /><ref name=story>{{cite book|title=You Really Got Me: The Story of The Kinks|author=Hasted, N.|page=|year=2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9781849386609}}</ref> The song also appeared on the compilation albums ''[[Come Dancing with The Kinks]]'' and ''[[To the Bone (The Kinks album)|To the Bone]]''.

"Do It Again" was described as a "circular, synth-spiked minor hit", and praised as one of the few distinctive tracks from ''Word of Mouth'' by [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]].<ref name=AllMusic>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/word-of-mouth-mw0000194486}}</ref>  [[Rolling Stone]] said that the track "has a recognizable kick, with Dave's brisk uppercut fuzz chords counting off a spry '[[Victoria (The Kinks song)|Victoria]]' rhythm."<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|last=Fricke |first=David |title=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/albums/album/189321/review/5945895/word_of_mouth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510155927/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/albums/album/189321/review/5945895/word_of_mouth |archivedate=10 May 2007 }}</ref>
