==Philosophical work==

Siegel is best known for her work in the philosophy of perception and epistemology. Her work is discussed critically and influenced many subsequent discussions of the contents of experience.

She has authored one monograph titled ''The Contents of Visual Experience,'' and has edited an anthology titled ''The Elements of Philosophy: Readings from Past and Present,'' in addition to publishing a number of chapters and peer reviewed journal articles.<ref name=cv/> She also writes and maintains the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'s article ''The Contents of Perception.''  Her monograph was well received,<ref name=ndpr/><ref name=mind/> and her papers have been widely cited. Siegel has been photographed by the American Photographer Steve Pyke<ref>[[Steve Pyke]]</ref> and she appears on the cover of Steven Pyke's photographic anthology of important contemporary philosophers<ref>http://global.oup.com/academic/product/philosophers-9780199757145;jsessionid=C464C8753E6A7BCC44092BDEC1A97AE3?cc=no&lang=en&</ref>

[[Ned Block]] described Siegel's ''The Contents of Visual Experience'' as "one of the most significant books in philosophy of mind for many years."<ref name=monograph>{{cite book|last=Siegel|first=Susanna|title=The contents of visual experience|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199931248}}</ref> [[James Genone]] hailed ''The Contents of Visual Experience'' as "an important contribution to the contemporary literature on the nature and structure of perception," and lauded Siegel for being one of the first recent philosophers to challenge the prevailing view that perceptual experiences have representational contents, suggesting that if Siegel is correct in her views, the result would be a [[Sea change (idiom)|sea change]] that would effect not only the philosophy of perceptual experiences, but also have broad implications for many other areas of philosophy.<ref name=ndpr>{{cite journal|last=Genone|first=James|title=Susanna Siegel, The Contents of Visual Experience, Oxford University Press, 2010, 222pp., $49.95 (hbk), ISBN 9780195305296|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Review|date=7 June 2011|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24721/|accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref>

The early portion of Siegel's book constructs and contrasts two opposing views, one that she deems the "Content View," and one that she describes as the "Rich Content View."<ref name=ndpr/> The "Content View" represents a situation in which there is precision in the way in which perceptual experiences have meaningful contents, whereas in the "Rich Content View" perceptual experiences consist of simple and complex properties that humans extrapolate meaning from.<ref name=ndpr/>  Having established this framework, Siegel uses it to examine three major philosophical points: first, that humans are able to determine content from sensory cues (in what Siegel describes as 'the method of phenomenal contrast,") second, that the method of phenomenal contrast supports the idea of the Rich Content model as an enhancement over the Content model, and lastly that while ordinary visual experiences involve seeing things that pertain to objects in addition to seeing things that do not pertain to objects, hallucinations differ from standard visual experiences by only perceiving things that do not pertain to particular objects.<ref name=mind>{{cite journal|last=Logue|first=H.|title=The Contents of Visual Experience, by Susanna Siegel|journal=Mind|date=13 December 2012|volume=121|issue=483|pages=842–849|doi=10.1093/mind/fzs089}}</ref>

In a series of peer reviewed articles,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00786.x | volume=46 | issue=2 | title=Cognitive Penetrability and Perceptual Justification* | journal=Noûs | pages=201–222 | last1 = Siegel | first1 = Susanna| year=2012 | url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12668187 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11098-012-0059-5|title = The epistemic impact of the etiology of experience|journal = Philosophical Studies|volume = 162|issue = 3|pages = 697–722|year = 2012|last1 = Siegel|first1 = Susanna|citeseerx = 10.1.1.363.2333}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/phpr.12273 | title=How Is Wishful Seeing Like Wishful Thinking? | journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume=95 | issue=2 | pages=408–435 | last1 = Siegel | first1 = Susanna| year=2017 | citeseerx=10.1.1.400.158 }}</ref> and a monograph titled ''The Rationality of Perception'' (2017),<ref>https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-rationality-of-perception-9780198797081?cc=us&lang=en&</ref> Siegel argues that we can epistemically evaluate the subpersonal transitions that lead to a perceptual experience, just as we rationally evaluate the transitions that lead to an individual forming a belief. So called "ill-founded" influences or transitions can diminish the epistemic value of the resulting experience. This upturns the traditional philosophical emphasis on perceptual experience as epistemically foundational, capable of justifying beliefs without itself being susceptible to epistemic evaluation in terms of rationality.
