'''''Huddle''''' is a [[1932 in film|1932]] American [[Pre-Code]] film directed by [[Sam Wood]] and starring [[Ramon Novarro]], [[Madge Evans]], [[Ralph Graves]] and [[Una Merkel]]. This was the first of two films Ramon Novarro would make in 1932, and his first after appearing in the acclaimed, successful ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]''.

==Plot==
Tony Ametto, a young steel-worker with immigrant parents, gets a scholarship to [[Yale University|Yale]], where he becomes a football star and finds romance with a young heiress.

==Production==
Director Sam Wood was known for directing college-themed films such as ''One Minute to Play'' (1926) and ''[[So This Is College]]'' (1929). The film showcases the popularity of the college film subgenre of culture-clash plot elements that were the focus of comedies like ''Hold 'Em Yale'' (1928) with [[Rod La Rocque]], and the drama ''[[Redskin (film)|Redskin]]'' (1929) with [[Richard Dix]].

The film was shot on a considerable budget of $514,000,<ref name="Soares, André 2002 p. 574">Soares, André. ''Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramón Novarro'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2002) p. 574 {{ISBN|0-312-28231-1}}</ref> and included recreating Yale's Derby Day on the [[MGM]] backlot.<ref>''Sarasota Herald'' July 9. 1932 p 3. Web. April 25. 2014</ref> Shooting began on February 12, 1932, and lasted for nine weeks.

Real college students for the film were recruited as extras for $5-a-day; while presumably providing authentic atmosphere to the crowd scenes, they were also cheaper to hire than the average professional film extra in [[Los Angeles]], whose pay was set at $7.50.<ref>Segrave, Kerry.

Jefferson: McFarland. p. 126 {{ISBN|978-0-7864-7330-4}}</ref> One of the extras in the film was a pre-fame [[Buster Crabbe]], who appeared in a few scenes before being fired because of "inadvertent rudeness to the star (Novarro) during rehearsals."<ref>Vermilye, Jerry.

Lead actor Novarro had to learn football and soccer for his role (his character plays football in the American release, soccer in the international versions).<ref name="Soares, André 2002 p. 574"/> He considered himself miscast;<ref>Ellenberger, Allan R. ''Ramon Novarro: A Biography of the Silent Film Idol, 1899-1968; With a Filmography''. Jefferson: McFarland. pp. 115-116. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4676-6}} Web. April 25. 2014</ref> [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] was originally considered for the role. Aged 33, and not a natural athlete, Novarro's casting as a hardscrabble college football star was a strange decision; when [[Greta Garbo]] heard of his new role, she reportedly said of their bosses at MGM, "Oh, they'll never learn."<ref name="Soares, André 2002 p. 574"/> Historian Mark A. Vieira credits Novarro's decision to accept the "dubious role" as payback to MGM chief executive [[Irving Thalberg]] for allowing him the autonomy to direct the foreign language versions of ''[[Call of the Flesh#Alternate language versions|Call of the Flesh]]'' (1929).<ref>Viera, Mark A. ''Irving Thalberg: Boy Wonder to Producer Prince'' Berkeley & Los Angeles: University of California Press p. 168 {{ISBN|978-0-520-26048-1}} Web. April 25. 2014</ref>

==Release==
The film went into general release on May 14, 1932, on the west coast, and had its [[New York City]] premiere at the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] a month later on June 16. In general release, the film was a box office failure, with a loss of $28,000.<ref name="Soares, André 2002 p. 574"/> Critics almost universally described it as too long and agreed that Novarro was miscast.

''Huddle'' has been broadcast on television occasionally and has played several times on the cable channel [[Turner Classic Movies]]. It was released on DVD through [[Warner Archive Collection]] on October 5, 2010.<ref>[http://shop.tcm.com/huddle-dvd/detail.php?p=356453&ecid=PRF-TCM-100188&pa=PRF-TCM-100188 Warner Archive ''Huddle'' DVD Page]</ref>

==Box office==
The film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $809,000: $476,000 from the US and Canada and $333,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $28,000.<ref name="Mannix"/>
