'''''Neotrigonia''''' is a [[genus]] of living [[Seawater|saltwater]] [[clams]], [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[bivalvia|bivalve]] [[mollusca|mollusk]]s in the family [[Trigoniidae]], which otherwise consists only of fossil genera. For a long time the entire family was thought to be long extinct, but a living species that is now placed in this genus was discovered in 1802. At that time it was assigned to the fossil genus ''[[Trigonia]]''. Currently, according to the [[World Register of Marine Species]], 8 species in this genus are recognized.

==Discovery of the genus==
Until the beginning of the 19th century, no living species in this superfamily had ever been discovered, although numerous fossil species were known. The superfamily was well known as fossils from the Devonian to the [[Cretaceous]] Period. In 1802, however, [[François Péron]] discovered a living species in waters off the coast of [[Tasmania]]. In 1804, [[Lamarck]] named that species ''Trigonia margaritacea'', and Cossmann renamed the genus ''Neotrigonia'' in 1912. Today, eight living species are known to exist, all of which are found off the coast of Australia and Tasmania. ''Neotrigonia'' probably evolved from ''Eotrigonia'' ([[Eocene]] to [[Miocene]]) during the Miocene epoch.<ref>Francis, A.O. 2000. The Palaeobiology of the European Jurassic Trigoniidae.
