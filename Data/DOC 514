This page shows no proof of [[WP:N|notability]], with trivial references and [[WP:SYNTH|synthesized]] content. It appears that a major reason for creating this page was as a platform for the [[Pilzno (Hasidic dynasty)|Pilzner]] Rav, who does not have [[WP:RS|reliable references]]. I would have suggested merging this page with [[Ramat Beit Shemesh]], but that page does not exist and the Ramat Beit Shemesh section under [[Beit Shemesh]] is quite short.

I agree that that this article should be converted into a subsection of an article on [[Ramat Beit Shemesh]]. However, first, '''Ramat Beit Shemesh''' needs to be created as an independent page. There is much notable information to say about Ramat Beit Shemesh on every level - demographically, culturally, religiously, historically and politically and it should not be buried under the [[Beit Shemesh]] page. Once the new page is created, Ramat Shilo can be merged with it.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:ד|ד]] ([[User talk:ד|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/ד|contribs]]) 10:54, 24 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*  '''Rename''' as [[Ramat Beit Shemesh]], separate that from [[Beit Shemesh]], and tag for expansion to cover all of Ramat Beit Shemesh.  There isn't enough for this by itself. [[User:Zero0000|Zero]]<sup><small>[[User_talk:Zero0000|talk]]</small></sup> 10:16, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
*  '''Rename''', I agree with Zero. [[User:Marokwitz|Marokwitz]] ([[User talk:Marokwitz|talk]]) 11:48, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
* I agree with Zero's suggestion and withdraw this deletion request. I'll go ahead and set up the new page, [[Ramat Beit Shemesh]]. Thank you, [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 12:11, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
**I started [[Ramat Beit Shemesh]] and put most of the information from [[Ramat Shilo]] (except for the Public transporation details) on it. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 12:27, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
