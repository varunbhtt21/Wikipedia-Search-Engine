In October 2014, the [[al-Nusra Front]] began attacking positions of the Hazzm Movement in the [[Idlib Governorate]], overrunning bases and seizing weapon stores, due to its perceived closeness to the United States.<ref name=hazzmwapo>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/us-backed-syria-rebels-routed-by-fighters-linked-to-al-qaeda/2014/11/02/7a8b1351-8fb7-4f7e-a477-66ec0a0aaf34_story.html|title=U.S.-backed Syria rebels routed by fighters linked to al-Qaeda|date=2 November 2014|accessdate=9 February 2015|agency=Washington Post |last= |first=}}</ref> Following the loss of men and weapons to Nusra, the Idlib branch of Hazzm stopped receiving funds from the CIA in December 2014, funds to the [[Aleppo]] branch continued.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/12/09/249556_rebels-in-northern-syria-say-us.html?rh=1|title=Rebels in northern Syria say U.S. has stopped paying them|date=9 December 2014|accessdate=9 February 2015|agency=McClatchy Newspapers|last=|first=|quote=Those cut off include a larger group of Hazm fighters whom Nusra ousted from their bases in the Zawyah mountains in Idlib province in October|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209070350/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/12/09/249556_rebels-in-northern-syria-say-us.html?rh=1|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=}}</ref> In January 2015, al-Nusra attacked Hazzm Movement positions in the [[Aleppo Governorate]].

On 3 May 2015, some of the former members of the northern branches of the Hazzm Movement, including the Atarib Martyrs Brigade, and the [[Syrian Revolutionaries Front]] along with [[Jabhat al-Akrad]], the [[Dawn of Freedom Brigades]] main component group the [[Northern Sun Battalion]] (making the [[Dawn of Freedom Brigades]] defunct in the process) and smaller FSA groups formed the [[Army of Revolutionaries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/archicivilians/status/594842226057814016|title=#Syria: Seven FSA groups (incl.

During the [[Turkish military intervention in Syria (August 2016 – March 2017)|Turkish military intervention in Syria]] which started in late August 2016, some former members of the Syrian Revolutionaries Front and the Hazzm Movement in exile from Turkey crossed into Syria through [[Jarabulus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alquds.co.uk/?p=592205|title=Threatens to exit "Arab factions" him: repercussions Turkish intervention shake Syria's alliance forces of democracy east of the Euphrates|work=Al-Quds al-Arabi|date=3 September 2016}}</ref>

In late December 2016, the Hazzm Movement, the SRF, and the Ansar Brigades in exile reportedly declared their intentions to return to Syria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/119683|title=Four factions that ended the "open-Sham" intend to return to the Syrian arena|work=Enab Baladi|date=16 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/Syria_Rebel_Obs/status/813135865090371590|title=Syrian Rebellion Obs on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=2016-12-26}}</ref>
