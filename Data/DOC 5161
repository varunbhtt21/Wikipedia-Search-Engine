* Wrong project; talk page for a file which isn't hosted on this project.
* Baseless accusation created solely as a revenge for [[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree files/2010 November 20#File:Barack Obama Presidential Limousine-1.jpg|this]] perfectly legitimate nomination, which resulted in deletion
* The accusation has been [[commons:User talk:LX/Archive/2010: October to December#Chris Atkinson 2006 Rally Australia Dwellingup.jpg|addressed]] on the appropriate project
* The accusation might needlessly cause potential reusers to refrain from using the content despite the fact that it's free
* I'd rather not be defamed for contributing my own work to Wikimedia projects and for contributing my time to weed out copyright infringements from those who prefer to upload other people's non-free content ''—[[User:LX|LX]] ([[User_talk:LX|talk]], [[Special:Contributions/LX|contribs]])'' 20:54, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - and add a response to make it clear that the assertion is baseless.  It's pretty clear that the images found by Tineye post-date the one uploaded on Commons.  I determined that before reading [[commons:User talk:LX/Archive/2010: October to December#Chris Atkinson 2006 Rally Australia Dwellingup.jpg|this]].  I am willing to post my analysis as a response so that the response is from a neutral editor. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 15:51, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' Any concerns regarding the validity of the file need to be dealt with at Commons. Discussing deletion at the English Wikipedia is inappropriate. Delete the talk page. [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 00:00, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
