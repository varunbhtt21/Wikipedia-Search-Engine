'''Fares Maakaroun''', (born October 12, 1940 in [[Rayak (Riyaq)]], Lebanon) was an Archbishop of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Nossa Senhora do Paraíso em São Paulo]] in Brazil from 1999 to 2014, when presented his apostolic resignation.

==Career==
He attended the primary school of his native town and then moved on to secondary school in [[Harissa]]. After the school, Maakaroun went as a novice to the [[White Fathers]] in Gap (France). He studied from 1960 philosophy and theology at the seminary of the White Fathers in Jerusalem and received a licentiate in theology. Maakaroun received his priestly ordination on 18 December 1966. Prior to his appointment as bishop in 1995, he was a professor at the seminary in Harissa, director of the Seminary of Damascus, [[Secretary General]] of [[Caritas International|Caritas]] Lebanon and finally Vicar General in Latakia in Syria.

==Bishop Offices==

On 31 July 1995 Maakaroun received the appointment as Archbishop of Latakia in Syria and on 17 December 1995 by Patriarch [[Maximos V Hakim]] was consecrated Archbishop. His co-consecrators were Archbishop (emeritus) [[Michel Yatim]] of Latakia and Archbishop [[Jean Mansour]], SMSP, Titular Archbishop of Apamea of Greek Melkites and Auxiliary Bishop of Antioch. On 18 December 1999, Maakaroun received the appointment as Archbishop "[[Pro hac vice]]", as Bishop of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Brazil. In this role he was co-consecrator of Archbishop [[Nikolaki Sawaf]] of Latakia. In October 2010, he participated in the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the Middle East in Rome. His objections to the final protocol was the call to engage in ''love'' for peace - but, he argued that "... there is no true love without true holiness. Let us be holy as our heavenly Father is holy. Holiness is the solution. Yes, sacred love, this is the solution." On July 21, 2014, Fares Maakaroun presented his apostolic resignation and was succeeded by his assistant, [[Joseph Gébara]].<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmaak.html]</ref>
