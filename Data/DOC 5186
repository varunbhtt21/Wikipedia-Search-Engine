'''Živojin Milovanović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Живојин Миловановић}}; January 23, 1884 — May 25, 1905), known by his nickname '''Žika''', was a Serbian soldier, member of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian revolutionary Chetnik Organization]] that fought in [[Old Serbia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] (see [[Macedonian Struggle]]).

==Life==
Milovanović was born on January 23, 1884, in [[Kruševac]], in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (now [[Serbia]]). He completed six grades of gymnasium in Kruševac, then finished the 33rd class of the Military Academy in Belgrade in 1903, with the rank of infantry lieutenant. He subsequently joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization, and in 1905, crossed the Serbian-Ottoman border into [[Old Serbia]] with a company. He participated in the famous [[Fight on Čelopek|battle at Čelopek]] (April 1905). Together with [[Lazar Kujundžić]] and [[Savatije Milošević]] he turned and went for [[Poreče]], through [[Kosovo (region)|Kosovo]] and Podgora, in order to bypass Ottoman harassing in the [[Kumanovo]] region. Milovanović, as a Serbian officer, was to establish the headquarters of Western [[Povardarje]]. The company was betrayed in [[Velika Hoča]] on May 25, 1905, by local Albanians who had promised (see ''[[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]]'') their security, thus they were forced to battle the Ottoman Army and neighbouring Albanian [[kachaks]]. After a long fight, all of these Chetniks died.<ref>М. Ракић, ''Конзулска писма, 1905-1911'', Београд 1985, приредио А. Митровић, бр. 2, 3, 4, 6; ; П.
