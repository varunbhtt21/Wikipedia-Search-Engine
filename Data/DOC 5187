Seems like a resume (also this is a misuse of a DAB page it looks like) [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:13, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
Should add-looks like an autobiography as well (probably should move the page without the DAB link-I'll do that now)  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:14, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Clearly a misuse of DAB, Also we aren't a resume host. -[[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 22:09, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
::speaking of which someone has been misusing DAB's as of late so I decided to move these pages and turn them into one, but it was still amess anyway. But yes this is a misuse. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 22:10, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' If an editor   was confused & marked something as a dab p when it's an ordinary article,  this is something that can very easily be corrected and is not an argument for deletion.  It was also tagged a7, but I removed the speedy--it has a plausible claim to significance, but I'm not yet sure of notability .
