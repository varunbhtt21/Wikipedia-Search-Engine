In a similar fashion to other titles in the [[Backyard Sports series|''Backyard Sports'' series]], players create their own teams choosing from more than 30 "neighborhood kids" who each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses.  Players may also choose from several [[National Hockey League]] hockey players as children, some of these players are [[Steve Yzerman]], [[Mike Modano]], [[Joe Sakic]], [[Jaromír Jágr]], [[Jarome Iginla]], [[Martin Brodeur]], and [[Curtis Joseph]].

In the game players control their character in a game of ice hockey.  At random times during a game, power ups appear at center ice.  Power ups provide help to the team that secures them such as causing all the players on the opposing team to fall over, or super speed.  Unique from most ice hockey games, fighting is not allowed in ''Backyard Hockey'' and very few penalties are called.
