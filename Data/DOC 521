::[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] '''ALT1''': Recently promoted to GA. Sufficient article length. Public domain image. Interesting hook. Should add a reference to the hook(s) in the LEAD section even if it is mentioned in the main body though. Otherwise, good to go once QPQ is done.

:::QPQ has already finished. I think refs no. 1 and 2 are enough to believe that they are half-brothers. Ref no. 1 states there "Before Cody Rhodes even hit high school, his half-brother Dustin ..." The real names of Goldust, Cody Rhodes and Dusty Rhodes are all present in the article. Thanks!
