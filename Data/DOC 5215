The '''Volvo B5TL''' is a 2-axle [[low-floor bus|low-floor]] [[Double-decker bus|double decker]] built by [[Volvo Buses|Volvo]].<ref name=routeone-1>{{cite web|last1=Deakin|first1=Tim|title=First drive of Euro 6 Wrightbus Gemini 3-bodied Volvo B5TL|url=http://www.route-one.net/vehicles/test-drives/first-drive-euro-6-wrightbus-gemini-bodied-volvo-b5tl/|website=route-one.net|publisher=Route One Magazine|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> It replaced the [[Volvo B9TL|B9TL]] as Volvo's Euro 6 2-axle double decker product for the UK and Irish markets.

==Design==
The B5TL is powered by Volvo's new 5.1 litre D5K-240 engine, which is rated at 240&nbsp;bhp/177&nbsp;kW. The move to a smaller engine is one of the weight-reduction measures implemented to the new bus.<ref name="routeone-1" /> Along with its bodybuilding partner [[Wrightbus]], the whole bus achieves a reduction of 1,000&nbsp;kg comparing to its predecessor. Volvo stated that, with the smaller engine and weight reduction, the B5TL will achieve 10% improvement on fuel economy.<ref>[http://www.volvobuses.com/bus/uk/en-gb/newsmedia/pressreleases/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=144777&News.Language=en-gb Extensive development paves way for Volvo’s new Euro 6 B5TL double deck bus] Volvo Buses 2 October 2013</ref>

Wrightbus currently offers the lightened [[Wright Eclipse Gemini|Gemini 3]] bodywork for the B5TL, which contributes 70% of the weight reduction. [[MCV Bus and Coach|MCV]] is also offering their body as an alternative to the Wrighbus design.

==History==

The first example appeared in London in autumn 2013, entering service with [[Go-Ahead London]] in October 2013 for evaluation. It remained until late February 2014 before being returned to Volvo.

Four further B5TL demonstrators have appeared in early 2014. One was trialed by [[Lothian Buses]], before moving to [[Go North East]].<ref>[http://lothianbuses.com/news/article/volvo-gemini-b5tl-demonstrator-bus Volvo B5TL Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 Demonstrator Bus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107115047/http://lothianbuses.com/news/article/volvo-gemini-b5tl-demonstrator-bus |date=7 November 2014 }} Lothian Buses 19 March 2014</ref> Another was trialled by operators such as Transdev on service 36. Both of these have now been purchased by [[East Yorkshire Motor Services|East Yorkshire]] and operate on the company's 66 route between Hessle and Hull. The other two were delivered to [[London General]] and [[Metroline]] and placed in service on routes [[London Buses route 12|12]] and [[London Buses route 297|297]] respectively.

In March 2014, [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] of Northern Ireland, placed an order for 42 buses with the new Wright Gemini 3 bodywork, with the last of them carrying the further redesigned version.<ref>[http://www.volvobuses.com/bus/uk/en-gb/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=146828&News.Language=en-gb 42 new Volvo B5TL double deck buses for Translink Northern Ireland] Volvo Buses 31 March 2014</ref> In May 2014, Lothian Buses had ordered for 25 buses, all of them were Wright Gemini 3 bodied.<ref>[http://lothianbuses.com/news/article/lothian-buses-place-order-for-25-new-buses Lothian Buses place order for 25 new buses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107114745/http://lothianbuses.com/news/article/lothian-buses-place-order-for-25-new-buses |date=7 November 2014 }} Lothian Buses 22 May 2014</ref> Translink placed a second order in 2017 for 32 B5TLs, 10 of which being long wheelbase models for use on its Airport 300 service, with the remainder for use in Belfast. All of these have the new style front.

Outside the UK, a B5TL demonstrator was delivered to [[Dublin Bus]] in early 2014 for evaluation. A batch of 70 (SG-class) were subsequently ordered by Dublin Bus with deliveries commencing in August 2014.<ref>[http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/about-us/Dublin-Bus-Fleet/ Dublin Bus Fleet] Dublin Bus</ref> In 2015 [[Bus Éireann]] took delivery of 25 B5TLs, while [[Dublin Bus]] ordered a further 90 examples. Dublin Bus have continued to place orders, and by the end of 2017 will have a total of 370 in service. Further orders have been placed for 2018-2019 deliveries.<ref>[http://dublinbuses.com/] Dublin Buses .com</ref> There are also 72 in service with [[Go-Ahead Ireland]] some of which were transferred from Dublin Bus and others delivered brand new to Go-Ahead. Bus Éireann similarly by the end of 2017 will have a total of 85 B5TLs in service across Ireland, operating in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.
