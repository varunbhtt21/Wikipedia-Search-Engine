The program has a list of six elements in order to ensure social responsibility and to create a strong partnership between workers, [[growers]] and [[buyers]]. The Fair Foods Standards Council (FFSC) oversees the program and ensures that standards are upheld.<ref>"Fair Food Program." Coalition of Immokalee Workers. N.p., n.d.

===Coalition of Immokalee Workers===
The Fair Food Program emerged from the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]]' Campaign for Fair Food. The campaign was launched in 2001 by farmworkers in [[Immokalee]], [[Florida]].<ref>Fair Food Program Report 2015." Fair Food Standards Council, n.d. Web.</ref>

==Background==

In 2005, after the CIW boycotted Taco Bell for almost four years, the company agreed to sign a Fair Food Agreement, committing the company to pay a “penny more per pound” on its tomatoes, to be passed on as wage bonus to tomato harvesters, and to work with CIW to improve conditions in the fields.<ref>CIW Taco Bell joint press release. 9 March 2005. Web.</ref> [[College]] campuses were a major impetus for this agreement; twenty-two colleges banned Taco Bell from operating.<ref>"Immokalee Tomato Pickers Win Campaign Against Taco Bell." Democracy Now! n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2014.</ref> The CIW then targeted McDonald’s for two years; in 2007, McDonald's signed a Fair Food Agreement with CIW.<ref>"US Farmworkers Reach Historic Agreement with McDonald's." Oxfam America. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 Apr. 2014.</ref> Other fast-food chains and food retailers followed suit.

Despite this success, in 2007, the Florida Tomato Growers, which is the state’s largest tomato producer, slowed the CIW’s progress. They threatened farms with $100,000 worth of fines if they passed through "penny per pound" monies. In 2010, Pacific Tomato Growers and Lipman, two of the nation’s largest producers, signed on to the program, effectively ending the industry boycott. Just months later, the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange signed onto the Fair Food Program, which began widespread implementation of the model.<ref>Greenhouse, Steven.

Walmart joined the Fair Food Program on January 16, 2014.<ref>"PRESS RELEASE: Coalition of Immokalee Workers Announces Walmart to Join Groundbreaking Fair Food Program."

"In Florida Tomato Fields, a Penny Buys Progress." The New York Times. The New York Times, 24 Apr. 2014. Web. 25 Apr. 2014.</ref> Walmart additionally agreed to help  expand the Program outside of Florida and expand into other crops.<ref>"PRESS RELEASE: Coalition of Immokalee Workers Announces Walmart to Join Groundbreaking Fair Food Program."

==Implementation and expansion==

The Fair Food Program has completed four year of implementation across the Florida tomato industry as well as its first year of expansion to Florida-based tomato growers’ operations in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. The program is currently expanding to strawberries and green bell peppers in Florida. The Fair Food Standards Council publishes detailed metrics annually, charting the program's implementation.<ref>"Fair Food Program Report 2015." Fair Food Standards Council, n.d. Web.</ref>

==Success==
From November 2011 through September 2015, farmworkers have brought forth over 1100 complaints. The FFSC has conducted more than 120 audits, interviewed 12,000 workers and completed 45 site visits. The CIW has conducted 400 education sessions, which has educated 35,000 workers about their rights. Buyers have paid nearly $20 million in the Fair Food Premium, which goes directly to workers as a line-item bonus on their paychecks.<ref>"Fair Food Program Report 2015." Fair Food Standards Council. Web.</ref>  According to the CIW, “today, virtually all Florida tomato growers have joined the Fair Food Program.<ref>Burkhalter, Holly. "Fair Food Program Helps End the Use of Slavery in the Tomato Fields." Washington Post. The Washington Post, 02 Sept. 2012. Web. 17 Apr. 2014.</ref>” "'When I first visited Immokalee, I heard appalling stories of abuse and modern slavery,' said Susan L. Marquis, dean of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, a public policy institution in Santa Monica, Calif. 'But now the tomato fields in Immokalee are probably the best working environment in American agriculture. In the past three years, they’ve gone from being the worst to the best.'" <ref>Greenhouse, Steve. "In Florida Tomato Fields, A Penny Buys Progress." The New York Times, 24 Apr. 2014. Web.</ref> ”
