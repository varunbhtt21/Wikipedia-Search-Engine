==Life==
Nedić was born in 1875, in the village of [[Strugovo]] near [[Bitola]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (now [[R. Macedonia]]). He received his nickname ''Ćela'' (slang for "head"), due to his [[Typhoid fever]] that left marks on his head. He joined the Bulgarian-organized [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) as a fighter in the bands of [[Georgi Sugarev]] and [[Gligor Sokolović]].<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|author1=Li︠u︡bomir Panaĭotov|author2=Ĭordan Nikolov Shopov|title=Osvoboditelnoto dvizhenie v Makedonii︠a︡ i Odrinsko: spomeni i materiali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHBIAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Nauka i izkustvo|quote=Келеша, Стефан, четник от четите на Георги Сугарев и на сърбоман- ския войвода Григор Лямев, X, 45. 48, 118, 123}}</ref> In 1902 he befriended [[Milorad Gođevac]], the founder of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]].
