The '''Pocantico River''' is a {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in|adj=mid|-long}} [[tributary]] of the [[Hudson River]] in western central [[Westchester County, New York]], United States. It rises from Echo Lake, in the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[New Castle, New York|New Castle]] south of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of [[Millwood, New York|Millwood]], and flows generally southwest past [[Briarcliff Manor]] to its outlet at [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]]. Portions of the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] are within its {{convert|16|sqmi|adj=on}} [[drainage basin|watershed]].

Writer [[Washington Irving]], who lived in the area for most of his life, was inspired by the undeveloped area above the river's mouth to write his classic "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]". Later in the 19th century much of the land was purchased by the [[Rockefeller family]] as part of their [[Kykuit]] estate; today much of that land has become [[Rockefeller State Park Preserve]]. A former reservoir used by the city of [[New Rochelle]] has likewise been converted into county-run Pocantico Lake Park. While the river runs predominantly through those parks and suburban land,<ref name="Riverkeeper"/> it is still one of the most [[water pollution|polluted]] tributaries of the Hudson.<ref name="PurityControl"/>

==Course==
In the past the Pocantico was considered to have two different sources, but today it is acknowledged that it rises from Echo Lake in [[Echo Lake State Park (New York)|the eponymous state park]] located in the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[New Castle, New York|New Castle]] between [[Saw Mill River]] Road ([[New York State Route 100]]) and the [[Taconic State Parkway]], just southwest of the [[unincorporated community|unincorporated]] [[Administrative divisions of New York#Hamlet|hamlet]] of [[Millwood, New York|Millwood]]. The lake is {{convert|325|ft}} above sea level, in a narrow valley between Cabin Ridge to the east and a similarly steep ridge on the west. Its surrounding terrain is primarily wooded and lightly developed outside of the two roads. The river begins at a dam on the lake's south end.<ref name="USGS source map"/><ref name="North PR Map" />

Shortly after draining the lake, the Pocantico flows under Route 100, which it remains closely parallel to for the next few miles. About {{convert|1,200|ft}} from its source, the stream crosses the town line from New Castle into neighboring [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]], soon forming the boundary between that town and neighboring [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] on its west. A short distance to the south, the river crosses back under Saw Mill River Road and receives its first [[tributary]], the unnamed outlet of [[Campfire Lake]] to the northeast, as it, Route 100 and the [[North County Trailway]] diverge from the Taconic. The river, road and trail continue heading to the southwest as the Pocantico begins to form the [[Briarcliff Manor]] [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] line at the [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]] Road crossing.<ref name="North PR Map" /><ref name="USGS headwaters map"/>

Another 1,200 feet south of that crossing, it recrosses Saw Mill River Road just north of where it merges with the Briarcliffâ€“[[Peekskill]] Parkway (also [[New York State Route 9A|State Route 9A]]). After flowing under the parkway, it passes just east of downtown Briarcliff Manor and then crosses Saw Mill River Road and the parkway again, meandering a little further to the east into residential neighborhoods, then turning south through the village's Jackson Road Park. After that it flows due south to the immediate east of the parkway, itself to the immediate east of a steep slope.<ref name="USGS VBM map"/>

After a slight swing east towards the Taconic, the river crosses under the parkway for the last time and continues on a more southwesterly course past {{convert|420|ft|adj=on}} Beech Hill into {{convert|164|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Pocantico Lakes Park]]. It widens amid swampy areas on either side as it receives [[Caney Brook]] from the north and then becomes Pocantico Lake. Midway along the lake, the municipal boundary leaves the river, putting it entirely within the town of Mount Pleasant. The dam at the lake's south end is at {{convert|219|ft}} above sea level, a loss of {{convert|106|ft}} from the Pocantico's source at Echo Lake.<ref name="USGS PL Park map"/><ref name="PL Map" />

From there, it flows southwestward again. At Old Sleepy Hollow Road it enters [[Rockefeller State Park Preserve]], at over {{convert|1400|acre|ha}} the largest of the three [[protected area]]s the river flows through. The road continues to parallel it on the east as it turns south; on the west it is paralleled by the preserve's Pocantico River Trail, which follows it for a mile and a half ({{convert|1.5|mi|disp=output only}}).<ref name="RSPP map"/> All three cross under Phelps Way ([[New York State Route 117|State Route 117]]) and turn south.<ref name="USGS RSPP map"/>

Within the preserve, the river meanders between hills amidst woodland interrupted by large clearings. Small stone bridges carry several of the preserve's trails across the river. About {{convert|600|ft}} after entering the preserve, the Pocantico crosses into the village of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]]. A short distance to the south, it receives [[Rockefeller Creek]] from the [[Pocantico Hills]] to the east. It bends north, away from the road, to receive its last named tributary, [[Gory Brook]], from the north, where it turns abruptly south again. After another quarter-mile ({{convert|0.25|mi|m|disp=output only}}) it crosses under the [[Old Croton Aqueduct]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] (NHL), and leaves the preserve, continuing straight through a steep, narrow wooded ravine in a slightly southwesterly direction.<ref name="RSPP map" />
[[File:View of Philipsburg Manor (Sleepy Hollow) New York.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large river flowing from a spillway; a mill in the background|The river, spillway, and impoundment at the [[Philipsburg Manor House]]]]
As it flows between [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] to the west and the village's Douglas Park to the east, the river drops below {{convert|50|ft}} in elevation. On the north edge of another residential neighborhood, it bends eastward. After flowing under [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]], it is again impounded, creating the [[mill pond]] at the [[Philipsburg Manor House]], another NHL.<ref name="USGS SH map"/><ref name="Lower PR Map" />

From that outlet, it meanders northwest past the former [[Tarrytown Truck Assembly]] plant, widening into a [[flood plain]] as it does. It bends north to pass another village park on the east, then north around that to divide the park from the residential area of Philipse Manor to its north. After flowing under the railroad tracks used by [[Metro-North]]'s [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] and [[Amtrak]]'s [[Empire Service (train)|Empire Service]], it flows under the entrance road to the county's Kingsland Point Park and empties into the [[Hudson River]].<ref name="USGS SH map" /><ref name="Lower PR Map" />

==Watershed==
The Pocantico's {{convert|16|sqmi|adj=on}} [[Drainage basin|watershed]] covers areas of [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]], [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], and New Castle, including Briarcliff Manor and Sleepy Hollow.<ref name="SHEAC"/> It includes {{convert|436|acre}} of mapped freshwater wetlands and eleven dams. Approximately 14,866 people live within the watershed. It is largely suburban, but also contains parks, forests and wildlife, highways, utilities, and institutions.<ref name="WatershedOverview"/>

==History==
[[File:Carl's Mill, Tarrytown, New York.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a forest, stream, and mill|''Carl's Mill on the Pocantico River, Sleepy Hollow'' by [[William Rickarby Miller]] in 1851, depicting a small mill on the river that was one of the ancient landmarks of the Sleepy Hollow; it vanished some time before 1893.{{efn|The mill was described as a ruin in 1899.<ref name="CarlsMill2"/>}}<ref name="CarlsMill"/>]]

The [[Wappinger|Weckquaesgeek]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe, who established their primary settlement around the mouth of a river in present-day [[Dobbs Ferry]], also had a village at the mouth of the Pocantico River called Alipconck, meaning "place of elms".<ref name="Scharf"/>{{rp|pages=11, 31}} The river historically set the dividing line between Mount Pleasant and Ossining.<ref name="Scharf"/>{{rp|page=6}}

The river was once called by the English as "the Mill river", while the Native Americans called it Pocanteco, a derivative of the Algonquin term PockÃ³hantÃ¨s, meaning a "run between two hills". The Dutch called it the Sleepy haven kill.<ref name="Bolton"/>{{rp|page=316}} Dutch colonist [[Adriaen van der Donck]]'s ''Beschrijvinge van Nieu Nederlandt'', published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1655, referred to the Pocantico River as "Slapershaven" (Sleepers' Haven).<ref name="Slapershaven"/> The [[anglicized]] term "Sleepy Hollow" grew to apply to the Pocantico's [[river valley]] and later to the village of North Tarrytown in particular; the village changed its official name to Sleepy Hollow in 1996.<ref name="SHHistory"/>

[[Frederick Philipse]] moved to the area and started purchasing land in the late 1600s, his properties would become known as [[Philipsburg Manor]]. He established his [[country seat]] at what was then known as North Tarrytown, at the mouth of the Pocantico River. A small community had already been established there when he arrived in 1683.<ref name="NRHPchurch"/>

A ship called the Roebuck, which transported cargo to and from New York City, ended up in the river, where its keel was scavenged by the miller at the mill of the [[Philipsburg Manor House]] site.<ref name="Bolton"/>{{rp|page=328}}

Around the late 1890s, [[Walter W. Law]] and [[Briarcliff Farms]] deepened the river for a length of {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}}, taking out the [[Ford (crossing)|rifts]] so the stream would flow and the swamps adjacent to the river would drain. The workers also cut rock and took out trees that lined the swamps to reclaim land for farming.<ref name="Social1">{{cite journal|title=Christmas Eve at Briarcliff Farms|journal=Social Service|date=January 1901|volume=3|number=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RDLAAAAMAAJ|pages=8â€“22|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref>

The [[North Tarrytown Assembly]], a large automobile factory in Sleepy Hollow, was owned and operated by [[General Motors]] for much of its history; a 1923 expansion of the facility involved land-filling the river; two-thirds of the factory site was land formerly occupied by the river. The river was rerouted south of the site.<ref name="GM"/>

During 1999's [[Hurricane Floyd]], the Pocantico was blocked by fallen trees and almost washed away the Philipsburg Manor historic site; about 70 employees of the parent organization [[Historic Hudson Valley]] assisted in its protection, along with the site's curators and security guards, and other village residents.<ref name="Floyd"/>

==Ecology and environment==
[[File:Weir chamber Sleepy Hollow.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A small rectangular stone building|A [[weir]] of the [[Old Croton Aqueduct]] in Sleepy Hollow; this weir functioned to divert water to the Pocantico River for aqueduct maintenance]]
The organization [[Riverkeeper]] collects samples in three Pocantico River tributaries. The river downstream of Pocantico Lake is a habitat for [[brown trout]].<ref name="Riverkeeper"/><ref name="NYSParks"/> The river is stocked each spring; 540 brown trout were stocked in 2013, and 630 were anticipated to be stocked in the river in 2014.<ref name="2013Stocking"/><ref name="2014Stocking"/> After a bacteria test completed on October 4, 2014, the river was found to have an ''[[Enterococcus]]'' bacteria count of greater than 2420, indicating high amounts of fecal matter in the water.<ref name="Riverkeeper"/> Other tests of the river quality at the mouth of the river in Sleepy Hollow also contain high levels of ''Enterococcus'' bacteria. In fact, the high bacteria counts throughout the river were taken both after wet and dry weather.<ref name="Riverkeeper"/> Dry weather tends to result in lower bacteria counts because less flooding results in less overflow from [[sewage treatment plant]]s.<ref name="Sandy"/> The high levels of bacteria in the river resulted in [[beach advisories]] for the entire river.<ref name="Riverkeeper"/> In 2014, $9.9 million was put aside to repair the Tarrytown sewage treatment plant in order to improve water quality in the region.<ref name="TreatmentPlant"/>

A Westchester County water quality study of the Pocantico River found that the chemical pollutants in the water met most of New York State Standards. The river met state standards on [[nitrate]] and [[phosphate]] levels, resulting in little [[cultural eutrophication]] in the water. Dissolved oxygen levels also met state standards with an average concentration of 9.853 milligrams per liter. Only the conductivity of the water failed state standards with conductivity levels averaging about three times the recommended levels.<ref name="WC Study"/>

[[American eel]]s enters the river from the Hudson every spring, moving upstream over the course of one to three years. The eels often accumulate under a dam in Sleepy Hollow, and approximately 10% make it past the dam. The eels move upstream where the habitat is preferable, with lower [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] pollution, fewer parasites, faster growth rates for the eels, and a higher percentage of females in the population. Other species in the river include [[white perch]], [[white sucker]], [[yellow perch]], [[golden shiner]], and [[Alewife]], only in small numbers.<ref name="MigratoryFishes"/>

The [[dÃ©nouement]] of "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" is set at a bridge over the Pocantico River in the area of the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow|Old Dutch Church and Burying Ground]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]].<ref name="Legend"/>{{efn|The bridge is presumed to be part of the Albany Post Road, now part of [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]]; at least five bridges are known to have stood there.<ref name="Legend"/>}} As well, [[Washington Irving]] makes frequent mention of the Pocantico River in Chronicle III of his short story anthology ''Wolfert's Roost''.<ref name="Wolfert's Roost"/>

{{quote|The delighted historian pursued his explorations far into the foldings of the hills where the Pocantico winds its wizard stream among the mazes of its old Indian haunts; sometimes running darkly in pieces of woodland beneath balancing sprays of beech and chestnut: sometimes sparkling between grassy borders in fresh green intervals; here and there receiving the tributes of silver rills which came whimpering down the hill sides from their parent springs. In a remote part of the Hollow, where the Pocantico forced its way down rugged rocks, stood Carl's mill, the haunted house of the neighborhood.|sign=Washington Irving|source=''Wolfert's Roost'', Chronicle III<ref name="Wolfert's Roost"/>}}
