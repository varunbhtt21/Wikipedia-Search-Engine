'''Timothy Andrea O'Neal''' (born August 3, 1972) is an American [[professional golfer]] who currently plays on [[PGA Tour Latinoamérica]], and previously on the [[Web.com Tour]].<ref name=web-profile /><ref name=ptla>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourla.com/golfers/300328/profile/?lg=en |title=Timothy O'Neal – Player Profile |publisher=[[PGA Tour Latinoamérica]] |access-date=April 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406203456/http://www.pgatourla.com/golfers/300328/profile/?lg=en |archive-date=April 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Amateur career==
Prior to turning professional, O'Neal had a distinguished amateur career winning 16 college tournaments during his time at [[Jackson State University]].<ref name=ptla /> He also won the Georgia Amateur Championship in 1997.<ref name=gsac>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsga.org/index.php/competitions/detail/georgia_amateur_championship_event_history |title=Georgia Amateur Championship Event History |publisher=Georgia State Golf Association |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427001852/http://www.gsga.org/index.php/competitions/detail/georgia_amateur_championship_event_history |archivedate=April 27, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

==Professional career==
For a very brief period early in his professional career, [[Will Smith]] sponsored O'Neal.<ref name=ptla /> O'Neal mainly played on U.S. mini-tours until receiving his [[Buy.com Tour]] card for the 2001 season (now named Web.com Tour), having missed out on a [[PGA Tour]] card at [[qualifying school]] by a single stroke following a double bogey on the final hole.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/10090314/tim-oneal-seeks-pga-tour-dream-via-q-school-golf |title=Tim O'Neal seeks PGA Tour dream |work=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref> O'Neal had a tough first season on the tour recording only two top-10 finishes ending 59th on the money list. In the following season, O'Neal only played three events on the Buy.com Tour and lost his tour card for the 2003 season.<ref name=web.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.23175.timothy-o-neal.html/career |title=Timothy O'Neal – Career Summary |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>

In 2004, O'Neal once again missed out on a [[PGA Tour]] card at qualifying school by a single stroke but in doing so regained his playing rights for the [[Nationwide Tour]] for the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/120904/spg_17396521.shtml |title=Tour Notebook: Tour qualifier full of unfortunate finishes |publisher=Jacksonville.com |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>

The return to the Nationwide Tour proved more successful and during the 2005 season O'Neal recorded his best finish to date, a second place at the 2005 [[Northeast Pennsylvania Classic]].<ref name=web-profile>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.23175.timothy-o-neal.html/profile |title=Timothy O'Neal – Web.com Profile |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref> O'Neal maintained his good form throughout 2005 and 2006 finishing 44th and 36th on the tour money lists respectively. However his form dropped in 2007 and 2008 and he was unable to retain his card following the 2008 season.<ref name=web.com />

O'Neal's career started to falter after losing his Nationwide Tour privileges. He also played on the [[Asian Tour]], [[eGolf Professional Tour]], the [[EPD Tour]], and the Morocco-based Atlas Pro Tour. In 2011, O'Neal was asked to take over the Jackson State golf program, but he declined. He has yet to become a swing instructor.

In 2013, O'Neal took up playing rights on [[PGA Tour Latinoamérica]] and had instant success winning the [[Arturo Calle Colombian Open]] and the [[Abierto de Chile]] in his first season on the tour.<ref name= ACCO2013>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourla.com/finalresults/m2013007/?lg=en#.U1rZDFw37eI |title=Arturo Calle Colombian Open presentado por Diners Club – 2013 Leaderboard |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref><ref name=AdC2013>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourla.com/finalresults/m2013007/?lg=en#.U1rZDFw37eI |title=Abierto de Chile – 2013 Leaderboard |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref> These wins together assisted O'Neal to a third place finish on the PGA Tour Latinoamérica Order of Merit which was sufficient for him to regain his tour card for the [[2014 Web.com Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatourla.com/orderofmerit/2013/?lg=en#.U1rZrFw37eI |title=Abierto de Chile – 2013 Order of Merit |publisher=[[PGA Tour]] |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>

At age 42, O'Neal finally played his in first PGA Tour event after qualifying for the [[2015 U.S. Open (golf)|2015 U.S. Open]], where he missed the cut.
