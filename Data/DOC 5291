|blurb='''[[List of parasites of the marsh rice rat|A variety of parasites]]''' have been recorded from the [[marsh rice rat]], a [[List of semiaquatic organisms|semiaquatic]] rodent found in the eastern and southern United States. Some of these [[Parasitism|parasites]] are endoparasites, internal parasites, while others are ectoparasites, external parasites. In a 1988 study, [[Parasitology|parasitologist]] John Kinsella found a total of 45 endoparasites in marsh rice rats, a number unequaled in rodents. This may be related to the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as [[intermediate host]]s of various parasites. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the [[nematode]] ''[[Aonchotheca forresteri]]'', other parasite species, such as the [[Amblyomma americanum|lone star tick]] ''(pictured)'', are shared with other mammals. Four [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] are known from the marsh rice rat. ''[[Borrelia]]'', the [[Bacteria|bacterium]] that causes [[Lyme disease]], has been identified in some [[tick]]s that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible [[natural reservoir]] for ''Borrelia''.
