'''Joseph Ponsford Bickerton Jr.''' (15 July 1878 – 20 August 1936) was an attorney and theatrical producer.

==Early years and education==
Joseph P. Bickerton Jr.  was the son of Joseph Ponsford Bickerton, a salesman, and Emma P. Jaques. Joseph Junior studied at Princeton University, but had to leave for financial reasons during his freshman year. He became a lawyer after working in law offices without having attended law school.<ref>J. P. Bickerton Dies; Lawyer, Stage Producer: Never Went to Law School. ''New York Herald Tribune''.

Bickerton managed the career of actor [[Charley Grapewin]], on tour with a play called "Above the Limit". The play
closed, leaving  Bickerton with a full set of scenery on his hands. He thereupon sat down and wrote a play to fit the scenery, entitled "The House on the Bluff," which was profitable. With the proceeds, he organized the Jungle Film Corporation in 1910 and bought the African hunt motion pictures which [[Paul J. Rainey]], a wealthy explorer, had made during a pleasure expedition. These films were the first motion pictures to be produced at regular theater prices and were successful in the U.S. and abroad.<ref>Meet JP Bickerton Jr. ''New York Times''. September 11, 1932</ref>

Among Bickerton's clients were [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], [[David Belasco]], [[Elmer Rice]], [[George Abbott]], [[Philip Dunning]], [[Sidney Kingsley]] and [[Ed Wynn]].<ref>Joe Bickerton Dies at 58; Was Central Cog of all Legit Biz.

==Arbitrator==
Bickerton enjoyed the confidence of producers, actors and playwrights to such a degree that they brought him their disputes to arbitrate. Bickerton devised the minimum basic agreement in 1926, which ended the struggle over the screen sale of stage plays at a time when the playwrights were talking of a strike against the producers. Thereafter  Bickerton was elected and re-elected during the last ten years of his life to be the arbiter of any further disputes between members of the Dramatists Guild of America and the producing managers. The sales of all their stage shows to Hollywood from 1926 until Bickerton's death passed through his hands.<ref>JP Bickerton Jr. Attorney, 58 dies. ''New York Times''. August 21, 1936</ref>

==Death==
Bickerton died in 1936.

==Family==
Bickerton's wife, Lois Tabor, had been an actress for [[David Belasco]] and a model for artist [[Howard Chandler Christy]].<ref>MISS LOIS TABER (sic) A BRIDE.; Former Actress Is Wedded to Joseph P. Bickerton Jr., a Lawyer. ''New York Times'' Jan 16, 1910</ref>
