:<small>''Nominator(s): [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 22:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)''</small>

These "epoch" warships were the first [[dreadnought]]s fielded by the United States Navy. Congressionally-mandated weight restrictions (some two to three thousand tons less than the earlier British ''Dreadnought'') were the impetus for some of the class' many innovations, but they also led to their uselessness during the First World War—their comparatively slow speed limited them to convoy escorting and home defense, tasks also assigned to completely obsolete battleships. Their ignominious careers were ended alongside dozens of other warships by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].

This article's [[Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/South_Carolina-class_battleship/archive1|first FAC]] was not promoted after I ran into several real-life obligations and was unable to address the worthy criticism. Thankfully, I have much more time now. While the style of this article may be a bit unusual, I've made many of the same choices (including the collapsed infobox) in previous FACs, such as {{sclass-|Pennsylvania|battleship|1}}. My thanks in advance for all constructive criticism.  [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 22:25, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Image review'''
*Why does some "courtesy" caption links go directly to the source and others only to the image description page?
*File:Brassey's1912_South-Carolina.png: needs US PD tag, and if the artist is unknown how do we know they died more than 70 years ago? [[User:Nikkimaria|Nikkimaria]] ([[User talk:Nikkimaria|talk]]) 13:33, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
**Hey {{u|Nikkimaria}}, thanks for the image check. I've fixed the ''Brassey's'' image with the date of the illustrator's death; it was previously found for [[:File:Brassey's_HMS_Canada_Plan_(1915).jpg]] by {{u|Jappalang}}. The courtesy links vary because some of them were uploaded by NARA specifically for this article and are not on their website.

'''Comments'''
*See no need for humongous image at top of mistakenly shrunken infobox.
*Shrink the line drawing and why are all of these photos upright 1.4? They're far larger than normal and I don't see any real point to doing so.
*Are these ships "shes" or "its"? The former is customary.
*You're using the ship names far too much, mix them up with a few pronouns and "the ship".
*Shouldn't eastern seaboard be capitalized as a proper noun?
*Spell out state abbreviations for those outside the US. More later.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 15:18, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*Split out |ship power from |ship propulsion and put ihp and # of boilers in ship power. Add # of shafts and engines to ship propulsion. Tell the reader that VTE engines are steam engines.
*Link knots, nautical miles, boiler (once added) and add hyphen for triple expansion engine when spelled out as it's a compound adjective.
*Abbreviate nautical miles and limit conversions from feet/inches to just one digit after the decimal, not the template's default.
*Data for armor is inconsistently presented and converted.
*Link and add an explanatory note for caliber like I had to do for [[Lexington-class aircraft carrier]].
*Provide a more exact scrapping or disposal date in the Ships table.
*Specifications for Possible need to use US spellings not the template's default British spelling.
*Figures for draft differ between Specifications section and infobox.
*{{xt|lower than HMS Dreadnought, the namesake British ship built shortly before the South Carolinas}} This is awkward.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 04:41, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
**Thanks Sturm. I've seen these comments and will address them as soon as I can. [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 16:28, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
**Replies are in order:
**@1 and 2, it's a stylistic choice. The images and thumbnail size are like postage stamps, with little detail open to being seen. I like seeing details w/o clicking. :-) As for the collapsed infobox, it's to allow more room for imagery. All of the specifications are available with either one click or farther down in prose form.
***[[Template:Infobox ship begin/Usage guide]] says: "The standard size for infobox images is 300px. Different values may be used, but you should only do so if absolutely necessary."
***I see absolutely no reason why the infobox image should differ from the standard 300px. I'm far more willing to grant much more freedom to vary sizes for later images.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 10:15, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
***The first, and most important bit of info, that the line drawing will convey is the general layout of the ship, such as turret and mast locations, etc. The only thing that you lose by using the default size is armor thickness and the stuff at the bottom, which should arguably be cropped as redundant to the infobox. This image dominates the entire article and for no good purpose, IMO.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 10:15, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
****I'll cut down the line drawing image; you're probably right in it dominating the surrounding text. I still don't agree on the infobox image, but can we compromise at 350px? [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 20:42, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*****What do you really gain by the extra 50 pixels? Most of what I can see now at the current size is the silhouette of the ship, details of the cage masts, some boats and the gun casemates. Most all of that will be retained if you use the standard 300 px size.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 14:35, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
**I've gone with "its" to be more formal. The only "she" is in the quote from Friedman, which I'm not allowed to change!
**That's a really good point, especially in the specifications. I'll be addressing this.
**[[User:Tony1|Tony]] or [[User:Dank|Dank]]: eastern seaboard or Eastern Seaboard (of the US)? I think Sturm's right here.
***Eastern Seaboard. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 23:36, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
****Thanks {{u|Dank}}—do you have any advice on vertical-triple-expansion vs vertical triple-expansion and the last point? [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 23:33, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*****I'm generally not comfortable with hyphen advice (except in cases where we can just look it up). If you're asking about "its", just the fact that ''AP Stylebook'' recommends it means that 90% of copyedited text in this country goes with "its". But I buy the argument that "her" might convey a certain intimacy with the source material ... and whether that's the tone you're going for is up to you. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 00:00, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
******Thanks, Dank! [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 22:53, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
**I don't see any state abbreviations? Or am I just blind?
***No, in your refs.
****To be clear, you're asking me to spelling out "Washington, District of Columbia" for "Washington, DC"? :-) [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 20:42, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
*****Nah, that one you can leave alone, but the others should be spelled out.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 14:35, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
******Done. [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 03:33, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
**Done.
**Done in the infobox. Is it vertical-triple-expansion or vertical triple-expansion?
**Done, I believe?
*******Vertical is a separate adjective from triple expansion as there were horizontal multiple-expansion engines, so it's vertical triple-expansion steam engines.

***{{ping|Sturmvogel 66}} I've either replied or addressed all of your points, with the exception of the state abbreviations and the hyphens. How do they look? [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 22:56, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
****Simply as a point for future use, the template for knot automatically converts into kmh and mph; save yourself some unnecessary typing.
****I think that it's a good idea to link terminology like knot and nautical mile in both the infobox and main body.
****When people read engine I believe that they're automatically gonna think internal combustion engine so you simply can't say just triple-expansion engine; you have to specify that it's a steam engine.
****I don't think that it's well covered in Friedman, but at least a mention of how the Americans moved their gun sights in the main gun turrets to either the side or the front of the turret (I forget which, off-hand) is worthy of mention. It was almost another decade before the Brits and Japanese stopped using roof-top gunsights that weakened the roof armor and could deafen the gunners in lower turrets when the superfiring guns fired above them. 
****I fixed a couple of the points above for you and cut back a couple of the unnecessary decimal places as well as I tend to be fussier about specifications, etc. than most. Still have to get to the meat of the article, though.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 10:15, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

**Where?
*Trials section is a bit too detailed, IMO, other than the damage sustained during them. Done up to service history.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 14:35, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
**I disagree. I could trim it down a bit around the damage, but then we lose the context. ''South Carolina''{{'}}s trials are only a few sentences long. [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 03:33, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
***Dude, you've got more information on the trials than you do for their armament and armor, combined! We're an encyclopedia and not supposed to include every fact that you run across just because we're not paper. I've been having a discussion with another editor over on the talk page of {{HMS|Indomitable|R10|6}} where he wants to add the ship's displacement and rpm count to the trials info. Simply because it's been made available by one author, even though it's been ignored by all the rest. The average reader doesn't care about that info, nor will zhe care about the dates of the subsequent trials or even the various types of trials conducted.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 04:18, 9 June 2014 (UTC)
***Still waiting on response/action on image issues. Why credit every image, why so big, why link to NARA more than once, etc.?
****Yes, but tell me where I should cut it down? ''Michigan''s trials are documented because of the multiple damages. Otherwise there's one paragraph about the launch ceremonies, a short paragraph listing what the builders had to meet on the trials, one sentence on ''Michigan''{{'}}s commissioning, then a few sentences on ''South Carolina''{{'}}s trials and commissioning. Conceivably, I could remove some information in the last paragraph, but cutting anything from the ''Michigan'' paragraph would cause the damages to lose context (hence my previous comment, if that wasn't clear!).
*****I think that you're overthinking things; it's actually pretty easy. Delete the entire short para about the specifics of the trials and just say that Michigan ran aground during the trials, damaging her propellers. And then give the top speed made by each ship. I cover trials in about two sentences in my articles, so the readers lose nothing by compressing this absurd amount of detail down that much. The funny thing is that {{User0|Damwiki1}} who wants even more details added about trials would probably say that you've got too much of the wrong sort of info here as you don't mention ship displacement, horsepower and rpm counts. To sum up I normally cover construction and trials in a paragraph or so, so I don't see any issues with in doing the same here. IMO, you've given far too much weight to the trials than they deserve since it's about 2/3s the length of the entire service section.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 22:32, 14 June 2014 (UTC) 
******{{ping|Sturmvogel 66}} Sorry for not seeing this sooner; I didn't realize that you replied in-line. I've shortened the paragraph in question! [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 02:49, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
****On the images, I do it because NARA has uploaded images specifically for this article. I've done it in previous FAs of mine with no complaint. As for the sizes, [[WP:IMGSIZE]] says that there should be a "good reason" to do so. That's not a high hurdle to clear. The postage stamp-sized default thumbnail size does not show the detail that I'd like for historical images that are of this high of quality (in pixels and clarity).

*****I counted two or so images that Dominic loaded for you this year. The other images are usually far older. I have no particular issue mentioning the source if they were special requests, but the others should not be mentioned as per the usual practice. I regret not mentioning the image issues in the Pennsy-class article, but you were so insistent on the hidden infobox that I figured it was a waste of time, much as it seems to be proving here.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 22:32, 14 June 2014 (UTC)

{{od}} This is all the info I gave on the Ise class for their trials, from the propulsion section: {{xt|Both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed of 23 knots (43 km/h; 26 mph) during their sea trials; Ise reached 23.6 knots (43.7 km/h; 27.2 mph) from 56,498 shp (42,131 kW) and Hyūga exceeded that with 24 knots (44 km/h; 28 mph) from 63,211 shp (47,136 kW)}}. I see no need for all of the excessive detail on their trials. Michigan's grounding arguably could be covered in the individual ship article rather than here, but typically I give dates for their trials in the individual ship articles as it's not particularly relevant for a class article, IMO. Why do you think that this plethora of info is worth including here? Simply because it's available? As far as I can tell the info here exceeds the coverage given the trials of virtually every other ship class article on Wiki, battleship or not. IMO the coverage that you had on the trials in your last FA, the Pennsylvania-class BBs, is about right.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 05:04, 14 July 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|Sturmvogel 66}} ... none of those ships were damaged on their trial runs, were they? :-) I've [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Carolina-class_battleship&diff=616978153&oldid=615893037 shortened] both paragraphs in question more. I'd like to keep the short paragraph with what they were contractually obligated to do, as that's rather important information.

::The detailed info on the format of the trials is pretty much the same for what the RN did and is likely similar for all navies of the period, so why is it important for these ships as opposed to any other class? If there was more organized information as to what was involved for more navies, I could see a worthwhile comparative article on the different practices for trials of different navies. That could cover differences between various measured miles, French and Italian practices of running trials without armament to increase reported top speeds, use of best-quality coals and additional stokers for the RN, etc. But as an isolated bit in one article, the info is mildly interesting at best and lacks context. Honestly, I think that you're enamored with this info because you've not seen it anywhere else and thus think that it's worth incorporating into this article. Remember Wiki's scope, we don't add every single bit of info that we discover; we have to pick and choose the most important bits lest general readers get bogged down in a forest of details and miss the important stuff. And I think that the trials info is far less important than the development history, technical specs and service histories of this class. Personally, I wouldn't bother with Michigan's grounding here, but I can see your point and have no problem with it remaining.--[[User:Sturmvogel 66|Sturmvogel 66]] ([[User talk:Sturmvogel 66|talk]]) 04:19, 15 July 2014 (UTC)

*As I said in the first FAC, I don't care for the collapsed infobox. I understand that you want room for images, but even with the box expanded, there's plenty of room for the photo of ''New Hampshire'' before it runs into the line drawing at the bottom of the section. You'd need a rather wide screen for that to be a problem, and you could shorten the infobox some by removing the cost figures (which are next to useless to readers, since they cannot be easily converted to 2014 dollars) and the note on the source of figures (which could easily be converted into a footnote and placed elsewhere, such as the "General characteristics" line of the box). You could also stand to lose the ship type field as well.
**Done. I wrestled with the sourcing note as well, but I don't really have another place to put it, as it applies to the whole infobox. [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 05:08, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

*{{xt|"As the superfiring arrangement used a great amount of space within each already-limited ship..."}} - did it use more space than the 5 turrets of ''Dreadnought'' or the eight of ''Satsuma''? Or more compared to the Italian ''Dante Alighieri'' or Russian ''Gangut''? What I'm getting at is, was it the superfiring arrangement that took up more space or simply the fact that it was twice as many 12" guns, with twice as many corresponding magazines, shell rooms, etc. that caused the space crunch?
**It was a combination of factors. The superfiring/centerline arrangement took up space that had been previously devoted to boilers, for instance. The ship could have been made bigger/longer to compensate, I suppose, but the congressional displacement limit would be broken by a larger ship.

***Right, but what I'm getting at is whether the superfiring arrangement took up more of the ship's volume than 4 turrets in a different arrangement (say the lozenge of the ''Invincible''s) would have taken up. As it reads now, it suggests that four turrets in a superfiring arrangement took up more space than the equivalent number of heavy guns in ''Invincible'' - which is to say, the internal volume problem was one of arrangement, rather than the simple fact that 4 large barbettes/shell rooms/magazines/etc. requires more room than 2 of them. Does my question make sense? [[User:Parsecboy|Parsecboy]] ([[User talk:Parsecboy|talk]]) 15:24, 20 June 2014 (UTC)
****{{ping|Parsecboy}} I don't think we're making it clear to each other. :-) First, Friedman doesn't say what would use up more space. However, in a ship that was already shortened due to congressional weight restrictions and being designed by individuals who were used to only having to place two main turrets on the centerline, the superfiring arrangement took up far more space than they were used to, requiring them to move many traditional locations (the boiler room, for one).

*****I think you've answered my question - if so, then it should be reworded to something like "As the additional main battery turrets with their associated magazines used a great amount of space within each already-limited ship..." - the point being to make clear that it was the additional number of main battery turrets, not the particular arrangement, that was responsible for the space problem. What you have now won't be an issue for most readers, but to those of us "in the know", it would suggest that the superfiring arrangement was particularly wasteful of space as compared to other arrangements.

*It seems to me that it would be best to concentrate the discussion of the merits of the superfiring arrangement in one place - right now it's spread out a bit in the design section and then a bit more in the characteristics section.
**Done, I believe? [[User:The ed17|Ed]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:The ed17|[talk]]]&nbsp;[[WP:OMT|[majestic titan]]]</sup> 05:08, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
*Did experience with the ''Kearsarge'' or ''Rhode Island'' classes play any role in the adoption of superfiring turrets? These ships didn't have superfiring guns per se, but from what I understand they were rather unsuccessful and might have caused some opposition to a superfiring arrangement.
**That's actually something I looked for while writing up the background. While it would stand to reason that those ships would comw up, Friedman doesn't mention them even once in ''US Battleships''. The main controversy came from C&R's insistence that mixed batteries were fine; or as Friedman puts it, "The bureau also observed sarcastically that quite competent authorities had been happy enough with a mixed battery only a short time before ..." My suspicion is that while they seem similar, the reality was different enough to lead detractors to focus on different topics.

*{{xt|"due to their top speeds, which were lower than the later Standard-type battleships"}} - the Standards only started with the ''Nevada''s (i.e., the second generation of US dreadnoughts) - all of the rest of the first generation (''Delaware'' to ''New York'' classes) were 21-knotters (and it was the 1st gen ships that did the bulk of USN service in Europe in WWI).

*One other thing occurs to me upon re-reading the introduction - it really ought to mention the superfiring arrangement. ''Dreadnought'' was the first in service with the all-big-gun arrangement (though her real innovation was the use of turbines in a large warship) but the superfiring, all-centerline arrangement was also a major step forward (and was only employed in the other major navies several years later).
