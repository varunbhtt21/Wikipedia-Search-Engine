'''Alfred Edwin Jones''' (1894–1973) was an eminent Irish architect. His collection of files about Irish architects formed the basis of the ''[[Dictionary of Irish Architects]] 1720–1940''.

== Childhood and youth==
'''Alfred Edwin Jones''',  only son of Felix Thomas Jones and Mary Mitchell, was  born in Shorncliff, Kent, England,  on 14 August 1894. He spent his early childhood in Rawalpindi where his father was a sergeant major in the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards. On his father's retirement from the service in 1895 the family moved to Dublin, Ireland.<ref name=ISA>[http://www.ucd.ie/archives/isa/newsletter/isa-newsletter0903_dia.html Irish Architectural Archive – Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720–1940]</ref> Educated by the Jesuits at [[Belvedere College]], Alfred pursued a variety of careers before becoming apprenticed to the architectural practice of Ashlin & Coleman c. 1911. He first attracted notice about this time when his measured drawing of the ceiling of Belvedere's Apollo Room was featured in the ''[[Irish Builder]]''. A design for an iron railing and gate which won him the Gold Medal at the Father Matthew Feis, two years later, was published in the same journal. Earlier illustrations by Jones had appeared in the third, fourth and fifth volumes of the ''Irish Georgian Society Records'' (1911–1913). By 1914 he was an assistant in the practice of Rudolf Maximilian Butler with a growing reputation. In 1918 his drawings of the Marino Casino won him the ''Downes Bronze Medal'' of the [[Architectural Association of Ireland]], according to the judges, ' one of the finest specimens of draughtsmanship ever produced by a member of the Association'.<ref>Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720–1940</ref>

==Professional career==
===Early years===
In 1919 Jones spent some months in partnership with Aubrey Vincent O’Rourke. Later that year he set up practice with Stephen Stanislaus Kelly whom he had known since childhood. In 1920 they won  the competition for Ballymena Town Hall,<ref>http://archiseek.com/2014/town-hall-ballymena-co-antrim/#.VMlK3C7wZx9, accessed 27 January 2015</ref> and in 1923  were winners of the [[Cork City Hall]] design competition.<ref>Spalding, Thomas, A guide to Cork’s 20th century architecture, Dublin, 2012, 99; McDermott, Matthew J (with Aodhagan Brioscu), Ireland’s architectural heritage: an outline of the Irish architecture, Dublin, 1975, 118; O’Regan, John, ed., Michael Scott, 1905–1989, 53–54, 69</ref> They remained in practice, under the title 'Jones & Kelly' until Kelly's  death in 1951. Subsequently, Jones took his son Felix Alfred Jones and his elder daughter, Elisabeth Fleming, into partnership, providing consultancy services to the firm for the remaining years of his life.

===Mature years===
Alfred Jones & Stephen Kelly had a wide-ranging practice, involving the design of ecclesiastical and educational structures as well as cinemas, theatres, manufacturing plants, commercial buildings and housing schemes. Among their most notable achievements were:  'Screen Cinema, Eden Quay, Dublin (1920, 1930;<ref>Archiseek.com/10/2010/1920, accessed 27 January 2015 (internal alterations, 1930)</ref> Ballymena Town Hall, Co Antrim (1928); Church of the Four Masters, Friary, Athlone, Co.

For the first quarter century of its existence Jones & Kelly was a practice of the old school, offering apprenticeships to applicants, over a hundred of who were indentured until the mid 1940s. Several were later to become notable Irish architects, including  ''Timothy Joseph Ahern, Basil Boyd Barrett, Rupert Boyd Barrett, Jackie Collins, John Peter Butler, Vincent Gallagher, Patrick F. McDonnell, Dermot O’Dwyer, Donal O’Dwyer'' and [[Michael Scott (architect)|Michael Scott]]. The latter who worked in the practice between 1923–1926, and much later designed Dublin's [[Busáras]] (bus station) and other buildings in the modern style, regarded Jones & Kelly's preoccupation with the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]] or [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] as a straitjacket which was out of date and outmoded.<ref>Michael Scott 1909–1985, (ed. O'Regan) 53</ref>

== Wider  interests==
Alfred Jones was a man whose interests ranged well beyond the  confines of his profession to embrace the historical, artistic and sporting. He had a lifelong interest in Archaeology and Egyptology. In the last decades of his life he  devoted much of his time in producing   a comprehensive  biographical index of Irish architects and engineers. He also trawled the ''[[Irish Builder]]'' for interesting material, transcribing his findings. The results of this labour, deposited in 1980, are now are to be found in the ''[[Irish Architectural Archive]]'', and are central to the Archive's database of Irish architects from 1720 to 1940.<ref>Dictionary of Irish Architects, 1720–1980</ref> Fittingly his portrait adorns the I.A.A. reading room with an inscription paying tribute to the wealth and quality of his research. Alfred Jones was also a philatelist and possessed a highly regarded collection of early French and French Colonial stamps. In addition he was a violinist who as a young man was known to have performed in the La Scala Theatre, Dublin.  His sporting interests included life membership of the Old Belvedere Rugby Football Club and the [[Irish Amateur Boxing Association]] whose home (the National Stadium) had been designed by Jones & Kelly. Alfred was also a trustee of the organisation and served as its President for over 20 years.<ref>Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720–1980</ref>

== Death ==
Dying on 29 June 1973 Alfred Jones was interred in the cemetery at Tallaght, County Dublin, on 2 July. He was survived by  his wife  of 50 years Mary (née Ardiff) (1892–1986), and by his three children: Elizabeth, Felix, and Marie, a distinguished musician. Elizabeth and Felix maintained the practice of Jones & Kelly after their father's death.
