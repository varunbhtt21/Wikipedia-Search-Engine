:({{Find sources|Iron solomon}})
Rapper whose article makes no substantive or [[WP:RS|properly sourced]] claim of [[WP:N|notability]] sufficient to pass [[WP:NMUSIC]] — it just asserts that he exists and has released an album, and is sourced ''only'' to non-notable blogs and [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCES|primary sources]] (i.e. his own social media profiles). I'm willing to withdraw this if a ''substantive'' claim of notability, sourced to ''proper'' sources, can be provided — but this version, as written, ain't cutting it. '''Delete'''.

I'm not clear what your rationale is. Bad articles should be improved by volunteers at the point of a gun? Nothing suggests you were interested in whether or not he was notable at any point. [[Special:Contributions/78.18.102.158|78.18.102.158]] ([[User talk:78.18.102.158|talk]]) 01:28, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:My point is that the article fails to demonstrate, through the use of [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], that he actually meets our inclusion rules for the [[WP:NMUSIC|notability of musicians]]. It isn't my job to "be interested in whether or not he was notable at any point", if that requires speculative guessing that isn't reflected in the article as written. The onus is on the writer of the article to demonstrate that he ''is'' notable enough to pass our inclusion standards — not on Wikipedia to keep an article that, as written, fails to meet our standards just because one anonymous IP thinks (wrongly) that a gun is somehow being pointed at their head. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 22:11, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::notability is a property of the subject, not the article. So yes, it is your job. nobody at afd is interested in your reviews of articles. [[Special:Contributions/78.19.99.71|78.19.99.71]] ([[User talk:78.19.99.71|talk]]) 23:16, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
::The onus is not on the writer(s) of the article to demonstrate notability (though it helps), beyond the bare minimum [[WP:CSD]] [[WP:A7|A7]] and [[WP:A9|A9]] criteria. The AfD nominator is expected to check for sources: see [[WP:BEFORE]] &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 17:09, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Yes, the onus ''is'' on the writer to at ''least'' demonstrate and source enough notability to at ''least'' get the person past A7 and A9 (which this article, as written, did not — it was in fact entirely speediable as written, with the fact that it was two years old already being the ''only'' reason I opted to take this route instead of pulling the speedy trigger on it.) And I ''did'' follow [[WP:BEFORE]] enough to know that while outside sourcing isn't ''entirely'' nonexistent, there isn't ''enough'' of it to actually get him past [[WP:GNG]] in any substantive way (even you acknowledge in your comment below that the sourcing you found is "not spectacular".) [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 18:47, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
::::It was most certainly not speediable as A7 (or A9, which doesn't apply). A7 specifically says "The criterion does '''not''' apply to any article that makes '''any credible claim of significance or importance''' even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify on Wikipedia's notability guidelines." (bold in the original). That "even if" clause is important: no sources need to be provided in order to meet that minimal standard. As far as GNG goes, "not spectacular" is not the same as "not significant". There are multiple sources, independent of the subject, which discuss the subject as more than a passing mention. That's GNG. "Not spectacular" was me being self-deprecating about my cursory search. &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 21:30, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::It most certainly ''was'' speediable, as it ''does not'' make any actual claim of ''significance'' at all — as written, it fails to actually claim anything beyond "this person exists", which is not the same thing. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 21:36, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' and '''move''' to [[Iron Solomon]]. I found a few sources just in the first page of results from googling him, though they're not spectacular: [http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/the-25-greatest-rap-battles-on-youtube/e-ness-iron-solomon] from [[Complex Magazine]] (review of a rap battle he participated in), [http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/iron-solomon-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-5-best-rap-battles/] also from Complex (mostly an interview, but the first page is a brief history of his career), and [http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2012/03/06/iron-solomon-and-the-business-of-battle-rap/] from [[Forbes]] of all things. Past the first page I get [http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2012/08/murda-mook-defeats-iron-solomon-in-ultimate-rap-leagues-summer-madness-2-battle-event/] from [[XXL Magazine]], [http://www.vibe.com/article/murda-mook-talks-defeating-iron-solomon-and-his-most-debated-rap-battle] from [[Vibe Magazine]] (interview with another rapper who beat him in a battle). I think that meets [[WP:BAND]]#1. I also ran across [http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Article/rap-up-volume-38-021243147969674]. I should also note that the label he's on, [[Duck Down Music Inc.]], is clearly notable, though since he appears to only have one album so far he doesn't meet BAND#5. The article should be moved to fix capitalization. &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 16:47, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Delete''' doesn't meet [[WP:ARTIST]]. No independent references just a few links to the artist's own website/facebook page [[User:Rehnn83|Rehnn83]] <sup>[[User Talk:Rehnn83|Talk]]</sup> 15:49, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:If I may ask, how are the references I found not independent? &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 16:27, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
::The artist's own twitter pager, facebook page and Yout Tube Channel are not independent. The first reference is actually a link to the artist's record label/publisher so that's not independat. -[[User:Rehnn83|Rehnn83]] <sup>[[User Talk:Rehnn83|Talk]]</sup> 18:27, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I'm referring to the references I found that I linked in this discussion, the ones from Complex, Forbes, XXL, and Vibe. &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 22:32, 14 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' and '''move''' to [[Iron Solomon]] per [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] [[User:Solarra|<font color="#FC89AC" face="Comic Sans MS">'''♥ Solarra ♥'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Solarra|<font color="green">♪ Talk ♪</font>]]</sup>  ߷  <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Solarra|<font color="darkgreen">♀ Contribs ♀</font>]]</sub> 05:46, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' and move per Gwalla.  Some of the sources that he's found don't go into enough depth to establish notability; but the ''Forbes'' piece and the ''Complex'' profile amply satisfy the notability criteria: coverage in some detail, in independent widely-circulated reputable media.  [[User:Ammodramus|Ammodramus]] ([[User talk:Ammodramus|talk]]) 15:22, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' and move to proper capitalization. Gwalla's links (Complex, Forbes, XXL, etc.) are dedicated coverage and sufficient for the [[WP:GNG|GNG]]. <span style='font:1.1em"Avenir";padding:1px 3px;border:1px solid #909;color:#909'>czar&nbsp;[[User:Czar|<font color="#909">♔</font>]]</span> 15:43, 24 May 2014 (UTC)
