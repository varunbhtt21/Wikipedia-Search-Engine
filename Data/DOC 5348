== VisualOn AAC Encoder ==
VisualOn provided a simple [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) encoder in early versions of [[Android (operating system)|Android]].<ref>{{cite web|title=VisualOn AAC encoder source code|url=https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-4.0.4_r2.1/media/libstagefright/codecs/aacenc/|website=Android Git|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> The encoder was derived from the [[3GPP]] reference encoder<ref>{{cite web|title=libstagefright AAC decoder legality should be checked/clarified|url=https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=16431|website=Android Issue Tracker|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> and supported only the AAC-LC profile in mono or stereo. Google added a more advanced [[Fraunhofer FDK AAC|AAC codec library]] to Android as of the 4.1 ''Jelly Bean'' release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discussion regarding the release of the Fraunhofer FDK encoder|url=http://www.hydrogenaud.io/forums/index.php?showtopic=95989|website=Hydrogen Audio|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> The VisualOn encoder remains in the Android source code, but development appears to have ended. VisualOn no longer markets any commercial encoder products. VisualOn software codecs listed on its website are software based decoders and not encoders.

A cross-platform source distribution is maintained by Martin Storsj√∂ as vo-aacenc. The latest vo-aacenc release is 0.1.3 (2013-07-27).<ref>{{cite web|title=vo-aacenc Releases|url=https://github.com/mstorsjo/vo-aacenc/releases|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> The code compiles into a shared library, libvo-aacenc. The media frameworks [[FFmpeg]] and [[Libav]] support audio encoding through libvoaac-enc.<ref>{{cite web|title=AAC Encoding Guide|url=https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/AAC#libvo_aacenc|website=FFmpeg documentation|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Encoding AAC|url=https://wiki.libav.org/Encoding/aac|website=Libav documentation|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>

The VisualOn AAC encoder has been shown to be very low quality in [[ABX test]]ing.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Kamedo2|title=FFmpeg native encoder quality assessment|url=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kamedo2/20120729/1343545890|accessdate=5 January 2015|language=ja|date=2012-07-29}}</ref> Of the four AAC encoders that can be used by FFmpeg, it is the least recommended option.<ref>{{cite web|title=AAC Encoding Guide/FAQ|url=https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/AAC#WhichencodershouldIuseWhatprovidesthebestquality|website=FFmpeg documentation|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>
