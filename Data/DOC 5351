==Innocence of Muslims==
The anti-Islamic film that was written and produced by [[Nakoula Basseley Nakoula|Nakoula Bassely Nakoula]], was uploaded in two versions to YouTube in July 2012 under the titles The Real Life of Muhammad and The Muhammad Movie Trailer.<ref>Zachary Zahos (September 19, 2012). "[http://cornellsun.com The Art of Defamation]". The Cornell Daily Sun. Retrieved 15 April 2014.</ref> The videos were dubbed in the Arabic language and anti-Islamic content was added in post-production without the consent of the actors who starred in the film.<ref>Dan Murphy (September 12, 2012).

The original script was written about life in Egypt 2,000 years ago but with the overdubbing and heavy use of the phrase “Muhammad,” The New York Times stated: “the trailer opens with scenes of Egyptian security forces standing idle as Muslims pillage and burn the homes of Egyptian Christians. Then it cuts to cartoonish scenes depicting Muhammad as a child of uncertain parentage, a buffoon, a womanizer, a homosexual, a child molester and a greedy, bloodthirsty thug.”<ref>David D.
