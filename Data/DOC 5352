'''''I, Detective''''' is an American [[documentary]]-style series that aired on Court TV (now [[truTV]]) from 2001 to 2006.

For a time in early 2014, the show returned in reruns on sister network [[HLN (TV channel)|HLN]]. At first, it was retitled '''''Detective Files''''', but a month later, the show returned to its original title. The reruns have been repackaged to include updates at the end of some episodes on what became of the suspect(s) or parties involved since the final verdicts. As of late January 2015, the reruns now air on [[Justice Network]].

==Synopsis==
[[Armchair detective]]s and [[forensic science]] junkies get the opportunity to solve real cases. This half-hour series aired weekly and gave viewers the opportunity to follow clues, find evidence and learn how this information is used to solve some of the most intriguing criminal investigations. ''I, Detective'' combined the elements of documentary, [[murder mystery]], and [[quiz show]]s. Through an interactive series of multiple choice questions, ''I, Detective'' challenged viewers to examine the same evidence, suspects, motives and witness statements that actual investigators consider in their quest to solve the crime. [[Art Bell]], Executive Vice President of Programming and Marketing said "The questions included in ''I, Detective'' give our viewers a chance to be active participants in the investigation. They examine the crime scene, evaluate evidence, and attempt to correctly answer questions that real criminologists and forensic specialists ask themselves as they solve a crime." ''I, Detective'' was produced by [[Hoff Productions|Michael Hoff Productions]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368508/ I, Detective info] - [[IMDb]] (accessed April 25, 2014)</ref>
