Being a [[justice of the peace]] doesn't satisfy the notability requirements. Wikipedia is not a memorial. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 22:48, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:One of my own unofficial rules is that if you have to quote the entirety of a person's newspaper obituary ''verbatim'' just to get the article past three sentences in length, then he probably doesn't have enough [[WP:N|notability]] to actually warrant an article. And if the obituary is the ''only'' source in the article that's ''substantively'' about him, and not just a namecheck that ''lists'' him in ''passing'', then he ''definitely'' doesn't have enough notability. '''Delete'''. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 06:38, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - per nom [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 00:25, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep''' Not sure how we can say that being a Justice of the Peace isn't notable.  Do we have any previous similar articles for comparison?  Sources are present.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[User talk:Xania|<sup>talk</sup>]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Xania<sup>WB talk</sup>]] 21:46, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
:*If you examine [[:Category:Justices of the peace]], you'll see that the few entries are for people who are notable for other things besides being a JP. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 22:46, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
::There are thousands upon thousands of Justices of the peace, so it's not like being governor of a state or something. They're just regular non-notable people. Most lawyers, judges, mayors, and other local officials are not notable enough to be on wikipedia. [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 12:55, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - per nom. Not historically notable, article is a memorial to an ancestor of the creator. [[User:Snappy|Snappy]] ([[User talk:Snappy|talk]]) 11:17, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' ''per'' nom. He verifiably existed, but was not notable.  Wikipedia is not a genealogy. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 23:55, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
