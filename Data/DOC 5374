:({{Find sources|Thirstin Howl III}})
Virtually [[WP:RS|unsourced]] promotional advertisement for a rapper, so appallingly badly written that I can't make heads or tails of whether he actually passes [[WP:NMUSIC]] or not (I actually considered speedying it as a G11, it's that bad.) The ''only'' source being cited here is his bio on his own webpage, a [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCE|primary source]] that does not demonstrate notability. As always, I'm willing to withdraw this if the article can be rewritten in a properly encyclopedic format that cites a proper array of [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], but he's not entitled to keep ''this''. '''Delete'''. Note also that if it does get deleted, the two albums of his which also have articles, ''[[Skilligan's Island]]'' and ''[[La Cura]]'', will also need to be deleted under CSD A9.

*'''Comment:''' I did find one possible source [http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.158/title.thirstin-howl-iii-the-sources-unsigned-hype], and apparently [[Eminem]] guested on one of this tracks [http://www.complex.com/music/2013/10/underrated-eminem-songs/thirstin-howl-iii-eminem-watch-deez]. I do not know how reliable Hip Hop DX and [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] are (and at any rate, the Complex article really only talks about Eminem's contribution). If kept, the article needs a major rewrite, pretty much from scratch. &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 23:46, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strong keep:''' An eminent article. It could use a scrubbing and more references, though. [[User:NaMo18|No More 18]] ([[User talk:NaMo18|talk]]) 11:12, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::Eminent how, exactly? [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 20:54, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''weak keep''' certainly notable—''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Unsigned Hype, once the most famous column in rap [http://wordtothemother.tumblr.com/post/67407181759/the-source-magazine-issue-95-august-1997], plus [http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-06-10/music/who-s-that-man-momma/] [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2008-03-06/music/thirstin-howl-iii-speaks/] [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thirstin-howl-iii-mn0000592239/biography] [http://books.google.ie/books?id=V60rnKjuhSgC&pg=PT20#v=onepage&q&f=false] [http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2002_07_island.html] [http://www.xxlmag.com/lifestyle/2010/11/polo-and-hip-hop-an-oral-history-pt-1/] & 200 words in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''.

*'''Delete''' - Totally agree with nom - I can't make any sense of it neither, IMHO it needs [[WP:BLOWNUP]] & rewriten, Anyway non notable rapper fails GNG.

*'''Keep'''. The sources provided by [[User:78.18.102.158]] look good (well, except for the one from XXL, which just lists rappers who wear Ralph Lauren gear. I think he clears the notability hurdle, and AfD decisions should be made based on the notability of the subject, not the state of the article ([[WP:BLOWUP]] is just an essay, not policy). Again, though, a major rewrite is in order. Even if it's just a stub. &mdash; [[User:Gwalla|Gwalla]] | [[User talk:Gwalla|Talk]] 16:22, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep''' All the bad writing comes from a text dump by one user, ending with "SKILLIONAIRE press kit". That edit should be reverted as possible copyvio and the article be completely rewritten. (though maybe some of the guest performances listed in there can be added to a list) [[User:Don Cuan|Don Cuan]] ([[User talk:Don Cuan|talk]]) 10:37, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
