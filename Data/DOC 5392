'''Đorđe Ristić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Ђорђе Ристић}}; August 6, 1881—1911), known as '''Đorđe Skopljanče''' (Ђорђе Скопљанче), was a [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian Chetnik commander]] who fought in [[Old Serbia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].

==Life==
Ristić was born in [[Peć|İpek (Peć)]], [[Sanjak of Peć]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (now [[Serbia]]) into a Serb family. He finished high school in [[Skoplje]], hence his nickname ''Skopljanče'' (a demonym). He then enrolled in the non-commissioned officer school in Belgrade in 1904, and with the rank of [[sergeant]] (''narednik'') he joined the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]] and immediately crossed the Serbian-Ottoman border. Due to his bravery, he gained the title of ''vojvoda'' (duke) the same year. He participated in the battles on Guglin, Petralica and Čelopek in that year. His designated area was the Kumanovo region where he constantly clashed with Bulgarian vojvoda [[Krsto Konjushki]]. He died in 1911 as a result of the extreme conditions he faced during guerilla fighting in the open outdoors under bad weather. He was buried in Niš, where the [[Narodna Odbrana]] erected a monument in his honour, in 1913.
