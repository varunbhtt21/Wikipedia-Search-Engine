'''Sunrise Mountain''' is a peak of the [[Kittatinny Mountains]] in [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], [[New Jersey]], United States. The mountain is {{Convert|1650|ft|m|0}} tall, and overlooks Beemerville to the east. It lies along the [[Appalachian Trail]] in [[Stokes State Forest]].

The crest of Sunrise Mountain is one of the most frequently visited sites in Stokes State Forest. The thin soil and harsh climate characteristic of Sunrise Mountain is a difficult environment in which few plants can survive. [[Kalmia latifolia|Mountain laurel]], [[blueberry]], [[Pinus rigida|pitch pine]] and [[Quercus ilicifolia|bear oak]] are among the natural vegetation found throughout the area. The pavilion at the summit was built in the late 1930s by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/stokes.html State of New Jersey: Stokes State Forest Website]</ref>
