<!--TELL us below about your background.  What brings you to research, libraries, digital information, open access, publishing, free knowledge...?-->
| story = I started working on library outreach in 2011 when I contacted HighBeam Reference for an account.  They said, "How about 1000?" I was hooked.  I started managing and expanding research account donations.  To combine and extend our many library-related projects into a shared, helpful, and powerful universe of resources, I started The Wikipedia Library in 2012 and have continued to work on it through a WMF Individual Engagement grant in 2013.  I'm a passionate believer in free culture and open knowledge--and a cheerleader for universal access, scientific and cultural literacy, and all kinds of research.
<!--HOW do you want to you contribute to our awesome community, share what you'd like to work on...-->
| skills = I'm a connector and organizer.  My strength is in finding ways to unite people to share their talents with the community.  I'd like to help coordinate our community of passionate library and research experts to build a powerful, open, and free hub for conducting the vital work they do, and helping others join in, too.

| story = I am a librarian in the public system in Vancouver, Canada.  I have been editing Wikipedia since late 2008. My desire is for Wikipedia to be not only the world's largest free repository of knowledge, but a reliable source of information as well.  Libraries provide the raw materials to build reliable articles.  I'd like to be part of the process of bringing libraries and Wikipedia editors together.

| story = I am the project manager for the Wikipedia Library, which means I help Jake build access to resources and expand programs within the Wikipedia Library. Before doing the work, I have been a long time Wikipedia contributor, with over 80,000 edits and tons of maintenance work and content creation on Wikipedia (if you want to see some of that work check out [[User:Sadads]]). However, my more important than my digital contributions to the community has been my outreach efforts: I was in the first batch of [[WP:Wikipedia Education Program]] volunteers, helped the UK community develop a similar program, and have actively supported GLAM outreach with a number of organizations, including most recently, [[The William Blake Archive]]. I am in the Wikipedia community to make academic work from students and researchers part of the "public" conversation. Mostly, I focus on the humanities (especially how the humanities interprets humanist information), because it is a sorely under-represented in Wikipedia.
<!--HOW do you want to you contribute to our awesome community, share your STRENGTHS and what you'd LIKE to work on...-->
| skills = Outreach, selling Wikipedia to academics, Education planning, content development, and many other things.

After a period of inactivity due to real-life concerns, I've returned to expand articles related to [[numismatics]].

| story = On the English Wikipedia, I enjoy doing antivandal work, helping at [[WP:DRN|DRN]], and helping users on IRC--to name a few. It's been an interesting experience for me to engage in understanding the nuances of [[WP:Verifiability]] and how verifiable information gradually instills personal and intellectual confidence within readers and fellow editors. Unlike how Wikipedia readily provides information to people around the world about a variety of topics, unfortunately, editors contributing to Wikipedia don't always have the resources they need to write highly-detailed, highly-technical articles to further the rich repository of information we label as "Wikipedia" today. 
<!--HOW do you want to you contribute to our awesome community, share what you'd like to work on...-->
| skills = Quite frankly, I think Wikipedia's Library is one of those hidden gems--not at the forefront of editors' awareness, but definitely very valuable. As an account coordinator, I holistically analyze editor impact and behavior, while exercising [[WP:AGF|AGF]]. On the other hand, I am well aware of how frustrating it is to have resources missing from a library, i.e. seeing an editor take off with an access code with no contributions made (their sense of responsibility wanes). A metaphor of this to more general Wikipedia editing: it's almost as if an editor added a substantial amount of information to an article's section, did not adequately source the information to meet some level of verifiability, and other editors are not willing to revert the contributions because the information added seems somewhat plausible (yet, the original contributor can no longer be contacted). This, then, can be frustrating. As a volunteer of the library, I try to maintain such balance.

| story = I am a retired teacher. After I began creating and editing articles on Wikipedia, a fellow Wikipedian pointed me to the Wikipedia Library and the resources that it offered. My work on Wikipedia has benefited greatly from free accounts, especially books from McFarland and the archives of Newspapers.com. 
<!--HOW do you want to you contribute to our awesome community, share your STRENGTHS and what you'd LIKE to work on...-->
| skills= My strengths are research, writing, and editing. I like to work primarily on articles about old-time radio, old-time television, films of the past, and the people associated with those topics.
