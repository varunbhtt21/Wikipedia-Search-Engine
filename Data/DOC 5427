What did he write? Nothing is said-and not sure how being a tea planter is notable either. Nothing is really in this article. If indeed notable, work is needed. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:09, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' Tea planters in Assam can be powerful and influential, though not all. They are plantation owners at the top of the pyramid in a local economy dominated by global tea export. It's not ''inherently'' notable but is a strong sign to continue looking. A Google search of <code>[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%80+%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%8D%E0%A7%B0%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A6+%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%97%E0%A6%A1%E0%A6%BC%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 "দেবী প্ৰসাদ বাগড়োদিয়া"]</code> turns up nothing... the article has 1 ref to [http://www.sentinelassam.com/state1/story.php?sec=2&subsec=2&id=138881&dtP=2012-12-15&ppr=1 The Sentinel], another sign of notability. Still need to see more evidence. Using the Sentinel as a clue, what other Assam newspapers are there? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Newspapers_published_in_Assam Wikipedia tells us], so I search and find sources in [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Devi+Prasad+Bagrodia%22+site%3Aassamtribune.com Assam Tribune].. and that's it. To be sure I check [https://googledrive.com/host/0B3ke7sJYbO1gVkRjUVh6bmtqeVU/IndianEnglishNewspaperSearch.html#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=%22Devi%20Prasad%20Bagrodia%22&gsc.sort=  Indian English Newspapers Search] and confirms very little. I don't believe this is enough evidence of notability. -- [[User:Green Cardamom|<font color="#006A4E">'''Green'''</font>]][[User_talk:Green Cardamom|<font color="#009933">'''C'''</font>]] 05:17, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-Yeah it is like how a farmer can be notable, but still this does not seem like someone who is notable and given how this looks like it has been deleted before. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 14:34, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - I think we may need the expertise of some Indians to help us determine notability. I suspect if there is press, it may not be written in English. There are a fair amount of google hits, but as is, the article is like "He exists, and trust us, he's notable!". Suggestion to the author: All I know about him is that he plants tea and writes books. I have no idea why or even if this guy is notable aside from the article's statement that he is notable. Explaining ''why'' the subject is notable is pretty darn important. Are his books big sellers? Have they had a cultural impact? These are things we need. I will wait to weigh in until there is more information on his notability.[[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 00:37, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

::::*That could be typical journalism lingo (or not) - it's very ambiguous. It doesn't say what he is noted for. A novelist? A poet? A journalist? I'd like to see more and better sources to judge if he is a notable writer.  -- [[User:Green Cardamom|<font color="#006A4E">'''Green'''</font>]][[User_talk:Green Cardamom|<font color="#009933">'''C'''</font>]] 07:44, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
