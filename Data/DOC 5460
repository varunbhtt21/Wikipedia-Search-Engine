'''Christopher Riley Martin''' (born June 2, 1986) is an American [[professional baseball]] [[relief pitcher]] for the [[Atlanta Braves|Atlanta Braves]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He previously played in MLB for the [[Colorado Rockies]], [[New York Yankees]], and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and for the [[Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters]] of the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB).

Martin played baseball at [[Arlington High School (Arlington, Texas)|Arlington High School]] and [[McLennan Community College]], but gave up on baseball after he suffered a shoulder injury. After working in a warehouse for three years, Martin began playing [[catch (game)|catch]], and felt strong enough to try out for [[independent league baseball]]. After pitching for the [[Grand Prairie AirHogs]] in 2010, the [[Boston Red Sox]] of MLB signed Martin in 2011. He pitched in [[Minor League Baseball]] for the Red Sox organization until they traded him to the Rockies after the 2013 season.

Martin made his MLB debut for the Rockies in 2014, and was traded to the Yankees after the season. He signed with the Fighters after the 2015 season, and with the Rangers after the 2017 season. The Rangers traded Martin to the Braves during the 2019 season.
