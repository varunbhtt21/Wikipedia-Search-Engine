Title : Harry Clifton (actor)
Text : '''Harry Clifton''' was an actor in silent movies in the USA from 1908 to 1919, not to be confused with the producer of the same name.

==Career==
IMDB lists one Harry Clifton as both an actor and a producer, but this is a conflation: the productions belong to a different Harry Clifton. His first film as an actor was the 1908 version of the tale of the [[Jamesâ€“Younger Gang|Younger brothers]].<ref name="imdb_0355046">{{IMDb title| id =0355046 | title = The Younger Brothers (1908) }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TLXYhM3cTkC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=harry+clifton+%22the+younger+brothers%22&source=bl&ots=odP4rCB8Fi&sig=hYM6ZYJoncgNB65k07B0vG4yw88&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_kLaU-biA9DG7AbF9IC4Ag&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=harry%20clifton%20%22the%20younger%20brothers%22&f=false Jesse James and the Movies], Johnny D.
