'''Linear Heat Detection''' ('''LHD''') (also known as '''Linear Detection Wire''' or '''Linear Heat Detection Cable''' or '''Linear Heat''') is a very commonly used method of fire detection. It can detect a fire anywhere along the length of the cable, and can be of lengths in excess of a kilometer.

Applications can range from building [[fire alarm systems]] to mobile [[heavy equipment|plant machinery]].

== Operation ==
Linear Heat Detection (LHD) cable is essentially a two-core cable terminated by an end-of-line [[resistor]] (resistance varies with application). The two cores are separated by a polymer plastic, that is designed to melt at a specific temperature (commonly 68&nbsp;°C for building applications<ref name="Typical LHD Temperatures for buildings">{{cite web|title=Linear Heat Detection cable information|url=https://www.tyco-fire.com/TFP_common/TFBP_LHD_Slick.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>), and without which causes the two cores to [[Short circuit|short]]. This can be seen as a change in [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] in the wire.

There are a limited states the LHD cable can be in:
# Open-circuit - Effectively an infinite resistance 
# Normal Operating Condition - Apparent resistance will be the same as the end-of-line resistor
# Fire Detection - Resistance of the Linear Heat Cable to the short circuit
