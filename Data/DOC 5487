It is brief, moving in places, almost unbearably so, and often beautiful.  In short Mr. Hanlin is a remarkable fellow."<ref name=observer_OIEL   /> [[John Steinbeck]] also spoke enthusiastically of the author, declaring the book "excellent."<ref name=JSteinbeckComments>{{cite book|title=Conversations with John Steinbeck|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mY98rl2LiuEC&pg=PA46&dq=tom+hanlin&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iSH7UJiKHaKM0wW_9IGADQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=tom%20hanlin&f=false|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>
