The '''Beaurains Treasure''' or ''Arras Treasure'' is the name of an important [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] hoard found in [[Beaurains]], a suburb of the city of [[Arras]], northern [[France]] in 1922. Soon after its discovery, much of the treasure was dispersed, to be sold on the antiquities market. However, the largest portion of the hoard can be found in the local museum in Arras and Room 70 in the [[British Museum]].<ref>British Museum Collection [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=34855&plaA=34855-3-1 database page]</ref></blockquote>

==Discovery==
The treasure was accidentally discovered inside a [[pottery]] vessel during building work at Beaurains, [[Pas-de-Calais]] on 21 September 1922. Two [[Belgian]] workmen were digging for clay when they unearthed the treasure a short depth underground. Unfortunately much of the treasure disappeared overnight and a great part of it was sold on the [[antiquities]] market. Items from the Beaurains Treasure are now found in collections worldwide, but the two institutions with the greatest proportion of the hoard are the [[Musée des beaux-arts d'Arras|Musée d'Arras]] and the [[British Museum]].

==Description==
The Beaurains Treasure is principally composed of coins, although other luxury items are included in the hoard. There are twenty-three pieces of [[jewellery]] (necklaces, bracelets, earrings, buckles, finger rings, cameos and pendants), silver objects (a lamp stand or [[candelabra]], two spoons and an [[ingot]]) and 472 coins that were kept in a (now lost) silver container, including at least 25 gold medallions issued during the reign of [[Constantine I]]. The medallions were minted in [[Trier]] and [[Rome]] and were probably gifts received by the owner of the treasure during his career as officer of the [[Roman army|imperial army]] between 285 and 310 A.D. Their value ranges from four to ten [[aurei]], and from one and a half to nine [[solidi]]. One of the medallions was issued to celebrate the reconquest of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] by [[Constantius I]] in 296 A.D, the reverse of which is denoted by an image of [[Londinium]], represented by a woman welcoming the Emperor on her knees outside the city walls. The original is kept in Arras, with a copy in the British Museum.<ref>British Museum Collection [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1616647&partId=1&searchText=medallion+beaurains&place=34855&page=1 database page]</ref></blockquote>
