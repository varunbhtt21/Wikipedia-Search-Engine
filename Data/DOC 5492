Title : Erdős–Hajnal conjecture
Text : {{unsolved|mathematics|Do the graphs with a fixed forbidden induced subgraph necessarily have large cliques or large independent sets?}}
In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Erdős–Hajnal conjecture''' states that families of graphs defined by [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden induced subgraph]]s have either large [[Clique (graph theory)|cliques]] or large [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent sets]]. It is named for [[Paul Erdős]] and [[András Hajnal]].

More precisely, for an arbitrary [[undirected graph]] <math>H</math>, let <math>\mathcal{F}_H</math> be the family of graphs that do not have <math>H</math> as an [[induced subgraph]]. Then, according to the conjecture, there exists a constant <math>\delta_H > 0</math> such that the <math>n</math>-vertex graphs in <math>\mathcal{F}_H</math> have either a clique or an independent set of size <math>\Omega(n^{\delta_H})</math>.

An equivalent statement to the original conjecture is that, for every graph <math>H</math>, the <math>H</math>-free graphs all contain polynomially large [[perfect graph|perfect]] [[induced subgraph]]s.

==Graphs without large cliques or independent sets==
In contrast, for [[random graph]]s in the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] with edge probability 1/2, both the [[maximum clique]] and the [[maximum independent set]] are much smaller: their size is proportional to the [[logarithm]] of <math>n</math>, rather than growing polynomially. [[Ramsey's theorem]] proves that no graph has both its maximum clique size and maximum independent set size smaller than logarithmic.<ref name="c14"/><ref name="aps"/> Ramsey's theorem also implies the special case of the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture when <math>H</math> itself is a clique or independent set.<ref name="c14"/>

==Partial results==
This conjecture is due to [[Paul Erdős]] and [[András Hajnal]], who proved it to be true when <math>H</math> is a [[cograph]]. They also showed, for arbitrary <math>H</math>, that the size of the largest clique or independent set grows superlogarithmically. More precisely, for every <math>H</math> there is a constant <math>c</math> such that the <math>n</math>-vertex <math>H</math>-free graphs have cliques or independent sets containing at least <math>\exp c\sqrt{\log n}</math> vertices.<ref name="c14"/><ref>{{citation

An earlier formulation of the conjecture, also by Erdős and Hajnal and still unsolved, concerns the special case when <math>H</math> is a 5-vertex [[cycle graph]].<ref name="reflections"/> The <math>C_5</math>-free graphs include the [[perfect graph]]s, which necessarily have either a clique or independent set of size proportional to the square root of their number of vertices. Conversely, every clique or independent set is itself perfect. For this reason, a convenient and symmetric reformulation of the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture is that for every graph <math>H</math>, the <math>H</math>-free graphs necessarily contain an induced perfect subgraph of polynomial size.<ref name="c14"/>
