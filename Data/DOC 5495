'''Silesian County''' (Polish: '''powiat śląski''') was an administrative unit ([[powiat]]) of both the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. With seats in the towns of [[Zator]] and [[Oświęcim]], it was part of [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]].

Silesian County was created at the [[General Sejm]] in [[Warsaw]], in 1564, when King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] merged territories of the [[Duchy of Zator]] and the [[Duchy of Oświęcim]], incorporating them into the Kraków Voivodeship of the [[Crown of Poland|Polish Crown]].<ref name="Truś2008">{{cite book|author=Radosław Truś|title=Beskid Mały: przewodnik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RDvOuQVQ3wC&pg=PA35|year=2008|publisher=Oficyna Wydawnicza "Rewasz"|isbn=978-83-89188-77-9|page=35}}</ref> The kings retained both ducal titles, and names of both duchies remained in common use. It existed for over 200 years, and was dissolved after the [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]] (1795).

The total area of Silesian County was 2690 sq. kilometers, and initially consisted of four royal towns ([[Wadowice]], [[Kęty]], Oświęcim and Zator) and one private ([[Żywiec]]). In the second half of the 16th century the largest of them was Kęty, with over 1000 inhabitants<ref>Województwo krakowskie w drugiej połowie XVI wieku, 2008, p. 71-75</ref>. Of 188 villages, 38 had over 200 inhabitants<ref>Województwo krakowskie w drugiej połowie XVI wieku, 2008, p. 82</ref>. In 1617 a new private town of Zebrzydów, now [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska]], was founded. In 1723 town rights were granted to Biała, now part of [[Bielsko-Biała]]. The town was in the centre of a small German [[language island]] that consisted of several other villages. The rest of the County was inhabited by the vast majority of Polish Roman Catholics, although at the turn of the 17th century the county had the highest share of Protestants in the Kraków Voivodeship: 29% of the total number of churches were protestant (mostly [[Calvinism|reformed]]), they were present in 34 parishes and their number was estimated at 10 – 15 thousand<ref name=w>{{cite book |author=Krzysztof Koźbiał |title=Wadowice na tle osad starostwa zatorskiego: zarys dziejów do 1772 roku |series=Wadoviana: przegląd historyczno-kulturalny |volume=3 |year=1999 |pages=17|url=http://wadoviana.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Wadowice-na-tle-osad-starostwa-zatorskiego-K.-Ko%C5%BAbia%C5%82.pdf}}</ref>.
