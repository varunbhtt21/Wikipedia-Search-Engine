Seems more like an essay-granted I don't know anything about this subject, but this guy does not seem like a notable person at all. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:46, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': The article text is a mess, but that is a matter for normal editing. The main claim to notability is probably the subject being on the [[:Sree Moolam Popular Assembly]] which may meet [[:WP:POLITICIAN]] #1. That needs referenced but note also this rather poor page photo on Commons: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kochu_Hassan_Kunju_Bahadoor_MLC,_MLA.JPG].

*'''Keep''' The article meets [[WP:POLITICIAN]] as he was elected to  [[Sree Moolam Popular Assembly]]. This indicates enough notability but the article needs a lot of cleanup.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 03:15, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I'm not even sure what that is-but I guess I'll take your word for that. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 03:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Does appear to meet the criteria of [[WP:POLITICIAN]]. -- [[User:Necrothesp|Necrothesp]] ([[User talk:Necrothesp|talk]]) 13:00, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
