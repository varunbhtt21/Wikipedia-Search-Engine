I am not seeing where in this article this topic is referred to in all caps. Even per the image of the cover of its magazine ([[:File:PasteMag.jpg]]), at least the "a" and "t" are lowercase. I [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] edited the redirect to '''retarget to [[Paste]]''' (a disambiguation page) for that reason, but since that edit was undone, the edit seems to be controversial. I was referred to [[WP:DIFFCAPS]] for the reason of the revert; however, I'm not seeing how that applies since the magazine's title is not stylized in all caps, but rather maybe [[PaStE]] or [[PastE]].

Does anyone have any idea the purpose of this redirect? I've been looking around for a while, and the only reference I can find in regards to this term is at [[Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Sc – Sl)#Sherifian Post]]. I am trying to fathom why this redirect targets Google; I have no idea. I say '''Delete''' per [[WP:REDLINK]]; the section where this subject is mentioned by name is not really a sufficient target due to the lack of description. [[User:Steel1943|<span style="color: #2F4F4F;">'''''Steel1943'''''</span>]] ([[User talk:Steel1943|talk]]) 22:01, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. No idea. It appears [http://www.wordaz.com/sherifian.htmlon wordaz.com (which to its credit says it gets the content from Wikipedia)] but lists it mostly (presumably scraping Wikipedia) as being used as an adjective meaning "of a sheriff/sharif/various cognates". [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Sherifian+post The Free Dictionary lists it here], which is a redirect to its entry for Google. So, my guess is either they've got it from here (unattributed) or we've got it from there (unattributed). [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 00:14, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

:The result of the discussion was <!-- Template:Rfd top--> '''keep''' both as recently retargeted to [[Market (economics)]]. Opinion is divided as to whether a redirect or a DAB is most appropriate. However, there is no support to retain the original targets. Conversion to a DAB does not require agreement here so, consequently, I am supporting the retargeting and it is open to any editor to overwrite the redirect with a DAB page if considered appropriate.

[[Market (economics)]] is about the idea of a market; someone searching for a "world market" is probably looking for information about the [[World economy]], so I propose '''retargeting''' there. Strictly speaking, there isn't ''a'' "world market" (the phrase "world markets" is perhaps more common), but I think the world economy is closer to that idea. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 19:59, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Neutral'''. I can see a case for redirecting to either of those titles, and am not sure which I would prefer. Neither article gives much coverage to idea of a global market, so it's a choice between two poor options. --[[User:BrownHairedGirl|<span style="color:#663200;">Brown</span>HairedGirl]] <small>[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])</small> 20:26, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
*<s>'''Keep''' at [[Market (economics)]], or '''Retarget''' all four of them together.</s> I can see the case for it going to [[world economy]] or [[global economics]] (which redirects there) or [[global village]] (which is  DAB) or [[international trade]] (which has its own article) or something similar; my point is simply that they should all go to the same place: the search engine does not distinguish on letter case. It used to be common to have different articles (and redirects) varying by case, but that is not true any more, so it would be misleading to send them to different places. Since the previous consensus, referred to by BDD, resulted in it being put at [[market (economics)]], so should these be; or we retarget all four together.

*'''Convert to a disambiguation page''' per the mixed answers above, the fact that the redirect [[World Market]] was recently the subject of another RfD discussion ([[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2014 April 13#World Market]]), and the fact that now 3 topics have been identified that could be called "World market": [[Market (economics)]], [[World economy]], and [[Cost Plus, Inc.]]. My preference is that '''[[World market]] should become the disambiguation page''' due to 2 of the 3 possible topics referring to the lowercase version of the word.

Non-notable person. Contestant of a reality TV show. [[User:Redtigerxyz|<font color = "red" >Redtigerxyz</font>]] <sup> [[User talk:Redtigerxyz|Talk]] </sup> 19:19, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. What next, people on phone-in shows? [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 08:01, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. The nomination is probably an accurate description of Manmohan Tiwari, but it's not an [[WP:RFD#DELETE|argument for deleting a redirect]]. Topics of redirects aren't required to be notable; in fact redirecting to a broader topic is a common outcome of deletion discussions relating to non-notable topics, and serves to discourage editors from creating articles on such topics. In this case the redirect is a plausible search term and mentioned in the target article. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Arms &amp; Hearts|Arms &amp; Hearts]] ([[User talk:Arms &amp; Hearts|talk]]) 11:54, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
::I see your point, but Wikipedia is not [[Who's Who]] or an [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] list either. The single mention of his name is the link itself in a table including profession and hometown: no substantial information on the subject. No other contestant has a blue link (they all have red links) and this one blue link is of course just a circular link via the redirect. It's not even an {{tlx|R to section}}. It should go per [[WP:REDLINK]]. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 06:48, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Huh? [[WP:REDLINK]] is clear that red links should only be included for articles that are likely to be created. As a personal name and an article that's not likely to be created (per your !vote I assume you agree this person isn't notable), redlinking to this is specifically discouraged per [[WP:REDNOT]]. I've removed all the links to personal names in the table accordingly. You're right of course that there's only a brief mention of this contestant, but if the article were expanded it could easily include a more comprehensive description (see, for example, [[Big Brother 10 (UK)#Housemates]]). &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Arms &amp; Hearts|Arms &amp; Hearts]] ([[User talk:Arms &amp; Hearts|talk]]) 00:02, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Arms & Hearts. The person is mentioned at the target article, and it's common practice to redirect reality show contestants to articles on their show (or season, where applicable). See, for example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/American_Idol_%28season_1%29&hidelinks=1 redirects to the first season of ''American Idol'']. I can't think of a good reason to [[WP:BIAS|treat Indian shows differently]]. A&H is also correct in his interpretation of REDLINK: this person should probably not have a standalone article, so if the redirect hinders anyone from making one, that's a feature, not a bug. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 19:07, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per Arms & Hearts' arguments, but not his conclusion from them (which was Keep). We shouldn't have articles of every participant who has ever appeared on a game show or "reality" show. Some, such as [[Fred Housego]], are notable (he was a London taxi driver who won the UK upmarket quiz show [[Mastermind (TV series)]], which astounded people even though London taxi drivers have to learn [[The Knowledge]] of about 25,000 London streets and develop a larger hippocampus than average). Some, such as the first people to win various national versions of [[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]], are notable (presumably) and have their own brief articles. But considering how many game/quiz shows there are and how many contestants they need to fill them, to assume all are notable is bizarre. While redirects do not have to meet [[WP:N]], the search engine would presumably find it anyway since patently there is no other notable person of this name to obscure its view. Either delete to encourage creation of the article, delete to let the search engine do the work, or at the very least make it an {{tlx|R to section}} rather than make the reader then search the page for the name. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 20:30, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' because the person is not discussed in the target article beyond showing up in a table.

This specific form of culture jamming isn't mentioned on the target page in any form. Delete to encourage creation, or just to avoid misleading readers. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 20:56, 11 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete all''' per BDD and perhaps [[WP:WORLDWIDE]] as well. I have never heard of any of these terms so perhaps they are US-specific? Or perhaps I am just getting old. It's my birthday today, and I just found out from my mum (whose birthday is the day before) that I will be 42. I thought I was 42 last year so for a whole year I have been telling people I was a year older than I was, you would think I could count. You shouldn't really trust me on anything if I can't even remember how old I am. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 00:25, 12 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete all''', I say again (I am allowed two !votes because it is my birthday). None of these is mentioned at the target. There's [http://www.neatorama.com/2008/06/18/is-shopdropping-reverse-shoplifting-a-crime/#!DG0Y1 a reference here] to "reverse shoplifting (shopdropping)". There are others as well but this is the closest to being [[WP:RS]] and at least gives a definition. Personally what I like to do is either take something out of someone's shopping cart/trolley so they get home and find they haven't got any cat food or whatever (it's not stealing because they have not paid for it until they get out of the store/shop), take something I like out to save me walking the whole store to find it and put it in me own trolley, or put some inappropriate thing in that they won't notice: condoms into an old lady's or whatever. But that is just because I hate supermarkets, not the individuals nor the companies but the stores, I just hate shopping in big stores generally so I have my bit of fun while I am in them.

*:Alternatively, we could revert [[Droplifting]] to its [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Droplifting&oldid=46996527 pre-redirect state], which while extremely short, is probably better than a redlink. The other titles could be retargeted there. - [[User:EurekaLott|Eureka Lott]] <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned"> — Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|undated]] comment added 22:20, 15 April 2014‎</span><!--Template:Undated-->

* '''Delete''' per [[WP:REDLINK]] and [[WP:R#DELETE]] #10: [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/24/us/24shopdrop.html ''New York Times'' article], [http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/19/news/funny/shopdropping/ CNN article] and [http://books.google.com/books/about/Alternative_Subterfuge.html?id=dGfySAAACAAJ book published by California State University] suggest the topic is very likely to be notable. I don't think [[WP:NEO]] is relevant here, since with the above sources and others we meet that section's requirement that we have secondary sources ''about'' the concept rather than merely sources that use it. Similarly, [[WP:WORLDWIDE]] is a Wikiproject; it is not a rationale for deletion. (Alternatively, the redirect at [[shopdropping]], which is probably the  [[WP:common name|common name]] per the above sources, could just be overwritten with a new article. Either way I'll try to get around to writing it.) &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Arms &amp; Hearts|Arms &amp; Hearts]] ([[User talk:Arms &amp; Hearts|talk]]) 02:55, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::Sorry, I chose bad wording there. I was not trying to suggest that not being known worldwide is a reason for deletion, only that perhaps it should be marked as {{tlx|worldwide}} or at least mention in the text to say the expression is chiefly US (if it is, just because I haven't heard of it doesn't mean others won't have).

This redirect seems to have been created by the editor/user who had this page as a subpage, most likely to refer to this page elsewhere... maybe? It may have been useful to the editor who created the page, but it doesn't seem like it would be useful to anyone else, especially considering that the redirect is for a specific nomination, and not any instruction page of [[WP:MFD]], or any other similar type of page.

*'''Delete''': There is precedent for such things (e.g. [[WP:RFAR/DDL]], [[WP:EEML]]), but the linked MfD just isn't important enough.  It's not an issue that affects the site as a whole.  It's just a particular example of BLP-violating material being deleted per the rules.  The discussion may be long and interesting, but it didn't really set any important precedent so far as I can tell.  BLP has always been applicable to all parts of the site, not just mainspace, and this did not overturn or strengthen that principle.  It also has very few links and is useless for searching, being in projectspace, so it serves no purpose.  Oh, and would someone like to have a look at the templates in that MfD?  They appear broken.  --'''''[[User:NYKevin|<span style="color:red">N</span>]][[User talk:NYKevin|<span style="color:green">Y</span>]][[Special:Contributions/NYKevin|<span style="color:blue">Kevin</span>]]'''''  03:29, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
