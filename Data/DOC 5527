An essay, a how-to, an informal style, and an overall bias, this page has no place on WP. The person who made the most substantial edits there even left a link, which violates [[WP:SPAM]]. An IP user also asked a question, and the <del>creator</del> main contributor of the page responded in a very [[WP:POV]], [[WP:NOTBLOG|blog-like]] style. For some reason, it is listed as a "assessment summary page", which it certainly is NOT. <del>Creator</del> The main contributor of talk page seems to have a serious [[WP:Conflict of interest]] (you'll see why [http://www.dallashealthandbeauty.com/doctors.php?doc=715&City=Colleyville&Doctor=Robert%20L.%20True,%20MD,%20FACOG,%20FAACS here)] and as one would expect, this page [[WP:COATRACK|coat-racks by focusing on the positive]]. This "talk page" really has to go. [[User:Mr. Guye|Mr. Guye]] ([[User talk:Mr. Guye|talk]]) 01:52, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom.  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 12:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - If the material were about article developoment, it could be merged to the main article talk page.  However, it is more of an advertisement and how-to, so merge would not be appropriate. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 15:34, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Frankly, borderline for CSD G11. Not at all encyclopedic, entirely useless to the encyclopedia as it is written in a casual, essay form. [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 17:00, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
