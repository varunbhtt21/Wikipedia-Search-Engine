The CIA features an extensive collection of sideshow memorabilia that Crew and Ferguson, both avid fans and historians of the American sideshow, had collected over the years. The venue, painted with bright, garish circus colors, displays [[taxidermy|cryptotaxidermy]], [[pickled punks]] and vintage banners for sideshow attractions and over the years has featured such oddities and hoaxes as a [[Fiji mermaid]], the skull of "the world's smallest [[Freemason]]", the severed head of [[Sasquatch]], the severed arm of [[Claude, Duke of Guise|Claude de Lorraine]] and a [[fairy]] skeleton.<ref name="SalonCIA" /><ref name="LAWeeklyCIA" /><ref name="LABizarroCIA" /><ref name="LATacoCIA" /> The CIA's most notable attraction, however, may be the preserved corpse of Achile Chatouilleu, an American circus performer who died in 1912 and requested his body be put on display in the clown makeup and attire he had worn throughout his life.<ref name="SalonCIA" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2006/11/freak_show_maestro.php |title=Freak Show Maestro |date=November 25, 2006 |author=Lemons, Stephen |publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]]}}</ref> Although Crew leased the body for six months in 2002, he claims that the owners "forgot" to retrieve it and the corpse remains at the CIA to present day in a hermetically sealed glass coffin, the body itself embalmed with [[arsenic]].<ref name="SalonCIA" /><ref name="LABizarroCIA" /> Chatouilleu's corpse is such a prominent fixture of the CIA that the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' newspaper ranked the venue in its "Best of LA 2006" list as "Best Place to Find a Dead Clown".<ref name="LAWeeklyCIA" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2012-08-30/calendar/what-the-hell-s-been-going-on-in-north-hollywood/ |title=What the Hell's Been Going On in North Hollywood?  |date=August 30, 2012 |publisher=[[LA Weekly]] |author=Whiteside, Johnny}}</ref>

As a music and performance venue, the CIA showcases intentionally offbeat and bizarre musical groups, as well as [[freak show]]s, performance art, puppet shows, burlesque acts, stand-up comedy, movie screenings and other sorts of unusual performances. Every month, the CIA hosts Club Microwave, which showcases [[chiptune]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] music and DJs and has featured such artists as [[8 Bit Weapon]], [[ComputeHer]] and [[Trash80]], among others. The CIA also regularly hosts an event called [http://www.shadesandshadows.org/ Shades and Shadows], a live reading series focusing exclusively on [[dark fantasy]], horror and science fiction literature. Among the authors who have appeared with Shades and Shadows include [[Martin Pousson]], [[Ben Loory]], [[Lisa Morton]] and [[Steven-Elliot Altman]].

The CIA has been featured on the dating shows ''[[Blind Date (U.S. TV series)|Blind Date]]'' and ''[[EX-treme Dating]]'', and in 2013, Crew and regular CIA performer [[Count Smokula]] showcased the venue on an episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[Oddities (TV series)|Oddities]]''.<ref name="SaltShakerCIA"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/oddities/return-to-holly-odd-2662988/ |title= Oddities Season 4 Episode 3: Return to Holly-Odd |publisher=[[TV.com]]}}</ref> In 2014 and 2015, the CIA appeared on Halloween-themed episodes of the local interest shows ''[[1st Look]]'' ([[KNBC]]) and ''Eye on LA'' ([[KABC-TV]]), respectively, both of which featured interviews with Crew and footage of the comedy punk band [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]] performing on the venue's stage.<ref name="WeirdChicken">{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/it-doesnt-get-any-weirder-than-this-north-hollywood-spot-5050634 |title=It Doesn't Get Any Weirder Than This North Hollywood Spot |date=September 9, 2014 |author=Hermann, Andy |publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://abc7.com/society/eye-on-la-gets-spooky-with-the-best-halloween-themed-spots-in-the-city/1038617/ |title=Eye on L.A. gets spooky with the best Halloween-themed spots in the city |date=October 17, 2015 |publisher=[[KABC-TV]] |author=Malave, Tina}}</ref>
