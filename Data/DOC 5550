==Biography==
;Film
Raised in a [[repertory theatre]] troupe, Crew spent much of his young life acting and traveling the country in numerous stage productions until the age of 18, when he became an apprentice [[embalming|embalmer]] for a [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] [[mortuary]], an occupation he held for four years before deciding to further pursue a career in acting.<ref name="CrewInt">{{cite web |url=http://carlcrew.com/carlcrew/press/Entries/2012/11/18_Jed_Bundy__Wonder_if_Jeffrey_Dahmer_ever_ate_at_Blood_Diner_Exclusive_Interview_with_Actor%2C_Writer%2C_Producer%2C_and_Entertainer_Extraordinaire%2C_Carl_Crew.html |title=Wonder if Jeffrey Dahmer ever ate at Blood Diner? Exclusive Interview with Actor, Writer, Producer, and Entertainer Extraordinaire, Carl Crew |date=November 18, 2012 |publisher=www.jedbundy.com}}</ref><ref name="LAWeeklyCIA"/> Crew landed his first major role in the 1987 [[cult film|cult]] horror comedy ''[[Blood Diner]]'', where Crew played the co-leading role of homicidal chef and wrestling enthusiast George Tutman, for which he was allegedly only paid $250.<ref name="CrewInt" /> In 1990, Crew wrote and starred in a low-budget [[gross out]] comedy aptly titled ''Gross Out'', a ''[[Pink Flamingos]]''-esque shock film following a group of siblings attempting to make the most disgusting movie possible to win an inheritance. Despite its excess of [[Toilet humour|scatological humor]], ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' offered a positive review of ''Gross Out'', describing it as "funny in a scabrous, admittedly juvenile way" and "thunderingly, gleefully tasteless...a natural for midnight venues".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-06/entertainment/ca-563_1_dino-lee |title=Film Review: 'Gross Out': Not for the Faint-Hearted |date=April 6, 1990 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Thomas, Kevin}}</ref>

In 1992, Crew wrote the screenplay and starred as the title subject in ''[[Jeffrey Dahmer: The Secret Life]]'', a biopic based on serial killer [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]. Shot a mere year after Dahmer's arrest, the film received intensely negative press from both the media and the families of Dahmer's victims, who staged open protests against the film. Crew and director David Bowen appeared on several [[talk show]]s including ''[[Maury (TV series)|The Maury Povich Show]]'' and [[WISN-TV]]{{'}}s ''Milwaukee's Talking'' with family members of the victims, defending the movie against their claims of glorifying and exploiting Dahmer's actions.<ref>{{cite news |date=September 15, 1992 |title=Dahmer movie is protested |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=19920915&id=bgggAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N2UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1368,3155000 |newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=September 29, 1992 |title=Povich Talk Show on Dahmer Film a Shouting Match |url=http://carlcrew.com/carlcrew/press/Entries/1992/9/29_The_Milwaukee_Sentinal__Povich_Talk_Show_on_Dahmer_Film_a_Shouting_Match.html |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234301/http://carlcrew.com/carlcrew/press/Entries/1992/9/29_The_Milwaukee_Sentinal__Povich_Talk_Show_on_Dahmer_Film_a_Shouting_Match.html |archive-date=April 26, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> Although ''The Secret Life'' was dismally received upon release, it has more recently been positively re-appraised by cult and horror publications; similarly, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', in reviewing 2002's ''[[Dahmer (film)|Dahmer]]'', compared it unfavorably to ''The Secret Life'', praising the latter's depiction of and Crew's performance of Jeffrey Dahmer, while [[CraveOnline]] called the film "fascinating" and "truly compelling".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/21/entertainment/et-dahmer21 |title='Dahmer' Falls Short of the Horrible Truth |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 21, 2002 |author=Thomas, Kevin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/reviews/170941-dvd-review-things-and-the-secret-life-jeffrey-dahmer |title=DVD Review: ‘Things’ and ‘The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer’ |date=July 12, 2011 |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |author=Bibbiani, William}}</ref>

Crew wrote, produced and starred in multiple roles in the 1994 horror [[anthology film]] ''Urban Legends'', directed by [[Bill Osco]], which would ultimately be his last major film contribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film3/dvd_reviews54/the_unknown_comedy_special.htm |title=The Unknown Comedy Special |publisher=DVD Beaver |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215614/http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film3/dvd_reviews54/the_unknown_comedy_special.htm |archivedate=2014-04-26 |df= }}</ref> Since then, Crew's acting work has been sporadic, almost exclusively appearing in films by prolific [[underground film]]maker [[Chris J. Miller]] including 2008's ''Polyphony'' 2011's ''Ironhorse'' 2013's ''2035: Forbidden Dimensions'' and 2016's ''Mortuary Massacre''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187680/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 |title=Carl Crew - IMDb |publisher=[[Internet Movie DataBase]]}}</ref>

During his time as an embalmer, Crew met Robert Ferguson, a fellow mortician who shared his passion for collecting vintage [[sideshow]] and [[carnival]] memorabilia. In 1994, the two opened a clandestine underground nightclub for unusual bands and performance artists in the [[North Hollywood]] district until the venue was inevitably raided and shut down by police. In 2001, Crew and Ferguson re-opened the club as the [[California Institute of Abnormalarts]], a dual [[nightclub]] and sideshow [[museum]] which hosts weird bands, performers, [[burlesque]] acts, [[freak show]]s and film screenings and displays a wide array of sideshow memorabilia ranging from [[Fiji mermaid]]s and [[pickled punks]] to the preserved corpse of a late 19th century circus clown.<ref name="LAWeeklyCIA">{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2006-10-05/news/best-place-to-find-a-dead-clown/ |title=Best Place to Find a Dead Clown |publisher=[[LA Weekly]] |date=October 5, 2006 |author=Wagman, Diana}}</ref><ref name="SalonCIA">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/03/25/clown/ |title=Through Clowning |publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=March 25, 2002 |author=Lemons, Stephen}}</ref><ref name="LATacoCIA">{{cite web |url=http://www.lataco.com/taco/california-institute-of-abnormal-arts-999-eyes-of-endless-dream-freak-show-north-hollywood |title=California Institute of Abnormal Arts ~ 999 Eyes of Endless Dream Sideshow ~ North Hollywood |publisher=LA Taco |date=November 20, 2006}}</ref> On February 9, 2013, Crew and the CIA were featured on the [[Discovery Channel]] reality series ''[[Oddities (TV series)|Oddities]]'', where Crew gave a tour of the building and its oddities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/oddities/return-to-holly-odd-2662988/ |title= Oddities Season 4 Episode 3: Return to Holly-Odd |publisher=[[TV.com]]}}</ref> In 2014 and 2015, the CIA appeared on Halloween-themed episodes of the local interest shows ''[[1st Look]]'' ([[KNBC]]) and ''Eye on LA'' ([[KABC-TV]]), both of which featured interviews with Crew.<ref name="WeirdChicken">{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/it-doesnt-get-any-weirder-than-this-north-hollywood-spot-5050634 |title=It Doesn't Get Any Weirder Than This North Hollywood Spot |date=September 9, 2014 |author=Hermann, Andy |publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://abc7.com/society/eye-on-la-gets-spooky-with-the-best-halloween-themed-spots-in-the-city/1038617/ |title=Eye on L.A. gets spooky with the best Halloween-themed spots in the city |date=October 17, 2015 |publisher=[[KABC-TV]] |author=Malave, Tina}}</ref>

As the theatrical and colorfully-dressed spokesperson and operator of the CIA, Crew himself has become almost as notable as the venue, with the ''[[LA Weekly]]'' newspaper once dubbing him "the [[P. T. Barnum|Barnum]] of Burbank Boulevard", writing "this cracked cat is a towering local cultural institution unto himself", while the book ''L.A. Bizarro'', a chronicle of "the obscure, the absurd and the perverse of Los Angeles", wrote of him as a "natural-born huckster who would have made a great [[snake oil|snake oil salesman]] back in [[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2012-08-30/calendar/what-the-hell-s-been-going-on-in-north-hollywood/ |title=What the Hell's Been Going On in North Hollywood?  |date=August 30, 2012 |publisher=[[LA Weekly]] |author=Whiteside, Johnny}}</ref><ref name="LABizarroCIA">{{cite web |url=http://labizarro.com/2010/08/25/weird-los-angeles-museums/ |title=Clowning Around at the California Institute of Abnormalarts |date=August 5, 2010 |publisher=LA Bizarro |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193442/http://labizarro.com/2010/08/25/weird-los-angeles-museums/ |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>

In September 2012, Crew and Ferguson authored and published a book through the publishing company Mikazuki Publishing House entitled ''Freakshow Los Angeles'', a historical chronicle of Los Angeles' underground sideshow and circus entertainment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mikazukipublishinghouse.com/freakshow_los_angeles.html |title=Freakshow Los Angeles by Carl Crew |publisher=Mikazuki Publishing House}}</ref>

Crew is the great nephew of Gerald "Jerry" Crew, a prominent figure in [[Sasquatch]] mythology as the man who allegedly discovered and made plaster casts of large, unusual footprints in the [[Del Norte County, California]] area in 1958, the media coverage surrounding it which led to the coining of the word "Bigfoot".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/CarlCrewCIA/status/355722084153962496 |title=CarlCrewCIA Twitter status |date=July 12, 2013 |publisher=[[Twitter]]}}</ref>
