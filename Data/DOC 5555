''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' contributor David Drake noted how the record was "moody and atmospheric" throughout its production and G-Eazy's musicianship takes cues from [[Kendrick Lamar]] ("Opportunity Cost", "Downtown Love"), [[Big Sean]] ("I Mean It") and [[Dom Kennedy]] ("Tumblr Girls"). He added that G-Eazy's lyricism works best when he explores inward in response to the world around him and displays glimpses of humanity that should be more prominent, saying "While one does get the feeling that there’s a better album somewhere inside of him, ''These Things Happen'' shows promise."<ref name="Pitchfork"/>
