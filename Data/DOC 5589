'''Solomon Southwick''' (December 25, 1773 – November 18, 1839) was an American newspaper publisher and political figure who was a principal organizer of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]].

Born in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Southwick attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], after which he was apprenticed as a baker and trained as a commercial sailor.  In 1792, he relocated to [[Albany, New York]] to work for the ''Albany Register'' [[newspaper]], of which he later became editor and publisher.  He also became affiliated with the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] and served in a variety of elected and appointed political positions.

In the 1820s, Southwick left the Democratic-Republicans and the ''Albany Register'', and he edited a variety of agricultural and religious newspapers.  He also played a major part in founding the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], and was its 1828 candidate for [[Governor of New York]].  After the Anti-Masons were supplanted by the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] as the major alternative to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Southwick decided to forego further involvement in politics.  He became a successful speaker and lecturer and remained active until his death in Albany.

==Early life==
Solomon Southwick was born in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] on December 25, 1773.  He was the son of [[Solomon Southwick (American Revolution)|Solomon Southwick]] (1731-1797) and Ann Gardner Carpenter Southwick (1748-1783).

The elder Solomon Southwick was the publisher of the [[The Newport Daily News|''Newport Mercury'']] newspaper and an ardent supporter of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause during the [[American Revolution]].<ref>Gorham A.

==Start of career==
The younger Solomon Southwick was educated in Newport and initially apprenticed as a [[baker]].  He briefly pursued training as a commercial [[sailor]], and moved to [[New York City]] in 1791 to become apprenticed as a [[Printer (publishing)|printer]].  In 1792 he relocated to [[Albany, New York]] to work for the ''Albany Register'', a [[newspaper]] aligned with the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which was owned by Robert and John Barber.  His older brother Henry Southwick had also settled in Albany to begin a career as a printer, which likely influenced Solomon Southwick's decision to move from New York City.  Henry Southwick later worked with Solomon Southwick on the ''Albany Register''.<ref>William Hunt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9k6AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA365&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+baker+sailor&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ybZaU-zYKbPPsATr5IH4Cg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20baker%20sailor&f=false The American Biographical Sketch Book], 1849, pages 365-366</ref>

Robert Barber left the ''Albany Register'' later in 1792, and Solomon Southwick became a partner in the newspaper and its associated printing business.  In 1795 he married Jane Barber, the sister of Robert and John Barber.<ref>Charles Evans, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SqXfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA190&lpg=PA190&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+%22john+barber%22+albany+register+1792&source=bl&ots=De3xesnHLY&sig=ZCluLvaSFz7BxvxuPiloz-ACBs4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=47daU4-lHfjNsQT974LQDg&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20%22john%20barber%22%20albany%20register%201792&f=false American Bibliography: 1786-1789], 1912, page 190</ref><ref>James Moore Caller, Maria A.

==Later career==
In addition to editing the ''Albany Register'', Southwick became active in civic life and took part in politics as a Democratic-Republican.  He served on Albany's volunteer fire department beginning in 1801, and was Clerk of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1803 to 1806, and Clerk of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1807 to 1808.<ref>New York Red Book, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zXZIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA143&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+clerk+new+york+assembly+1803+1806&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uLlaU53nPKvjsATK_IGACw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20clerk%20new%20york%20assembly%201803%201806&f=false Clerks of the Assembly], 1922, page 143</ref><ref>Manual for Use of the Legislature of the State of New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VLxXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA549&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+clerk+new+york+senate&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GbpaU8fzFsWisATm1oCYDQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20clerk%20new%20york%20senate&f=false Clerks of the Senate], 1919, page 549</ref>

From 1808 to 1810 Southwick served as [[Sheriff of Albany County, New York]].  In 1812 he was appointed to the [[University of the State of New York|New York State Board of Regents]], and he served until 1823.  Southwick studied law with [[Harmanus Bleecker]], and was admitted to the bar in 1813.  He was the official state printer, and continued to serve in local offices, including [[Postmaster]] of Albany.  At the founding of the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank in 1811, Southwick was elected to serve as its president.<ref>Joel Munsell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MZUPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA276&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+albany+admitted+bar&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9BZcU4_BGbDksASIkoGQDQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20albany%20admitted%20bar&f=false The Albany Annual Register for 1849-1850], Part 2, 1850, page 276</ref><ref>Benson John Lossing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aMMLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA447&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+sheriff&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Mr1aU4-5KbjfsATR9oLQBw&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20sheriff&f=false The Empire State: A Compendious History of the Commonwealth of New York], 1888, page 447</ref><ref>William Lyon Mackenzie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hXssAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA25&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+farmers+and+mechanics+bank&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Fb5aU6aTEaeqsQTYl4DgCQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20farmers%20and%20mechanics%20bank&f=false The Life and Times of Martin Van Buren], 1846, page 25</ref>

In 1812 Southwick was tried for the charge of attempting to bribe Assembly [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] [[Alexander Sheldon]] to procure Assembly votes in favor of a new central bank to replace the [[First Bank of the United States]] after the first bank's charter had expired.  Southwick appeared in court in [[Johnstown, New York|Johnstown]] to face Judge [[James Kent]].  He was prosecuted by [[Thomas Addis Emmet]], and defended by [[Aaron Burr]], [[Daniel Cady]], [[Abraham Van Vechten]] and Ebenezer Foote.  The trial ended with Southwick's acquittal.<ref>Edward French Bullard, [[The Green Bag (1889–1914)|The Green Bag]] magazine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rgwtAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA94&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+bribery+sheldon+kent+burr+foote+cady&hl=en&sa=X&ei=f75aU7_0ONKwsASx8YDwBg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20bribery%20sheldon%20kent%20burr%20foote%20cady&f=false Daniel Cady], March 1897, page 94</ref><ref>F.W.

==Anti-Masonic views==
By 1817 or 1818 Southwick's political views were no longer in line with those of the Democratic-Republicans, and he ceased publication of the ''Albany Register''.  He then published several specialty newspapers, including ''The Plough Boy'', a publication which provided information about farming in New York and advocated the creation of local, county and state agricultural societies.  He also published and edited the ''Christian Visitant'', a religious magazine, and the ''National Democrat'', a political newspaper which opposed the Democratic-Republicans.  Southwick also ran [[Quixotism|quixotic]] campaigns for the [[New York's 9th congressional district special election, 1822|United States House of Representatives]] and [[Governor of New York]] in 1822 as [[New York gubernatorial election, 1822|the candidate of the National Democrats]] (also called the [[National Republican Party]]).<ref>Brigham, Clarence S.

In addition, Southwick opened an office that organized and operated lotteries to raise money for state projects and programs.  According to [[Thurlow Weed]] and other contemporaries, Southwick appeared in the mid-1820s to have become eccentric, and consulted fortune tellers and mystics in an effort to obtain winning lottery numbers for contests held in other states.  Weed and others indicate that Southwick acted for several years as though every time he checked his mail, he was sure to be notified that he had won a large sum, but he never did.  When Southwick sustained personal financial losses in operating New York's lotteries, the state reimbursed him.<ref>Thurlow Weed, Thurlow Weed Barnes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=558MAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA102&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+%22thurlow+weed%22+lottery&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gsJaU5nBPIWosASq2YDIBQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20%22thurlow%20weed%22%20lottery&f=false Life of Thurlow Weed Including His Autobiography and a Memoir], Volume 1, 1884, page 102</ref><ref>Evan Cornog, [https://books.google.com/books?id=POMtIqp_WIYC&pg=PA146&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+%22thurlow+weed%22+lottery&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gsJaU5nBPIWosASq2YDIBQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20%22thurlow%20weed%22%20lottery&f=false The Birth of Empire: DeWitt Clinton and the American Experience, 1769-1828], 1998, page 146</ref><ref>Laws of the State of New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c4s4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA428&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+lottery&hl=en&sa=X&ei=acNaU7CbDNLNsQTi14JA&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20lottery&f=false Law Authorizing Commission to Settle Claims of Solomon Southwick], 1825, page 428</ref>

At the founding of the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], Southwick became one of its chief organizers and proponents.  He published the ''National Observer'', an Anti-Masonic newspaper, and he ran [[New York gubernatorial election, 1828|unsuccessfully for Governor]] as an Anti-Mason in 1828.<ref>Ronald P. Formisano, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BSwQBp7JC9sC&pg=PA103&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+%22national+observer%22+antimason&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZMRaU8DvJofLsAS2y4DoBw&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20%22national%20observer%22%20antimason&f=false For the People: American Populist Movements from the Revolution to the 1850s], 2008, page 103</ref><ref>Joseph Blunt, editor, American Annual Register, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KWE-AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA25&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+governor+1828+antimason&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u8RaU_P5DKrlsATm1YCYBQ&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20governor%201828%20antimason&f=false Votes for Governor in 1828], 1829, page 25</ref>

By 1831 Anti-Masonic influence in New York was on the wane, and Southwick decided to take no further part in politics.  He became a popular moralizer and sermonizer on the statewide lecture circuit, and frequently delivered addresses including ''The Bible'', ''Temperance'', and ''Self-Education'', many of which were also reproduced as pamphlets. From 1837 to 1839 he was associated with the ''Family Newspaper'', a periodical which was published by his son Alfred.<ref>George Rogers Howell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XP9OXSEvvkYC&pg=PA375&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+visitant&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JcBaU_6FAbagsQSztIFI&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20southwick%22%20visitant&f=false Bi-centennial History of County of Albany, 1609-1886], 1886, Volume 2, page 363</ref>
