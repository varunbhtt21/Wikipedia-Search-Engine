'''Nabatean architecture''' refers to the building traditions of the [[Nabateans]] in [[Jordan]]. It includes the temple and tombs of [[Petra]] in the sandstone cliffs of Jordan’s [[Negev desert]]. The style appears a mix of [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Hellenistic]] (Greek) influences.<ref>Temples and Tombs of Petra Approach Guide</ref>

Much of the surviving architecture was excavated out of rock cliffs. So the columns do not actually support anything.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qda6hopYVEcC&pg=PT436&dq=Nabatean+architecture&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7wZbU7L-A7PgsAT0wYKIDA&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Nabatean%20architecture&f=false The Rough Guide to Jordan] by Matthew Telle</ref> Ceramics and coins were also part of the culture.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2PWC98JLn7QC&pg=PA57&dq=Nabatean+architecture&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7wZbU7L-A7PgsAT0wYKIDA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Nabatean%20architecture&f=false Retrieving the Past: Essays on Archaeological Research and Methodology in Honor of Gus W.
