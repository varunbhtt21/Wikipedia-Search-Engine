'''"Go Home Girl"''' is a song written by [[Arthur Alexander]].  It was originally released in 1962 as Alexander's follow-up single to "[[Anna (Go to Him)|Anna]]."  It has since been recorded by [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[Gary U.S. Bonds]] and [[Frank Black]].  

==Arthur Alexander version==
Like "Anna," "Go Home Girl" was inspired by Alexander's difficulties with his wife.  The lyrics portray the singer in love with his best friend's girlfriend, and therefore insisting on breaking off the relationship with the girl in order to preserve his friendship.<ref name=mojo>{{cite book|title=The Mojo Collection: 4th Edition|page=426|year=2007|publisher=Canongate Books|isbn= 9781847676436}}</ref>  Alexander biographer Richard Younger describes the song as taking "the moralistic view of a man who decides that it is wrong to romance his best friend's girl."<ref name=shot/>  The music incorporates elements of both [[country music|country]] and [[R&B music]].<ref name=billboard/>  Rubber City Review detects a [[country music]] twang in the vocal performance.<ref name=rubber>{{cite web|title=The Country Soul of Arthur Alexander|date=May 27, 2012|publisher=Rubber City Review|url=http://rubbercityreview.com/2012/05/the-country-soul-of-arthur-alexander/|accessdate=2015-01-11}}</ref>  Author Roben Jones notes that the [[melody]] and structure of "Go Home Girl" was similar to that of Alexander's first single "[[You Better Move On (song)|You Better Move On]]."<ref>{{cite book|title=Memphis Boys: The Story of American Studios|author=Jones, R.|page=333|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn= 9781604734027}}</ref>  Instrumentation includes [[string instruments]] and Alexander is backed by a [[choir|chorus]] in parts.<ref name=billboard/>  Younger points out a number of similarities between "Go Home Girl" and Alexander's previous releases, including "sparse drum and piano figure," "choppy guitars," "off-beat cymbals" and "lush female vocals."<ref name=shot/>
