'''Pigeon Roost''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Choctaw County, Mississippi]].<ref name="GNIS"/>

Once home to a Chief of the [[Choctaw]] people, and an important stop along the [[Natchez Trace|Old Natchez Road]], nothing remains of the former settlement.

==History==

Pigeon Roost was located along the Old Natchez Road where it crossed the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Mississippi: The WPA Guide to the Magnolia State | publisher = Viking Press | year = 1938 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C4VQ8viRWvYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 400}}</ref>

The settlement was named for the millions of [[passenger pigeon]]s that once roosted there.<ref name="GORP">{{cite web | title = Natchez Trace Parkway Overview | publisher = GORP | url = http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/natchez-trace-parkway-scenic-byways-outdoor-pp2-guide-cid9224-ctid815.html | accessdate = April 26, 2014}}</ref>
 
Nathaniel Folsom of [[New England]] moved there in 1790, and opened "Folsom's Stand and Trading Post", within the Choctaw territory.<ref name="GORP"/>  Pigeon Roost became part of the Natchez-Nashville Mail Route in 1821, which passed "from Nashville to Florence, thence to Columbus, from there to Pigeon Roost, thence to Natchez".<ref>{{cite book | last = McCain | first = William David | title = The Journal of Mississippi History | publisher = Mississippi Department of Archives and History | year = 1949 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=skkTAAAAYAAJ&dq | page = 14}}</ref>

Nathaniel married a Choctaw woman named Ai-ni-chi-ho-yo ("one to be preferred above others"), who was a direct descendant of a long line of Choctaw chiefs.  Their son, David Folsom, assisted with the operation of the trading post, and was notable for his many accomplishments.

David Folsom assisted the Americans in the [[Seminole Wars]] in Florida, and became a colonel.  David also enabled the first wagons to travel from the [[Tombigbee River]] in eastern Mississippi, to the navigable waters of the [[Yazoo River]] in the [[Mississippi Delta]], by assisting early missionaries clear a wagon road from Pigeon Roost their mission at [[Elliott, Mississippi|Elliott]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Conlan | first = Czarina C. | title = David Folsom | publisher = Chronicles of Oklahoma | date = December 1926 | url = http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v004/v004p340.html}}</ref>  David became influential within the Choctaw people, and met with Chief [[Mushulatubbee]] at Pigeon Roost in 1822.<ref name="Kidwell">{{cite book | last = Kidwell | first = Clara Sue | title = Choctaws and Missionaries in Mississippi, 1818-1918 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | year = 1997 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rjB5gBIZOOcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 58, 77, 85}}</ref>  Noted Christian missionary [[Cyrus Byington]] lived with David Folsom in Pigeon Roost in 1823, where David&mdash;a strong believer in Christianity&mdash;taught Byington the Choctaw language.<ref name="Kidwell"/>  In 1826, David Folsom was named [[List of Choctaw chiefs|Chief of the Choctaw Nation]] in its northern district.<ref>{{cite web | title = Natchez Trace Parkway from milepost 109 to 170 | publisher = Legends of America | url = http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ms-natcheztrace5.html | accessdate = April 26, 2014}}</ref>

By the late 1820s, a school for Choctaw children was located at Pigeon Roost, and the community became central to many of the affairs of the Choctaw people.<ref name="Kidwell"/>  Pigeon Roost Cemetery was also located there.<ref>{{gnis|708416|Pigeon Roost Cemetery}}</ref>

In 1830, Pigeon Roost ceased to exist following the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]], which forced the removed of the Choctaw people from Mississippi.

A marker located at mile 203.5 on the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] near Pigeon Roost Creek recognizes the former community.<ref name="GORP"/><ref>{{gnis|675726|Pigeon Roost Creek}}</ref>
