== Career ==
The stories; ''New Year Cat'' and ''The Best Guy in Albert Street'' were both published by [[Puffin Post]]. Mendes then moved to writing picture books, and published two; ''Tomasina's First Dance'' in November 1992 and ''Look at Me, Grandma!'' in January 2001. ''Tomasina's First Dance'' was illustrated by Heather Calder. ''Look at me, Grandma!'' was illustrated by Claire Fletcher. The picture book was praised for the repetitive nature of the writing, however some allusions were deemed too vague for a recommended age group of three to seven.<ref>{{cite web|title=LOOK AT ME, GRANDMA!|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-439-29654-0|work=Publishers Weekly|publisher=publishersweekly.com|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>
