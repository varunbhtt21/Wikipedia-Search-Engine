The '''De Wet Medal''' is a military long service medal which was instituted by the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]] in 1987.

The Union Defence Forces (UDF) were established in 1912 and renamed the South African Defence Force (SADF) in 1958.

The position of the De Wet Medal in the order of precedence remained unchanged, as it was on 27 April 1994, when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted in April 1996 for the two former non-statutory forces, the [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], and again when a new series of military decorations and medals was instituted in South Africa on 27 April 2003.<ref name="Gazette 27376"/><ref name="Gazette 15093"/>

==Description==
;Obverse
The De Wet Medal is a disk struck in bronze, 38 millimetres in diameter and 3 millimetres thick, depicting [[Second Boer War]] General [[Christiaan de Wet]] on horseback, surrounded by a wreath of proteas and inscribed "MEDALJE ~ DE WET ~ MEDAL".<ref name="SADF 1952-1975"/>

;Reverse
The reverse has the [[:File:Coat of Arms of South Africa (1932-2000).svg|pre-1994 South African Coat of Arms]].

;Ribbons
The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with a 4 millimetres wide green band, a 2 millimetres wide white band and a 7 millimetres wide dark blue band, repeated in reverse order and separated by a 6 millimetres wide yellow band in the centre. The green and yellow colours have their origin in the ribbon colours of the three awards which were belatedly instituted in 1920, as retrospective awards for Boer veteran officers and men of the [[Second Boer War]] of 1899â€“1902, the [[Dekoratie voor Trouwe Dienst]], the [[Medalje voor de Anglo-Boere Oorlog]] and the [[Lint voor Verwonding]]. For these three awards, these two colours had been gazetted as green and orange, but the orange appeared as yellow on the actual ribbons.

==Discontinuation==
Conferment of the medal was discontinued in respect of services performed on or after 27 April 2003.<ref name="Gazette 25213"/><ref name="Gazette 26778">Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 26778, Pretoria, 17 September 2004</ref>
