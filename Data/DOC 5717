'''Rade Radivojević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Раде Радивојевић}}; 1874—July 1907), known as '''Vojvoda Dušan''' (Душан), was a [[Serbian Chetnik Organization|Serbian Chetnik vojvoda]] in [[Old Serbia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] during the [[Macedonian Struggle]].

==Life==
Radivojević was born in 1874 in [[Vasojevići]], [[Principality of Montenegro]] (now [[Montenegro]]). He finished the [[Serbian theological school in Prizren]], and started teaching in the [[Oreše]] village near [[Veles (city)|Veles]].

Upon [[Jovan Babunski]]'s joining of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]], also Radivojević joined with his armed band into the vicinity of Veles. In 1905 and 1906 he participated in all action around [[Kičevo]], [[Prilep]] and Veles, together with the ''voivodes'' [[Gligor Sokolović]], [[Stefan Nedić]], [[Vasilije Trbić]], [[Trenko Rujanović]], [[Jovan Dolgač]], [[Mihailo Josifović]] and [[Mihailo Jovanović-Brodski|Mihailo Jovanović]]. Because of hectic guerilla warfare and exhaustion, Radivojević and his band were returned to Serbia in late 1906, where they vacated until spring, 1907.

At this time, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) decided on a major offensive against the Serbian bands on the right side of the Vardar. An IMRO unit of 130 fighters under the command of several Bulgarian officers set off against [[Poreče]] and [[Azot (region)|Azot]] to destroy Serbian bands and villages. The local Serbian bands were weakened and diminished by the constant warfare, thus, in March 1907 when the Ottoman troops proved strong in the Kumanovo region, Radivojević and his band were sent across [[Kosovo (region)|Kosovo]] as aid, and were all wearing [[Albanian dress|Albanian clothes]] with the plan to reach Poreče disguised as Albanian [[kachaks]]. However, they were discovered near the village of [[Pasjane]] in the [[Gnjilane]] region on July 14, 1907, in the local church. An Ottoman army and Albanian [[bashi-bazouk]] numbering 2,000 surrounded the church. The band was almost completely destroyed, with the exception of three Chetniks who were caught a few days after the battle, and then [[sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]]. Rade Radivojević and lieutenant [[Dragoljub Nikolić]] were [[killed in action]].
