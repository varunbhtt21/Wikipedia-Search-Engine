:{{reply|John Weiss}}- Because, it apparently does not meet [[WP:BAND|Wikipedia notability standard]] for inclusion. It already has been speedy deleted, perhaps twice under [[WP:CSD#A7]] criteria. We here, would discuss the subject if it actually is suitable for inclusion or not. Please take a look at [[WP:BAND]], and improve the present article to save it from deletion. You may place your arguments here, against deletion of the article.

::::I see no reason not to '''keep''' this page. [[User:John Weiss|John Weiss]] ([[User talk:John Weiss|talk]]) 02:55, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''. I see no good reason to keep this, other than the band may more become notable over time, but we don't host articles about up-and-coming or borderline-notable bands or artists. Looking at the sources, I see directory listings, youtube links, user reviews or blog reviews, a brief paragraph, links to pages that seem to be maintained by the band itself -- none of which count as [[WP:SIGCOV|significant coverage]] in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that are independent of the subject. I don't see this meeting criterion #1 of [[WP:BAND]] or any other criterion. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 00:01, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. The sources I've given are more than reliable. The subject is very well-known, and I've given multiple reviews from legitimate sources that are not the artist himself, or anybody close to the artist. This definitely meets the first criteria for notability. [[User:John Weiss|John Weiss]] ([[User talk:John Weiss|talk]]) 04:56, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*:It may help if the article is expanded some more. Have the songs charted? Are any specific songs hits? The article, as is, seems fairly vague and I'm having trouble seeing the notability. Why not work on it while it's going through the AFD process and see if that helps. :-) [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 06:25, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

* Okay, let's have a look at those sources, as they currently exist as of this writing:
*# http://thedailyalbum.com/sweet-nothings-plini/ - blog post; from the site's description it seems like a start-up effort
*# http://www.underthegunreview.net/2013/09/29/plini-announces-sweet-nothings-ep-second-in-trilogy/ - trivial mention announcement of an album release, not a review or significant coverage
*# http://plini.bandcamp.com/ - self-published or not independent, not coverage
*# http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/182462/9 - This is a music blog. It might qualify as significant coverage, although the publication appears be local interest to the London area
*# http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/59529/Plini-Sweet-Nothings/ - user review, not written by staff; we can't cite user-generated content. Our article [[Sputnikmusic]] suggests this is an amateur review.
*# http://windsweptedge.com/2013/04/19/review-plini-other-things/ - somebody's personal blog, very unprofessionally written too
*# http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/59529/Plini-Sweet-Nothings/ - same as #5
*# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q23qpmOCaaY - YouTube videos are not valid sources, especially self-made videos of some guy covering a song
*# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrQGE6p_gtE - YouTube videos are not valid sources
*# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_nhj9dYXP0 - YouTube videos are not valid sources
*# http://got-djent.com/band/halcyon - directory listing and trivial mention
*# http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=6446 - directory listing
*# http://www.thecirclepit.com/2013/05/plini-other-things-ep-review.html - amateur review full of spelling errors
*# http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/59529/Plini-Sweet-Nothings/ - same as #5
*# http://plini.bandcamp.com/album/sweet-nothings - self-published or not independent, not coverage
*# http://plini.bandcamp.com/album/other-things - self-published or not independent, not coverage
*# http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/artist/plini - self-published and trivial
*# http://plini.bandcamp.com/album/sweet-nothings - self-published or not independent, not coverage
*# http://ask.fm/plinimusic/answer/110841882349 - trivial self-mention, this can't be considered a source
*# http://www.underthegunreview.net/2014/03/12/plini-shreds-through-new-song-atlas/ - similar to #2, trivial mention announcement
*# http://halcyonofficial.bandcamp.com/ - similar to #3, this isn't coverage
*# http://plini.bandcamp.com/album/other-things - same as #16
*# http://plini.bandcamp.com/album/sweet-nothings - same as #15
*# http://www.underthegunreview.net/2013/09/29/plini-announces-sweet-nothings-ep-second-in-trilogy/ - trivial mention announcement of an album release, not a review or significant coverage
*# http://plini.bandcamp.com/album/i - self-published or not independent, not coverage
:I'm not seeing any sources in that list that meet all three criteria: '''(a) significant coverage, (b) reliable source,''' and '''(c) independent.''' All of them fail at least one. Therefore, I stand by my '''delete''' comment above. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 17:26, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - The reviews of the band's works are overwhelmingly positive. They will likely become notable in the future. However, I don't think there's enough at this point for their own page. Perhaps the author could look into the possibility of a mention on the main page for the label. [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 17:43, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*:<s>Keep</s> You haven't even seemed to take more than a glance at this article or the references. The subject of the article has an obvious fan-base, and is well-known. The actual reviews I've given are neither self-published or unreliable. I have several references on this article, however, that can't really be considered standalone sources for obvious reasons. But they're there because I try to get as many sources as possible. And for personal information such as birthday and location. I did plenty of research on the subject, and it's obviously enough to prove that Plini is a notable musician. I see absolutely no reason to delete this article. I was surprised that I was the first to make an article for such a well-known musician. He's obviously not a mainstream charting musician, but he's definitely notable. He was a member of a well-known (albeit independent) band, and has released music to critical acclaim. In addition to having a steady fan-base, which should be more than apparent.

*:That being said, I will try and work on this page to make it less vague. But I still think it should be '''kept'''. [[User:John Weiss|John Weiss]] ([[User talk:John Weiss|talk]]) 19:46, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*:::He did vote once. The first one was really just a response comment. I fixed the indentations to clarify that.
*::::I see two "keeps" that might be interpreted as voting aside from the one you indented. I put a strike through the second one to make it clear. :-) [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 14:05, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*:::And John Weiss, I did look carefully at every. single. source. I stand by my position. The references provided are numerous but are mostly not valid to establish notability. Therefore, this musician doesn't meet the first criteria of [[WP:MUSICBIO]], which was the basis of your argument to keep. I see no evidence that any other criteria have been met. I do agree that this musician is certainly getting attention. But we don't publish articles about musicians who are up-and-coming. They must have already arrived. Plini, so far, has not, although he may be getting there. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 05:05, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*::::Plini is not "up and coming." He's obviously notable, and does in fact meet the first criteria as I've proven. I've given at least one reliable, non self-published, independant outside source. Again, I will try my best to find more information to make that more clear (and I would be grateful if someone else helped), but I still think it works as is. [[User:John Weiss|John Weiss]] ([[User talk:John Weiss|talk]]) 18:07, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*:::::No, he isn't "obviously notable" according to Wikipedia notability guidelines. What may be obvious to you isn't obvious to me or others who have commented here. Which source are you referring to? I posted the entire list of sources above and found each of them wanting. The article is now larded with a huge number of non-sources that only serves to give the illusion of notability. Kindly point out the sources that you believe are adequate to establish notability. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 18:54, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' It clearly fails [[WP:BAND]]: no independent sources or appearance on a national chart.--<span style="font-family:Black Chancery;text:grey 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em;">'''[[User:Sabrebd|<span style="color:blue;">SabreBD</span>]]''' ([[User talk:Sabrebd|talk</span>]]) 20:29, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to his band [[Halcyon (band)]]. That one has one good ref, better than this. If that's deleted then delete this too. Plini lacks coverage in independent reliable sources. The analysis of sources by Amatulić is right. [[User:Duffbeerforme|duffbeerforme]] ([[User talk:Duffbeerforme|talk]]) 02:36, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
