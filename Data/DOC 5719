:There is a list of criteria at [[WP:BAND|this link]]; a band that does not come under one or more of those criteria is likely (but not definitely) to not be [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] enough for inclusion into the encyclopædia.

:::The Sputnik review is fine, but it needs at least one other in what Wikipedia calls a reliable source, by my count. [[Special:Contributions/78.18.102.158|78.18.102.158]] ([[User talk:78.18.102.158|talk]]) 01:15, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep.''' The review from Prog Sphere should be fine. [[User:John Weiss|John Weiss]] ([[User talk:John Weiss|talk]]) 05:07, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. The Sputnik review is a good start but by itself is not enough. The prog sphere review is not a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]. Halcyon lacks coverage in multiple independent reliable sources. [[User:Duffbeerforme|duffbeerforme]] ([[User talk:Duffbeerforme|talk]]) 02:41, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*What this article lacks is [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Progsphere is not "fine", Sputnik is not as terrible as Progsphere but is not enough in isolation, and ''everything'' else here is referenced to an invalid [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCES|primary source]] like the band's own promotional profiles on Facebook and Bandcamp. I'm willing to reconsider this if ''good'' sources start showing up, but this version as currently written does not meet [[WP:NMUSIC]] standards and has to be '''deleted'''. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 04:22, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. To meet [[WP:BAND]] criterion #1, we need ''significant'' coverage in ''multiple'' reliable sources (not just one) that are ''independent'' of the subject. ~[[User:Amatulic|Amatulić]] <small>([[User talk:Amatulic#top|talk]])</small> 06:10, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
