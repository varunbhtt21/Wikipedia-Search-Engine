There was a disputed prod on this article, which was deleted in January and then restored last week upon request — however, there's still enough dispute about its actual [[WP:N|notability]] that I thought it best to put it up for wider discussion. Essentially, what we have is a cookbook that was compiled by a politician, given a single small print run and sold locally to raise funds for her reelection campaign — while it did garner a small volume of media coverage in the moment (note for starters that every single one of the few sources cited in the article is dated to a single three-day period), there's little evidence here of any ''sustained'' notability that would warrant a standalone article about the book, when one or two sentences in [[Lisa MacLeod]] would be every bit as effective at giving this the amount of [[WP:WEIGHT]] that it actually warrants. I think it's a '''delete''', personally, but it needs more people weighing in on it than it's had so far. [[User:Bearcat|Bearcat]] ([[User talk:Bearcat|talk]]) 01:57, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' The politician is notable but the book isn't. A burst of local coverage of a campaign gimmick isn't enough.

*'''Keep''' This is the second time this has been nominated for deletion without me (the creator) being nominated (it was a CSD before Bearcat). I think (it was a while ago) I wrote it shortly after release, which is why the references are all spaced close together. It's received coverage from CTV and the Ottawa Citizen (granted Ottawa is local, it's also a city of about a million people). I will try to get some more sources (I'm on holidays now), but it was considered notable enough to be in the DYK section of the main page. --[[User:kelapstick|kelapstick]]<sup>([[User talk:Kelapstick#top|on the run]]) </sup> 10:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
**While it doesn't address Bearcat's comment regarding the timing of sources, [http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2010/09/11/hail_to_the_chef_harper_and_conservative_foodies_share_recipes_in_new_cookbook.html this] entry from the [[Toronto Star]] does address your comment regarding "local coverage" {{u|Cullen328}}. --[[User:kelapstick|kelapstick]]<sup>([[User talk:Kelapstick#top|bainuu]]) </sup> 11:15, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep'''. I wrote this with K-stick as a personal favor to Lisa MacLeod, given my lifelong dedication to the conservative cause. Plus we got paid, though I have no idea what I can do with those weird-looking dollars. Sourcing is on the thin side, as is the article, but it squeaks by, in my opinion. Also, the prose is tasty like foie gras. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 12:58, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:'''Merge''' to [[Lisa MacLeod]]. Any attention the book has gained is solely because she produced it. Biography article is easily of a size that can accommodate it.[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 18:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
