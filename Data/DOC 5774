'''Hills Showground railway station''' is an underground [[rapid transit]] station built by the [[Metro Trains Sydney]] consortium at Doran Drive, [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The station, located near the Castle Hill Showground, was built as part of [[Transport for NSW]]'s [[Sydney Metro Northwest]] project, to serve future train services to [[Rouse Hill, New South Wales|Rouse Hill]] and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]]. The station is planned to eventually serve trains to the [[Sydney central business district]] and [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] as part of the government's 20-year ''Sydney's Rail Future'' strategy.<ref name="srf">{{cite book|title=Sydney's rail future: modernising Sydney's trains|date=June 2012|author=[[Transport for New South Wales]]|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/publications/sydneys-rail-future.pdf}}</ref><ref>[http://sydneymetro.info/project-overview1/documents/23035/download Sydney Metro City & Southwest Project Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917165629/http://sydneymetro.info/project-overview1/documents/23035/download |date=17 September 2015 }} Sydney Metro June 2015</ref><ref name=TransportNSW>[https://www.sydneymetro.info/station/hills-showground-station Hills Showground Station] Sydney Metro</ref> The station opened 26 May 2019.

The original plans for the North West Rail Link showed a station called [[Hills Centre]], after the complex of civic buildings of the same name. This was to have been constructed on the site of the Castle Hill Showground. Following community consultation, it was determined that the station would be moved to the Hills Centre site – requiring its demolition – in order to retain the Showground. The station was renamed as a result.
