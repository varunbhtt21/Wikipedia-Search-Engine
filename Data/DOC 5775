'''Bella Vista railway station''' is a [[rapid transit]] station built by the [[Metro Trains Sydney]] consortium at Lexington Drive, [[Bella Vista, New South Wales|Bella Vista]], on the western edge of the [[Norwest Business Park]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The station was built as part of [[Transport for NSW]]'s [[Sydney Metro Northwest]] project to serve future train services to [[Rouse Hill, New South Wales|Rouse Hill]] and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]]. The station is planned to eventually serve trains to the [[Sydney central business district]] and [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] as part of the government's 20-year ''Sydney's Rail Future'' strategy.<ref name="srf">{{cite book|title=Sydney's rail future: modernising Sydney's trains|date=June 2012|author=[[Transport for New South Wales]]|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/publications/sydneys-rail-future.pdf}}</ref><ref>[http://sydneymetro.info/project-overview1/documents/23035/download Sydney Metro City & Southwest Project Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917165629/http://sydneymetro.info/project-overview1/documents/23035/download |date=17 September 2015 }} Sydney Metro June 2015</ref>

The [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] announced a future railway line to [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], south-east of Bella Vista, as part of its ''Action for Public Transport'' strategy in 1998. Bella Vista was to be served by a [[bus rapid transit]] connection to the new rail terminus.<ref>{{cite book|title=Action for transport 2010: an integrated transport strategy for Sydney|author=New South Wales Department of Transport|year=1998}}</ref> A longer-term plan presented by Co-ordinator General of Rail [[Ron Christie (rail administrator)|Ron Christie]] three years later included a 'Mungerie Park Line', with a station at Burns Road (now called Memorial Avenue) in [[Kellyville, New South Wales|Kellyville]] â€“ about one kilometre north of the present Bella Vista Station site.<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|title=Long-term strategic plan for rail|first=Ron|last=Christie|publisher=Office of the Co-ordinator General of Rail|location=Sydney}}</ref> In the years that followed, Burns Road Station formed part of successive north-western rail proposals, including the Metropolitan Rail Expansion Plan in 2005 and [[Sydney Metro (2008 proposal)|a short-lived metro proposal in 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Media release: release of preferred route for the proposed rail link to for Sydney's north west|author=Office of the Minister for Transport|date=10 March 2002|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news/media/2002/10-03-02-nwrl-min.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/49629/20050503-0000/www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news/media/2002/10-03-02-nwrl-min.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 May 2005}}</ref>

Burns Road opened as a [[North West T-way]] bus station in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/priority-bus-green-lights-scrapped/2007/04/11/1175971183194.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=Priority bus green lights scrapped|first=Linton|last=Besser|date=12 April 2007}}</ref>

Work on the North West Rail Link got underway with the election of the [[Barry O'Farrell|O'Farrell]] Government in 2011. As part of the approved proposal, Burns Road Station was replaced with new stops at Lexington Drive, Bella Vista, to the south and [[Kellyville railway station|Samantha Riley Drive, Kellyville]], to the north. The new station opened to passengers 26 May 2019. The station is operated by Metro Trains Sydney, which was also responsible for the design of the station as part of its Operations, Trains and Systems contract with Transport for NSW.<ref name=TransportNSW>[https://www.sydneymetro.info/station/bella-vista-station Bella Vista Station] Sydney Metro - Transport for NSW</ref><ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/north-west-rail-link-340-million-skytrain-contract-awarded North West Rail Link $340 million skytrain contract awarded] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192215/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/north-west-rail-link-340-million-skytrain-contract-awarded |date=2 January 2014 }} Transport for NSW 18 December 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/83-billion-north-west-rail-link-open-late-2019 $8.3 billion North West Rail Link to open in late 2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426214748/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/83-billion-north-west-rail-link-open-late-2019 |date=26 April 2014 }} Transport for NSW 16 June 2013</ref>
