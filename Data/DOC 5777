'''Tallawong railway station''', originally known as '''Cudgegong Road railway station''', is a station near the intersection of Cudgegong and Schofield Roads, [[Rouse Hill]], in [[Sydney]], Australia. The station is the terminus of the [[Metro North West Line]] to [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood]] that will later be extended through the [[Sydney central business district]] to [[Bankstown railway station|Bankstown]]. Beyond the station lies a train depot.<ref>[http://sydneymetro.info/project-overview1/documents/23035/download Sydney Metro City & Southwest Project Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917165629/http://sydneymetro.info/project-overview1/documents/23035/download |date=17 September 2015}} Sydney Metro June 2015</ref>

The station was originally proposed to be named Cudgegong Road after a nearby road, which in turn was named for a central west NSW property owned by the suburb's namesake, local pastoralist and political figure [[Richard Rouse (politician)|Richard Rouse]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} It could not be named Rouse Hill as this name is used for [[Rouse Hill railway station|a separate station to the east]] at [[Rouse Hill Town Centre]]. [[City of Blacktown|Blacktown City Council]] unsuccessfully proposed naming the surrounding area and station in honour of former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/whitlam-suburb-name-refusal-reveals-geographical-names-board-unique-agenda-20150424-1msq48.html|date=26 April 2015|newspaper=The Sun-Herald|title=Whitlam suburb name refusal reveals Geographical Names Board unique agenda|first=Eamonn|last=Duff}}</ref> In December 2017, the [[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales]] launched a consultation to rename the station Tallawong.<ref>[http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/place_naming/current_proposals/naming_proposal?id=130574 Naming Proposal Tallawong Railway Station] Geographical Names Board of New South Wales</ref> The renaming was confirmed in April 2018.<ref>[http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/place_naming/placename_search/extract?id=MnckFxKmKW Tallawong Railway Station] Geographical Names Board of New South Wales</ref>

== History ==
Though various forms of a rail line to Rouse Hill were proposed by the NSW Government between 1998 and 2010, these generally terminated at Rouse Hill Town Centre. A 2001 plan had the line continue north-west rather than west from Rouse Hill, with the next stop at [[Box Hill, New South Wales|Box Hill]].<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|title=Long-term strategic plan for rail|first=Ron|last=Christie|publisher=Office of the Co-ordinator General of Rail|location=Sydney}}</ref> Tallawong only emerged as a station location in 2012, with the government favouring a future corridor heading west from Rouse Hill towards the existing [[Schofields railway station]] and the future growth area of [[Marsden Park]].

The station opened on 26 May 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://transportnsw.infotransportnsw.info/node/4480|title=Sydney Metro to open 26 May|last=Transport for NSW|first=Customer Experience Division|website=transportnsw.info|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> and is operated by Metro Trains Sydney, who are also responsible for the design of the station.<ref name=TransportNSW>[https://www.sydneymetro.info/station/Tallawong-station Tallewong station] Sydney Metro - Transport for NSW</ref><ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/north-west-rail-link-340-million-skytrain-contract-awarded North West Rail Link $340 million skytrain contract awarded] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192215/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/north-west-rail-link-340-million-skytrain-contract-awarded |date=2 January 2014 }} Transport for NSW 18 December 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/83-billion-north-west-rail-link-open-late-2019 $8.3 billion North West Rail Link to open in late 2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426214748/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/83-billion-north-west-rail-link-open-late-2019 |date=26 April 2014 }} Transport for NSW 16 June 2013</ref>
