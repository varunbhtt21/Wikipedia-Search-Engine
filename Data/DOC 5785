== History ==

Founded in 1944, the company operated under the name Heath Engineering, manufacturing farm implement equipment using shape cutting products.<ref name=Peterson /><ref name=Johnson>Johnson G & Frisby, T (1968). Patent No. [http://www.google.com/patents/USD210245 ''US D210245 S''].</ref> In 1976, ESAB purchased Heath Engineering, making it their robotic welding division. [[ABB]] bought ESAB in 1993, designating it their Welding Systems Division. In 2003, the Rimrock Corporation bought the division and renamed it Wolf Robotics.<ref name=WolfPurchasesWSD>Welding Journal editors (February 2004).
