Almost a quarter of Lindsay's vote (281,796) was on the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] line, while 63,590 of Beame's votes were on the Civil Service Fusion line. [[John Lindsay]], a Republican Congressman from the [[Carolyn B. Maloney|"Silk-Stocking" District]] on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, carried [[Manhattan]], [[Queens]], and traditionally Republican [[Staten Island]] (Richmond), while [[Abraham Beame|Abe Beame]], the City Comptroller, carried [[The Bronx]] and his home borough of [[Brooklyn]], both of which he had also won in the Democratic primary. However, while Beame had also carried Queens in the primary, he lost it to Lindsay in the general election.<ref>Page 41 of the 1966 ''World Almanac & Book of Facts'' and page 69 of Cannato's [https://books.google.com/books?id=Upv5ezVPBOMC&pg=PA69 ''The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York'']</ref>  (Five years later, Bill Buckley's brother [[James L. Buckley]] would win the 1970 New York state election for U.S. Senator on the [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative Party]] line against divided opposition.) The Other vote was 11,104- Vito Battista - United Taxpayer Party; 3,977- Clifton DeBerry - Socialist Workers; 2,087 - Eric Haas - Socialist Labor
