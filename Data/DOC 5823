The church is part of the Osterøy [[parish]] in the [[List of churches in Hordaland#Arna og Åsane prosti|Arna og Åsane]] [[deanery]] in the [[Diocese of Bjørgvin]].

This is the third church building to stand on this site.  The original church from the [[middle ages]] was a [[stave church]].  That one was replaced by a timber church in the early 17th century.  That church was torn down to make room for the present church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osteroy.kyrkja.no/Bruvik.html|title=Bruvik kyrkje|language=Norwegian|publisher=Osterøy kyrkjeleg fellesråd|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515164855/http://www.osteroy.kyrkja.no/Bruvik.html|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}</ref>
