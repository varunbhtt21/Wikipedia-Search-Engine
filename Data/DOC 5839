<small>Created by [[User:Captain Assassin!|Captain Assassin!]] ([[User talk:Captain Assassin!|talk]]). Self nominated at 02:42, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] Article contains only 941 prose characters, far short of the absolute minimum of 1500 (though articles may need to be longer to cover the subject adequately). The article needs significant expansion in order to qualify for DYK. Captain Assassin!, do you think this is feasible within a reasonable period of time? Thanks.

*:Sorry {{u|BlueMoonset}}, I was away for a while, yes I will do it soon and I'll comment back here, thanks. --[[User:Captain Assassin!|<span style="font-variant:small-caps;color:Green;font-family:Trajan Pro;">'''''Captain Assassin!'''''</span>]] <sup><span style="color:Red;font-size:85%;">«[[User talk:Captain Assassin!|T]] ♦ [[Special:Contributions/Captain Assassin!|C]] ♦ [[User:Captain Assassin!/Guestbook|G]]»</span></sup> 09:49, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
*Wording of the hook seems a bit awkward, "auctioned its first 3G and 4G spectrum auction"—how about "held its first 3G and 4G spectrum auction"? [[User:Altamel|Altamel]] ([[User talk:Altamel|talk]]) 23:17, 14 May 2014 (UTC)

*[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] Article has not been edited since before it was nominated. It has been over three weeks, and nothing has been done, nor has a subsequent post been made here. Closing nomination as unsuccessful.
