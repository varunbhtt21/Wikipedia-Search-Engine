==Main characters==
===Steven Universe===
{{main article|Steven Universe (character)}}
The titular protagonist of the series, Steven Quartz Universe{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=16}} (voiced by [[Zach Callison]]) is the youngest and only male member of the Crystal Gems. His characterization is loosely inspired by series creator Rebecca Sugar's younger brother Steven Sugar, a background artist for the show.<ref name="Cavna 2013">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html|title='Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar is a Cartoon Network trailblazer|work=The Washington Post|date=November 1, 2013|author=Michael Cavna|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> His portrayal as a male character whose heroism is based on traditionally [[feminine]] attributes such as [[empathy]] and nurturing, and who seeks to live up to the legacy of his heroic mother, has drawn favorable reaction from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/tv/2016/5/11/11604098/steven-universe-explained|author=Susana Polo|title=Steven Universe, explained|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btchflcks.com/2015/06/strong-in-the-real-way-steven-universe-and-the-shape-of-masculinity-to-come.html#.WbBhUSwo7IU|title=Strong in the Real Way: 'Steven Universe' and the Shape of Masculinity to come|website=Bitch Flicks|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|author=Joseph Cain|title=Superheroes, Steven Universe, and the Maternal Narrative|website=The Mary Sue|date=May 13, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>

In the show, Steven is the son of Greg Universe, a human musician, and Rose Quartz, the former leader of the Crystal Gems. Rose is described as having "given up her physical form to bring [Steven] into the world" as the first Gem-human hybrid, and her gemstone is embedded in his navel.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=16}} At the beginning of the show's narrative, he is in his early teens, but appears younger due to the interaction of his Gem magic with his aging process. Steven is caring, protective, brave, gentle, forgiving, and eager to help the people he loves with their problems; his optimism is often a source of strength for the other Crystal Gems. His gemstone gives him a wide range of magical abilities; one of the long-term [[story arc]]s of the series is his progress in learning about and mastering these abilities, beginning in the first episode with his first successful attempt to summon his Gem weapon, a pink [[shield]]. Other long-lasting character arcs involving Steven include his anxiety about filling his mother's place in the Crystal Gems and coping with her complex legacy, and his developing friendship with his human best friend Connie.

===Garnet===
{{Main article|Garnet (Steven Universe)}}
The disciplined current leader of the Crystal Gems, Garnet (voiced by [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]) is quiet, stoic, pragmatic, and described by Steven as "mysterious", but over the course of the series she becomes more emotionally open, especially in expressing her love for Steven. According to the writers, her great self-confidence is reflected in the fact that she never asks questions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/sdcc2015-steven-universe-roundtable-interview/|publisher=Toonzone|title=SDCC2015: 'Steven Universe' Roundtable Interview|last=Glennon|first=Christopher|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> She possesses red [[garnet]]s embedded in her hands, from which she summons her Gem weapon, a pair of heavy [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. She also has a [[precognition|precognitive]] ability she refers to as "future vision". Garnet has three eyes, over which she wears a [[visor]].

In the first-season finale "[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]", it is revealed that Garnet is a [[#Fusions|fusion]] of two smaller Gems named Ruby and Sapphire. Garnet's existence is thus a personification of Ruby and Sapphire's loving relationship—she describes herself as "a conversation" and "made of love"—and her personality is a stable blending of Ruby and Sapphire's traits. The character of Garnet has won acclaim from critics as a representation of a [[queer]] relationship.<ref name=MarySue1>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-bomb-recap/|website=The Mary Sue|title=The Great Big Steven Universe Recap; Or, The Femme Smooch Heard 'Round the World|author=Vrai Kaiser|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> Though she is normally stoic, Garnet's strongest emotional displays are often centered around fusion: anger and revulsion at what she perceives as abuses or perversions of fusion, and delight when Steven develops the ability to fuse. The second-season episode "[[The Answer (Steven Universe)|The Answer]]", a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] showing how Ruby and Sapphire met and formed Garnet for the first time, was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-Format Animation|an Emmy Award]] and adapted into a children's book.

====Ruby and Sapphire====
Ruby (voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]) and Sapphire (voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]])—the two smaller Gems who are the components of Garnet—first appeared in "[[Jail Break (Steven Universe episode)|Jail Break]]". They have contrasting personalities and abilities: Sapphire is an emotionally reserved Gem who held a high rank on Homeworld, having ice-related powers and the ability to see into the future;{{sfn|Sugar|2016|loc=n.p.}} while Ruby is impulsive and hotheaded, has fire-related abilities, and was a common foot soldier on Homeworld. Garnet's qualities are the result of a "conversation" between these two contrasting personalities. Near the end of the fifth season, after a period of questioning the basis of their relationship in the wake of revelations about Rose Quartz's past, Ruby and Sapphire recommit themselves to each other through marriage; critics described the characters' marriage as a milestone of progress in the history of queer representation in children's television.<ref name="Polygon">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/7/5/17536202/steven-universe-heart-of-the-crystal-gems-the-question-same-sex-couple |title=Steven Universe honored a relationship and broke ground for LGBTQ culture |first=Petrana |last=Radulovic |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=July 5, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref name="ew">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/07/05/steven-universe-same-sex-marriage-proposal-the-question/ |title= ''Steven Universe'' shows a groundbreaking same-sex marriage proposal|last= Romano|first= Nick|date=5 July 2018 |publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date= 3 September 2018}}</ref>

===Amethyst===
{{Main article|Amethyst (Steven Universe)}}
Amethyst (voiced by [[Michaela Dietz]]) is the shortest and youngest of the Crystal Gems other than Steven. Her mischievous sense of humor often provides [[comic relief]], and her fun-loving, childish nature bolsters her friendship with Steven. Her [[amethyst]] gemstone, from which she can summon a [[whip]], is embedded on her chest; she also makes frequent use of [[shapeshifting]] capabilities.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=38–41}} She was the last of the Gems created on Earth as part of the Gem Homeworld's "Kindergarten" project to convert Earth into a Gem-occupied world, and learns in the second season that she is smaller and weaker than other Gems of her type (the "Quartz" warrior caste).  Her rebellious and hedonistic personality covers for deep-seated feelings of inadequacy, resentment, and fear that the other Crystal Gems do not respect her, and a long-term [[character arc]] involves her learning to respect herself and her capabilities.

===Pearl===
{{Main article|Pearl (Steven Universe)}}
Resembling a [[ballerina]] in her slender build, costume, and graceful style of movement, Pearl (voiced by [[Deedee Magno Hall]]) is a short-tempered, precise strategist and technician. Her gemstone is a white [[pearl]] in her forehead from which she can summon a [[spear]] and create holographic images.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=52–55}} She is the most motherly and protective toward Steven of the Gems. Pearl harbored a deep romantic devotion to Rose Quartz, leading to lasting [[grief]] over Rose's absence and [[jealousy]] over her relationship with Greg; major character arcs for Pearl include learning how to cope with and move beyond these emotions. On the Gem homeworld, pearls are a "made-to-order" servant caste, and the fifth season reveals that Pearl originally served Rose Quartz in Rose's original identity of Pink Diamond. Pearl has learned to move beyond her caste role as a fighter and technician, but still has difficulty learning to feel independent rather than subordinate.  Critical response to Pearl has largely appreciated her portrayal as a complex and sympathetic, yet flawed [[queer]] character.<ref name="Pink">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/17/comment-lots-of-childrens-programmes-already-have-lgbt-characters/|title=Comment: Lots of children's programmes already have LGBT characters|last=Payton|first=Naith|date=July 17, 2015|publisher=[[Pink News]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name="MarySue">{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-and-fandom/|title=It's OK to Have Flaws (Except for You): ''Steven Universe'' and Fandom|last=Kaiser|first=Vrai|date=June 11, 2015|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>

==Major supporting characters==
===Greg Universe===
Steven's father Greg (voiced by [[Tom Scharpling]]) is a former rock singer who now lives in his van and runs a car wash in Beach City. Although Steven lives with the Gems, Greg remains a constant presence in his life. Though he is often made uncomfortable by Gem magic, Greg is laid-back, accepting, and supportive of Steven's adventures; it is largely from Greg that Steven inherits his optimistic, empathetic temperament.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=https://player.fm/series/the-steven-universe-podcast/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-ian-jones-quartey-zach-callison-grace-rolek-vol2ep1|title= The Steven Universe Podcast: Steven Universe |publisher=Cartoon Network |host= Mackenzie Atwood|date= 25 January 2018}}</ref>

===Connie Maheswaran===
Connie (voiced by [[Grace Rolek]]) is Steven's best friend. Introduced as an intelligent yet lonely person in the episode "Bubble Buddies" early in the first season, she rapidly develops a close relationship with Steven. An avid reader of [[fantasy literature]], she admires what she calls Steven's "magical destiny" and is eager to be part of it. Her increasing involvement in Gem adventures, eventually leading to her becoming accepted as a member of the Crystal Gems, is a long-term plot arc, including learning to fight with Rose Quartz's sword and coming to see herself as Steven's equal despite not having magical abilities of her own. Another character arc involving Connie is her learning to push back against her overprotective parents.

===Lars and Sadie===
At the beginning of the series, Lars Barriga (voiced by [[Matthew Moy]]) and Sadie Miller (voiced by [[Kate Micucci]]) are teenage employees at the Big Donut, a donut shop that Steven frequently visits. Lars is inconsiderate, irresponsible, and abrasive, but insecure and desperate to be accepted by those he considers to be the "cool kids". Sadie is friendly and shy, but has difficulty asserting herself and tends to try and fix Lars' issues for him. Despite Lars's negative attitude, Steven considers Lars to be a close friend, and Sadie [[puppy love|has a crush on him]]. Lars and Sadie's intermittently affectionate and antagonistic relationship is a recurring focus of episodes in which both characters feature. Matthew Moy has stated that Lars is one of his favorite acting roles, and has described his character as a "complicated fellow".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheMoyWonder/status/619618547291938816|title=The ridiculous screaming. I love when Lars has a complete meltdown & his eyes bug out. He's a complicated fellow|author=Matthew Moy|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> According to [[Rebecca Sugar]], Lars and Sadie are based upon characters she created while in college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvzqk3|author=Rebecca Sugar|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|website=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017|author-link=Rebecca Sugar}}</ref> They appeared in both the [[television pilot|pilot]] episode of ''Steven Universe'' and the first episode of the series proper; they are the only characters other than the Crystal Gems to have speaking roles in those episodes.

Lars is prominently featured at the end of season 4 and beginning of season 5, during which he is abducted and taken to the Gem Homeworld with Steven; his character arc in these episodes focuses on him learning to overcome his fear of embarrassing himself and being perceived as inadequate. This storyline culminates when he is killed defending Steven and others from Homeworld security robots and then revived by Steven's healing powers. When revived, Lars's body has turned pink, and he manifests magical properties, including the ability for Steven to teleport to a pocket dimension via his hair. With his newfound confidence, Lars becomes the leader of a band of fugitive Gems and captain of a stolen spaceship. At the same time, Sadie, left behind on Earth, develops the self-confidence to quit her job at the Big Donut and form a [[horror rock]] band with the "cool kids", "Sadie Killer and the Suspects".

===Rose Quartz===
The original leader of the Crystal Gems, Rose Quartz (voiced by [[Susan Egan]]) is Steven's mother, who "gave up her physical form" to allow Steven to be born. Her gem is embedded in her abdomen. Although she appears only in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, her legacy and her absence define the lives and relationships of the other main characters. She led the ancient rebellion against the Gem homeworld, and the Crystal Gems describe her to Steven as loving and seeing beauty in all forms of life. Flashback episodes show the development of her relationship with Greg from infatuation into love and understanding, and eventually her earlier history as well. Steven initially feels great pressure to live up to her example as a compassionate leader, but his relationship with her memory becomes complicated at the end of the third season when he learns of morally questionable actions that she undertook during the war. "Lion 3: Straight to Video", the first episode in which she appeared (via a videotaped message to Steven), was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-Format Animation|Emmy Award for short-form animation]].

In the fifth-season episode "[[A Single Pale Rose]]", Rose Quartz is revealed to have originally been [[#Great Diamond Authority|Pink Diamond]], the Gem leader overseeing the Gem colonization of the planet Earth. Originally immature and believing herself to be undervalued by the other Diamonds, she was made miserable by the strict expectations placed on her by her status as a Diamond. She created the alternate identity of Rose Quartz to alleviate her boredom while running the colonization of Earth, and ended up falling in love with the diversity of the planet's life and the possibilities that came with it. Unable to protect the life on Earth any other way, she used her new alternate identity to lead the rebellion to protect the planet, and eventually faked her own assassination to break free from her former life.

===Lapis Lazuli===
Lapis Lazuli (voiced by [[Jennifer Paz]]) is a Gem who was trapped in a magical mirror on Earth for thousands of years. When the mirror is given to Steven in the first-season episode “Mirror Gem”, she befriends him, but initially mistrusts the other Crystal Gems and attacks them when Steven frees her. As the first sentient Gem other than the Crystal Gems to appear in the series, Lapis's appearance sets the stage for deeper plot developments; the show’s writers cite it as "really the beginning of the show".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joethejohnston.tumblr.com/post/98475763276/um-so-for-obvious-reasons-i-couldnt-post-the|title=joe the johnston|website=joe the johnston}}</ref> In "[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]", the first-season finale, she prevents the Homeworld Gem Jasper from attacking the Crystal Gems by fusing with her and imprisoning themselves at the bottom of the ocean. After being freed in the third season premiere, she forms a close relationship with Peridot and comes to accept living on Earth. Her character arc in her intermittent appearances since then has involved her slow recovery from the [[psychological trauma]] of having been imprisoned and being part of an abusive fusion, and coping with the fear of being victimized again. Late in the fifth season, she joins the Crystal Gems to fight Blue Diamond. She has powerful [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] control over water and can produce wings made of water from the [[lapis lazuli]] gemstone embedded on her back.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=75}}

===Peridot===
In her introduction, Peridot (voiced by [[Shelby Rabara]]) is a technician dispatched by the Gem Homeworld to check on remaining Gem installations on Earth; her appearance late in the first season becomes an ominous sign that the Crystal Gems are under threat from Homeworld. Stranded on Earth after the events of [[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|the first-season finale]], Peridot becomes a recurring antagonist in the first half of the second season before being eventually captured and convinced to ally with the Crystal Gems to defuse the [[#The Cluster|Cluster]]. When the Crystal Gems first encounter her she wears technological "limb enhancers", which give her a fearsome and robotic appearance; after she is captured, she loses them and appears much shorter and weaker without them. She plays a prominent role in the last part of the second season, during which her character arc centers around learning to outgrow Homeworld’s hierarchical, utilitarian mindset and appreciate the value of friendship, individuality, and life on Earth, eventually declaring herself a member of the Crystal Gems and forming a close relationship with Lapis Lazuli. She is cranky and self-aggrandizing in demeanor, but demonstrates willingness to learn from her mistakes and to treat others with greater respect and kindness. Her gemstone is a triangular [[peridot]] embedded in her forehead,{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=76}} and she discovers in the third season that she has the ability to [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] control metal objects.

===Jasper===
Introduced at the end of the first season, Jasper (voiced by [[Kimberly Brooks]]) is a powerful warrior from Homeworld and a renowned veteran of the ancient war against the Crystal Gems. A subordinate of Pink Diamond created on Earth, she holds a long-standing grudge against the planet and Rose Quartz for Pink's purported destruction. She is openly contemptuous of those she perceives as weak or defective and is "determined to never be weak or vulnerable"<ref>http://www.thewrap.com/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-talks-lgbt-themes-teases-season-3/</ref> herself. Her gemstone is a yellow [[jasper]] in the place of her nose, and her Gem weapon is a heavy [[helmet]].{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=77}} Although she dismisses Gem fusion as a "cheap tactic to make weak Gems stronger", after she is defeated in one-on-one battles against fusions, she resorts to attempting fusion herself, with disastrous results. She is the principal recurring antagonist in the second half of the third season; as a perfectly formed Quartz warrior, she becomes the target of Amethyst's resentment and desire to prove herself. At the end of the season, she attempts fusion with a corrupted Gem monster, becomes corrupted herself, and is neutralized and captured until the corrupted Gems are healed in [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|the fifth season finale]].

===Great Diamond Authority===
The '''Great Diamond Authority''' are the leaders of the Gem Homeworld and its colonies, whom all other Gems are created to serve without question, and the primary antagonists in the fourth and fifth seasons. The first two Diamonds introduced in the series are the vindictive, impatient, and disdainful '''Yellow Diamond''' (voiced by [[Patti LuPone]]) and the depressive and sentimental '''Blue Diamond''' (voiced by [[Lisa Hannigan]]). Yellow and Blue, despite their different approaches, are both motivated to destroy Earth by their mutual grief and guilt over '''[[#Rose Quartz|Pink Diamond]]''''s death, before finally learning at the end of the fifth season that her demise was faked. Yellow and Blue themselves are intimidated by their superior '''White Diamond''' (voiced by [[Christine Ebersole]]), a passive-aggressive, condescending,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.themarysue.com/lets-talk-about-white-diamond-in-steven-universe/ |title = Let's Talk About White Diamond in Steven Universe}}</ref> and narcissistic perfectionist who sees all other Gems as flawed reflections of herself, and possesses the ability to turn other Gems into colorless puppet thralls she can act through. The Diamonds' relationships are portrayed as those of an abusive and controlling family, and it was this dynamic that would drive Pink away to become Rose Quartz and rebel against them. In the [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|fifth-season finale]], the Diamonds are eventually persuaded by Steven to attempt to fix their mistakes rather than ignore them or project them onto others.

===Lion===
Lion (animal noises by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is Steven's mysterious pink pet [[lion]] who possesses a variety of magical abilities. Lion provides Steven with connections to Rose Quartz's legacy—he brings Steven and Connie to Rose's secret armory, and a number of Rose's keepsakes are stored in a pocket dimension accessible via his mane, including her sword and a videotaped message to Steven. He is introduced in the early episode "Steven's Lion", in which he appears mysteriously in the desert and follows Steven home. In season 5, it is implied that Lion was originally an ordinary lion, and, like Lars, developed his magical nature after dying and then being resurrected by Rose Quartz. In the same season, after Lars's resurrection, Lars's hair becomes another portal to the pocket dimension.

==Other recurring characters==
===Humans===
''Steven Universe'' possesses a large cast of occasionally-appearing human characters, many of whom become the focus of episodes that explore their relationships with the main characters and each other. According to critic Sara Goodwin, one of the great strengths of ''Steven Universe'' is the depth of development it gives to its "normal human being" characters and how the superpowered characters are affected by them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-importance-of-human-beings-in-steven-universe/|author=Sara Goodwin|title=Connie, Sadie, and the Importance of Human Beings in Steven Universe|website=The Mary Sue|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>

===Bismuth===
The Crystal Gems' [[weaponsmith]] during the ancient rebellion, Bismuth (voiced by [[Uzo Aduba]]) is passionately devoted to overthrowing the hierarchical structure of Gem society and grateful to Rose Quartz for showing her that an alternative existed. But Bismuth's radicalism led to a dispute with Rose over the use of a weapon designed to permanently destroy enemy Gems, leading Rose to bubble her gem and hide her fate from the other Crystal Gems. In the show's special [[Bismuth (Steven Universe)|hundredth episode]], Steven accidentally frees Bismuth and befriends her, but is later forced to bubble her again when the same conflict repeats itself. Steven later frees Bismuth again in the fifth season so she can attend Ruby and Sapphire's wedding; upon her release, she comes to understand Rose's choices after learning of her true identity as Pink Diamond. 

Aduba's guest performance, and Bismuth's portrayal as a sympathetic character whose complex disagreement with Steven had no easy answers, won praise from critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/100th-episode-steven-universe-means-bismuth-240483|author=Eric Thurm|title=The 100th episode of Steven Universe means "Bismuth"|website=The A.V.

===Ruby squad===
Rubies (all voiced by Charlyne Yi) are a foot soldier Gem caste on Homeworld. Aside from the Crystal Gems' [[#Ruby and Sapphire|Ruby]], a squad of five Rubies sent by Yellow Diamond to locate Jasper appear as recurring characters beginning in the third season. Steven nicknames the quintet according to the location of their gems: the veteran Eyeball, the rookie Leggy, the cheerful Navy, the violent Army, and the leader Doc. They are portrayed as comically [[gullibility|gullible]], but can be ruthless when they realize that they have been tricked. They sometimes fuse to form a giant Ruby. Yi's performance of their diverse personalities has drawn praise from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-recap-hit-the-diamond/|author=Vrai Kaiser|title=Steven Universe Recap: "Hit the Diamond"|website=The Mary Sue|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>

===Pearls===
Pearls (all voiced by Deedee Magno Hall) are a servant Gem caste on Homeworld who serve respected Gems. Aside from the Crystal Gems' [[#Pearl|Pearl]], Pearls belonging to the other Diamonds have appeared. The docile and artistic blue Pearl and the prideful yellow Pearl serve as attendants to their respective Diamonds. Another Pearl who originally belonged to Pink Diamond spent millennia under White Diamond's control, serving as her representative to other Gems; she now has a scar in place of her left eye.

===The Off-Colors===
A group of fugitive Gems from Homeworld, first appearing in season five, who lived in hiding underground because they are regarded as defective or do not conform to Homeworld's expectations. They are the '''Rutile [[Crystal twinning|Twins]]''' (voiced by [[Ashly Burch]]), a Gem with two conjoined bodies from the waist up; '''Fluorite''' (voiced by [[Fisher (band)|Kathy Fisher]]), a huge caterpillar-like [[#Fusions|fusion]] of six Gems; '''Padparadscha''' (voiced by Erica Luttrell), a Sapphire whose defective "future vision" can only predict the recent past; and '''Rhodonite''' (voiced by [[Enuka Okuma]]), an anxious "star-crossed" fusion of a Ruby and a Pearl. Under Lars' leadership, they steal a spaceship and flee Homeworld.

===Nephrite===
'''Nephrite''' (voiced by [[Aparna Nancherla]]) was an officer of the Gem Homeworld's army who was left behind on Earth when the Homeworld Gems abandoned the planet, and became corrupted by the Diamonds' attack. She appears in her corrupted form as '''Centipeetle''' (vocal effects by Dee Bradley Baker), an acid-spitting, [[centipede]]-like monster that the Crystal Gems fight and capture in a bubble in the series premiere "Gem Glow". In the first-season episode "Monster Buddies", Steven frees her from her bubble, causing her to assume a diminutive form, and befriends her. In the third-season episode "Monster Reunion", he partially and temporarily heals her corruption and learns her history. At the end of the fifth season, she and other corrupted Gems are successfully healed with the help of the Diamonds.

===Holly Blue Agate===
Holly (voiced by [[Christine Pedi]]) is the supervisor of Pink Diamond's human zoo, under the direction of Blue Diamond. She is abusive and dismissive to her subordinates at the zoo, but grovels incessantly to superior-ranking Gems.

===Aquamarine===
Aquamarine (voiced by Della Saba) is a Gem [[bounty hunter]] sent on a mission by Homeworld in the fourth season, accompanied by Topaz.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Zach|title=''Steven Universe'' Finds His Destiny… By Losing His Self|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/steven-universe-finds-his-destiny-by-losing-his-se.html|accessdate=September 6, 2017|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> Her childlike, innocent appearance contrasts with her ruthlessness and sarcastic personality; Steven describes her as "awful, small, and mean".

===Topaz===
Topaz (voiced by [[Martha Higareda]]) is a fusion of two Topazes, acting as Aquamarine's enforcer, who imprison captured humans by fusing around them. Although silent and menacing in her first appearance, she soon reveals a sentimental and sympathetic side.

===The Cluster===
The Cluster is an artificial [[#Fusions|fusion]] embedded within the Earth to destroy the planet, formed of millions of broken Gem shards, their minds shattered and desperate to feel whole. In the episode "[[Gem Drill]]", Steven helps its numerous components to find connection among themselves and eventually bubble itself. In the episode "[[Reunited_(Steven_Universe)|Reunited]]", when it is reawakened by the Diamonds, it takes the form of a giant arm and fights Yellow Diamond's ship, revealing that it is in control of itself and now intends to protect the Earth, and returns to its bubble.

===Fusions===
Fusion is a process whereby two or more Gems combine their physical forms and minds to create a larger, more powerful individual who possesses all of the powers of their component Gems and more. Fusions are often able to combine their components' Gem weapons into a more powerful weapon. A strong bond between Gems is the primary driving force enabling them to form and maintain fusions. While the Gem Homeworld allows Gems of the same caste to fuse, usually for combat purposes, mixed-Gem fusions are considered offensive, and those that exist usually [[closeted|keep themselves from public knowledge]]. Same-Gem fusions form a larger version of their components' identical forms, but mixed-Gem fusions usually have extra body parts; for example, Garnet has three eyes and Opal has four arms. The concept of fusion is used by the show's writers for thematic purposes as a broad metaphor for a variety of types of intimacy and relationships.
 
Garnet is listed above as a main character; other fusions involving major characters are listed here in order of appearance.

* '''Opal''' (voiced by [[Aimee Mann]]): The fusion of Amethyst and Pearl, who first appears in the first-season episode "[[Giant Woman]]" as Steven's introduction to the concept of Gem fusion. Amethyst and Pearl rarely fuse, as their conflicting personalities make it difficult for them to achieve the necessary harmony to fuse. Opal can combine Pearl's spear and Amethyst's whip into a [[bow and arrow|bow]].{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=80–81}}
* '''Sugilite''' (voiced by [[Nicki Minaj]]): The fusion of Garnet and Amethyst, introduced and featured prominently in the first-season episode "[[Coach Steven]]". In that episode, Sugilite's behavior is dangerously violent, as Amethyst and Garnet's personalities when fused together become more unrestrained and aggressive, making her  unwilling to separate. She can combine Garnet's gauntlets and Amethyst's whip into a giant [[flail (weapon)|flail]].
* '''Alexandrite''' (voiced by [[Rita Rani Ahuja]]): The fusion of Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, introduced in the first-season episode "Fusion Cuisine". She is formidable in battle due to her massive size, six arms, and flame breath, but confused and unstable when she attempts to socialize with Connie's parents. She appears in the mobile video game ''[[Steven Universe: Attack the Light!]]'' as a powerful combined-attack move.
* '''[[Stevonnie]]''' (voiced by [[AJ Michalka]]): The fusion of Steven and Connie, and the only known instance of a human successfully participating in Gem fusion. Introduced in the first-season episode "[[Alone Together (Steven Universe)|Alone Together]]", Stevonnie has the appearance of a beautiful teenager of [[androgyny|indeterminate]] or [[nonbinary]] gender. The character has received critical acclaim both as a rare example of a nonbinary character and as a metaphor by which the writers explore themes of puberty and maturation, [[Consent#Sexual activity|consent]], and healthy communication.<ref name=vox>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/9/17/9347303/steven-universe-cartoon-network-best|author=Caroline Framke|title=Steven Universe is the most delightful, sex-positive show on television|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/steven-universe-guidebook-spills-the-secrets-of-the-cry-1704470546|author=Meredith Woerner|title=Steven Universe Guidebook Spills The Secrets Of The Crystal Gems|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/14/8961119/what-a-childrens-show-can-teach-us-about-sex-and-healthy-relationships|author=Carli Velocci|title=What a children's show can teach us about sex and healthy relationships|website=Polygon|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>
* '''Malachite''' (voiced by Kimberly Brooks and Jennifer Paz): The fusion of Jasper and Lapis Lazuli. In [[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|the first-season finale]], Jasper fuses with Lapis to defeat the Crystal Gems, only for Lapis to take control of the fusion and imprison themselves at the bottom of the ocean. Though unstable, Malachite remains fused until eventually defeated by Alexandrite in [[Super Watermelon Island|the third-season premiere]]. In the third-season episode "Alone at Sea", in the aftermath of Malachite's separation, Malachite is used as a metaphor for an abusive relationship;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/steven-universe-and-lapis-lazuli-take-fraught-trip-240202|author=Eric Thurm|title=Steven Universe and Lapis Lazuli take a fraught trip through a 'ship|website=[[The A.V.

* '''Rainbow Quartz''': The fusion of Rose Quartz and Pearl. Her only fully formed appearance to date was in the flashback episode “We Need To Talk”, where she took the form of an elegant dancer wearing a leotard and leggings and had no spoken lines. Rose and Pearl's first attempt to fuse, inspired by Garnet, was a turning point in the history of the Crystal Gem rebellion.
** '''Rainbow Quartz 2.0''' (voiced by Alastair James): The fusion of Pearl and Steven, who uses a parasol created from Pearl's spear and Steven's shield.
* '''Sardonyx''' (voiced by [[Alexia Khadime]]): The fusion of Garnet and Pearl, who has the personality of an elegant but attention-seeking entertainer. She can combine Garnet's gauntlets and Pearl's spear into a giant [[sledgehammer|warhammer]]. A major [[plot arc]] in the second season, advertised as the "Week of Sardonyx", deals with Pearl tricking Garnet into fusing for fabricated reasons, and the emotional consequences of that violation.
* '''Smoky Quartz''' (voiced by [[Natasha Lyonne]]): The fusion of Steven and Amethyst. Smoky Quartz first appears in the third-season episode "Earthlings", formed during a moment of commiseration between Steven and Amethyst over their shared fears of not being able to live up to their potential. Smoky Quartz has a playful, self-effacing personality, and can combine Steven's shield and Amethyst's whip into a massive [[yo-yo]] that they use in combat.
* '''Sunstone''' (voiced by Shoniqua Shandai): The fusion of Steven and Garnet, described by reviewer Eric Thurm as "a loose parody of kid-friendly ’80s action characters".<ref name="thurmchangeyourmind">{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/a-really-truly-epic-hourlong-steven-universe-nearly-sp-1831937101|title=A really, truly epic hourlong Steven Universe nearly spells the end of everything|first=Eric|last=Thurm|website=TV Club}}</ref> They can attach Steven's shield to Garnet's gauntlets to use as suction cups.
* '''Obsidian''': The fusion of Steven, Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet, a lava-skinned giant who first appeared in [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|the fifth-season finale]]. Obsidian can combine their components' weapons into the hilt of a giant sword, producing a blade from the magma in their second mouth. The original form of Obsidian, containing Rose Quartz rather than Steven, was the basis for the design of the Crystal Gems' temple.<ref name="thurmchangeyourmind" />

===Sentient plants===

====Watermelon Stevens====
The Watermelon Stevens are living watermelons shaped like Steven, created in the first-season episode "Watermelon Steven" as a result of Steven's ability to create sentient plants. Soon after their creation, they go on a rampage in Beach City; after that, they leave Beach City and form a civilization on the remote Mask Island. They sometimes serve as vessels that Steven can project his mind into.

====Pumpkin====
Pumpkin is a living pumpkin that behaves like a dog. It was created by Steven in the fourth-season episode "[[Gem Harvest]]" and adopted as a pet by Peridot and Lapis.
