}}The '''Gove Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Kunene River]] about {{Convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Huambo]] in [[Huambo Province]], [[Angola]]. The purpose of the dam is to control floods and generate [[hydroelectric]] power. It has a power generating capacity of {{convert|60|MW}} each) (three turbines of {{convert|20|MW}} each), enough to power over 30,000 homes.

==History==
The Gove Dam cost US$279 million and was built by Brazilian construction group [[Odebrecht]].  It was formally inaugurated in August 2012 by the Angolan President.  The dam produces power for the cities of [[Caála]], [[Huambo]], and [[Kuito]].

Construction of the dam began in 1969 and it was completed in 1975. Construction of the power station was halted twice, from 1975 to 1983 due to the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]], then again from 1986 to 2001 also due to fighting. The dam was partially destroyed by dynamite in 1990. Along with the power station, sub-stations at Caála, Dango, and Benfica (in Huambo) were inaugurated at the time of completion. The sub-stations and distribution network cost US$80 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gove Hydroelectric dam inaugurated in Angola|url=http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2012/08/23/gove-hydroelectric-dam-inaugurated-in-angola/|publisher=Macaupub|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>
