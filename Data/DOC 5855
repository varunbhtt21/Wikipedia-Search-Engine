== I want detail ==

In Windows (7) file and folder listings I prefer to see file size and date information, but somehow something changed so that I see only the file names. How can I change it back? --[[User:Halcatalyst|Halcatalyst]] ([[User talk:Halcatalyst|talk]]) 21:48, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:There should be a small icon with a black triangle below the title bar at the right. Click on the triangle and select ''Details''. That should do it. -- [[User:Toshio Yamaguchi|'''<span style="color:black;">Toshio</span>''']] [[User talk:Toshio Yamaguchi|'''<span style="color:black;">Yamaguchi</span>''']] 22:22, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
::Thank you! I would say they did a good job of hiding it in plain sight. --[[User:Halcatalyst|Halcatalyst]] ([[User talk:Halcatalyst|talk]]) 03:39, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

== USB 2 device on USB 3 port ==

When I plug a USB 2 external drive into a USB 3 port, I was surprised to get 25-40% better performance.  Will plugging a USB 2 printer or scanner into a USB 3 port increase the speed the data gets transferred?
