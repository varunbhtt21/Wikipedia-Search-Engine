== Bazhin Gap ==

In the [[Nanga Parbat]] there is a high altitude gap/saddle called "Bazhin Gap". What does "Bazhin" refer to? Local dialect? A name of a person? The expression seems to be mentioned for the first time in the 1930ies. Any lead is appreciated. <span style="color:grey;"><b><small>GEEZER</small></b><sup>[[User talk:Grey Geezer|<span style="color:grey;">nil nisi bene</span>]]</sup></span> 10:18, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:Probably a person.  Note that there is also a "Bazhin Glacier" nearby. [[User:Looie496|Looie496]] ([[User talk:Looie496|talk]]) 14:06, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

== don't put warm food in fridge? ==

I had some leftovers that I was going to save in the fridge, but my mom says don't do that since they are still warm.  I'm supposed to leave them on the counter til they reach room temperature before refrigerating.  She says the same thing when we buy warm stuff from the store.  What's the issue here?  Does the quicker temperature change mess up the food in some way?  Does putting the warm stuff (just an unfinished meal, not anything large) in the fridge temporarily warm up the fridge interior enough to speed the spoilage of other food in the fridge?  Or is the whole thing just silly?  Thanks. [[Special:Contributions/98.207.66.10|98.207.66.10]] ([[User talk:98.207.66.10|talk]]) 19:33, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

::I do wonder if there are climate and cultural differences. The stereotype is that Americans have larger, more powerful fridges than Britons: I know that I have watched the temperature in my fridge rise out of the safe zone, when I have overloaded it. And American food safety advice I have seen seems to assume a much warmer environment than British food safety advice: perhaps in line with the jokes about [[room temperature]] being laughably unrealistic in British labs. And every bit of American advice which claims it is a myth, that I have seen, also has a note about if you left the food to cool and forgot about it for hours, which perhaps shows the motive for the advice.  This would explain why the official governmental advice from the [[NHS]], supported by expert advice, is to allow food to cool before putting it in the fridge, whereas the official governmental advice in America is to not worry about that.

:I'd say it depends.  If you have a powerful, almost empty fridge, containing food that doesn't really need refrigeration anyway (like fruit), and the food you want to put in isn't all that hot, but might tend to spoil quickly, then go for it.  On the other hand, if it's very hot, doesn't need refrigeration all that much, and you will need to cram it in right next to some foods that really need to be properly refrigerated (like egg salad), and your fridge can barely keep up with what's already in it, then wait.

Thanks, I see.  At least this identifies the issue, of warm food in the fridge transferring heat to other food.  Of course letting the warm food sit outside the fridge probably attracts even more bacteria, but whatever.

*This really depends on the food and circumstances.  Soup in a pot with a lid that forms a seal can be brought to a boil and served, then left on the stove with the lid closed, be removed from heat, and let cool overnight.  As long as the lid is not removed and the stock was boiling it is sterile.  Leaving out uncovered eggs or dairy to cool is foolish.  Bacterial growth is normally most rapid around body temperature.  The worst thing to do is to let food sit warm.  It's an easy way to get you restaurant shut down.  Food should be [http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/food-technology/bacterial-food-poisoning/ under 40 or over 140F]. If your fridge is from the 1940's a warm pot might be a problem, but letting a newer model run to cool the food is better than kidney failure.

:This thread reminds me of [[fan death]]. #science people. Putting something hot in the fridge will raise its temperature by .... how much?... versus the fact your food has been at incubating temperature for how much longer?... Actually come to think of it, this seems to be the approach most of europe takes to most problems, so I guess I'm not surprised.

::(<small>Well you Americans with your giant powerful fridges would think that, wouldn't you?</small>)  As Jayron, Stu Rat & Medeis say above, it depends on lots of variables, but I always follow the advice not to put very hot food in a small fridge.  It's just common sense.

:::Fan death strikes me as a socially convenient belief.  Obviously shutting off fans/air conditioners automatically saves money, energy, and removes unpleasant noise from the environment.  Yet for some reason it seems easier for some people to cite a different motivation. [[User:Wnt|Wnt]] ([[User talk:Wnt|talk]]) 01:14, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

Actually, newer model fridges may not be as good in dealing with this problem than older models. The newer models are a lot more energy efficient due to better insulation, but that means that the fridge doesn't run its engine as often as the older models. If you place a hot object in such a newer model fridge then the temperature in the neighborhood of the hot object will rise a lot more before the engine will run. If the engine only runs once every hour, then the heat from the hot object would have had to trigger the thermostat to run the engine, but that means that the stuff in the direct neighborhood of the object will have been heated well above the ideal temperature. In contrast, if you have an inefficient fridge that runs its engine every five minutes, then the heat from the object is irrelevant. There is then a large heat flux from the environment moving into the fridge that is almost constantly being pumped out.

What I do is I place hot objects in the freezing compartment of the fridge for about 15 minutes to cool them down to about 5 C (the time depends on the size of the object). The thermostat of the fridge reacts immediately to anything placed there and it's also well isolated from other stuff in the fridge (I don't use the freezing compartment of the fridge for storage at all).

== Hypoxia ==

I have read the article on hypoxia, but it did not answer my questions. What are the cumulative effects of marginal hypoxia? What would the main symptoms be?

Steel gasoline (UK: petrol) tanks of cars and motorcycles that have internal rust are difficult to clean, access is only via by small openings and most of the inner surface is out of sight. Vinegar which is mainly dilute [[Acetic acid]] is suggested in online videos as a rust remover so I experimented by letting the head of a rusty screw soak overnight in a teaspoonful of concentrated "Vinegar Essence 35%" which is cheap (and is probably safer than an industrial chemical such as phosphoric acid). The pictures show my results which are promising. The questions are:
# Surface rust on the screw has blossomed into a powdery scale (center pic). This happens above the submerged part of the screw. I suppose capillary action and/or a reaction in air occur. Can anyone explain what chemical reaction is likely here?
# The converted rust could be washed off with warm water (right pic). The bolt head is now almost rust free, and I can repeat the treatment. But in the case of a fuel tank I suspect the acid etched surface will be prone to rust again quickly. My question is what is a good way to finish the vinegar treatment? I am considering alternatives such as rinsing with [[Kerosene]], [[Gasoline]] or with dilute [[Sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] ?

:I'm wondering if it makes economic sense to try to remove rust from a gas tank, instead of replacing it.  To remove the rust you will have to remove the gas tank (which is quite a job, in the case of a car), drain it, then use quite a bit of whatever rust removing agent you decide on, then rinse that, then coat it with a large quantity of some type of anti-rust treatment, then maybe let it cure for a while, then rinse again, dry all the water out, then re-install.  The labor and other costs of all this sounds like it would exceed that of a new tank (or maybe a used one from a junkyard). Perhaps an exception might exist for old tanks for which no replacement can be found, or when you need to keep the original parts intact in a classic vehicle.

:If you need to do this because its a '''Classic''' vehicle its only worth doing properly. I used to own  classic  cars,  so know,  that if you don't get all the corrosion off and the new surface properly sealed again the rust comes back real quick. Here's a link with photos.
