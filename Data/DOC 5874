== Coffee, tea, or alcohol. ==

A friend is curious what would be more ''culturally'' appropriate to offer as a drink in this case; a 16 y/o Irish girl has just spent a long day at the hospital with her dad in Belgium, and found out that her father is undergoing probably routine but emergency surgery, say for an impacted gallbladder.  Would a fellow Irish businessman, acting as informal guardian, assuming he wanted to offer a pickmeup, offer the girl coffee, tea, or an alcoholic beverage?  (Nothing sexual is implied, he's a friend of the family.)  This is for a short story, all that is wanted is cultural authenticity in regards to a mood improver.  Thanks.

:[[Tea_culture#Ireland]] would imply tea would be appropriate.  To wit: "Ireland has, for a long time, been the biggest per-capita consumer of tea in the world."  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 03:29, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:According to [[Legal drinking age]], in Belgium, it's "16 for beer and wine, 18 for spirits", so he could legally offer beer or wine, but not hard liquor. In Ireland, the drinking age is 18, so if she's a good girl, she's never had any alcohol in the homeland. —[[User:Nricardo|Nelson Ricardo]] ([[User talk:Nricardo|talk]]) 03:32, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:::In the Irish TV comedy ''[[Father Ted]]'', the eponymous priest has a housekeeper called [[Mrs Doyle]] who continually pesters guests to the presbytery to drink tea. When one visiting priest tells her that he's allergic to tea and will die if he drinks one drop, he's still not let off the hook.

:::Re your last comment, μηδείς, in the UK (and I would have thought also in Eire, though I have only visited and will stand correction) there is no widespread stigma against teenagers drinking coffee, other than their own personal taste. Of course, most of the coffee consumed here is rather innocuous [[Instant coffee]], not percolated. {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} [[Special:Contributions/212.95.237.92|212.95.237.92]] ([[User talk:212.95.237.92|talk]]) 13:24, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:::::I took a course in [[Critical Incident Stress Management]] (helping people to deal with the immediate aftermath of a critical incident, e.g. a death or serious accident) here in Ireland. It was noted that the default setting for almost all Irish people dealing with a serious event is to 'put the kettle on' - that is, to make a cup of tea - and, in fact, we were advised that if we are ever in the position of having to help someone 'defuse' after an incident, we should get tea brewing as a matter of priority. So yes, for the purposes of your story, offering tea would be just right. - [[User:Cucumber Mike|Cucumber Mike]] ([[User talk:Cucumber Mike|talk]]) 19:14, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

Tea or coffee.  Paedophiles have bribed victims with alcohol; and the Irish Roman Catholic Church is in a historic child abuse scandal - about why bishops did not act on allegations against priests and so on.  There are fewer circumstances it is appropriate to give any U18 alcohol; even a legal guardian with no perverted interest is aware of how it is perceived.  It would be mitigated if there were a female adult present, if it were in the context of a meal or if they both had alcohol.  One alcohol which would be completely acceptable would be Irish coffee - filter coffee with an alcoholic component.  It is difficult or impossible to abuse, because it costs $5-10, and is so difficult to make that in my experience the bar staff always had to phone the publican.  I've routinely had coffee since at least 16.  My IP address locates to Lisburn, UK/Ireland.  --[[Special:Contributions/81.145.165.2|81.145.165.2]] ([[User talk:81.145.165.2|talk]]) 11:36, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

== how much profit do mobile manufactureres make? ==

how much profit do mobile manufaturers make on the MSRP of a product? for example, a Galaxy S5 will cost USD 971 for an end buyer. now out of this USD 971, what percentage goes to Samsung and what to the retailer?  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:EditorMakingEdits|EditorMakingEdits]] ([[User talk:EditorMakingEdits|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/EditorMakingEdits|contribs]]) 11:52, 20 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::The quick answer is that (according to our [[Samsung]] article) Samsung reported profits of $27.6 billion in 2010.

:There will be no fixed amount.  The unit will be sold at different prices to different wholesalers in different countries, depending partly on the quantity sold, but also on how keen Samsung is to break into a particular market and how good the wholesaler is at negotiating the price down.  Even if you knew this price (which you are unlikely ever to find out because it is commercially sensitive), to find the profit per unit you would still need to proportion out Samsung's manufacturing costs and overheads to particular products.  No doubt Samsung do this internally, but they are unlikely to publish the information.  I suspect that they have actually made a loss on the first few hundred thousand sold, and will not start making a significant profit until the product becomes popular and sales reach a million or so (<small>mileage will vary depending on product.</small>)  [[User:Dbfirs|''<font face="verdana"><font color="blue">D</font><font color="#00ccff">b</font><font color="#44ffcc">f</font><font color="66ff66">i</font><font color="44ee44">r</font><font color="44aa44">s</font></font>'']] 07:12, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

People have backtracked and priced components and ended up with, say, 140% manufacturing cost compared to sale price for an iphone.  That emphasises how much guesswork there really is.  Also, account for shared components with other models, development of the next model, paying debts, currency exchange rates and working practices.  Whereas the Dutch go home at 15.30, the South Koreans finish work at probably 20.00.  Google might charge for software.

== Religious prohibitions on the celebration of birthdays and holidays ==

One of the Jehovah's Witnesses' most famous practices is [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Celebrations|their non-celebration of birthdays, Christmas, Mother's Day, Halloween, New Year's Day, Valentine's Day and other holidays]] other than the Memorial of Christ's Death (although they do celebrate weddings, anniversaries and funerals). From what I read, this was not one of their founding doctrines (unlike their 606, and later, 607 B.C. date for the Babylonian Captivity); in fact, this doctrine comes only from 1951, long after various splinter groups (both from the Witnesses, and from the [[Bible Student movement]]) had formed, and six years after their prohibition of blood transfusions.

Now here are my questions: 1. Do any of the non-JW groups in the Bible Student movement also share this practice of not celebrating birthdays and holidays? 2. Are there any other religions outside of the Jehovah's Witnesses, Bible Study movement or not, Christian or not, or organizations, religious or not, that also share this practice? And among these other groups (if there are any), why do they follow the practice? 3. How did this doctrine develop? Our articles do not mention how the doctrine was formulated, although our article on [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices]] does mention that at least some practices are formulated at meetings of the JW's [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]]; however the Governing Body did not exist in 1951.

:The only holidays that fall under the scope of religious guidance are religious holidays. If a religion doesn't celebrate that day as holy, it ceases to be a holiday. If it ceases to be, its presence can't be ignored. If a church commands a flock to not observe certain secular customs on particular days, then that forced non-observational practice becomes its own annual religious tradition.

== Active Financing Exception and CFC Look-Through Rule ==
I have received two petitions in the past week or so asking my support to end the "Active Financing Exception" and the "CFC Look-Through Rule." I have never heard of either of them.

:I'll confess I only know a little. Essentially the exception and rule are methods corporations use to pay less in taxes. I don't have any insight here beyond a few minutes searching Google. Here are a couple of sources that look helpful:
*Seems like a reasonably good explanation here: [http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/proctor_and_gamble_fc42612.pdf]
*"The CFC look-through rule, a much broader and more generous exclusion, provides that certain dividends, interest, rents and royalties paid between foreign subsidiaries of the U.S. group, provided not allocable to other subpart F income, will not immediately be subject to federal income tax."[www.icpas.org/WorkArea/downloadasset.aspx?id=3992]
*"Newly reached fiscal cliff agreement has made it possible for US banks and other large cross-border companies to retain a key tax break covering billions of dollars in foreign income. Multinationals would be allowed after extension of the so-called “subpart F exception for active financing income” to defer paying US taxes on certain financial business deals performed outside the US. The U.S. law imposes tax on that income only when companies brought back to the United States."

== Is it racist for someone to call themselves white Canadian/American of European ancestry?  ==

And is it also racist for someone te describe someone with pale skin if they are talking someone they met? Because for example if someone says their college professor is of Japanese descent, is it rude for someone to say for example the person I'm dating is white, has European ancestry or pale skin? Is this culturally acceptable? [[User:Venustar84|Venustar84]] ([[User talk:Venustar84|talk]]) 17:48, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:I'm from the [[Southern United States]], so my situation may be a bit different, but so far as I and probably most of my family and friends would ask in what context.
:"I'm dating someone [[User:Ian.thomson|(white or European-American), (6'2", 220 lbs, male, brown hair and eyes, late twenties)]]" would probably not be racist, just  merely describing how someone looks.
:Bragging about dating someone for their race as a matter of status probably is racist, even if it is not actively and malevolently so.  There are inactive, unconscious, and (for lack of a better term) "benign" (rather, "less harmful" than "safe") forms of racism.
:If someone states their race online merely to establish what they look like offline, again, no real harm.
:If someone states their race online to look for some sort of social credit, I'd be at least concerned unless there's a good reason for them to mention their race (for example, a user mentioning that they're a minority in a discussion on discrimination against their group).
:That said, there are some individuals who identify as African-American who have paler skin than some people of European ancestry.  Many of them would be offended (even if they completely hide it) at being told they "look white."  They may well have some European ancestry as well, and they're likely well aware of it - but pointing that out may be literally the same as pointing out to someone that one of their ancestors was a rapist.

It's never racist to describe reality. To believe otherwise is to subscribe to some weird religion of unreality for some other reason, often a self-serving one.

:Getting away from the OP's question here, but "describing reality" in certain contexts can indeed indicate racist ideas from the speaker. Consider this conversation: "Dad, I can marry a black guy if I want to- he really loves me and will make a great father for my kids!" dad says, "I doubt it- Black men are six times more likely to end up in jail than white men."

Your question, "Are you suggesting that "most" incarcerated black males did not actually commit the crime of which they were convicted?" implies that the only explanation for the higher incarceration rate is that blacks are falsely convicted of crimes they didn't commit.  Even if that were ''not'' the case (and I'm not saying that it is or it isn't), there are still systemic problems that lead to higher incarceration rates for black Americans than white Americans, including things that happen both ''before'' crimes are committed (lower socioeconomic status is correlated to higher crime rates regardless of race; on average blacks are poorer) and after (the aforementioned studies).  Both factors point to problems in the American society at large that need fixing.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 11:04, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::::I did mean the rate of incarceration, but this has nothing to do with whether a given offender is actually guilty of the crime they are convicted of. E.g. black and white Americans use marijuana at similar rates, but the arrest rate for black Americans is disproportionately high. The ''rate'' of incarceration would go down if arrests were proportional to offense, but they are not, see e.g. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/] [https://www.aclu.org/billions-dollars-wasted-racially-biased-arrests].
