== Not religious. Not agnostic. Not atheist. Just doesn't care. ==

Is there a simple label for someone who is clearly not religious, but doesn't fit the formal definitions of [[atheist]] or [[agnostic]]? This would be someone who never really thinks about the matter, and doesn't really care of god exists, or not. It's a description I feel would apply to a lot of people I know, but we don't seem to have a formal label for them. Or do we?  [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 01:08, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:I think you're talking about [[apatheist]]s, although your first sentence would also apply to people who very strongly believe in God and want to serve God, but don't believe in churches and such. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 01:09, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
::I definitely don't mean the latter. That would involve too much thinking about the matter. [[Apatheist]] comes close - "''someone who considers the question of the existence of gods as neither meaningful nor relevant to their life''" - but is obviously not a common word. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 01:25, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:Apatheism covers the "doesn't really care" part of the question but it's not a statement of belief or disbelief. So there's typically a better term to describe the apatheist's actual beliefs (after all, apathy doesn't mean you've never thought about it -- just that it's not important). [[Nontheism]] would be the broader term. If your version of not caring allows for the possibility of a god, agnostic could also apply. "Strong agnosticism" is similar to apatheism in that it renders the question of god unknowable in an absolute sense. [[Post-theism]] considers the idea of God irrelevant for the modern world. [[Irreligion|Irreligious]] indicates lack of religion (i.e. belief/disbelief in god not required, but religion is rejected).  --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 02:20, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
::Nah, that's all far too complex for the approach to life I'm talking about. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 05:12, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:::You can ''be'' agnostic (not claiming to ''know'' that a deity exists), atheist (not ''believing'' that a deity exists) or irreligious (not interested in organised religion), or any combination thereof without actually giving much consideration to your formal position. In any case, the relevant terms would still apply. Similarly, the autonomic processes that keep you alive may be ''complex'', but a lack of awareness about how those processes work doesn't change the fact that they ''happen'' and that the terms for those processes still apply to you.--[[User:Jeffro77|<span style='color:#365F91'>'''Jeffro'''</span><span style='color:#FFC000'>''77''</span>]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 05:20, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

== Czech sentence ==

Could anybody fix the Czech sentence "moja žena je raniena" for me please? Google Translate gives me "moj<u>e</u> žena je <u>z</u>ran<u>ěn</u>" but (though having zero knowledge of Czech), I find this implausible as it seems to lack gender agreement. In contrast GT gives me e.g. "moja żona jest ranna" and "моя жена ранена" so it can do gender agreement - does it just have blind spot when it comes to Czech? Also, where did the initial "z-" come from? do I really need it? Also, [[Czech_declension#Short_forms]] says ''There are also short forms in <u>some</u> adjectives. They are used <u>in the nominative</u> and are <u>regarded as literary</u> in the contemporary language.'' - so if a participle isn't one of the ''some'', or one doesn't have ''literary'' pretensions, how can one form a predicate of the type needed for my sentence (also why would one decline a short form?)? Thanks, --[[User:Catslash|catslash]] ([[User talk:Catslash|talk]]) 02:38, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:I don't know Czech, but I know that Slavic languages distinguish between [[perfective aspect]] and [[imperfective aspect]], and that very often verbs without a prefix are imperfective while verbs with a prefix (such as ''z-'') are perfective. So that's probably where the ''z-'' comes from. At any rate, [http://sport.idnes.cz/moravska-vyskarska-tour-prisla-o-jednu-z-hvezd-friedrichova-je-zranena-13q-/atletika.aspx?c=A101227_173016_atletika_par this Czech headline] says of [[Ariane Friedrich]] (who ruptured her Achilles tendon), "Friedrichová je zraněná", so maybe "<s>moja</s><u>moje</u> žena je zraněná" is the right way of saying it. I hope an actual Czech speaker shows up, though. [[User:Angr|Angr]] ([[User talk:Angr|talk]]) 10:24, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:According to [[wikt:můj|Wiktionary's entry for ''můj'']], the nominative singular feminine form is ''moje'' (not ''moja''), so Google Translate seems to be right in translating "my wife" as ''moje žena''. [[User:Angr|Angr]] ([[User talk:Angr|talk]]) 10:30, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
::Thank you, particularly for the link to the Dnes article. Yes the perfective is surely wanted for the past passive participle, but for this particular verb I was expecting it to be the same as the imperfective - as in the Russian version of the sentence above. The original sentence was an utterance reported by someone who though able to communicate freely in Czech, had not studied it formally and so was very likely using a sort of generic Slavonic with a Czech accent. This might have made the ''z-'' unexpected and easily missed, and likewise caused ''moje'' to be heard as ''moja''. There is a small chance that even though the speaker was reported as being ethnic Czech, the utterance might have been intended as being in Slovak. So (supplementary question), could anybody give me the correct Slovak rendering of the sentence please? --[[User:Catslash|catslash]] ([[User talk:Catslash|talk]]) 14:58, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

It's "moje žena je zraněná". The short form version would be "zraněna" without the long vowel on the end, either I think are acceptable. My Slovak is only rudimentary but I think it would be the same except with moja for moje, and zranena, -á without the ě. - [[user:filelakeshoe|filelakeshoe]] ([[user talk:filelakeshoe|t]] / [[special:contributions/filelakeshoe|c]]) 17:56, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

Re: short forms, they're usually used with adjectives that derive from verbs. For example the verb here is zranit - to wound (perfective), "zraněn ,-a ,-o" is the passive participle or the short form and "zraněný, -á, -é" is the full, declinable adjective. There are a few other adjectives that do it like "jsem si jistý" (I am sure) can just be "jsem si jist" in formal writing. - [[user:filelakeshoe|filelakeshoe]] ([[user talk:filelakeshoe|t]] / [[special:contributions/filelakeshoe|c]]) 18:04, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

:Many thanks filelakeshoe. As you are a Czech Republic resident, I will take that to be an authoritative answer. --[[User:Catslash|catslash]] ([[User talk:Catslash|talk]]) 00:55, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

== Artificial 'boo' in horrors ==

Is there a name for the sudden, artificial 'boo'-like sound effect often added at the end of the suspension moments in horror films to increase terror? [[User:Brandmeister|Brandmeister]]<sup>[[User talk:Brandmeister|talk]]</sup>   15:22, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:I'm not sure because "boo" sounds so meek, but do you mean something like a [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord "scare chord"], "cousin to the [[Sting (musical phrase)|sting]]"? ---[[User:Sluzzelin|Sluzzelin]] [[User talk:Sluzzelin|<small>talk</small>]] 15:35, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
::Specifically, like [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYJrxezWLUk&t=2m15s at 2:15], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6DYsGTMkCU&t=2m04s 2:04] or [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YM9wBIgY-Y&t=1m25s at 1:25]? [[User:Brandmeister|Brandmeister]]<sup>[[User talk:Brandmeister|talk]]</sup>   15:58, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Those three examples use a non-musical noise (heavy slamming with heavy reverb, shots) for the main [[Dynamics_(music)#Sudden_changes_and_accented_notes|sforzando]]. Though technically not chords, I still view their function as that of a scare chord. A related tool, the [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNoteNightmare "last note nightmare"], sometimes uses this sort of echoing slamming door too, instead of an actual chord. In a symphony orchestra you'd have to make do with the percussion section for this noise effect, but in the studio you're not limited to instruments and performers. Besides being scary for being a sudden loud noise, the slamming can also evoke the eerie [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostButler "ghost butler"] effect. <small>(Ok, I'm done spamming you with links to TV Tropes now).</small> ---[[User:Sluzzelin|Sluzzelin]] [[User talk:Sluzzelin|<small>talk</small>]] 16:32, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

== Euthanize in Spanish ==

Hello,<br><br>
I was wondering how to say "euthanize" (the verb) in (Castillian) Spanish, but online machine translators were not very helpful.  Could someone please give me the verb in Spanish?  Thanks!<br>
Sincerely,<br>
[[Special:Contributions/68.175.115.117|68.175.115.117]] ([[User talk:68.175.115.117|talk]]) 17:42, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:Spanish has no such verb, according to [http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/172073/is-there-a-spanish-verb-to-euthanize-if-so-what-is-it This] site.  It appears that only the noun form "eutanasia" (as in English, a borrowing from Greek) exists.  I also believe that the English verb is a much more recent neologism from the noun, which is probably much older.  English, as a language, is known for inventing words like "euthanize" with more easily than other languages.  Etymonline dates "euthanize" to [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euthanize 1915] while it dates "euthanasia" to [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euthanasia&allowed_in_frame=0 around 1600].  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 19:33, 19 April 2014 (UTC)

Is there a word that describes fusion of three inputs into one (as in 3 veins coalescing into one common vein)?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.199.139.183|70.199.139.183]] ([[User talk:70.199.139.183|talk]]) 20:57, 19 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
