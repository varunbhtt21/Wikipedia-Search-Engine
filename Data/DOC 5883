== Architectural career ==
[[File:207 Bluff Road, Sandringham.jpeg|thumb|207 Bluff Road, Sandringham, Victoria, Australia. Mewton's residence for two decades.]]
Mewton began his architectural career in 1923, working at the [[Blackett, Foster & Craig]] office while studying at night at the Working Men's College (later to be known as the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], RMIT).<ref name=encyclopaedia /> Throughout 1926 to 1928 Mewton attended night classes at the [[Melbourne University Architectural Atelier]] (MUAA).<ref name=langmore /> After graduating from MUAA on 27 August 1928 Mewton travelled to London with [[Roy Grounds]] and [[Oscar Bayne]], colleagues at the University Atelier.<ref name=langmore /><ref name=encyclopaedia /> Here Grounds, Mewton and Bayne lived together in rented accommodation in London.<ref name=encyclopaedia />

During his time in London, Mewton worked for [[Adems Holden & Pearson]], the firm is known for the design of the modernist brick and concrete suburban [[London Underground]] railway stations.<ref name=encyclopaedia />

In 1929 after travelling to New York Mewton started working in the [[Van Alen]] office. At the time the firm was in the completion stage of the Chrysler buildings.<ref name=ancestry>[http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?new=I&gsfn=Geoffrey+Harley&gsln=Mewton&gl=ROOT-CATEGORY&rank=I&gss+sfs62_&msbdy=1905], www.ancestrylibrary.com, viewed 24 April 2014.</ref><ref name=encyclopaedia />

At the age of 25 on 20 October 1930 Mewton returned to London to sit his [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) examinations and took the opportunity to travel throughout Europe.<ref name=ancestry /><ref name=encyclopaedia />

On returning home to Melbourne, Australia on 13 September 1932, Mewton set up his own office.<ref name=encyclopaedia /> A year later Roy Grounds returned to Melbourne and the pair formed the office [[Mewton & Grounds]].<ref name=bayside /><ref name=encyclopaedia /> Together they were subsequently responsible for the design of several buildings that introduced modernism to Melbourne.<ref name=bayside /> Their partnership was informal and each worked individually, collecting their own profits.<ref name=encyclopaedia /> Quickly the pair became acknowledged as the protagonists of modernism in Melbourne.

Within this body of work Mewton demonstrates a skill in rectilinear arrangement which also exhibits an interest in the work of Dutch Modernist Architect [[William Dudok]] and Russian architect [[Lakov Chernikov]].<ref name=bayside /><ref name=encyclopaedia /> The Watt House Toorak, VIC (1934), Fairbairn House, Toorak VIC (1935–1936) and Mewton's own home 207 Bluff Road (1938) epitomise his interest in living room garden windows. To create a house that opened to the garden Mewton used windows that could be folded back completely.<ref name=bayside /><ref name=encyclopaedia /> [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] described Mewton's work as "the perfect example of the Victorian type, house and garden are really planned as one."<ref name=bayside />

In 1939 the partnership between Mewton and Grounds was dissolved. From here Mewton began partnership with [[Edward Billson]]. The pair practised together from 1939 to 1942.<ref name=encyclopaedia />

Mewton worked for the [[Department of Labour and National Service]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=encyclopaedia /><ref name=madge>Madge, J and Peckham, A (2006).

Mewton worked briefly in 1945 for the firm A.C. Leith & Barttett. He assisted in the design of the Housing Commission of Victoria.<ref name=encyclopaedia /> He was nominated that same year as judge for the Sun Post War Homes competition (1945). He was an advocate and committee member of 'Small Homes Service' [[Royal Victorian Institute of Architects]] (RVIA).<ref name=encyclopaedia />

Later in 1945 Mewton joined the firm [[Godfrey & Spowers]]. Also joining the partnership were Eric Hughes and John Lobb. Together they formed '[[Godfrey&Spowers, Hughes, Mewton and Lobb]]'.<ref name=encyclopaedia /><ref name=peterson>Peterson, R (2005). "A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and their people", www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/42.htm</ref> Expanding in the late 1950s the firm began to undertake industrial and office buildings such as; Allan’s Music Building, Collins St (1965), National Mutual Centre Melbourne (1965) and Dallas Brooks Hall (1963–1969).<ref name=spowers>[http://www.spowers.com.au/company-profile/spowers-history/, "Spowers Background"]</ref><ref name=encyclopaedia /> Mewton continued to work for Godrey&Spowers, Hughes, Mewton and Lobb as a partner until he retired in 1980 from practice.<ref name=spowers />
