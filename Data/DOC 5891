== teams jerseys sets from 1970 to 1999 MLB Montreal Expos ==

Is there a website that shows how the team uniforms of each team of Major League Baseball including Montreal Expos look like? I find it interesting that some teams had unique ones like San Diego Padres wore camo jersey, Royals of Kansas City, Blue Jays, Phillies and Expos wore light blue ones.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.54.66.100|70.54.66.100]] ([[User talk:70.54.66.100|talk]]) 04:43, 19 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:The Hall of Fame has a page showing uniform designs.[http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/database.htm] The ones through 1994 or so were taken from Marc Okkonen's book on uniforms. The later ones appear to have been drawn by someone else. But it should give you a good start. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 04:48, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
::It appears they switched from their original 1969 tri-colored script "M" to the script "Expos" in 1992, and retained that design through 2004, their last season in Montreal. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 04:53, 19 April 2014 (UTC)
:::The Montreal Expos were very conservative in terms of uniform design: they wore one style from 1969 (their first season) until 1978; in 1979, they went from blue to red numbers in the front but changed nothing else; in 1980, they added stripes down the shoulders and sides to the basic uniform, reverting to blue numbers at home. In 1992, there was the only important redesign, with a switch to pinstripes at home, a gray road uniform (instead of powder blue), and a solid blue cap instead of tri-color; they also stopped using their logo on the uniform front, switching to "Expos" at home and "Montréal" (with a fleur-de-lys as the accent on the letter E) on the road. They kept that look until the end of the 2004 season. The original tri-color cap was the most distinctive feature of the design and is still way more popular than the more recent all-blue cap among Expo nostalgics. --[[User:Xuxl|Xuxl]] ([[User talk:Xuxl|talk]]) 09:13, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

:The Padres mock "camouflage" uniform is an occasional special thing they wear in order to honor the military, which has a large presence in San Diego. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 07:35, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
