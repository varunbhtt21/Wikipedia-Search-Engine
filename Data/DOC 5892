'''Gjerstad Church''' ({{lang-no|Gjerstad kyrkje}}) is a [[parish church]] in [[Osterøy]] municipality in [[Hordaland]] county, [[Norway]].  It is located in the village of [[Gjerstad, Hordaland|Gjerstad]].  The church is part of the Osterøy [[parish]] in the [[List of churches in Hordaland#Arna og Åsane prosti|Arna og Åsane]] [[deanery]] in the [[Diocese of Bjørgvin]].  The white, wooden church was built in 1870 by the builder Ole Vangberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkesok.no/eng/kirker/Gjerstad-kyrkje-Osteroey|title=Gjerstad kyrkje|publisher=Kirkesøk: Kirkebyggdatabasen|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkekonsulenten.no/kirker.htm|title=Oversikt over Nåværende Kirker|language=Norwegian|publisher=KirkeKonsulenten.no |accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>

The church is the third church to stand on this site.  The first church existed during the [[Middle Ages]] and it was a [[stave church]].  It was probably built about the year 1210.  There are some items from this church that are preserved at the [[Bergen Museum]] such as a soapstone baptismal font.  That church was in poor condition by the 1600s (decade) and so it was taken down and a timber church was built in 1622.  That was followed by the present church in 1870.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osteroy.kyrkja.no/Gjerstad.html |title=Gjerstad kyrkje |language=Norwegian |publisher=Osterøy kyrkjeleg fellesråd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515164900/http://www.osteroy.kyrkja.no/Gjerstad.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}</ref>
