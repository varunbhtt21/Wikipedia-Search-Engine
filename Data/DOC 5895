== MH370 (flight) ==

Is it common for news reporters to refer to a missing aircraft by its flight number, such as "[[MH370]]"?  The aircraft has its own serial number apart from the flight number.  (A similar phenomenon occurred when news reporters began to refer to a series of aircraft crashes by simply stating the month and date of the crashes, "[[9/11]]".) <br>
—[[User:Wavelength|Wavelength]] ([[User talk:Wavelength|talk]]) 03:06, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:It's very common here in the States.  A flight number is generally shorter and/or easier to remember than the aircraft's [[tail number]].  (I'm guessing that by "serial number" you mean tail number.)  The tail number can be up to 5 or 6 characters long and thus rather cumbersome to say again and again.  This is one reason why pilots and air traffic controllers will often abbreviate an aircraft's tail number while communicating.  MH370, Flight 93, Flight 175, or Flight 77 are easier to say and remember.  Add to that the chances of a second instance of MH370 going down being rather slim, there's little reason ''not'' to use the flight number.  <span style="font-family:monospace;">[[User:Dismas|Dismas]]</span>|[[User talk:Dismas|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 03:16, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:Yes, this is common. News reports about such events never mention aircraft registration numbers. Airlines retire flight numbers that have experienced deadly crashes. "9/11" is more memorable than the 4 individual flight numbers. I do note that [[US Airways Flight 1549]], in which everyone survived, is better known as the "Miracle on the Hudson".—[[User:Nricardo|Nelson Ricardo]] ([[User talk:Nricardo|talk]]) 03:18, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

: (ec) Yes, universally common.  You won't find "MH 370" written anywhere on the fuselage, assuming it's ever found.  But the flight number is the public identification of the flight and hence the plane.  Its serial numbers, [[Aircraft registration]] (for Malaysia it's always 9Mxxx), and any other identifying features are all too technical for the public to grasp.  Now, if there were another major incident involving a different plane also travelling on flight MH 370 (at a different time), that would be confusing and some extra ID would be necessary to disambiguate the two events.  But I've not heard of that sort of coincidence ever happening.  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 03:19, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:{{ec}} By convention, flight disasters are known by the flight number, not the airplane call number or serial number.  [[United Airlines Flight 93]], [[Pan Am Flight 103]], [[Air France Flight 447]], etc. are all known by their flight number.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 03:20, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

:I may be being fooled by a [[recency illusion]], but I think this "universally common convention" only started in 1983 when the Soviets [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|shot down a Korean airliner]] that went off-course.  It was flight 7 and flight numbers with less than 3 digits are sometimes padded with leading zeroes.  Journalists found the notation of a flight [[James Bond|numbered 007]] irresistible and into the headlines it went, and and having done that once, they then started copying the practice with all other air disasters, to the point where Wikipedia has copied it as well.  (I may only be talking about North American journalists here.)  --[[Special:Contributions/50.100.193.30|50.100.193.30]] ([[User talk:50.100.193.30|talk]]) 22:44, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:::The crash of [[American Airlines Flight 320]] on February 3, 1959 (yes, ''that'' February 3) didn't seem to be called prominently by its flight number, at least not in the handful of contemporary references I've seen on the internet.

:Journalists have to have SOMETHING to call the story.   Generally, disasters can be named after the place where they happened (eg "The Boston Marathon Bombing") - in the case of a plane crash, if the place it crashes is somewhere with a name - then they often use it (eg "The Lockerbie bombing") - but if the event happens over some large, nameless tract of ocean - or if (as in this case) nobody knew within a million square miles where it went down - what else is there to use than the flight number?   That said, Wikipedia has "[[Pan Am Flight 103]]" as the official title of the article on "The [[Lockerbie bombing]]" - which is odd because I don't think the flight number was much used by the press at the time.  But if you check the "Talk:" page for that article, you'll see there was some discussion about that particular name choice there.

== Playing or Ripping a broken dvd ==

If this question can be asked here, Can anything be done with a DVD that is broken and missing plastic? My idiot sister intentionally destroyed some of my stuff and in the batch of broken items is an EXTREMELY rare DVD that can literally not be found anywhere online now and it took me a lot of time and effort to find it for sale in the first place. It's literally one of a kind and it is extremely important to me. I've only had it a few days, I haven't even watched it all the way through, and now the DVD is broken and missing plastic due to my idiot sister's antics. Not much talk of broken dvds at Google since they're so freaking old and no one really uses them anymore I guess, but I figured if anyone has the answer it's Wikipedia.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.8.106.52|68.8.106.52]] ([[User talk:68.8.106.52|talk]]) 03:27, 20 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

The disc is so damaged that my laptop won't even play it, so I don't think IsoBuster will help since the DVD can't even be read. I tried tape but all that and the misshapen parts of the disc did was prevent the DVD from spinning in the drive. I can't believe this has happened. I've only had it a few days and I haven't even watched it all the way through. It was my most prized possession and it's now destroyed. Jeez. I couldn't even get an apology out of her.

:Sorry about your loss.  I don't think tape is a good idea because it might damage your drive.  I'd have tried superglue, but I don't know the exact condition of the damaged DVD.

::Yeah, it's definitely not good to put a cracked or otherwise damaged disk into the player.   It won't play - and there is a very large risk of it breaking apart under the centrifugal force and wrecking something inside the player.  DVD drives spin at a couple of thousand RPM - and the outward forces on the disk are quite significant.   Trying to fix it wouldn't work - and would probably result in an unbalanced disk, which could also wreck your player.  For these reasons, you stand zero chance of recovering the data without some exceedingly specialized equipment.  I'm quite sure that no matter how rare this DVD was, it's worth less than the cost of recovering it.  Also, depending on where the breaks fell, it's possible that there is data that is simply completely missing.   Although DVD's and CD's have some redundancy in the data so that they can recover from a scratch or other minor imperfection - they really aren't good at recovering from damage that completely spans the disk.  If the disk is truly, demonstrably of great value, you might consider trying to recover the cost from home-owner's insurance.   It's not clear whether they would cover this as an accident - but it might be worth checking. [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] ([[User talk:SteveBaker|talk]]) 19:07, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

(Incidentally - if you'd care to tell us the title of the DVD, maybe we can figure out where you can get a replacement.) [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] ([[User talk:SteveBaker|talk]]) 19:48, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
