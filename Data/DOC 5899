== Sign showing LCCN error when there is none? ==
I created a page recently ([[Japanese minesweeper W-10]]).  On the page, I used an [[LCCN]] book number.  Despite me using the number given in the book, and finding the book I meant to find when clicking on the given link, it shows an error.  Is there any way to get rid of that?[[User:Cnd474747|Cnd474747]] ([[User talk:Cnd474747|talk]]) 01:03, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

== How to remove unwanted period after footnote ==

There is an extra period after the first footnote in this section of this article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Loathing#Plot_and_setting. I've been trying to remove it, but the reference in the infobox looks the same as all the others. My own fiddling with it has had no success. Assistance in its removal would be appreciated.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/98.119.91.79|98.119.91.79]] ([[User talk:98.119.91.79|talk]]) 02:19, 22 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Kaali Venkat Page Deleted ==

Hi Team,

I have created a page for my brother Kaali Venkat,
and I have followed all the standards of Wiki Guidelines,
I want to get Back my post,

:To have an article on Wikipedia, a subject must meet our [[WP:N|notability guideline]].  If you can provide [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] showing your brother is notable then make another request at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].  This will be much more persuasive than your previous request which gave as an undeletion reason merely that he is your brother.  However, you have made it doubly difficult by repeatedly posting the same article after it was deleted causing the page to be locked.  You also have [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] as you are the subject's brother and you should read the policy I linked.

== Is this an appropriate use of a Talk page? ==

I came across a Talk page ([[User talk:MasterMind5991|MasterMind5991]]) that has many comments/discussions that don't seem to me to be relevant to a Talk page; more like some kind of blog or quiz. I am just curious as to whether others think this is an appropriate use of a Wikipedia talk page? Cheers.

Dear,

I've tried all sorts of improvement for:

It's about a musicfestival in the Netherlands. I've looked at other festivals and they have the same information/sources etc. and they did get accepted. Can you give me some advice on what to do?

Hello, [[User:KGraat|KGraat]].  Wikipedia policy requires that information in articles be verified by independent sources, such as news reports, books, magazines articles, music reviews, etc.  Take a look at this article: [[Tottenham Bluegrass Festival]]. It's a just a starter article, but it already includes references from several newspapers and websites not connected to the festival.  Your draft article so far has only one source besides the festival website, and it appears to be a press release from a music promoter, not a neutral, independent source.  If the November Music Festival is a notable festival, then newspapers, magazines and online review websites will have written about it, and you can find these reports and add references to them.  (Sorry, I wrote this before reading [[User:Maproom|Maproom]]'s reply so there is some duplication.) &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 11:04, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

== Crystal Lake South High School ==

Hi - After reading the bio on CLS, the last paragraph should be removed as it is a prank in my opinion.  It states..

<blockquote>
The school now just as any other high school practices the destruction of childrens minds. Forcefully provoking a social structure based on material and work ethic. Instead of the more purposeful expansion of mindfulness, creativity, and a true expansion of an individual on an individual basis.
