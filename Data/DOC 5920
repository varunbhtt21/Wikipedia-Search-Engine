North Carolina came from behind for the win after trailing 14-0 after a quarter of play.<ref name="Peach" /> Mississippi State missed chances to extend its lead in the second quarter when two touchdowns were scuttled by holding penalties. The Tar Heels then drove 82 yards to open the second half and Natrone Means pounded in the score, UNC's only offensive touchdown of the day. Means finished with 128 yards.

Bracey Walker blocked two punts, including one for a 24-yard scoring return that tied the game at 14 in the third quarter.<ref name="MSU" /> The defensive MVP also laid a big hit to key a 44-yard interception return by teammate Cliff Baskervillle for the go-ahead TD in the fourth quarter. MSU added a late field goal, but turned the ball over via interception and downs inside the Tar Heels' 30 on two late drives.<ref name="MSU" />
