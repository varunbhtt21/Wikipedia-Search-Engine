"'''First Love'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Jennifer Lopez]] for her eighth studio album, ''[[A.K.A. (album)|A.K.A.]]'' (2014). It was written by [[Max Martin]], [[Savan Kotecha]] and [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]], and produced by Martin and Ilya, with vocal production being handled by Martin, Peter Carlsson, and Ilya. It was released by [[Capitol Records]] as the album's second single on May 1, 2014. The song was first developed when Lopez was talking to Martin, Kotecha and [[Cory Rooney]] about relationships during a break from the album recording. A day later, they appeared with the lyrics of the track, and Lopez recorded it.

"First Love" is a [[pop music|pop]], [[electropop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with synth beats, "hard-hitting percussion" and "big drums" as the song's instrumentation, with critics also noting influences from her previous material. Lyrically, "First Love" talks about finding true love and wishing you would have met the person you're with now years ago, so they can be your first love. The song received positive reviews from most [[music journalism|music critics]], who commended the track for lifting the bar for high-quality pop music, while also praising its "fun and free feel".

Commercially, "First Love" received minor success on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''US'' Billboard Hot 100]] chart, but managed to receive moderate airplay on the [[Pop Songs|''US'' Pop Songs]] and topped the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|''US'' Hot Dance Club Songs]]. It also reached the top-twenty in [[Spain]] and the top-fifty in [[Italy]]. The accompanying music video for "First Love" was released on May 29, 2014 and was directed by [[Anthony Mandler]]. The black-and-white music video features British model [[David Gandy]] and Lopez during love scenes in a [[desert]]. Lopez promoted the track with live performances on the [[2014 Billboard Music Awards|2014 ''Billboard'' Music Awards]], ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[Late Show with Jimmy Fallon]]'', as well as on her concerts throughout 2014 - blending the song with elements of "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]" as well as a dance-break.

== Background and release ==
While working on her then-upcoming album, Lopez expressed the interest on working with Swedish [[record producer]] and [[songwriter]] [[Max Martin]]. According to the singer, "I had really wanted to work with Max for many, many years, and it just never happened," she explained. She further commented: "For [A.K.A.] I was like, 'I want to work with you.' I met with him in the summertime, and he was like, 'I'm just going off to do [[Adele]]'s album!' or somebody he works with all the time. I was like, 'When are you back?', he was like, 'October', I was like, 'I'll wait for you'."<ref name=fuse>{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Hilary|title=Jennifer Lopez Tells the Story Behind "First Love" - Interview - Fuse|url=http://www.fuse.tv/videos/2014/06/jennifer-lopez-first-love-interview|accessdate=December 8, 2014|work=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]|date=June 19, 2014}}</ref> About Martin, Lopez added: "He's a super producer, maker of great pop hits.

=== Background and shooting ===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="I've been asked if I'd take part in music videos before and I've always said no, but I jumped at the chance of working with a music icon such as Jennifer. The conditions to shoot in were very challenging due to the weather - we were in the desert outside LA and the winds were incredibly strong and we had to deal with plummeting temperatures and sandstorms - but the atmosphere on set was great and we all had a lot of fun."|source=—[[David Gandy]] talking about why he accepted to do the music video.<ref name=vogue>{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Lauren|title=David Gandy Is JLo's "First Love"|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/05/21/david-gandy-jennifer-lopez-music-video-first-love|accessdate=December 9, 2014|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=May 21, 2014}}</ref>}}
A [[music video]] for the song was shot in the [[Deserts of California|California desert]] outside of [[Los Angeles]]  in early May, with [[Anthony Mandler]] being the director. Lopez claimed that the video shoot was the hardest she's done in her career. "It was like the apocalypse," she said on [[iHeartRadio]]. "It was like purgatory. I was waiting for frogs to fall out of the sky. It was a wind storm. Literally, it felt like we were in the middle of a tornado. There was this much dust on my face. We looked like we were covered up on soot. And it was freezing. And of course, you know, in the video I'm not wearing all that much."<ref name=idolatorvid1>{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Christina|title=Jennifer Lopez Teases Steamy "First Love" Video|url=http://www.idolator.com/7519352/jennifer-lopez-first-love-video-teaser|accessdate=June 1, 2014|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|agency=[[Spin Media]]|date=May 21, 2014}}</ref> Regarding the video's concept, she elaborated:
{{cquote|"Just the title, 'First Love,' you think of so many different visuals that can go with that. The song gives you a feeling more than anything, because it's gonna mean so many different things for so many different people. It's not about your first love; it's just, 'I wish you were the person I had met early and then I wouldn't have had to go through all these things.' I just think that was such a beautiful sentiment."<ref name=fuse/>}}

On May 27, 2014, Lopez teased the video on her [[Instagram]] account, uploading a sneak peek of it, also announcing that it would be fully released the same day on [[Entertainment Tonight]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wass|first1=Mike|title=Jennifer Lopez Teases Her Super Sexy "First Love" Video On Instagram|url=http://www.idolator.com/7519952/jennifer-lopez-sexy-first-love-video-preview|accessdate=June 1, 2014|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|publisher=[[Spin Media]]|date=May 27, 2014}}</ref> Lopez also revealed to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', "We talked a lot about whether we would do a little bit of color or pops of color. But Anthony [the director] felt strongly that it be all in black and white. It's a sweet and sexy video, I think," she said. "It definitely captures the feeling of the song."<ref name=people>{{cite news|last1=Gomez|first1=Patrick|title=See Jennifer Lopez in Her Steamy New 'First Love' Video|url=http://www.people.com/article/jennifer-lopez-first-love-music-video|accessdate=June 1, 2014|work=[[People Magazine]]|date=May 30, 2014}}</ref>
