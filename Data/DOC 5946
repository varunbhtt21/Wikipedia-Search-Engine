==History==
The present church at Hamre cannot be dated precisely.  It was historically thought to have been built around 1622, but more recently an inscription on the old main door was found that suggests that it may have been built in 1585, in which case it is the first wooden church to be built near [[Bergen]].  Hamre Church was founded in 1024, and it was the main church for all of [[Nordhordland]].  There isn't much known about the original church building, but at some point it was torn down and a [[stave church]] was built to replace it.  The stave church was replaced by the present church sometime around 1600.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osteroy.kyrkja.no/Hamre.html|title=Hamre kyrkje|publisher=Osterøy kyrkjeleg fellesråd|language=Norwegian}}</ref>
