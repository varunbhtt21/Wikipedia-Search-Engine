Title : Biecz County
Text : {{short description|Former administrative unit of Poland}}
'''Biecz County''' (Polish: '''powiat biecki''') was an administrative unit ([[powiat]]) of both the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. With its seat in the town of [[Biecz]], it was part of [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]]. Biecz County existed from the second half of the 14th century, until the [[Partitions of Poland|first partition of Poland]] in 1772.

In the early Kingdom of Poland, the ancient town of Biecz was the seat of a [[castellany]]. In the 14th century, when castellanies were replaced by counties, the expansive Biecz County was created, one of seven such units of Kraków Voivodeship. Apart from Biecz itself, it included such towns, as [[Jasło]], [[Gorlice]], [[Dukla]] and [[Ciezkowice]]. In the 17th century, Biecz County had 11 towns and 264 villages, with an area of 2300&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

In 1772, following first partition of Poland, Biecz was annexed by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. The county was disbanded by Austrian authorities in 1783.
