'''Chevelle Franklyn''' (born 4 March 1974)<ref>[http://www.wapjfm.com/reggae_explorations/this_day_in_reggae WAPJ This Day in Reggae]</ref> is a [[Jamaica]]n reggae and [[gospel reggae]] singer.

==Early life and reggae career==
Born in the Tawes Pen area of [[Spanish Town]] in [[St. Catherine Parish]], Franklyn was the fourth in a family of ten children. She was forced to leave school at the age of fourteen to help support her family, and found work singing at hotels and resorts. After a year or two, she came to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and worked with various producers there - Rohan Harrison, who had recorded her first single ("Here I Am") when she was 14, [[Steely & Clevie]] ("No One in the World", 1989) and Winston Riley. Manager and producer Mikey Bennett encouraged her to improve her education.<ref>[http://www.rudegal.com/artists/biochevelle02.htm RudeGal biography of Franklyn, 2002]</ref> Produced by Harrison and Bennett, her first hit song was "Nice and Naughty" (1992). This helped lead to collaborations with major stars like deejay [[Spragga Benz]] ("A-1 Lover", 1995), [[Shabba Ranks]] ("Mr. Lover Man", 1991), deejay [[Lady G]] ("Thank You", 1995) and [[Beenie Man]] (the song and album ''Dancehall Queen'', 1997 (also used in the 1997 Jamaican movie ''[[Dancehall Queen]]'')).<ref>[http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Chevelle_Franklin__Dancehall_Queen_To_Gospel_Reggae_Scene/24688/p1/ CrossRhythms article on Franklyn, 13 November 2006]</ref> Franklyn was frustrated that she was usually replaced by an actress in the accompanying videos, and wanted to raise her profile as an artist. After the release of her album ''Serious Girl'' in 1996, Franklyn toured extensively in the Caribbean, the UK, and the US.

==Conversion and gospel reggae career==
In 1998 Franklyn was about to perform "Dancehall Queen" on stage during a concert and instead performed [[Kirk Franklin]]'s gospel song "Silver and Gold", announcing that she had become a Christian. After collaborations in 2000 with deejays [[Papa San]] ("Touch From You") and [[Lieutenant Stitchie]] ("Mr. Lover" - a charting hit in the US<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ww4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=lt+stitchie+feat+chevelle+franklyn&source=bl&ots=Ol16Aet0BH&sig=N7n2t7VPDOaxpaZCvtHokWfWuVo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iQJ9U7WkCKPE8QHQuYCYAg&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=lt%20stitchie%20feat%20chevelle%20franklyn&f=false ''Billboard'', 1 April 2000, p. 27, "Hot Rap Singles" chart at #12]</ref>), she released her first gospel album, ''Joy'', in 2001, toured internationally, and won (in 2002) 5 Caribbean Gospel Reggae Marlin Awards.<ref>[http://www.yardflex.com/archives/001141.html "Chevelle Franklyn: 'I Can't Do This Anymore...'", YardFlex.com, 25 Feb. 2007]</ref> Her gospel music was controversial with some for combining dancehall with gospel. Her album ''His Way'' was released in 2006; another album, ''Shake It Off'' (2008), was the product of a 2007 tour of South Africa and featured South African musicians and ministers. In 2008 she also performed in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] at "The Experience", a gospel mega-concert that attracted 400,000 attendees.<ref>[https://gospelreggae.com/browse/artists/chevelle+franklyn/detail.html GospelReggae.com bio]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426201720/https://gospelreggae.com/browse/artists/chevelle%2Bfranklyn/detail.html |date=26 April 2014 }}</ref> In 2009 she was featured on one track ("Surely Goodness") on American Christian musician [[Israel Houghton]]'s album [[The Power of One (album)|The Power of One]]; the album won the Grammy award in 2010 for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album. Since then, she has continued to tour.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140430024643/http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-47401/jamaicas-chevelle-franklyn-kenya ''The Star'', 30 Sept. 2011, "Jamaica's Chevelle Franklyn for Kenya"]</ref><ref>[http://www.ghanamusic.com/news/upcoming-events/chevelle-franklyn-storms-ghana-on-oct-2/index.html Ghanamusic.com, 22 Sept. 2011, "Chevelle Franklyn Storms Ghana on Oct. 2"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502010034/http://www.ghanamusic.com/news/upcoming-events/chevelle-franklyn-storms-ghana-on-oct-2/index.html |date=2 May 2014 }}</ref>
