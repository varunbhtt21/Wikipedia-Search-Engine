'''Andrew Marienhoff Sessler''' (December 11, 1928 &ndash; April 17, 2014) was an American physicist, academic ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), former director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (1973&ndash;1980), humanitarian and former president (1998) of the [[American Physical Society]].<ref name=APS2014>{{cite web|title=Andrew Sessler 1928-2014|url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/updates/andrewsessler.cfm|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=26 April 2014|date=21 April 2014}}</ref>

==Biography==
Sessler was born in [[New York City]] in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andrew Sessler, 2013|url=http://science.energy.gov/fermi/award-laureates/2010s/sessler/|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=26 April 2014|date=8 April 2014}}</ref>  He was educated at [[Harvard University]] (B.A. in mathematics) and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D. in physics)<ref name=newscenter.lbl.gov2014>{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Andrew Sessler, Former Laboratory Director, Acclaimed Physicist and Humanitarian|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2014/04/18/in-memoriam-andrew-sessler/|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=26 April 2014|date=18 April 2014}}</ref> with dissertation ''Hyperfine structure of <sup>3</sup>He''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sessler, A.

His areas of expertise were the physics of particle accelerators, particle physics and plasma physics. In addition to accelerator physics, he also published theoretical work on quantum-theoretical statistical mechanics, atomic physics and superfluidity. Sessler was also active in the study group of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] of the long-term effects of the atomic bombing of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], and in an initiative group of APS against landmines. Sessler was a member of the [[American Committee for Peace in Chechnya]].

In 1970, he became an [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] laureate. On January 13, 2014, Sessler and [[Allen J. Bard]] were awarded the [[Enrico Fermi Award]].<ref>[http://energy.gov/articles/president-obama-names-scientists-bard-and-sessler-enrico-fermi-award-recipients "President Obama Names Scientists Bard and Sessler as Enrico Fermi Award Recipients"] DOE Press Release:  Jan 13, 2014.</ref>
