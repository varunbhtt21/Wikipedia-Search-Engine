Title : Stężyca Land
Text : '''Stężyca Land''' (Polish: '''ziemia stężycka''') was an administrative unit ([[ziemia]]) of both the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It had its seat in the town of [[Stezyca, Lublin Voivodeship|Stężyca]] after which it was named.

It was the composed of only one county ([[powiat]], known as the '''Stężyca County'''); as such the terms ziemia (land) and county (powiat) in this case are mostly interchangeable.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The Land (County) of Stezyca was created in 1568. In the south and east, it bordered [[Lublin Voivodeship (1474–1795)|Lublin Voivodeship]], in the north [[Mazovia]]’s [[Czersk Land]], and in the west its border went along the [[Vistula]] river. Stezyca was the seat of the [[starosta]] and of the land court.

Stężyca County was the only county of [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]], located east of the [[Vistula]] river, in the northeastern corner of the voivodeship. In the 17th century, the area of Stezyca County was 1780 sq. kilometres, with nine towns: Stezyca, [[Zelechow]], [[Laskarzew]], [[Bobrowniki, Lublin Voivodeship|Bobrowniki]], [[Okrzeja]], [[Adamow, Lukow County|Adamow]], [[Jeziorzany, Lublin Voivodeship|Jeziorzany]], [[Wojcieszkow]] and [[Maciejowice]].

The county existed until 1793, when its territory was merged into Lublin Voivodeship.

In contemporary Poland, the territory of former Stezyca County covers all of [[Ryki County]], the southern part of [[Garwolin County]], and the southwestern corner of [[Lukow County]]. Its biggest urban center is [[Deblin]], which was granted [[town rights]] in 1954.
