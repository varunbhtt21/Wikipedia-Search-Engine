Title : March 1951 lunar eclipse
Text : [[File:Lunar eclipse chart close-1951Mar23.png|320px|thumb]]
A '''penumbral [[lunar eclipse]]''' took place on March 23, 1951. This subtle penumbral eclipse eclipse may have been visible to a skilled observer at maximum eclipse. 64% of the Moon's disc was partially shaded by the Earth (none of it was in total shadow), which caused a gentle shadow gradient across its disc at maximum; the eclipse as a whole lasted 3 hours and 34 minutes.
