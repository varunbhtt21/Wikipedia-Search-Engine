* ... that the [[Donner Party]] passed by '''[[O'Fallons Bluff]]''' on June 18, 1846 on their way to [[California]]?

:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] size and age are ok. Hook cited...but is there any chance of another source than that website? If not, the ruts seen from I-80 make an interesting hook. Some sentences could do with some rewording - I did some. {{NRHP url|id=74001127|title=This ref}} indicates the name origin is unclear, which should be incorporated into the article - it also gives some basic facts such as how long it is and when it was used (1840s-60s) which should be in article. Not seeing any paraphrasing (which is good). Over to you. [[User:Casliber|Cas Liber]] ([[User talk:Casliber|talk]] '''·''' [[Special:Contributions/Casliber|contribs]]) 20:53, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::Regarding the second question, the NRHP document is the only place I can find an indication about uncertainty of the origin, so I have changed it to clearly indicate what we know.  Regarding the first, until I get a chance to look at the actual diaries, I can't say for sure that the hook is reliably sourced.  Your alt would be fine, but I think alt1 below, might get attention:
*::'''Alt1''': ... that [[American pioneer]]s following the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] and [[California Trail|California]] trails passed over '''[[O'Fallons Bluff]]''' on their way [[American frontier|west]] during the 19th century?

::::[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] yeah, works for me - let's go with ALT1.
