Apparent hoax musical instrument, up since December 2012. This is one for the [[Wikipedia:List of hoaxes on Wikipedia]] 'at least one year' section, unless someone can find anything real under all this silly "redneck" humor, apparently created for the guy's girlfriend's kids. We should have caught this one a lot earlier, but fwiw it was an orphan. [[User:Pharos|Pharos]] ([[User talk:Pharos|talk]]) 04:22, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as blatant hoax. This is the nicest one I've seen in a while; liked the mocked-up photo. He should put it on his blog, though. [[User:Chiswick Chap|Chiswick Chap]] ([[User talk:Chiswick Chap|talk]]) 07:19, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. For anyone coming in, basically the article is a joke about "redneck" hunters using bird calls. The mock up photo is of one of the various bird/deer calls out on the market that someone tailored to look like it was something other than a bird call by adding rope. ( They probably used [http://www.basspro.com/Knight-&-Hale-EZ-Doe-Bleat-Plus-Deer-Call/product/10212954/ one of these] [http://www.wildfowlmag.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/8/files/22-must-see-waterfowl-calls/wf_knighthalesmoothtalker.jpg types of calls] [http://www.allpredatorcalls.com/knight-and-hale-acrylic-single-reed-duck-call-kh317/ from Knight & Hale], from what I can tell.) Odds are very, very high that this is a personal joke that the article creator came up with on his own and decided to upload to Wikipedia. That it's been here since 2012 is kind of funny, but this really has no purpose in being here. I'm going to tag it as a speedy.

:*I've also [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Help_desk&diff=prev&oldid=122300559 alerted Wikimedia Commons] that the two photos should probably be deleted, as they were clearly uploaded to perpetuate the hoax and in the case of the second photo, is potentially copyvio from someone else's photo.
