'''Bono's Restaurant and Deli''' is a historic restaurant located at 15395 [[Foothill Boulevard (Southern California)|Foothill Boulevard]] in [[Fontana, California|Fontana]], [[California]]. The restaurant opened in 1936 to serve travelers on [[U.S. Route 66]], which then passed in front of the site; it originally operated as a produce stand. In 1943, increased traffic on the highway prompted the owners to expand their operations, and the current building was constructed as a full-service restaurant. The restaurant building has a [[Streamline Moderne architecture|Streamline Moderne]] design and features red and green stripes promoting its [[Italian cuisine]] as well as painted grapevines promoting its wine. As Fontana's Italian immigrant community grew in the 1940s, the restaurant also became a local source of Italian foods previously unavailable in the area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vanaskie|first=Laura|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Bono's Restaurant and Deli|url={{NRHP url|id=07001353}}|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=April 25, 2014|date=March 12, 2007}} {{NRHP url|id=07001353|title=Accompanied by photos|photos=y}}.</ref>

The Big Orange, a {{convert|7|ft|adj=on}} tall orange-shaped citrus stand, is located on the property of the restaurant. The orange was originally located {{convert|3|mi}} to the east; restaurant owner Joe Bono [cousin of [[Sonny Bono]]] purchased the stand in the 1990s and moved it to its current site. While the restaurant had an orange-shaped stand of its own when it served Route 66 traffic, it was eventually demolished due to decreased demand. The Big Orange is one of six surviving orange-shaped buildings in California.<ref>{{cite news|last=Groves|first=Martha|title=California's main squeeze|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/03/local/la-me-orange-stands3-2010mar03|accessdate=April 25, 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 3, 2010}}</ref>
