Title : June 1947 lunar eclipse
Text : [[File:Lunar eclipse chart close-1947Jun03.png|320px|thumb]]
A '''partial [[lunar eclipse]]''' took place on June 3, 1947. A tiny bite out of the Moon may have been visible at maximum, though just 2% of the Moon was shadowed in a partial eclipse which lasted for 34 minutes and 42 seconds. A shading across the moon from the Earth's penumbral shadow should have been visible at maximum eclipse.
