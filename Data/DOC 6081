'''Quynh Anh Pham''' (born 16 January 1987 in [[Liège]], Belgium) is a [[Vietnamese people in Belgium|Vietnamese-Belgian]] singer.

==Singing career==

From the early age, Quynh Anh participated in numerous music activities in [[Mons]]. In September 2000, her father enrolled her in the TV singing competition "Pour la Gloire" (For the Glory) held by Belgium TV channel [[RTBF]], where she won the first prize. Through this competition, she met her new manager, who introduced Quynh Anh to her producer. In 2002 she signed a contract with Rapas Centre, a French-branch of [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]. The producer made possible Quynh Anh's duet ''"J'espère"'' with French-hit singer [[Marc Lavoine]] in 2005. Quynh Anh then followed Lavoine on a tour to France, Switzerland, and Belgium.

Quynh Anh reached international popularity in 2006 with her French song ''"[[Bonjour Vietnam (song)|Bonjour Vietnam]]"'' composed by Lavoine and co-written by Lavoine and Yvan Coriat. Lavoine said he was touched by the innocent charm and the longing of a small girl who had never seen her homeland.<ref>{{cite book|first = Thanh Liem |last = Bach Lien|url = http://vietnamnews.vn/print/151268/bonjour-viet-nam-a-gift-to-the-homeland.htm|title = Bonjour Vietnam, a gift to the homeland|publisher = Vietnam News}}</ref> Later, Quynh Anh worked with her producer Pierre-Alain Simon to release her first album ''"Bonjour Vietnam"''.<ref>{{cite book|first = Ngoc Trung |last = Nguyen|url = http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=273609&rel_no=1|title = 'Bonjour Vietnam' Tune Tugs Expat Heartstrings|publisher = OhmyNews}}</ref> Due to its popularity, ''"Bonjour Vietnam"'' was translated into English by Guy Balbaert and was called ''"Hello Vietnam"'' (distinguish it from the single ''"[[Hello Vietnam]]"'' written by [[Tom T.
