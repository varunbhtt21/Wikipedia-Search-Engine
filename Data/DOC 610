Section 409 of the [[Packers and Stockyards Act]] regulates that [[meatpacking|meatpackers]] pay promptly for livestock that they purchase.

It requires that any [[meatpacking|meatpacker]] or dealer buying livestock to pay up in full to the seller before the end of the next [[business day]].<ref name="United States  Department of  Agriculture">{{cite web|title=Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921|url=http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/Lawsandregs/PS_act.pdf|work=United States  Department of  Agriculture|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>

409(b) states that the purchaser is exempt from this requirement if the parties have other payment agreements in writing.<ref name="United States Department of Agriculture" />

==History==
The law was passed in 1921 as part of the [[Packers and Stockyards Act]]  ([[Title 7 of the United States Code|7 U.S.C.]] §§ 181-229b; '''P&S Act''') which was passed in order to "regulate interstate and foreign commerce in live stock, live-stock produce, dairy products, poultry, poultry products, and eggs, and for other purposes."

==Penalty==
A dealer who violates the law could be assessed a fine not exceeding 32,000 dollars for each violation. When determining the amount of the violation, the secretary should consider the gravity of the offence.<ref name="United States Department of Agriculture" />

==Enforcement==
The only time<ref name="Channel 7 Arutz Sheva Israel National News" /> experts remember that a [[meatpacking|meatpacker]] was criminally charged for violating the law, was in 2010 when [[Sholom Rubashkin]] the [[CEO]] of [[agriprocessors]] was charged with failing to pay 31 cattle suppliers within 24 hours. [[Sholom Rubashkin|Rubashkin]] at times paid as much as 11 days late<ref name="Justice - Web">{{cite web|title=1921 Law Used For First Time|url=https://justiceforsholom.org/unbelievable/psa-used-after-9-decades|accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>  causing a loss of $3,800.51 of potential [[interest]]. [[Federal Judge]] [[Linda R.
