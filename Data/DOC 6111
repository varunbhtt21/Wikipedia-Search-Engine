"'''Alyosha'''" ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|Алёша}}) is a Soviet-era Russian song by composer Eduard Kolmanovsky and poet [[Konstantin Vanshenkin]]. The subject is the [[Alyosha Monument, Plovdiv|Alyosha Monument]], the common local name for the {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} statue of a World War II Soviet soldier which stands in the Bulgarian city of [[Plovdiv]] as a monument to all Soviet soldiers who died in the occupation of Bulgaria.{{Cref2|A}}

In 1962, Eduard Kolmanovsky visited Bulgaria, including in the city of Plovdiv where the  Alyosha monument stands, where he learned the story of its origin. Kolmanovskii later shared his notes with poet Konstantin Vanshenkin, who was inspired by the topic and soon wrote a poem.

Kolmanovskii then composed music for the verses. The mournful feeling<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armchairgeneral.com/rkkaww2/Multimedia/afterww2.htm#Alyosha |title=Post-War Songs |work=Armchair General |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> of the song is achieved with the minor mood of the music and by the lyric which employs both slow repetition:
{{poemquote|If there's a new snowfall in the fields
Snowfall, snowfall
If there's a new snowfall in the fields
Or thunder echoes in the rain
He stands upon the mountain: Alyosha,
Alyosha, Alyosha
He stands upon the mountain, Alyosha
A Russian soldier in our Motherland}}
and [[pathos]]:
{{poemquote|Since the blizzard of bullets, his tunic is made now of stone{{nbsp}}... 
He'll never step down down from his mountain{{nbsp}}... 
He cannot give flowers to the women, who give their flowers to him}}

"Alyosha" was published in 1966 in the Soviet army magazine ''Sergeant Major/Sergeant'' ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|Старшина-сержант}}) in the section dedicated to Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. In 1967, the Soviet [[Alexandrov Ensemble]] first performed the song at the foot of the monument. It was performed at the 1968 Ninth [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in [[Sofia]]. The song immediately became very popular in Bulgaria.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the Soviet Union, the song became popular in a duet by the Bulgarian singers Margret Nikolova and Georgi Kordov.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bgestrada.com/bgestrada/?q=content/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%20%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0 |title=Маргрет Николова |trans-title=Margret Nikolova |work=B G Estrada |accessdate=April 23, 2014}} {{link language|bul}}</ref>

Until 1989 "Alyosha" was the official anthem of Plovdiv.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/119041/The+Lone+Soviet+Soldier%3A+The+Alesha+Monument+in+Bulgaria%27s+Plovdiv |title=The Lone Soviet Soldier: The Alesha Monument in Bulgaria's Plovdiv |author=Ivan Dikov |date=August 10, 2010 |work=Novinite |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> Every morning Radio Plovdiv started its broadcasts with this song. It was often played during cultural events conducted by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]], and all Bulgarian primary school students were required to learn it.

The song has also become identified with the Russian monument [[Defenders of the Soviet Arctic during the Great Patriotic War]] in [[Murmansk]] which is also nicknamed Alyosha, and with other Soviet monuments.

==Notes==
{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha|colwidth=40em}}
{{Cnote2|A|In fact, the Red Army did not fight an extensive campaign in Bulgaria. A new and Soviet-friendly government was established by the Bulgarians themselves almost immediately the Soviets crossed the Bulgarian border and the Red and Bulgarian Armies became allied. While there was scattered and bitter fighting, mostly between Bulgarians, German attempts to hold Bulgaria were relatively desultory and ineffectual and a large Soviet campaign in Bulgaria was not needed. See [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944]] and [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II]].}}
