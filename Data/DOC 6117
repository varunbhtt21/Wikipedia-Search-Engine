This article is about a 1977 album by American rock band Television. Writers have considered it an important post-punk album and influence on subsequent rock music movements and guitarists. The article is properly sourced and comprehensive of its topic. [[User:Dan56|Dan56]] ([[User talk:Dan56|talk]]) 05:05, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

==== Comments from Richard3120 ====
(1) Final sentence of lead section: according to WP:GENRECAP "New Wave" should not be capitalised, i.e. "new wave".
(2) Last paragraph of 'Recording' section: the line which says "Verlaine said to him 'forget it'" sounds a bit awkward to me – would "Verlaine told him to 'forget it'" sound better?
(3) Last paragraph of 'Lyrics' section: the lyric sheet for "See No Evil" might say "Runnin wild with the one I love" but I think "runnin" should have an apostrophe after it to indicate the missing 'g' (sorry if I'm being a grammar pedant here!).

==== Comments from Niwi3 ====
*To be honest, I don't like very much how the article is organized. Firstly, I would rename the "Commercial performance" section to simply "Release" and include the album's release date in it; I personally think the term "Commercial performance" is more appropriate to use in more mainstream albums. Secondly, the "Critical reception" section should appear after the "Release" section; it's strange that you first talk about critical reception, then about commercial performance, and then come back again to (retrospective) critical reception. Finally, the "Legacy and influence" section should be rename to simply "Legacy" and should have two subsections: "Retrospective acclaim", which should contain the first two paragraphs and the retrospective reviews template, and "Music influence", which should contain both the "Alternative rock" and "Rock guitar" subsections merged together. Overall, the article should look something like this:

5 Artwork
<br/>
6 Release
<br/>
"''Marquee Moon'' was released in February 1977 by Elektra Records. The album was an unexpected success in the United Kingdom, where..."
<br/>
7 Critical reception
<br/>
"Upon release, ''Marquee Moon'' was acclaimed by..."
<br/>
8 Legacy
<br/>
8.1 Retrospective acclaim
<br/>
8.2 Music influence
<br/>

:: I very much agreed with your suggestion to rearrange "Release..." (I've added "...and promotion" since it talks about their touring as well) with "Critical reception", but disagree that there need to be layout changes for "Legacy and influence". How the critics see it in retrospect is essentially what "Legacy" means in the context of this article, so it would be redundant. Elements of "retrospective acclaim" ("still sounds timeless", "one of the all-time classic guitar albums") run throughout the entire "Legacy and influence", which is more about its importance and impact rather than critics saying how good they think it is--its standing among other albums and all-time rankings are also its "legacy". Also, "Music influence" sounds generic and vague, whereas the two paragraphs dealing with its influence on "alternative rock" genres makes sense to be titled "Alternative rock", while the two paragraphs + cquote dealing with its influence on guitar playing (and specific guitarists) in rock makes sense to be titled "Rock guitar" (based on what multiple sources used in that subsection have referred to as its influence on "guitar rock", including Erlewine and Kot) This is more accessible for readers, since all those paragraphs under what could be a "Music influence" subsection would be overwhelming to read. Furthermore, article layouts are decided based on consideration of both the suggested layout at MOS:ALBUM and the material available to write about the article's topic--both dictate how the article's layout for prose sections ends up looking and, in IMHO, I feel it's best the way it currently is.

*Why is the Christgau rating in the retrospective reviews template? His review is from 1977, right? I would personally include his A+ rating in the prose of the Critical reception section and remove it from the retrospective reviews template.
:: The rating is cited from his 1990 ''Consumer Guide Albums'' book. Also, IMO, noting another "A+" in the prose would make it a clunkier, more awkward read. [[User:Dan56|Dan56]] ([[User talk:Dan56|talk]]) 19:17, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::: His book ''Rock Albums of the '70s: A Critical Guide'' does not contain retrospective reviews, but a selection of release reviews he wrote in the 70s. This album is a ''classic'' and therefore you cannot mix release and retrospective reviews together. It's confusing and misleading. Besides, if you include the ratings from Peter Gammond and Jon Tiven in the critical reception section you should also include the one from Christgau, who is one of the most important critics in popular music. In my opinion, noting it in the prose won't make it clunkier because the critical reception section has very few ratings. You can start the sentence like this: "Robert Christgau of ''The Village Voice'' awarded the album an A+ and asserted that the 'demotic-philosophical' lyrics could..." --[[User:Niwi3|Niwi3]] ([[User talk:Niwi3|talk]]) 23:08, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:::: You're right, {{u|Niwi3}}. Forgive me, I was working on [[New York Dolls (album)]] at the same time and confused the two--Christgau's "A+" for that album wasn't in his original ''Newsday'' review but in that ''Rock Albums of the Seventies'' book, not the case here.

:*"When Johns suggested they record another take of the song, Verlaine told him to 'forget it'" -- I don't like how this is written. Perhaps "Johns suggested to record another take of the song, but Verlaine told him to 'forget it'"?

:*"According to Rolling Stone magazine, Marquee Moon is a post-punk album" -- Rolling Stone is a notable magazine, so the word magazine is redundant

:*"According to Spin magazine, Marquee Moon is 'about urban mythology' as Verlaine 'brings a sentimental romanticism to the Bowery, making legends out of the mundane'" -- Again, the word magazine is redundant

:*"Peter Gammond of Hi-Fi News & Record Review gave it an 'A+' and called it one of the most exciting releases in music, highlighted by Verlaine's steely, Gábor Szabó-like guitar and authentic rock music" -- The second part is blurry to me. Please clarify.

:*"Gramophone magazine's Nigel Hunter found both Verlaine's lyrics and guitar playing vague" -- "Writing for ''Gramophone'', Nigel Hunter found both..." flows much better

:*"In his review for Rolling Stone, Ken Tucker said that the lyrics generally amount to non sequiturs" -- replace "said" with "stated" to avoid repetition.

:*"Since then, it has been cited by rock critics as one of the greatest albums of the American punk rock movement, including Mark Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly, who called it the masterpiece of the 1970s New York punk rock scene" -- I don't like the word including here. Perhaps "...the American punk rock movement, with Mark Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly calling it the masterpiece of the 1970s New York punk rock scene"?

:*"According to English writer Clinton Heylin, the album marked the end of the New York scene's peak period" -- replace "the album" with "Marquee Moon". Too much repetition.

:*"while Spin magazine called it the CBGB era's 'best and most enduring record' and ranked it as sixth greatest album in its April 1989 issue" -- Again, the word magazine is redundant. The second part should also be written like this: "...ranked it as the sixth greatest album of all time in its April 1989 issue"

:*"That same year, Marquee Moon was named the fourth greatest of all time by NME" -- Add the word album: "...was named the fourth greatest album of all time by NME" --[[User:Niwi3|Niwi3]] ([[User talk:Niwi3|talk]]) 17:33, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

====Comments from Gongshow====
Outstanding work, Dan. My only suggestion: in the 'Legacy and influence' section, almost every person has some descriptor like "''journalist'' Tony Fletcher", "''English writer'' Clinton Heylin", "''Irish guitarist'' The Edge", "''American guitarist'' John Frusciante", and so on. Should the same also be done for Marc Riley and Mark Radcliffe? Just a nitpick, though, I'm happy to give my '''Support'''. <small><span style="border:1px solid">[[User:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:black">&nbsp;Gongshow&nbsp;</span>''']]</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color:black">[[User_talk:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:#ffffff">talk</span>''']]</span></small> 18:53, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

: Thx! {{u|Gongshow}}. I did consider adding a descriptor to those two when I first added that line, but their respective Wikipedia articles have several for each of them, like "English broadcaster, musician, and writer," "radio personality, and DJ," etc. What would you suggest for either of them? I thought adding multiple for each would inhibit the flow of the prose, so I figured readers could just find out who they are by clicking the links. [[User:Dan56|Dan56]] ([[User talk:Dan56|talk]]) 02:00, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::[[User:Dan56|Dan]] – you are correct that both Radcliffe and Riley have had varying careers (Marc Riley was the bass player in an early version of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], for example) but I think most Brits would agree with me in saying that they are both best known for their work as radio DJs: they had a long-running career during the 1990s and 2000s as a "double act" on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] and [[BBC Radio 1]] before deciding to go their separate ways, and they currently both present separate music shows on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. I would say "radio presenter" would probably be the best description for both of them. [[User:Richard3120|Richard3120]] ([[User talk:Richard3120|talk]]) 02:36, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Dan - I agree with your point on maintaining the flow of the prose, and with Richard that both men appear to be best known for their careers in radio, so [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marquee_Moon&diff=606724407&oldid=606714987 your edit] solves it perfectly.

====Comments from Fantailfan====
Having listened to ''Marquee Moon'' on my way to Newbury Comics today, it is a much better album than I remember it being. My only relevant remark about the article would be that it is a good thing that negative reviews are represented. It is difficult to find well-written and substantive bad reviews. Such reviews usually depend on snarky dismissal and inapt comparisons (which the Springsteen comparison resembles) rather than real criticism (the others). '''Support'''.

So far, looking quite good. I only see several things to address:
*Is the album's exact release date known? If so, please do include that.
:: Nope, unfortunately. [[User:Dan56|Dan56]] ([[User talk:Dan56|talk]]) 02:09, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::I will almost certainly be able to find out the UK release date, but that won't necessarily be a worldwide release date (UK release date will very likely be a Friday, and I know US release dates are/were normally on a Tuesday), so it will probably have to stay as just "February 1977", unless somebody comes across the US release date in an old copy of ''Billboard'' or similar.

*In "Background" section ref#3 ("From the Velvets to the Voidoids: The Birth of American Punk Rock") should only be used at the end of the second paragraph per WP:OVERCITE.
