* '''Delete'''. I couldn't find a single actual website under this domain. Some names are reserved and parked, but that's about it. -[[User:Sigeng|Sigeng]] ([[User talk:Sigeng|talk]]) 08:13, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

**'''Redirect''' to [[List of Internet top-level domains]] as seems a much better solution than deleting. -[[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 15:10, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[List of Internet top-level domains]] or [[Generic  top-level domain]]. Preferably the former as the latter article is in need of an update. Non-notable domain, but redirects are [[WP:CHEAP|cheap]]. [[User:Novusuna|Novusuna]] <sup>[[User_talk:Novusuna|talk]]</sup> 21:04, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
Yes, redirecting is also a good option too. [[User:Tinton5|Tinton5]] ([[User talk:Tinton5|talk]]) 02:40, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect to [[List of Internet top-level domains]]'''. All TLDs used to be inherently notable, and receive quite a bit of attention. With this many being launched, hardly any are notable. --[[User:Lewis Hulbert|Lewis Hulbert]] ([[User talk:Lewis Hulbert|talk]]) 13:32, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect to [[List of Internet top-level domains]]'''. Most sensible solution by {{u|Lewis Hulbert}}, above. Cheers, &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 17:02, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[List of Internet top-level domains]]. No independent notability in a [[WP:SET|search engine test]] (though I did find [http://www.popsci.com/article/science/forget-com-there-will-soon-be-hundreds-domains-sucks] and [http://domainincite.com/15913-heres-why-registrars-are-boycotting-sexy]). Best kept in list until sources show. [[WP:BEFORE|Before]] you nominate to AfD, might be worth discussing merge options on the article talk pages.
