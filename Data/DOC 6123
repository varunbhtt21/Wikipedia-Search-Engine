A series of main roads connects towns to the highways, and local roads provide additional links. The majority of these roads service the western half of the region, with few located in the [[Deserts of Australia|various deserts]] east of the [[Oakover River]]. Roads are often named after the towns or areas they connect.<ref name="MRWA UR">{{cite MRWA map|UR|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="ISA">{{cite MRWA map|P-ISA|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

The region's main roads are important for multiple aspects of the Pilbara's economy. These activities include mining (despite most products being transported by rail), agriculture and pastoral leases, and tourism, especially to the national parks at Karijini, Millstream-Chichester, and Rudall River.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pilbara Regional Profile |url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Pilbara%20Regional%20Profile%202013.RCN-D13%5E23728690.PDF |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=26 April 2014 |author=Main Roads Western Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426045938/https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Pilbara%20Regional%20Profile%202013.RCN-D13%5E23728690.PDF |archivedate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |format=PDF |year=2013 |df= }}</ref>
