Film production expert Eve Light Honathaner in ''The Complete Film Production Handbook'', (Focal Press, 2001 p. 211.):
:"Publicity photos (star headshots) have traditionally not been copyrighted. Since they are disseminated to the public, they are generally considered public domain, and therefore clearance by the studio that produced them is not necessary."  
::"There is a vast body of photographs, including but not limited to publicity stills, that have no notice as to who may have created them."  (''The Professional Photographer's Legal Handbook'' By Nancy E. Wolff, Allworth Communications, 2007, p. 55.)
