==Early life and Reign==
Shamsher Bahadur was the son of Maratha [[Peshwa]] Bajirao I and his second wife Mastani, whose mother was a Persian Muslim. Bajirao wanted Shamsher Bahadur to be accepted as a [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]], but because of his mother's [[Muslim]] heritage, the priests refused to conduct the Hindu [[upanayana]] ceremony for him. His education and military training was conducted in line with other sons of the Peshwa royal family, even though Maratha nobles and chiefs didn't recognize Mastani as a legitimate wife of the Peshwa.<ref name="BSR_2005"/> After the death of both Bajirao and Mastani in 1740, Shamsher was taken into the household of [[Kashibai]], Bajirao's widow, and raised as one of her own.
