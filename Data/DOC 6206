Powell was a two-time all-state high school player in California and led his team to a state championship before joining UCLA.

He was drafted by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], who subsequently traded his draft rights to Toronto.

==Early years==
Powell was born in [[San Diego]], [[California]], to Sharon and Norman Powell Sr.<ref name="ucla_bio" /> He was introduced to basketball by his uncle, Raymond Edwards.
