Title : Hiroshi Sugito
Text : {{Nihongo|'''Hiroshi Sugito'''|杉戸 洋|Sugito Hiroshi|born 1970}} is a contemporary Japanese painter who has been recognized as a part of the Tokyo-Pop movement.<ref name=ArtNews>{{cite web|title=Hiroshi_Sugito|url=http://artnews.org/artist.php?i=116|publisher=Artnews.org}}</ref> He specializes in [[Nihonga]] painting (literally "Japanese painting"). However, instead of the traditional scenic imagery of Nihonga, his paintings focus on abstract and recognizable elements. Oftentimes his artwork consists of dreams, altered realities and childlike fantasies. They consist of both abstract and concrete elements and are also influenced by both Eastern and Western paintings.<ref name=The_Modern>{{cite web|title=Focus Hiroshi Sugito|url=http://themodern.org/exhibition/past/FOCUS-Hiroshi-Sugito/1705|publisher=Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth}}</ref>

==Work==
Hiroshi Sugito’s work tends to focus on Japanese painting with a Western influence. A lot of his imagery has a sense of “Kawaii”—which means "cute" in Japanese—and intertwines this idea with a sense of weirdness or eerie displacement. “I start moving my brush like walking into the woods, away from everything, and I want words and meanings to lose their power and just fade away.<ref name=The_Modern />
