*'''Redirect''' to [[Brant-Argyle School]] or perhaps [[Argyle, Manitoba]]. The school has local historical importance so we should mention it somewhere. I think the best place to mention it is in the Brant-Argyle School article under the history section. More substantial sources could persuade a keep vote here but I'm not seeing the degree of coverage needed to have more than a stub.

*'''Redirect'''-I agree with the comment above, seems to be a good redirection instead. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:53, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[Brant-Argyle School]] as not notable for a standalone article. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 18:08, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
