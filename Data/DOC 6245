The '''Swiney Prize''', a British award made every five years by the [[Royal Society of Arts]] with the [[Royal College of Physicians]], was set up by the will of George Swiney, an English physician who died in 1844.

The prize came to be awarded alternately for medical jurisprudence and general jurisprudence. New cups were designed, after an initial stable period when a pattern by [[Daniel Maclise]] was reused. The first new design came in 1919, by Melvin Oliver.<ref name="RSA1939"/><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 41380170|title = The Midlands Centre: The Swiney Prize 1999|journal = RSA Journal|volume = 146|issue = 5486|pages = 109|last1 = Botting|first1 = Geoff|year = 1998}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25263511|title = Swiney Prize|journal = The British Medical Journal|volume = 1|issue = 1174|pages = 1291|year = 1883}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Davenport|author2=Ian McDonald|author3=Caroline Moss-Gibbons|title=The Royal College of Physicians and Its Collections: An Illustrated History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGPZSDzOCxYC&pg=PA120|year=2001|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|isbn=978-0-907383-83-3|page=120}}</ref>

==George Swiney (1793–1844)==
George Swiney, a physician, was the son of William Swiney (1748–1829), [[Admiral of the Red]]. He was born on 8-Jun-1793 at St Marylebone, Middlesex, England. He was educated at Edinburgh University, where he graduated M.D. in 1816.  Having retired from practice, he settled in London, lived a secluded life, and acquired a reputation as an eccentric. He spent much time on his will and died at Grove Street, [[Camden Town]], on 21 January 1844. He bequeathed £5,000 to the Society of Arts, to found a quinquennial prize for the best published essay on jurisprudence, the prize to be adjudicated jointly by the Society of Arts and the London College of Physicians; and £5,000 to the [[British Museum]] to found a lectureship in geology, the lecturer to be an M.D. of Edinburgh.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Swiney, George|volume=55}}</ref>
