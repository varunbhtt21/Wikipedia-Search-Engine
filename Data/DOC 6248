'''Jerry Michael Straka''' is an American atmospheric scientist with expertise microphysics of clouds, cloud modeling, and dynamics of severe [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] in conjunction with [[weather radar]]. He was in leadership roles in both the [[VORTEX projects]] and subsequent field research focusing on [[tornadogenesis]].<ref>[https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/vortex2/team.php VORTEX2 Team]</ref>

Straka earned a B.S. and M.S. in 1984 and 1986, respectively, from the [[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee]]. His masters dissertation was: ''A Mesoscale Numerical Study of Environmental Conditions Preceding the 08 June 1984 Tornado Outbreak over South Central Wisconsin''. Straka earned a Ph.D. in [[meteorology]] from the [[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison]] in 1989 with the doctoral dissertation: ''Hail Growth in a Highly Glaciated Central High Plains Multi-cellular Hailstorm.'' He is a professor at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in Norman.<ref>[http://weather.ou.edu/~jstraka/ Jerry M. Straka]</ref>
