'''''Lithospermum erythrorhizon''''', commonly called '''purple gromwell''', '''red gromwell''', '''red-root gromwell''' and '''redroot lithospermum''', is a plant species in the genus ''[[Lithospermum]]''.<ref name="GRIN">{{GRIN}}</ref> It is called ''zǐcǎo'' ({{lang|zh|紫草}}) in Chinese, ''jichi'' ({{lang|ko|지치}}) in Korean, and ''murasaki'' ({{lang|ja-Hrkt|ムラサキ}}; {{lang|ja-Hani|紫}}) in Japanese.<ref name="GRIN" />

The dried root of ''Lithospermum erythrorhizon'' (lithospermum root or ''Lithospermi Radix'') is a Chinese herbal medicine with various antiviral and biological activities, including inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).<ref>Chen, X., et al.

== Biochemistry ==
The enzyme [[4-hydroxybenzoate geranyltransferase]] utilizes [[Geranyl pyrophosphate|geranyl diphosphate]] and [[4-hydroxybenzoate]] to produce [[3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate]] and diphosphate. Biosynthetically, [[alkannin]] is produced in plants from the intermediates 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and [[geranyl pyrophosphate]]. This enzyme is involved in [[alkannin|shikonin]] biosynthesis.

The enzyme [[geranylhydroquinone 3''-hydroxylase]] uses [[geranylhydroquinone]], NADPH, H<sup>+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub> to produce [[3-hydroxygeranylhydroquinone]], NADP<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O.

== Culture ==
It has been cultivated in [[Japan]] since the [[Nara period]] for its [[root]], which can be used for [[herbal medicine]] and to make [[dyes]].

One [[Japanese language|Japanese word]] for the plant, ''murasaki'' (紫), inspired the [[pen name]] "Lady [[Murasaki]]" for the author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and is also the source of the general Japanese term for the color [[purple]], ''murasaki iro'' (紫色).

The dyes made from its root also had other names, such as ''shikon'' (紫根), but all of them were difficult to work with because of their requirement for an [[alum]]-rich [[mordant]] and the resulting colors' extreme vulnerability to [[photobleaching]]. During the [[Heian Period]], [[sumptuary]] laws restricted ''murasaki''-dyed clothing to the [[Empress]] and her [[ladies in waiting]].
