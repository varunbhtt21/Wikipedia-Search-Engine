The '''Portland Loggers''' were a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Portland, Oregon]]. They were members of the [[Continental Football League]] and only lasted one year. Featuring much of the roster of the defunct [[Orange County Ramblers]], the team was originally known as the Hawaii Warriors, but were relocated from [[Honolulu]] to Portland just 18 days before the start of the 1969 season.<ref name=failed/> The team played at [[Multnomah Stadium]] in the [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] neighborhood of Portland. They were coached by retired [[running back]] [[Chuck Fenenbock]] and their [[general manager]] was Al King.<ref name="welcom2"/><ref name="logger3"/>

To boost attendance towards the end of the season, team owners held several promotions at one game, including their November 16 game against the [[Spokane Shockers]] where it was "Ladies Night", "Boy Scout Night", "Chamber of Commerce Night" and "Picture Night".<ref name="format4"/> In October the team stopped holding their practices at Multnomah Stadium and started using the [[American football#Field and equipment|football field]] at [[Central Catholic High School (Portland, Oregon)|Central Catholic High School]].<ref name="regrou5"/> In late October the Loggers received [[placekicker]] [[Momčilo Gavrić (footballer)|Momčilo Gavrić]] on loan from the [[National Football League]] (NFL) [[San Francisco 49ers]].<ref name="kicker6"/> [[Manch Wheeler]], who played four games for the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[American Football League]], was a quarterback on the team.<ref>https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/08/14/manch-wheeler-remembered-for-ability-loyalty-to-school/</ref> Ultimately, only 25,157 fans attended the Loggers' six home games, or 4,192 per contest.<ref>[http://www.profootballarchives.com/1969coflpor.html 1969 Portland Loggers]</ref>

The Loggers were mentioned as a team that could have potentially played in a 1970 iteration of the Continental Football League, one that would have been based only in the western United States. The Loggers had stopped responding to phone calls by August 1970, effectively ending the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jQg0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=OPgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6757,488619&dq=continental-football-league&hl=en|title=Spokane Daily Chronicle - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}</ref>
