Title : Esuvii
Text : {{Unreferenced|date=August 2016}}
The '''Esuvii''' (Esubii, Sesuvii) were a [[Gaulish tribe]] mentioned by [[Bellum Gallicum|Caesar]].
They settled in what is now [[Normandy]].

They were presumably a confederation (comparable to the [[Helvetii]] and included the sub-tribes of the  [[Baiocasses]] and the Viducasses. The Baiocasses are probably eponymous of [[Bayeux]]. Pliny mentions their capital as Augustodurus. The capital of the Viducasses was Aregenua (Vieux).
They were neighours of the [[Aulerci]].

Another tribe with the same name settled in the alpine [[Ubaye Valley]]. 

Their tribal name is presumably related to the theonym [[Esus]].
