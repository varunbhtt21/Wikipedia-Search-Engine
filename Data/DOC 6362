Title : List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz
Text : {{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}
The [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']] was attacked on multiple occasions by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces during [[World War II]]. While most of the attacks failed to inflict any damage on the battleship, she was placed out of action for a lengthy period following the [[Operation Source]] midget submarine attack on 22 September 1943 and for a short period after the [[Operation Tungsten]] aircraft carrier strike on 3 April 1944. ''Tirpitz'' suffered severe and irreparable damage after being hit by a [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] bomb during the [[Operation Paravane]] air raid on 15 September 1944, and was sunk with heavy loss of life in the [[Operation Catechism]] raid on 12 November that year.
