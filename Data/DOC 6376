The '''2d Special Operations Squadron''' is an [[Air Force Reserve Command]] unit, assigned to the [[919th Operations Group]].  Stationed at [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida, the unit operates [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper]] remotely piloted vehicles.

The unit is one of the oldest units in the United States Air Force, being formed on 25 September 1917 at [[Fort Omaha]], Nebraska.  During [[World War I]], the unit was part of the Balloon Section, [[American Expeditionary Forces]], becoming the first American balloon company to reach the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France and enter combat. The 2d thus holds the distinction among all USAF units of being "the first complete American air unit in history to operate against an enemy on foreign soil."<ref name="ross">Schiver, p. 49</ref>

It was part of the Army Balloon School after the war, being a balloon training unit until the beginning of [[World War II]].   It was later part of the [[Strategic Air Command]] during the [[Cold War]].

==History==

===World War I===
The unit was initially formed at [[Fort Omaha]], Nebraska as '''Company B, 2d Balloon Squadron''' on 25 September 1917 at the Fort Omaha Balloon School.  Its mission was to provide forward observations for the artillery.  The unit trained in the fall of 1917, one of the last, as training was rather difficult at Fort Omaha: the weather was bad much of the time, and it was impossible to keep balloons in the air for long periods. The Army decided they needed Balloon Schools in warmer, more stable, environments and selected [[Camp John Wise]] in San Antonio, Texas and [[Ross Field (airfield)|Camp Ross]], Arcadia, California.<ref name="bal">DesChenes, {{page needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> On 30 November, orders were received for the unit to proceed to the [[Aviation Concentration Center]], Garden City, Long Island, for preparation to serve overseas.<ref name="GorrellJ">Gorrell, Series F, Vol. 1, pp. 126-127</ref>

On 7 December, the [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]], now designated the '''2d Balloon Company''', boarded a train and proceeded to [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], Newfoundland where it boarded the {{RMS|Tunisian}} for the crossing of the Atlantic.   It left on 12 December and arrived at [[Liverpool]], England on Christmas Day.   From there, the company traveled by train to [[Southampton]] on the English Channel coast and boarded the steamer Archangel for [[Le Havre]], France, arriving on 28 December.  It reported to the American Expeditionary Force Balloon School at Camp de Coetquidan, [[Morbihan]], France, on 3 January 1918.<ref name=Gorrell2>Gorrell, Series F, Vol. 1, pp. 128-130</ref>

[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|left|: Close-up view of an American major in the basket of an observation balloon flying near front lines]]
At the school, the company received French Caquot (U.S. Type R) [[observation balloon]]s.  It was trained on the equipment by members of the French Army, and, on 23 January, the first trial ascents with an observer in the basket were made.  The company sent members to the front lines and operated under French control, making artillery adjustments for the 101st, 102, 149th and 150th French Artillery Regiments.  Finally, on 29 February, training was ended and the 2d Balloon Company was ordered to report to the [[First United States Army|First Army]] at [[Toul]], arriving on 1 March, joining the French encampment of the 90th French Balloon Company at Camp L'Emitage, near [[Menil-la-Tour]].  It was the first American balloon company to reach the Western Front and enter combat.<ref name=Gorrell2/>

The first observer of the company to be decorated was 1st Lieutenant Sidney Howell, when on 16 March, he was forced to jump from a burning balloon set on fire by enemy aircraft.  He received a [[Croix de Guerre]] with palm.  During the Chateu-Thierry operations, the company took a very active part, following the advance of Allied troops moving frequently as the front moved up.  Frequently the balloons were attacked and set on fire by enemy aircraft, observers jumping and landing safely.<ref name=Gorrell2/>   The company took part in the St. Mihiel and Muse-Argonne offensives during 1918, making a total of 180 ascensions with 13 observers.   The missions being hazardous with 9 balloons being shot down, however no squadron members were killed or wounded in action.<ref name=Gorrell2/>

With the Armistice on 11 November 1918, the company was reassigned to the [[Third United States Army|Third Army]] and ordered to report to [[Trier-Euren]], Germany, in the Rhineland and performed [[military occupation|occupation]] duty along the Rhine River.  It remained with Third Army until 20 May until being relieved and ordered to return to the United States.   After processing at the 1st Air Depot, [[Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome]], France, the unit reported first to a staging area, then to a port for the return home.<ref>Gorell, Series O, Volume 29, {{page needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>

The 2d Balloon Company arrived at the Port of New York on 22 June 1919 on the USS Patria and transferred to [[Mitchel Field]], New York, c. 23 June 1919, where the men were demobilized and returned to civilian life.<ref name="Clay"/>

===Inter-war period===
[[File:Type R Observation Balloon.jpg|thumb|Type "R" observation balloon at Arcadia Balloon School, Arcadia, California, 1921]]
On 11 August 1919, the [[company (military unit)|company]] was transferred to Ross Field, Arcadia, California without personnel or equipment.  The unit was reorganized on 1 October 1921 and redesignated as the [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]] '''Balloon School Detachment'''.   However, the Air Service decided to close Ross Field due to the [[Santa Ana wind]]s, which blew in from the desert. These winds created much havoc with the aerial observation, ground training, and balloon handling.  The [[detachment (military)|detachment]] was disbanded and the remaining equipment left over from the war and some men were sent to [[Brooks Air Force Base|Brooks Field]], Texas.<ref name="bal"/>  The unit was demobilized on 21 May 1922.<ref name="Clay">Clay, {{page needed|date=July 2018}}</ref><ref name=2SOSfacts/>

A new '''2d Balloon Company''' was constituted in the Regular Army on 18 October 1927, as part of the 26th Balloon Group at [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas.  The company was assigned to the Army's [[Eighth Corps Area]], however it was not activated.  The designation was transferred to the [[Sixth Corps Area]] on 1 September 1928, before being organized at [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina on 29 May 1930.<ref name="Clay"/> The unit was equipped with type C-3 observation balloons as well as type A-6 and A-7 spherical balloons.  It was consolidated with its World War I predecessor unit on 6 August 1930.<ref name=2SOSfacts/>

At Fort Bragg, the unit was redesignated the '''2d Balloon Squadron''' on 1 October 1933, and equipped with C-6 observation balloons in 1938.<ref name=2SOSfacts/>   It supported activities of the Coast Artillery Barrage Balloon Training Center at [[Camp Davis]], North Carolina, 1940-41.<ref name="Clay"/> Aircraft reconnaissance technology was making the manned observation balloon obsolete by 1940; the unit was last assigned on 1 September 1941 to [[I Air Support Command]] of [[First Air Force]] at [[Pope Field]], before being disbanded on 3 February 1942 shortly after the [[Pearl Harbor Attack]].<ref name=2SOSfacts/>

===Strategic Air Command===
In its early years, along with its own fighter wings for escorting its bombers, [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) formed a limited air transport capability to supplement that of the [[Military Air Transport Service]], which provided SAC with the majority of its airlift support.  The '''2d Strategic Support Squadron''' was organized and activated on 14 January 1949 at [[Biggs Air Force Base]], Texas, where it drew its [[cadre (military)|cadre]] from the [[1st Strategic Support Squadron]], which had moved to Biggs the previous month.<ref name="SSS">{{cite web |url= http://www.alternatewars.com/WW3/WW3_Documents/USAF/SAC_Historic_Study_61_Partial.htm |author=|title=The Strategic Air Command, A Chronological History 1946-1956, SAC Historical Study No. 61|date=|publisher=Historical Division, Office of Information, Strategic Air Command|accessdate=July 31, 2018}} (partial unpaginated copy, undated, but probably c. 1957)</ref>  The squadron was assigned directly to SAC's [[Eighth Air Force]], but was attached to the host wing at Biggs, the [[97th Bombardment Wing]].<ref name=2SOSfacts/>

Initially flying [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]]s, the squadron carried much classified equipment and personnel to various locations around the world. During the 1950s the squadron operated from several SAC bases in various locations and was upgraded to the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]] intercontinental airlifter in 1950.  The squadron was inactivated on 15 June 1961 when SAC divested itself of its organic transport aircraft and transferred the mission back to MATS. In September 1985, the two squadrons were consolidated as the '''2d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron''', but the consolidated squadron remained inactive.<ref name=2SOSfacts/>

===Unmanned vehicle operations===
The squadron was reactivated in the [[military reserve force|reserve]] as the '''Second Special Operations Squadron''' in 2009.  With its history of being a combat reconnaissance unit, the squadron was assigned modern [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).  The 2d became the first Air Force reserve squadron to assume command of a UAV combat air patrol - a 24/7 orbit over a critical area of a combat zone.<ref name="UAV">{{Cite news|url=http://www.citamn.afrc.af.mil/News/Features/Article/195362/eye-in-the-sky-new-reserve-predatory-squadron-operating-its-own-combat-air-patr/|title=Eye in the Sky: New Reserve Predatory squadron operating its own combat air patrol 24/7, 365|last=Joyner|first=Bo|date=July 27, 2009|work=Citizen Airman Magazine|access-date=September 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924092518/http://www.citamn.afrc.af.mil/News/Features/Article/195362/eye-in-the-sky-new-reserve-predatory-squadron-operating-its-own-combat-air-patr/|archive-date=September 24, 2017|dead-url=|publisher=Air Force Reserve Command|language=en-US|website=}}</ref>

The 2d was originally established as a classic [[Air Force Reserve Command#Associate Program|associate squadron]] with a bit of a twist. It was initially located at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], Nevada, geographically separated from both its parent unit, the [[919th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Duke Field]], Florida, and its host associate unit, the Regular Air Force's [[3rd Special Operations Squadron]] at [[Cannon Air Force Base]], New Mexico. It is also geographically separated from the aircraft it operates, as all of the aircraft the squadron operates are owned by the active-duty unit, and all are deployed in combat areas.<ref name="UAV"/>  In 2014, the squadron relocated to its current home of [[Hurlburt Field]], Florida, concurrent with its transition to the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper]].<ref name="nwfdailynews.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.919sow.afrc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/623865/reserve-rpa-squadron-begins-operations-at-hurlburt-field/|author=No byline|title=Reserve RPA squadron begins operations at Hurlburt Field|last=|first=|date=June 13, 2014|work=|access-date=September 23, 2017|publisher=919th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs}}</ref>

Like many other UAV squadrons, the 2d is composed of people with a wide range of aircraft experience in addition to the MQ-1 and MQ-9: AC-130 gunships, MC-130 Combat Talons, A-10s, Marine Corps AV-8 Harriers, Navy F-14s, F-15s, F-16s, Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18s, F-22s and bombers, tankers, airlifters, and even helicopters.<ref name="UAV"/>
