This is a dab page, but all the entries are redlinks apart from one that redirects to an article about a person. [[User:DexDor|DexDor]] ([[User talk:DexDor|talk]]) 07:56, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::Agree, but I'd hold off on deletion. Angolan place names are difficult to decipher, and this is a great resource. Red links: very little work is being done on Angola-related articles, even on basic geographic articles that you see here (villages), hence the red links.

<s>*'''Delete''' The only blue link doesn't mention being known as 'Dumbo'; all others don't meet [[MOS:DABRL]]. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 14:12, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</s>
*'''<s>Delete</s> Redirect'''-at first I thought that someone was saying that this place was dumb or something. You automatically think of the elephant of course when you hear the word Dumbo. If this place is anything-a merge? [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:02, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:I changed my vote now to redirect. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 22:27, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' It could redirect to [[Dumbo (disambiguation)]] - then it would be easily recreated if/when needed. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 15:48, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' I agree with [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] that a redirect is better, since some of these places are likely to eventually have articles.  ''Wikipedia is an encyclopedia: It combines many features of general and specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and gazetteers.'' [[Wikipedia:Five pillars]].  By the way, the Dumbo in Bié Province does not refer to the person at the blue link, but to the settlement at 14° 3' S, 17° 26' E, which is known as both {{GEOnet2|32FA8813315A3774E0440003BA962ED3|Mandume (Approved)}} and {{GEOnet2|32FA8813315B3774E0440003BA962ED3|Dumbo (Variant)}}. I'll see if I can fix that. --[[User:Bejnar|Bejnar]] ([[User talk:Bejnar|talk]]) 20:36, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[Dumbo (disambiguation)]] as a plausible search term. [[User:Northamerica1000|NorthAmerica]]<sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|1000]]</sup> 05:09, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
