==Historical Significance==
[[Kanthirava Narasaraja I|Narasaraja Wodeyar I]] (1638 - 1659) popularly known as Ranadheera Kantheerava was an emperor in the royal [[Mysore]] dynasty. He was a man of immense physical strength and was known as an intense wrestler in the Kingdom. He was an exponent in a form of wrestling called "Vajra Mushti".  He was also a musician with a strong liking towards arts and literature. He used the [[Srirangapatna]] town as his capital. Soon after his death in 1659, all his 10 wives committed [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] and ended their lives.<ref>[http://samharshbangalore.blogspot.in/2013/02/the-wrestler-king-of-mysore-whose-ten.html The wrestler King of Mysore whose ten wives committed sati]</ref>

==Cultural Significance==
This film is credited to have spurred the Kannada cinema industry in the direction of historicals. This was produced as a joint venture under at a time when the Kannada cinema industry was facing severe financial crises and its enormous success is reported to have not only re-instilled confidence in the Kannada cinema industry but inspired other historicals in quick succession. Even today it stands as a sort of guidepost to making compelling historical dramas in Kannada. The chief merit of Ranadheera Kanteerva is the level of authenticity in several key aspects. The first is the Kannada language used during Kanteerava Narasaraja Wodeyar’s days both by the royalty and the common people. To a keen student of the inflections that Kannada has undergone, this forms a useful study. Equally authentic are the depictions of the protocol, manners, customs, and traditions of palace life. The movie also brings out a few nuances of palace intrigue, tangentially touches upon some aspects of the administrative machinery, and the system of espionage by weaving them together in a rather dramatic fashion.
This level of detail was made possible due to extensive research and first hand knowledge of the Mysore palace life that the film’s writer Sri G.V. Iyer possessed.<ref>http://prekshaa.in/contributions-of-kannada-cinema-to-historical-dramas/#.WzjaB9SLRnJ</ref>
