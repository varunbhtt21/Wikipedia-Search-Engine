== Biography ==

Christodoulos Stefanadis was born in [[Ikaria]], Greece and attended the [[University of Athens Medical School]] from which he graduated in 1971. He completed his residency in Cardiology at the Cardiology Department of the University of Athens (1978), followed by a PhD in Athens Medical School (1981). He has been Professor of Cardiology since 2002 and Director of the 1st Department of Cardiology since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Cardiology Journal, Profiles in Cardiology|url=http://stefanadis.gr/ProfilesInCardiology.pdf}}</ref>
He has held the positions of Dean of Athens Medical School (2007-2011), President of the Hellenic Society of Cardiology (1997-1999 & 2007-2009), Board Member of the Hellenic Heart Foundation (1995–present),<ref>{{cite web|title=Hellenic Heart Foundation Board members (greek page)|url=http://www.elikar.gr/page.php?pid=2}}</ref> Professor of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, [[Emory University]], Atlanta U.S.A.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Christodoulos Stefanadis profile on Emory University Online Directory, Department of Cardiology|url=https://open.library.emory.edu/profiles/cstefan/}}</ref> Professor of Internal Medicine, Cardiology, [[Yale University]], New Haven, Connecticut, USA (July 2014-)<ref>{{cite web|title=Christodoulos Stefanadis Profile on Yale University|url=http://directory.yale.edu/phonebook/index.htm?Query=stefanadis&btnG.x=0&btnG.y=0&btnG=enter|access-date=2015-03-05|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150309124712/http://directory.yale.edu/phonebook/index.htm?Query=stefanadis&btnG.x=0&btnG.y=0&btnG=enter|archive-date=2015-03-09|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

== Research ==

One of his several research activities include designing of at least 10 prototype cardiac catheters which were applied in various diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.  Early in his career he developed the technique of retrograde non-transeptal mitral balloon valvuloplasty which has been used internationally for the interventional treatment of mitral stenosis, introduced the idea of covering metallic stents by non-thrombotic material and he developed covered stents by autologous vascular (arterial or vein) grafts.
He subsequently made studies on the elastic properties of aorta and the function of left atrium. A large part of his research efforts was devoted to experimental and clinical studies on coronary heart disease, such as estimation of thermal heterogeneity of human atherosclerotic plaques using a special catheter with a thermistor tip, external non-invasive heating of stented arterial segments, and evolution and application of bevacizumab-eluting stent for the inhibition of microvessel growth in unstable atherosclerotic plaques.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Cardiology Journal, Profiles in Cardiology|url=http://stefanadis.gr/ProfilesInCardiology.pdf}}</ref>
He has been worked lately on invasive treatment methods of resistant hypertension by novel sympathetic denervation techniques of the renal arteries (chemical denervation, barodenervation).<ref>{{cite web|title=Editorial on Hellenic Journal of Cardiology: Renal Denervation in Resistant Hypertension: Radiofrequency Ablation and Chemical Denervation|url=http://www.hellenicjcardiol.com/archive/full_text/2011/6/2011_6_481.pdf|access-date=2014-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050942/http://www.hellenicjcardiol.com/archive/full_text/2011/6/2011_6_481.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes}}</ref>
He has presented his research results by more than 3,500 abstracts in international scientific conferences and has given over 260 lectures as invited speaker internationally.

Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research has published an "Analysis of Global Research Trends in

Cardiology Over the Last two Decades" listing Christodoulos Stefanadis at the first rank among top authors for clinical cardiology research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=Rohit|last2=Sachdeva|first2=Soumya|last3=Zacks|first3=Jerome S|date=January 2015|title=An Analysis of Global Research Trends in Cardiology Over the Last two Decades|journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research : JCDR|volume=9|issue=1|pages=OC06–OC09|doi=10.7860/JCDR/2015/11223.5453|issn=2249-782X|pmc=4347106|pmid=25738015}}</ref>

== Honors and awards ==

Stefanadis was awarded the title of "Elite Reviewer" by the scientific journal [[Journal of the American College of Cardiology]] (JACC) in recognition of his whole contribution to the journal’s publications (2005)<ref>{{cite web|title=JACC award for Christodoulos I Stefanadis|url=http://stefanadis.gr/pics/jaccrecognition.jpg}}</ref>  and the international journal [[Clinical Cardiology]] dedicated a special honorary article to him entitled "Profiles in Cardiology" in a 2007 issue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Cardiology Journal, Profiles in Cardiology|url=http://stefanadis.gr/ProfilesInCardiology.pdf}}</ref>

The American College of Cardiology awarded him the Simon Dack’s Award (2011), which is given annually to the scientist with the most important contribution to the scientific journals of the American College of Cardiology (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, JACC-Cardiovascular Interventions and JACC-Cardiovascular Imaging).<ref>{{cite web|title=Simon Dack award for Christodoulos Stefanadis|url=http://stefanadis.gr/pics/simon-dack.jpg}}</ref>
