'''Elections to [[Harrogate Borough Council]]''' were held on 22 May 2014. A third of the council was up for election, with voting only in the urban wards of [[Harrogate]], [[Knaresborough]] and [[Ripon]]. The elections were held on the same day as the [[2014 United Kingdom local elections|British local elections]] and the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament elections]]. Each ward up for election returned a councillor for a four-year term of office.

==Electoral system==
All locally-[[Elections in the United Kingdom#Registration procedure|registered electors]] ([[British citizen|British]], [[Irish citizen|Irish]], [[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth]] and [[European Union]] citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1694/schedule/made |title=The Representation of the People (Form of Canvass) (England and Wales) Regulations 2006, Schedule Part 1 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/faq/voting-and-registration/i-have-two-homes.-can-i-register-to-vote-at-both-addresses |title=I have two homes. Can I register at both addresses? |publisher=The Electoral Commission |date= |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

==Campaign==
The elections saw new parties contest Harrogate for the first time, such as the TUSC and a number of Independents. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] fielded a full slate of the 19 candidates, [[UK Independence Party]] fielding 17, 16 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] 8, 3 Independents and 1 [[Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition]] candidate.
