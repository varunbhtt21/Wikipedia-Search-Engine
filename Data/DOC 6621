I went with the shorter hook, although both were basically equally good

* ... that '''[[Samuel Bowen]]''' introduced the [[soybean]] to North America?

:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Hook is interesting and verifiable with the reliable sources given.--[[User:12george1|12george1]] ([[User talk:12george1|talk]]) 03:45, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] '''Second, expanded review''': New enough, long enough, well-referenced, no close paraphrasing seen. QPQ done. Hook ref verified and cited inline. However, I wonder if you want to mention that this idea supersedes the older idea that [[Benjamin Franklin]] introduced the soybean to North America?

:::*'''Comment''': {{ping|Yoninah}} Thanks for the comment. I did think about that but dumped the idea because I wanted a short, catchy hook. It also seemed to me that readers were more likely to click on a link for Benjamin Franklin rather than poor old Samuel. That said, your suggestion is a good one, so how about:
:::*'''ALT2''' ... that '''[[Samuel Bowen]]''' introduced the [[soybean]] to North America rather than [[Benjamin Franklin]] as is widely believed?
:::What do you think? [[User:Philg88|<span style="color:#3a23e2; font-weight:bold; text-shadow:grey 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em;">&nbsp;Philg88&nbsp;</span>]]<sup>♦[[User_talk:Philg88|talk]]</sup> 04:27, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Hook ref verified and cited inline. This nom is good to go. I'll leave it to the closing administrator to decide if Samuel Bowen alone, or Samuel Bowen with Ben Franklin, is more hooky. I would suggest tweaking the second option as follows:
::::*'''ALT3''': ... that '''[[Samuel Bowen]]''', not [[Benjamin Franklin]], introduced the [[soybean]] to North America?
