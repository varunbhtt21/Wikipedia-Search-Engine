This biographical article is about, in my opinion, an unnotable textbook author/academic. It has been nominated for [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion]] twice, both times being removed by an IP address seemingly associated with the article's subject, {{user|Teraknor}}, who created the article: most edits are by him, although since I attempted to {{tl|prod}} yesterday, a number of new, single-use accounts ([[WP:DUCK]]?) have also edited the article in question.

Most sources are generic; those that are not are fairly minor. In its current state, the article reads like a CV. [[User:Microchip08|μc8]] ([[User talk:Microchip08|talk]]) 09:50, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

::I am one of the contributors; having used one of these IP addresses I think, preferring to remain anonymous over time, I prefer a low profile on the web(Mortimer)

::Been trying to add stuff over some time, quite inexperienced in this editing lark, so if I have violated rules, sorry, BUT i am very interested in why this page is up for removal as soon as the subject writes an article on WikiAbuse.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Mortimer.lake|Mortimer.lake]] ([[User talk:Mortimer.lake|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mortimer.lake|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

*'''Delete''' - This is mostly just a bibliography - there is little to no discussion of his academic career, which makes it a bit hard to what positions he's held, and consequentially how successful his career has been.  But in absence of evidence, the default assumption must be that he has not held senior professorial positions that would see him meet [[WP:PROF]].  I can't find anything in what are usually the key sources (Who's Who, Debrett's).  Possibly [[WP:TOOSOON]].

::Seeing quite a large number of articles from them around the world, note you have other authors who do not appear in the same journals you mention? <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:31.90.58.160|31.90.58.160]] ([[User talk:31.90.58.160|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/31.90.58.160|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->
::: It's generally considered more helpful than not if a comment makes sense.  I didn't mention ''any'' journals. [[User:Barney the barney barney|Barney the barney barney]] ([[User talk:Barney the barney barney|talk]]) 18:09, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. This is not an article, but rather a list of accomplishments copied from a CV. As this article stands, it should not be on Wikipedia. To keep, it would need a major re-working, including some narrative. --[[User:Kbabej|Kbabej]] ([[User talk:Kbabej|talk]]) 18:25, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
