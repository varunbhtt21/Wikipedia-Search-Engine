<small>Created by [[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]). Self nominated at 09:51, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] From a DYK perspective, this article is new enough and long enough and the hook facts are well sourced. However, reading through the plot section, I find it quite difficult to follow. For example, what does this mean - "He is upset because Bertie told him during a stopover for pigeons that his father was having a private conversaion with a dirty radio intern called Florentine(Lena Sabine Berg)."

::::*[[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]], thanks for the review. I will do the necessary corrections soon.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 11:22, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::* [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]], I have rewritten the plot to make it more clear.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 12:48, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] This article meets the DYK criteria of newness and length and the hook fact has an inline citation. I have done some more copyediting and I think the plot text is OK now. I do not believe you need to do a QPQ review as I don't think you have had any DYKs before.
