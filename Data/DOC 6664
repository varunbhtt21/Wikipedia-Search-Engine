'''Gebhard Ludwig Himmler''' (29 July 1898 – 22 June 1982) was a German [[Nazi]] [[functionary]], [[mechanical engineer]] and older brother of ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]].

== Upbringing ==

Gebhard Ludwig Himmler was born on 29 July 1898 in [[Munich]], the first son of a schoolmaster who later became a headmaster (''Oberstudiendirektor''), Joseph Gebhard Himmler (born 17 May 1865 in [[Lindau]]; died 29 October 1936 in Munich), and Anna Maria Heyder (born 16 January 1866 in [[Bregenz]]; died 10 September 1941 in Munich).<ref>[http://www.descartes-gym-nd.de/index.php/faecher/geschichte/schulgeschichte/310-beruehmte-persoenlichkeiten?showall=&start=3 ''Gebhard Himmler, Der Vater eines Massenmörders'']</ref> His siblings were [[Heinrich Himmler]] (born 7 October 1900 in Munich; committed suicide in British custody, 23 May 1945 in [[Lüneburg]]) and [[Ernst Hermann Himmler]] (born 23 December 1905 in Munich; died 2 May 1945).

On 3 November 1902 the family moved to Passau, where Joseph Gebhard Himmler taught Greek and Latin at the Königlich humanistisches Gymnasium.<ref>Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 22f</ref>

From 1904 to 1906 he attended the cathedral school on the ''Frauenplatz'' in Munich.<ref>Klaus Mües-Baron: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLcMqSmglicC&pg=PA29&dq=%22Gebhard+Ludwig+Himmler+in+die+katholische+Domschule%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nVO5Ub-VB-S84ASqwoDwDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Gebhard%20Ludwig%20Himmler%20in%20die%20katholische%20Domschule%22&f=false ''Heinrich Himmler: Aufstieg des Reichsfuhrers SS (1910–1933)'';] unipress, Göttingen 2011, p. 29</ref> From 1906 to 1908 he went to the ''Amalienschule'' and from 1909 to 1916 to the [[Wilhelmsgymnasium München|Wilhelmsgymnasium]]. In 1916, because he was still working for his ''[[Abitur]]'', he was absolved from being called up into the [[Bavarian Army]]. In March 1917 he took his ''Abitur'' early and passed.

He was a member of the ''[[Studentenverbindung]]'', AGV München, where he got to know [[Richard Wendler]], later to become his brother-in-law. On 18 September 1926 he married Mathilde Hilde Wendler, whom he had met at a ball held by the Apollo students' association. Their children are Irmgard (born 21 October 1927), Anneliese (born 16 October 1930) and Heide (born 13 March 1940 in [[Gmund am Tegernsee]]).

== Wartime service and early career ==
In 1917, Himmler passed an officer training course and, in May 1917, joined [[16th Bavarian Infantry Regiment]] in [[Passau]]. In summer that year he participated in an exercise at [[Grafenwöhr]], passed a [[Fahnenjunker]] course and, subsequently, a machine gunner's course in [[Lagerlechfeld]]. On 9 April 1918, Himmler arrived in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and then took part in the [[Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)|Battle of Château-Thierry]], 65&nbsp;km east from [[Paris]], as a runner between battalion and regimental headquarters. 

In 1919, after the end of the war, Himmler and his brother, Heinrich, left the Munich citizens' militia, the ''[[Einwohnerwehr]]'', to join the 21st Rifle Brigade (''Schützenbrigade 21'') of the [[paramilitary]] [[Black Reichswehr]] under [[Franz Ritter von Epp]]. In early 1923, Himmler joined the ''[[Bund Reichskriegsflagge]]'' under [[Ernst Röhm]], who took part in the [[Munich Putsch]] in November 1923.

From 15 January 1919 to July 1923, he took a course in [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[Munich University of Technology]]. From July 1923 to the introduction of the [[Rentenmark]] currency, Himmler worked for the Bavarian Mortgage and Exchange Bank (''Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank'') for paper currency. In 1924 he worked in the construction office of the engineering firm, Fritz Neumeyer AG, in the Munich quarter of {{ill|Freimann (Munich)|lt=Freimann|de|Freimann}}. From January 1925 he was an assistant teacher at the municipal vocational and technical school for precision engineering in ''Deroystrasse''; from April 1925 he was appointed as a teacher ([[Studienrat]]) there and taught technical drawing, physics and instrumentation.

== Nazi functionary ==
On 30 January 1933, Himmler was appointed headmaster of the vocational school in ''Deroystraße'' and on 1 November 1935 he became headmaster of the Oskar von Miller Polytechnic, a higher education establishment specializing in technology.

In May 1933 Himmler joined the [[Nazi Party]] (member no. 1.117.822)<ref name="DAL">''Dienstaltersliste der Schutzstaffel der NSDAP (SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer – SS-Standartenführer)'', Berlin 1944.</ref> and the ''[[Verein für das Deutschtum im Ausland]]''. In order to avoid the appearance of being an opportunist, at his request the lower Nazi membership number of his wife was transferred to him. Before 30 January 1933, Himmler became the head of the Bavarian vocational schools association. This was transferred in 1933 into the [[National Socialist Teachers League]] (NSLB). Himmler became deputy and, subsequently, head of the Gau Students Association (''Gaufachschaftsleiter'') for the [[Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|Gau of Upper Bavaria]].

From his appointment as director of the vocational school in ''Deroystraße'', Himmler devoted himself to numerous honorary offices in the Nazi regime and was largely exempted from teaching. He trained as an officer and continued to work with the NSLB. From early 1936, he worked in the head office for technology in the Nazi Party, the ''Hauptamt für Technik in der NSDAP'', and in the Nazi Federation for German Technology (''NS-Bund Deutscher Technik''), led by [[Fritz Todt]] and to which, until 1938, almost all technical-scientific associations, such as the [[Association of German Engineers]] (VDI), were connected.<ref>[[Josef Greiner]], [http://www.worldcat.org/title/sudetenfahrt-der-deutschen-technik-eigene-zugzeitung-nr-1-8-nov-dez/oclc/719149583 Sudetenfahrt] der deutschen Technik Eigene Zugzeitung ; No. 1–8 ; Nov-Dec.</ref>

The VDI defined the guidelines for the award of the title "engineer". Himmler helped to shape this corporate representative body and exercised the state's political power in a discriminatory and party-political manner.<ref>Michael Alisch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6fnexdwq3_UC&pg=PA53&dq=%22Rassedoktrin+war+das+f%C3%BCr+Gebhard+Himmler+kein+beruflicher%22&hl=de&sa=X&ei=_GTJUdKJOIbL4ATq84DoDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Rassedoktrin%20war%20das%20f%C3%BCr%20Gebhard%20Himmler%20kein%20beruflicher%22&f=false ''Heinrich Himmler – Wege zu Hitler: das Beispiel Heinrich Himmler'']; p. 53</ref>

On 1 August 1939, Himmler was called up and assigned to the 19th Bavarian Infantry. He was deployed with his company to Czechoslovakia on the Polish border.

After the start of the [[Second World War]] on 1 September, he participated in the [[Invasion of Poland]]. The 19th Infantry were part of the [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|14th Army]]. At the end of the fighting, on 16 and 17 September, the regiment was located west of [[Lemberg]] (now Lviv), but was transferred to the Lower Rhine in October 1939.

Himmler enjoyed the protection of [[Fritz Todt]], who ensured that, in December 1939, he was posted to Department E IV of the ''[[Reichserziehungsministerium]]'' in Berlin. On 12 July 1940, he was promoted from principal (''Oberstudiendirektor'') to director (''Ministerialrat'').  From June 1940, Gebhard and Hilde Himmler lived with their family in ''Hähnelstraße'' in the Berlin district of [[Friedenau]]. From August 1943, Himmler lived with his brother, Ernst, in [[Ruhleben-Spandau|Ruhleben]] in Berlin. In 1944, Wilhelm Heering (born 1877),<ref>Heering, Wilhelm (born 1877): Professor am Berufspädagogischen Institut in Berlin, tätig im preußischen Ministerium für Arbeit, 1933–1934 im Amt für Technik und Schule, dann Reichsreferent des NSLB für den berufsbildenden Bereich, 1934–1945 Abteilungsleiter des REM für den berufsbildenden Bereich.</ref> director (''Ministerialdirigent'') at the ''Reichserziehungsministerium'', retired, and  Himmler became his successor. 

Until 1946, his family lived at ''Haus Lindenfycht'' in [[Gmund am Tegernsee]] with [[Margarete Himmler]]; during renovation work at the private villa she looked after prisoners at the subcamp of [[KZ Dachau]].<ref>Wolfgang Benz, Barbara Distel (Hrsg.): ''Der Ort des Terrors.'' Bd. 2: ''Frühe Lager, Dachau, Emslandlager''. München 2005, {{ISBN|3-406-52962-3}}, p. 12.</ref> On 30 January 1944, Himmler became an SS-''[[Standartenführer]]'' (SS-Nr. 214.049)<ref name="DAL" /> and, on 30 March 1944, was promoted to SS-''Standartenführer der Reserve'' in the [[Waffen-SS]] and was employed as inspector of Waffen-SS schools.

== Post-war ==
Himmler was taken prisoner by the British Army near [[Kappeln]] on the [[Schlei]]. In early March 1946, he was interned at the Emil Köster Leather Factory in [[Gadeland]]; later, he was transferred to [[Bad Fallingbostel]] on the [[Lüneburg Heath]]. In 1948 he was moved to an internment camp on Ungererstraße.

Following his release in 1948, he worked on the manufacture of [[capacitor]]s in Hoffmannstraße. Karl Hudezeck (1934–1945, headmaster of the [[Wittelsbacher-Gymnasium München]]) gave him a [[denazification certificate]] for the Nazi era. At a [[denazification panel]] he was assessed as Category II - Follower (''belastet'').

In the European-Afghan Cultural Office in Munich, Himmler, as director (''Ministerialdirigent a. D.'') and engineer, worked as a study adviser and arranged internships for Afghan students. He was barred from working for the government and he was disqualified from his pension, but he successfully appealed this in 1959.<ref>[[Katrin Himmler]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=-4w8MgoxEv4C&pg=PA288&dq=%22In+1959+Gebhard+was+finally+successful%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4iW-Ub3-CaX64QTP6oDgAw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22In%201959%20Gebhard%20was%20finally%20successful%22&f=false The Himmler Brothers], p. 288</ref> He died in Munich on 22 June 1982, aged 83.
