Title : Generations of warfare
Text : {{History of war}}
The concept of four "generations" in the history of [[modern warfare]] was  created  by a team of [[United States]] analysts, including [[William S. Lind]],<ref>{{Citation |last1=Lind |first1=William S. |last2=Nightengale |first2=Keith |last3=Schmitt |first3=John F. |last4=Sutton |first4=Joseph W. |last5=Wilson |first5=Gary I. |date=October 1989 |title=The Changing Face of War: Into the Fourth Generation |url=http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/lind/the-changing-face-of-war-into-the-fourth-generation.html |work=Marine Corps Gazette |pages=22-26 }}</ref> for the purpose of an argument for "the changing face of war" entering into a "fourth generation".
*First-generation warfare  refers to [[Ancient history|Ancient]] and [[Post-classical history|Post-classical]] battles fought with massed manpower, using [[phalanx]], line and column tactics with uniformed soldiers governed by the state.
*Second-generation warfare is the [[Early modern period|Early modern]] tactics used after the invention of the [[rifled musket]] and [[breech-loading weapon]]s and continuing through the development of the [[machine gun]] and [[indirect fire]]. The term ''second generation warfare'' was created by the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] in 1989. 
*Third-generation warfare focuses on using [[Modern history#Late modern period 2|Late modern]] technology-derived tactics of leveraging speed, stealth and surprise to bypass the enemy's lines and collapse their forces from the rear. Essentially, this was the end of linear warfare on a tactical level, with units seeking not simply to meet each other face to face but to outmaneuver each other to gain the greatest advantage.
*[[Fourth-generation warfare]] as presented by Lind et al. is characterized by "Post-modern" a return to [[decentralized]] forms of warfare,  blurring of the lines between [[war]] and [[politics]], [[combatants]] and [[civilians]] due to  [[nation state]]s' loss of their near-monopoly on combat forces, returning to modes of conflict common in pre-modern times.

==First generation==

In 1648, at the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] gave a practical sovereignty to the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]], which until then were semi-independent components of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This more firmly established the sovereignty of the [[nation-state]], which meant, among other things, that governments would have exclusive rights to organize and maintain their own militaries. Before this time, many armies and nations were controlled by religious orders and many wars were fought in [[mêlée]] combat, or subversively through bribery and assassination. The first generation of modern warfare was intended to create a straightforward and orderly means of waging war.<ref name=Lind>{{Citation |last=Lind |first=William S. |authorlink=William S.

Alternatively, it has been argued that the Peace of Westphalia did not solidify the power of the nation-state, but that the Thirty Years' War itself ushered in an era of large-scale combat that was simply too costly for smaller mercenary groups to carry out on their own. According to this theory, smaller groups ''chose'' to leave mass combat&mdash;and the expenses associated with it&mdash;in the domain of the nation-state.<ref>{{cite book |last=Echevarria |first=Antulio J.

The increased accuracy and speed of the [[rifled musket]] and the [[breech-loading weapon|breech-loader]] marks the end of first generation warfare; the concept of vast lines of soldiers meeting face to face became impractical due to the heavy casualties that could be sustained. Because these technologies were adopted gradually throughout the Americas and Europe, the exact end of the first generation of modern warfare depends on the region, but all world powers had moved on by the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=Lind/>

In order to create a more controlled environment for warfare a military culture was developed that, in many ways, is still visible in the armed forces of today. Specially crafted uniforms set soldiers apart from the general populace. 

An elaborate structure of [[Military rank|rank]] was developed to better organize men into units. Rules for [[Parade (military)|military drill]] were perfected, allowing line and column maneuvers to be executed with more precision, and to increase the rate of fire in battle.

Control of media information release during the war and production of [[counterfeit money]] in order to devaluate enemy's economy were used for the first time during [[Napoleonic wars]].

Examples:
*[[English Civil War]]
*[[Anglo-Spanish War (1654)|Anglo-Spanish War]]
*[[Seven Years' War]]
*[[American Revolutionary War]]
*[[Napoleonic Wars]]
*[[War of 1812]]
*[[Mexican War of Independence]]

==Second generation==
[[File:Red army soldiers, end of 1920s-beginning of 1930s.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Technological developments such as the [[Maxim gun]] gave smaller units the ability to operate more independently]]
In the 19th century, the invention of the breech-loading rifled musket meant longer range, greater accuracy, and faster rate of fire. Marching ranks of men straight into a barrage of fire from such weapons would cause tremendous rates of casualties, so a new strategy was developed. 

Second generation warfare still maintained [[Line (formation)|lines of battle]] but focused more on the use of technology to allow smaller units of men to maneuver separately. These smaller units allowed for faster advances, less concentrated casualties, and the ability to use cover and concealment to advantage.<ref name=Lind />
To some degree, these concepts have remained in use even as the next generations have arisen, so the end of the second generation is not as clearly defined as that of the first. The development of the [[blitzkrieg]] highlighted some of the flaws of static firing positions and slow-moving infantry, so this can be considered the beginning of the end for the second generation, at least as the dominant force in military strategy.

The contributions of the second generation were responses to technological development. The second generation saw the rise of [[trench warfare]], [[artillery]] support, more advanced [[reconnaissance]] techniques, extensive use of [[Military camouflage|camouflage uniforms]], [[radio]] communications, and [[fireteam]] maneuvers.

Examples:
*[[American Civil War]]
*[[Boer War]]
*[[World War I]]
*[[Spanish Civil War]]
*[[Iran–Iraq War]]

==Third generation==
[[File:DesertStormMap v2.svg|thumb|left|250px|Fast advances and maneuvering allowed Allied cavalry forces to quickly penetrate deep into Iraq during the [[Gulf War]]]]
The use of blitzkrieg during the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] first demonstrated the power of speed and maneuverability over static artillery positions and trench defenses. Through the use of [[tank]]s, [[mechanised infantry|mechanized infantry]], and [[close air support]], the Germans were able to quickly break through linear defenses and capture the rear.

The emphasis on maneuvering and speed to bypass enemy engagement remains a common strategy throughout the world, and collapsing an enemy's defenses by striking at deeper targets is—in a somewhat different way—a major strategy in [[fourth generation warfare]].<ref name=Lind />

The contributions of the third generation were based on the concept of overcoming technological disadvantage through the use of clever strategy. As linear fighting came to an end, new ways of moving faster began to appear.

The emphasis on cavalry moved from heavy armor to greater speed, the development of the [[helicopter]] allowed insertions in hostile territory, and advanced [[missile]] technology allowed forces to bypass enemy defenses and strike at targets from great distances.
The speed inherent in these methods necessitated a greater degree of independence allowed to the units on the front lines.

Greater trust needed to be placed in junior officers commanding sub-units by higher-ranking officers—a belief that they could adequately achieve their objectives without micromanagement from higher ranking commanders in command headquarters.

Smaller units were allowed greater decision flexibility to deal with changing situations on the ground, rather than have decisions made for them by commanders who were distant from the front. This began to break down the regimented culture of order that was so important in previous theoretical eras of military [[command and control]].

Examples:
*[[World War II]]
*[[Korean War]]
*[[Vietnam War]]
*[[Persian Gulf War]]
*[[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]
*[[Iraq War]]

==Fourth generation ==
{{main|Fourth-generation warfare}}
Fourth-generation warfare is characterized by a blurring of the lines between [[war]] and [[politics]], [[combatants]] and [[civilians]]. The term was first used in 1989 by a team of [[United States]] analysts, including [[William S. Lind]], to describe [[war]]fare's return to a [[decentralized]] form. In terms of [[generational modern warfare]], the fourth generation signifies the [[nation state]]s' loss of their near-monopoly on combat forces, returning to modes of conflict common in pre-modern times.

The simplest definition includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a [[Sovereign state|state]] but rather a [[violent non-state actor]]. Classical examples, such as the [[Third Servile War|slave uprising under Spartacus]] or the [[Mercenary War|mercenary uprising]] that occurred in Carthage after the [[first Punic War]], predate the modern concept of warfare and are examples of this type of conflict.

Fourth generation warfare is defined as conflicts which involve the following elements:
* Are complex and long term
* [[Terrorism]] (tactic)
* A non-national or transnational base – highly decentralized
* A direct attack on the enemy's core ideals
* Highly sophisticated [[psychological warfare]], especially through [[media manipulation]] and [[lawfare]]
* All available pressures are used – political, economic, social and military
* Occurs in [[low intensity conflict]], involving actors from all networks
* Non-combatants are tactical dilemmas
* Lack of hierarchy
* Small in size, spread out network of communication and financial support
* Use of insurgency and [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]]
