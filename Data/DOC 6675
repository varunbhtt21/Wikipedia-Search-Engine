==Plot==
Marieme (Karidja Touré) is a 16-year-old [[Blacks in France|African-French]] teenager living in a poor [[Paris]] suburb.  Academically, Marieme struggles, which forces her into a vocational track where she will learn a trade.  Due to her mother's long working hours, Marieme's abusive brother is effectively in charge of the household.<ref name="Girlhood">{{cite web|last1=O'Malley|first1=Sheila|title=Girlhood|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/girlhood-2015|website=Rogerbert.com|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref>  On her way out of school, the day she found out about vocational school,  she is approached by a gang of girls. Lady ([[Assa Sylla]]) who is the leader of the group, and her followers, Fily (Marietou Toure), and Adiatou (Lindsay Karamoh), ask Marieme if she wants to join them for a day in the city centre.  They wear leather jackets, gold jewelry, and have pin straight hair. Marieme initially declines but, after seeing the girls approached by a group of boys, including her brother's friend, Ismael (Idrissa Diabate) whom she has a crush on, Marieme joins them.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=A.O.|title=Exploring the Limits in a Man’s World In ‘Girlhood,’ a French Adolescent Comes Out of Her Shell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/movies/in-girlhood-a-french-adolescent-comes-out-of-her-shell.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref>

The girls fight, steal and intimidate others but love and support each other. Marieme and the girls grow close and she eventually begins to act and dress just like them.  After committing theft, the girls pay for a hotel room, steal dresses, drink alcohol, do drugs, lip sync to "[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]", by [[Rihanna]], and dance all night long. At the hotel, Lady encourages Marieme to ignore her abusive older brother's phone calls and gives her a gold necklace with the name Vic for Victory.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

Fighting is part of competitng with other groups.<ref name="Girlhood"/>  Lady sets up a fight with a girl in a rival group.  Unfortunately, Lady is beaten, and has her shirt torn off which is viewed as a disgrace.  Due to her loss, her father cuts all of her hair off and makes her keep her distance from the group.  Vic/Marieme, wants to prove to herself, as well as Lady, that she has the strength to beat their rival.  Vic wins the battle by ripping the girl's shirt off and cutting her bra, leaving her topless.  Both Lady and Vic's brother are incredibly proud of her.

Vic is physically assaulted by her brother when he finds out she slept with Ismael, so she leaves home and starts to work for Abou, a local drug dealer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abraham|first1=Amelia|title='Girlhood' Gives Young Black Girls Some Much-Needed Screen Time|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/celine-sciammas-new-film|website=Vice|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref>  While working for Abou, Vic lives in an apartment with two male roommates. In order not to be sexualized, she binds her breasts and wears loose baggy clothing. When her boyfriend discovers she has been binding her breasts, they fight. Afterwards, she goes to a party at Abou's place where, despite her dressed down look, Abou approaches and tries to kiss her. She tells him no and pushes him away.  Vic goes to Ishmael's place to tell him she's done with Abou and he offers to let her stay at his place and marry her. Vic refuses, telling him she doesn't want that kind of life.  She attempts to go back home, but despite being buzzed into her building she finds herself unable to get in.

==Production==
Sciamma's inspiration for the film came from the different gangs of girls she saw around Paris, especially around the Les Halles shopping center and the Metro.<ref name="Screen International">{{cite web|last1=Screen International|title=Girlhood|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?shr=t&csi=355078&sr=HLEAD(%22Girlhood%22)%20and%20date%20is%202014|publisher=Media Business Insight|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> ''Girlhood'' is her last coming of age film and her goal was to focus on friendship, sorority, and the special bond that is formed between girls.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|last1=Romney|first1=Jonathan|title=The stars of Girlhood: ‘Our poster is all over Paris, with four black faces on it…’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/26/girlhood-film-karidja-toure-assa-sylla-celine-sciamma|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Blay|first1=Zeba|title=Interview: 'Girlhood' Director Celine Sciamma on Race, Gender & the Universality of the Story|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/interview-girlhood-director-celine-sciamma-on-race-gender-the-universality-of-the-story-20150206|website=IndieWire|accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref>  Sciamma is frequently asked why she wrote and directed a film about a gang of young French black girls, seeing that she is white.  Celine stated, "I had a strong sense of having lived on the outskirts-even if I am middle-class white girl.  I didn't feel I was making the film about black women but with black women-it's not the same.  I'm not saying, 'I'm going to tell you what it's like being black in France today'; I just want to give a face to the French youth I'm looking at".<ref name="theguardian.com"/> 

The film's casting process took four months to complete where actresses were scouted from the streets of Paris.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chang|first1=Dustin|title=Shine Like A Diamond: GIRLHOOD Director Céline Sciamma Interview|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2015/01/draft-celine-sciamma-interview.html|website=twitchfilm|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Nastasi|first1=Alison|title=‘Girlhood’ Director Céline Sciamma on Reclaiming Childhood, Casting Her Girl Gang, and How Her Film Mirrors ‘Boyhood’|url=http://flavorwire.com/502100/girlhood-director-celine-sciamma-on-reclaiming-childhood-casting-her-girl-gang-and-how-her-film-mirrors-boyhood|website=Flavorwire|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

Sciamma intentionally cast black actresses because of her concern over the lack of opportunities for black women in France, saying that she "was shocked by how black people were never on screen [in France]. Very, very few – even in TV. Particularly that age group and women. There are no black actresses famous in France."<ref>{{cite web|last1=MOTTRAM|first1=JAMES|title=Céline Sciamma interview: step aside 'Boyhood', it's 'Girlhood' time|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/cline-sciamma-interview-step-aside-boyhood-its-girlhood-time-10199093.html|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>

The film also made prominent use of the song "[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]" by [[Rihanna]]. Sciamma shot the scene before securing the rights to the song and had to appeal to Rihanna's management in post-production. After seeing the scene, they agreed to grant her the rights to the usage of the song for a minimal fee.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Theodore-Vachon|first1=Rebecca|title=How Rihanna Brought Black Girl Magic To "Girlhood"|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccatheodore/2015/02/06/girlhood-movie-rihanna-music-diamonds-black-girls/|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>

==Reception==
The film received highly positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 96% approval rating and an average rating of 8.1/10 based on 72 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/girlhood_2015/ | title=Girlhood | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reports an 85/100 rating based on 20 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/girlhood-2014 | title=Girlhood | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' described the film as "a work of cinematic art."<ref>{{cite web|title=Girlhood review: an exhilarating, thought-provoking look at life inside a girl gang|url=https://www.theguardian.com/french-film-first/2014/oct/08/girlhood-review-exhilarating-thought-provoking-look-at-life-inside-a-girl-gang|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> In his review for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] wrote, "''Girlhood'' is about as grim as movies get, but it's showing something real, and Sciamma has a feel for this period of life, the camaraderie, the jokes, the kinds of conflicts, the panic and the hope. Each time Sciamma makes a movie, it’s as if she’s saying, not stridently, but plainly, 'Here’s something real people are going through that you’ve never thought about.' That’s a moral use of film, all the more effective in that Sciamma makes ''Girlhood'' entertaining."<ref name="sfgate">{{cite news|last1=LaSalle|first1=Mick|title=Growing up on the wrong side of Paris in 'Girlhood’|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Girlfriends-growing-up-in-a-tough-part-of-6173470.php|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2 April 2015}}</ref>

Sciamma received both criticism and praise for her decision to use an all black cast of girls.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blay|first1=Zeba|title=Interview: 'Girlhood' Director Celine Sciamma on Race, Gender & the Universality of the Story|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/interview-girlhood-director-celine-sciamma-on-race-gender-the-universality-of-the-story-20150206|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>

The New York Times appraises ''Girlhood'' in [[A. O. Scott]]'s review by maintaining the movie's focus on a young woman in an absent society where she is fierce, independent, gentle and intelligent in order to survive what comes ahead.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|title = In ‘Girlhood,’ a French Adolescent Comes Out of Her Shell|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/movies/in-girlhood-a-french-adolescent-comes-out-of-her-shell.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 29 January 2015|access-date = 22 July 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = A.

Scott focuses on the conflict between the conscious Marieme developing towards the fearless Vic and how she combats the stereotypes of what a young woman in her situation is expected to become by transforming her experiences into a future she now controls.<ref name=":0" />
