==History==
''La Patilla'' was created by co-founder and former CEO of Globovisión, Alberto Federico Ravell. In 2010, the majority shareholders of the television station asked for the resignation of the directors of Globovision which included Ravell.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/02/11/pol_ava_alberto-federico-rav_11A3421293.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214091041/http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/02/11/pol_ava_alberto-federico-rav_11A3421293.shtml |archive-date=2010-02-14 |dead-url=yes |title=Alberto Federico Ravell sale de la directiva de Globovisión, El Nacional |df= }}</ref> On 11 June 2010, Ravell then created the news website, La Patilla.

===Growth===
According to [[Alexa Internet]], in 2015, ''La Patilla'' was one of the most popular websites in Venezuela, more popular than [[Twitter]] and any other news website.<ref name=ALEXApop>{{cite web|title=Top Sites in Venezuela |url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries;0/VE |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=22 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222195213/http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries%3B0/VE |archivedate=22 February 2015 |df= }}</ref> At that time the only websites that were more popular in Venezuela were YouTube, Amazon, Google and Facebook.<ref name=ALEXApop/> By 2017, ''La Patilla'' had grown to be among the top 5 most visited websites in Venezuela, with only Google, YouTube and Facebook being more popular in the country.<ref name=1APR17/><ref name=Ajune2015>{{cite web|title=lapatilla.com |url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.lapatilla.com |website=Alexa |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617064636/http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.lapatilla.com |archivedate=June 17, 2015 }}</ref> It was also the top visited news website in Venezuela, ranked more popular than ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', ''[[Globovisión]]'' and ''[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]''.<ref name="ALEXApop"/>

The ''Wall Street Journal'' reports that Venezuelans "have been forced to find alternatives as newspapers and broadcasters struggle with [[Censorship in Venezuela|state efforts to control coverage]]", with a growing trend of Venezuelans using online news media to bypass government censors.<ref name="WSJcrackdown" /> Journalists and press-freedom advocates also state that news websites like ''La Patilla'' "have helped fill a gap" since those linked to the Venezuelan government had purchased media organizations in Venezuela, such as ''El Universal'', Globovisión and ''[[Ultimas Noticias]]''.<ref name="WSJcrackdown" /> In an article by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' discussing the rising popularity of news websites in Venezuela, ''La Patilla'' CEO Alberto Federico Ravell stated that, "The editorial line of ''La Patilla'' is to call it like it is ... We don't need paper. We don't need a broadcasting license. There's little they can do to squeeze us."<ref name="WSJcrackdown" />

Shortly after ''La Patilla'''s launch, readership was primarily from [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate educated]] individuals in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413024147/https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/lapatilla.com|title=Lapatilla.com Site Info|date=2011-04-13|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Censorship===
{{more|Censorship in Venezuela}}
[[File:Netblocks-venezuela-wikipedia-block.png|thumb|Netblocks showing the censorship of websites including La Patilla and Wikipedia by CANTV]]
On 17 May 2012, ''La Patilla'' was covering violent clashes occurring at a Venezuelan prison, [[La Planta]], through a [[live stream]] video feed. However, visitors of ''La Patilla'' reported that the website was experiencing "irregularities" and thought it was just technical problems. Later it was discovered that ''La Patilla'' was blocked by the government-run [[CANTV]]. CANTV blocked ''La Patilla'''s original [[IP address]] and after ''La Patilla'' changed its IP address, CANTV blocked it again. Readers of ''La Patilla'' criticized the blockage by CANTV saying it was a "violation of their right to information". Readers also assumed the blockage by the government was due to the coverage of the prison clashes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cantv, proveedor de internet del Estado venezolano, bloquea portal de noticias ''La Patilla''|url=http://noticiasmontreal.com/41972/proveedor-de-internet-del-estado-venezolano-bloquea-portal-de-noticias-la-patilla/|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Noticias Montreal|date=17 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cantv bloquea la página web ''La Patilla''|url=http://globovision.com/articulo/cantv-bloquea-la-pagina-web-la-patilla|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=Globovision|date=17 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lapatilla.com denuncia bloqueo a usuarios en Cantv|url=http://www.elmundo.com.ve/noticias/tecnologia/internet/lapatilla-com-denuncia-bloqueo-a-usuarios-en-cantv.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=El Mundo|date=17 May 2012}}</ref> David Moran, editor of ''La Patilla'' stated that "Censorship has been multidimensional against us".<ref name=ENHblockage/>

Weeks after the [[2018 Venezuelan presidential election|Venezuelan presidential election in 2018]], ''La Patilla'' had their [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] momentarily censored by the state-run CANTV as well as private internet service providers who had to comply with government regulations from 6 June 2018 to 11 June 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2018/06/12/los-bloqueos-de-la-patilla-y-el-nacional-revelaron-una-nueva-forma-de-censura-en-internet/|title=Los bloqueos de ''La Patilla'' y El Nacional revelaron una nueva forma de censura en internet|last=|first=|date=|website=La Patilla|language=es-ES|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> Since June 2018, CANTV has continued to block access to ''La Patilla''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/2018/08/24/cantv-continua-el-bloqueo-a-la-patilla/|title=Cantv continúa el bloqueo a ''La Patilla''|last=|first=|date=2018-08-24|work=La Patilla|access-date=2018-08-24|language=es-ES}}</ref>

===Attacks on reporters===
On 22 April 2014, reporters from ''La Patilla'' that were covering events in Santa Fe were retained by the National Guard. The team of reporters were accused of being "fake journalists", had to show their ID's to the National Guardsmen and had their pictures taken. They were later released without further complications.<ref>{{cite news|title=GNB retuvo y fichó a fotógrafos de lapatilla (Video)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/04/23/asi-retuvieron-y-ficharon-a-fotografos-de-lapatilla-video/|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=23 April 2014}}</ref> In another incident on 12 May 2014, a photojournalist from ''La Patilla'' was assaulted by National Police who tried to take his camera and hit him in the head with the [[Stock (firearms)|butt]] of a shotgun while he covering protests in Las Mercedes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Impactantes imágenes: la agresión al reportero de ''La Patilla'', captada por las cámaras de NTN24|url=http://www.ntn24.com/videos/impactantes-imagenes-la-agresion-al-reportero-de-la-patilla-captada-por-las-camaras-de-ntn24-132099|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=NTN24|date=12 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Reportero gráfico de ''La Patilla'' es empujado y golpeado por un PNB: le rompieron el casco de un "cachazo"|url=http://www.ntn24.com/noticias/reportero-grafico-de-la-patilla-es-empujado-y-golpeado-por-un-pnb-le-rompieron-el-casco-de-un-132064|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=NTN24|date=12 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=PNB agrede a reportero gráfico de @La_Patilla (Video)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/05/12/pnb-agrede-a-reportero-grafico-de-lapatilla-video/|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=12 May 2014}}</ref> A week later on 20 May 2014,  the same photojournalist attacked in Las Mercedes who worked for ''La Patilla'' was assaulted by the National Police again who tried to take his camera while covering protests in the Las Minitas neighborhood in [[Baruta]].<ref>{{cite news|title=PNB agrede nuevamente a reportero de @La_Patilla en Las Minitas (Video)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/05/19/pnb-agrede-nuevamente-a-reportero-de-la_patilla-en-las-minitas-video/|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=19 May 2014}}</ref> On 27 May 2014, a reporter for ''La Patilla'' was attacked while covering clashes in Táchira when he was shot in the arm by a National Guardsman armed with a shotgun.<ref>{{cite news|title=Herido por perdigones reportero gráfico de @La_Patilla en Táchira (Fotos)|url=http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2014/05/27/herido-por-perdigones-reportero-grafico-de-la_patilla-en-tachira-fotos/|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=La Patilla|date=27 May 2014}}</ref>

In April 2017, a ''La Patilla'' reporter was shot at close range with a tear gas canister, fracturing his tibia after being hit in the leg.<ref>{{cite news|title=El CPJ pide cobertura informativa "segura" durante protestas en Venezuela|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/04/12/el-cpj-pide-cobertura-informativa-segura-durante-protestas-en-venezuela/|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=La Patilla|date=12 April 2017|language=es-ES}}</ref>

===Diosdado Cabello===
{{details|Corruption in Venezuela#Diosdado Cabello}}

On 11 August 2015, then President of the National Assembly, [[Diosdado Cabello]], sued ''La Patilla'' and other media organizations for reporting that he was being investigated for his ties to drug trafficking and his alleged role in the [[Cartel of the Suns]]. On 31 May 2017, Bolivarian official [[Pedro Carreño]] leaked a document prior to trial of a decision by Venezuelan courts to award Cabello 1 billion [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolívar]]es ($500,000 USD in May 2017). Cabello stated that with the money, "I am going to pay the lawyers and I will give that to the poor children", while the lawyer for ''La Patilla'',  Alejandra Rodríguez, stated that "to publish the contents of a judicial act in the middle of a controversy, of which Pedro Carreño is not a party, invalidates the judicial proceedings ... If that decision is true, it would demonstrate once again that in Venezuela there is no separation of powers and that the Judiciary is an appendage of the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=AFP: Portal venezolano de noticias LaPatilla debe pagar casi US$ 500.000 a líder chavista Diosdado|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/06/01/afp-portal-venezolano-de-noticias-lapatilla-debe-pagar-casi-us-500-000-a-lider-chavista-diosdado/|accessdate=1 June 2017|work=La Patilla|date=31 May 2017|language=es-ES}}</ref>

In June 2019, the website was charged with "moral charges" and fined 30 billion bolivars (about $5m dollars) after publishing an [[ABC News]] article<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/internacional/20150127/abci-venezuela-cabello-eeuu-201501262129.html|title=El jefe de seguridad del número dos chavista deserta a EE.UU. y le acusa de narcotráfico|last=Blasco|first=Emil J.|date=26 January 2015|website=ABC|language=es|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> about drug traffic in Venezuela, that implicated the president of the pro-Maduro [[2017 Constituent National Assembly]], [[Diosdado Cabello]]. The website director [[Alberto Federico Ravell]], supporter of [[Juan Guaidó]] during [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis|the presidential crisis]], wrote that Cabello was engaging in "judicial terrorism". Cabello also added that he will take control of the website if it was unable to pay.<ref name=lapatilla30bn>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-news-ordered-pay-5-million-key-regime-081209706.html|title=Venezuela news site ordered to pay $5 million to key regime figure|date=5 June 2019|website=Yahoo News|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> Cabello had previously tried to raise judicial processes against ABC and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' for accusations of drug trafficking, but the cases were rejected.<ref name=lapatilla30bn /> Nathalie Southwick (CPJ) considers that the measure against ''La Patilla'' is an "attempt to bankrupt and shut down a critical outlet" and provides an "example of how the Venezuelan judicial system is being used to retaliate against critical media".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2019/06/venezuelas-supreme-court-orders-la-patilla-to-pay-.php|title=Venezuela's Supreme Court orders La Patilla to pay US$5m in damages to Cabello|date=7 June 2019|website=CPJ|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>
