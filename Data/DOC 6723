(1986), "Notes on Late Libyan Period", ''JEA'' 72, pp.&nbsp;198–201</ref> was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian ruler ("king") of [[Hermopolis]] during the [[25th Dynasty]].

==Biography==
Like his probable predecessor [[Nimlot of Hermopolis|Nimlot]], he proclaimed himself king, adopting the full [[royal titulary]] although he was no more than a governor of Hermopolis and a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] 25th Dynasty. His [[cartouche]]s appear carved on the shoulders of a damaged [[block statue]] depicting the priest Tjanhesret, found in [[Luxor]] in 1909 and now in the [[Cairo Museum]] (CG 42212), and on a [[bronze]] ''[[Naos (hieroglyph)|naos]]''-shaped amulet of [[Amun-Ra]] of unknown provenance – possibly from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] – and now in the [[British Museum]] (EA11015).<ref name=jea/><ref>Kitchen, op. cit., § 109; 331</ref><ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=129855&partId=1&searchText=bronze+naos&page=1 The bronze ''naos''-shaped amulet EA11015 at the British Museum.]</ref> The only known depiction of the king is found on a votive scribal pallet now in the collection of the [[Swansea University#Museum of Egyptian Antiquities (Egypt Centre)|Egypt Centre of Swansea University]].<ref name=Sagrillo/>

[[United Kingdom|British]] [[Egyptologist]] [[Kenneth Kitchen]] has suggested that the successor of Djehutyemhat could have been the poorly known "king" [[Pedinemty]].<ref>Kitchen, op. cit., § 525</ref>
