First, the schools were analyzed for the number of students who achieved above the state average on the reading and math tests. Then they considered how the economically disadvantaged students performed against the state average. Finally, they considered the participation rate and the performance of students in college readiness by examining Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate test data. Bloomsburg Area High School ranked 45th place in Pennsylvania and 1,758th among USA high schools, for a silver medal in 2014. Among Pennsylvania high schools (traditional, charter and private) 56 achieved gold or silver medals. Another 103 high schools achieved bronze rating out of 698 Pennsylvania high schools reviewed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools |title=High School Overview 2014 |author=US News and World Report |date=April 22, 2014}}</ref> The Bloomsburg Area High School was ranked Silver in 2011 and was listed as #1,560 of all high schools in the nation.<ref>US News and World Report, Best High Schools Bloomsburg Area High School Report, 2011</ref> In 2009, Bloomsburg Area High School was ranked Bronze.

===PSSA Results===
[[Pennsylvania System of School Assessment]]s, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/state_assessment_system/20965 |title=State Assessment System |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2014}}</ref>

==Science in Motion==
Bloomsburg Area High School and Bloomsburg Area Middle School both took advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate.<ref>The Pennsylvania Basic Education/Higher Education Science and Technology Partnership, Science in Motion annual report, 2012</ref>  [[Susquehanna University]]  provided the science enrichment experiences to schools in the region.

==College Remediation==
According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 19% of Bloomsburg Area School District's graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]] or community colleges. .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdehighered.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=Dir&id=cached&psname=Dir&psid=1&in_hi_userid=2&cached=true&control=DirRepost&rangeFrom=121&rangeTo=140&subfolderID=5358&DirMode=1 |title=Pennsylvania College Remediation Report, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=January 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503011538/http://www.pdehighered.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=space&name=Dir&id=cached&psname=Dir&psid=1&in_hi_userid=2&cached=true&control=DirRepost&rangeFrom=121&rangeTo=140&subfolderID=5358&DirMode=1 |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}</ref> Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.<ref>National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008</ref>  Per the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]], one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.

==Dual enrollment==
Bloomsburg Area High School offers a [[dual enrollment]] program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/24901214/Pennsylvania-Department-of-Education-Dual-Enrollment-Guidelines-2010-2011 |title=Pennsylvania Department of Education – Dual Enrollment Guidelines. |access-date=2017-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017221943/https://www.scribd.com/doc/24901214/Pennsylvania-Department-of-Education-Dual-Enrollment-Guidelines-2010-2011 |archive-date=2014-10-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions.<ref>[http://www.patrac.org/ Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement.

==Wellness policy==
Bloomsburg Area School Board established a district-wide Wellness Policy in 2006 – Policy 246.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloomsburgasd.schoolwires.com/6278951022102120/site/default.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711091156/http://bloomsburgasd.schoolwires.com/6278951022102120/site/default.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-11 |author=Bloomsburg Area School Board Policy Manual |title=Student Wellness |year=2006 }}</ref> The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) "shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006."

The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, all public school districts are required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.<ref>Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the  School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education – Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008</ref> The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.

Bloomsburg Area High School offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.<ref>USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012</ref> The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].<ref>Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009</ref>

In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and [[Vitamin D]].<ref>USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013</ref> In order to comply with the [[Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010]] all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/governance/legislation/Pricing_Equity_Facts.pdf |title=Food and Nutrition Service Equity in School Lunch Pricing Fact Sheet |author=United States Department of Agriculture |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922174202/http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/governance/legislation/Pricing_Equity_Facts.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-22 |df= }}</ref>  In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/9528/white-house-michelle-obama-lets-move-sugary-drinks-schools/ |title=White House Sets New Limits on Junk Food Ads in Schools |author=Denver Nicks |publisher=Time Magazine |date=February 25, 2014}}</ref> The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch.
