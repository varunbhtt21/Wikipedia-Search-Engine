The '''Society of Artists''' was an influential Sydney based group of progressive artists who staged annual exhibitions from 1895 to the 1960s. The Society included many of Australia's best artists of the time. It lapsed during the mid 1960s.

== History ==

[[File:Society of Artists' Selection Committee, Sydney, 1907.jpg|thumb|Society of Artists' Selection Committee, 1907 — group of artists including [[Julian Ashton]] (left) and [[Norman Lindsay]] (5th from left).]]

In 1888 the artist [[Tom Roberts]] established the [[Victorian Artists' Society]] but he and [[Arthur Streeton]] moved to Sydney in 1891 during an [[economic depression]] in Melbourne. Roberts then formed the "Society of Artists" in Sydney in 1895 as a breakaway group from the Royal Art Society of NSW<ref name="Max" /> as a protest by [[avant-garde]] artists who believed that the general body of members should have a vote in choosing the committee of selection for annual shows,.<ref name="SMH-1901" /> As well the formation of the new Society was a protest against what they considered to be the cramping effect of the old unchanging tradition that photographic realism was the essential of good art<ref name="Catalogue1946" /> and a desire to limit the membership to more professional painters.

The Society of Artists' foundation had strong points of similarity with that of the [[New English Art Club]], which sought a more progressive and contemporary version of English art, and many of the Society's early executives were in some way influenced by [[Henry Tonks]], [[Walter Sickert]] and their English fellows.<ref name="Catalogue1946" />

The Society of Artists' first exhibition, in 1895, was inaugurated by Sir [[Henry Parkes]].<ref name="Parkes" />

In 1897 the Society of Artists secured a Government subsidy of £400 a year which was later raised to £500. This enabled the painters to rent a gallery in [[Pitt Street, Sydney]], and also to offer a travelling scholarship of £150 a year for three years to the best student of the year.<ref name="SMH-1901" /> Recipients of the Society's travelling scholarship included people like [[William Dobell]], who later became famous artists.<ref name="SMH-1929" />

[[Sydney Ure Smith]] was President of the Society from 1921 to 1948 and during this time he encouraged new members and advocated measured progress in Australian art. Together with [[George Washington Lambert]] he helped to keep the Society [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] and supported the award of the Society's travelling scholarship to young artists. In 1923 Lambert arranged the Society's controversial Exhibition of Australian Art in London – which attracted controversy because a group of Victorian artists wanted to remove [[Norman Lindsay]]'s works as being "immoral" and applied for a court injunction to prevent the exhibition leaving Australia without further selections.<ref name="MuseumVic" />

The "Press and Arts Club", a [[supper club]] of the Society of Artists was a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] club also founded and presided over by Tom Roberts. It was established for professional painters and illustrators, as opposed to some of the older art societies, which were dominated by laymen. It met monthly at the Cafe Frangois in [[George Street, Sydney]]. The Supper Club was described by artist [[George Augustine Taylor|George Taylor]] as a "glorious, wonderful feast of song, sketch and story that would follow the feast of beefsteak".<ref name="Dancing" /><ref name="Sunday Times 1898" />

From its inception in 1895, the Society held various functions to augment money for its travelling scholarship including an annual Artists' Ball, children's parties and an Art Union<ref name="SMH-1929" /><ref name="SMH-1897" /><ref name="SMH-1900" /><ref name="Evening-1925" /><ref name="Sunday Times-1895" /> and these as well as afternoon teas to entertain women were often held at the same time as the Society's art exhibitions.<ref name="Freeman's Journal-1896" />

The Society's publications included annual exhibition catalogues and books such as Amy Lambert's ''Thirty Years of an Artist's Life'' a book about her husband (George Washington Lambert) and his career and the ''Anzac Memorial Building N.S.W'' about the sculptures by [[Rayner Hoff]] in the [[ANZAC War Memorial]] in Sydney.<ref name="MuseumVic" /><ref name="Noff" /> The Society also awarded medals to encourage 'good service for the advancement of Australian art'.<ref name="MuseumVic" />

[[David Edgar Strachan]] was the last president (1965) of the Society,<ref name="ADB" /> after which it folded.<ref name="Max" />

== Membership ==

The Society of Artists included artists from all over Australia. The Society stated in its 1946 exhibition catalogue<ref name="Catalogue1946" /> that the only qualification for membership being:
{{quote|...competence, but at a high level not only of technique but of thought. It must be remembered that a good artist puts on canvas only what he has thought about deeply and unceasingly both as to content and technique and especially as to significance in the world of life and nature. The merit of all those elected to the Society has been always an individuality of approach and expression, content being subordinate to the thought.}}

== Exhibitions ==
