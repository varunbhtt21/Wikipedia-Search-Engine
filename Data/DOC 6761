Title : File:A Green-bean Galaxy.jpg
Text : ==Summary==
{{Non-free use rationale 2
|Description = An image from the Gemini Observatory webpage showing a Green-bean galaxy.
|Source = '''Original publication''': The Astrophysical Journal Vol. 763<br/>
'''Immediate source:''' The Gemini Observatory website
|Date = January 2013
|Author = Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope 
|Article = Green bean galaxy
|Purpose = It will show an image of a Green Bean galaxy (GB), thus making the article's subject
clearer.
|Replaceability = There isn't one.
|Minimality = It will be used on the GB article. I can also put a link to the Gemini
website on the page (already on talk), so someone can download it from
there.
|Commercial = I have contacted Kathie Coil at [[NOAO]] via email, who writes: "If you use the acknowledgement on the image, you should be fine." I have credited the image to
the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, so I'm not sure what more I can do.  

|Other information = {{Non-free with permission|image has rationale=yes}}<br/>
The webpage I have taken it from is: http://www.gemini.edu/node/11904  . I have
contacted the Gemini Observatory outreach team:  coil@noao.edu  . Kathie Coil is
the Public Affairs Program Coordinator.
