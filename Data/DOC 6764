I've been contacted by Russell Brown from [http://www.audioculture.co.nz/about Audio Culture] which is funded by NZ on Air to showcase NZ Music and Artists. They are keen for the like to be referenced on Wikipedia eg artists pages like [http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/push-push this] however after some bad experiences a few years ago with [[Wikipedia:External_links/Noticeboard/Archive_1#User:Filmtvfan|NZonscreen links]] they are a little wary on how best to proceed. I was thinking we could just add them ourselves where they were up to scratch but I don't want to tragger some spam filter. Thoughts? - [[User:SimonLyall|SimonLyall]] ([[User talk:SimonLyall|talk]]) 11:46, 7 September 2013 (UTC)

== Question regarding copyright of images listed on National Library of New Zealand ==
[[File:Edward John Eyre 01.jpg|thumb|[[Edward John Eyre]]]]
I've been searching for some free images for New Zealand biographical articles, and have found a number of interesting images listed on the National Library of New Zealand website. However I'm unsure of the copyright status of some photos. For example [http://natlib.govt.nz/records/23014929?search%5Bpath%5D here] an image (from 1921) is provided, and they state that the author is unknown. The photo was definitely taken in New Zealand, but the exact date and location is unknown. According to [http://www.caslon.com.au/durationprofile3.htm this], should this photo not be in the public domain? The natlib page states however that "You can copy this item for personal use, share it, and post it on a blog or website. It cannot be used commercially without permission, please ask us for advice. If reproducing this item, please maintain the integrity of the image (i.e. don't crop, recolour or overprint it), and ensure the following credit accompanies it". So can anyone clarify whether images such as this, taken, and I assume published, in New Zealand over 50 years ago by an unknown author are in fact ''not'' in the public domain? -- [[User:Shudde|<font color="Blue">Shudde</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Shudde|<font color="Blue">talk</font>]]</sup> 02:39, 13 October 2013 (UTC)

::It's of course true what Stuartyeates says, but most of the time, what they say about copyright is simply made up. I've uploaded hundreds of photos from the National Library, and most of the pages told me that I can't do that.

:::Yeah if it's a government work then you'd hope they'd know who took it and when (they give two possible dates and locations). I get the feeling they just put up a bit of a [[Boilerplate (text)|boiler-plate]] message without establishing whether they actually have copyright or not. I think I may go and upload the image to commons.

:::::Unfortunately the National Library have various objectives and getting photos into Wikipedia articles is not one of them.

"It cannot be used commercially without permission, please ask us for advice. If reproducing this item, please maintain the integrity of the image (i.e. don't crop, recolour or overprint it)". Well, it is from the 1870s or 1880s, they don't even give the artist but even if they did, that person would be long dead. I think I'm actually doing them a favour by not asking for permission, because I'm not using up their staff time and they can instead focus on something more productive.

:Yes, I saw that. Where I'm coming from is that I could only find the image because "they" had preserved it and catalogued it and that is why I could find it and therefore I owed them some courtesy. Being unwilling to be 'blacklisted' (there've been quite a few conversations, er terseness was in the air) I just shut down my little project. One of the things I did point out to them was that while their colleagues around the world were groping for ways to let people see what they held and yet keep it safe they would let me display [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Charting_rebellious_New_Zealand.jpg things1] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:On_the_road_Daimler.jpg things2] in WP that NatLib would not.

::I don't think you can get them to loosen up.

I think it is best to just give up on getting them to change the license and only use them for stuff that is(or should be) in the public domain.
::I've bounced from body to body. The one I'm most hopeful of is Archive New Zealand. They actually control the copyright to everything they have so can make decissions. If anybody is Wellington-based we could organise a slection of a sample of stuff and then request they release it under a WP-friendly license. - [[User:SimonLyall|SimonLyall]] ([[User talk:SimonLyall|talk]]) 10:35, 4 November 2013 (UTC)

== Regions of New Zealand, revisited ==

Kia ora tātou. The names of all 16 regions in NZ were standardised as "Foo&nbsp;Region" for articles and categories [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject New Zealand/Archive 3#Regional categories and articles|per consensus in 2009]]. A few regions have now had their names changed to "Foo&nbsp;region" (lower-case&nbsp;"r") because the "region" bit is not part of the proper noun; this makes sense IMO. I was trying to standardise the rest of them, but a couple of them had redirects (which needs admin assistance). So I wanted to get a second opinion before going ahead.

* '''Foo <u>R</u>egion''' (7): [[Auckland Region]] <small>(redirect at [[Auckland region]] since 2007)</small>, [[Wellington Region]] <small>(redirect at [[Wellington region]] since 2010)</small>, [[Tasman Region]], [[West Coast Region]], [[Canterbury Region]] <small>(redirect at [[Canterbury region]] since 2011)</small>, [[Otago Region]], [[Southland Region]]
* '''Foo <u>r</u>egion''' (8): [[Northland region]], [[Waikato region]], [[Bay of Plenty region]], [[Gisborne region]], [[Hawke's Bay region]], [[Taranaki region]], [[Manawatu-Wanganui region]], [[Marlborough region]], 
:* <small>These were all moved on 26 November by [[User:BlackCab]], except for Hawke's Bay, which I moved just prior to posting here. Double redirects from "Foo&nbsp;Region" have already been fixed.</small>
* '''Other''' (1): [[Nelson, New Zealand]] <small>(with several redirects, including at [[Nelson Region]])</small>

The categories are all at '''Category:Foo Region''', including Nelson. Personally I favour having all of them at "Foo region" with the lower-case "r". Thoughts? <span style="font-family:Verdana">– [[User:Liveste|Liveste]] <small>([[User talk:Liveste|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liveste|edits]])</small></span> 06:47, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

:I have always wondered why 'regions' was capitalised. I support having the remaining ones brought in line to all have lower case 'r'. '''<font color="#000000">[[User:Schwede66|Schwede]]</font><font color="#FF4500">[[User talk:Schwede66|66]]</font>''' 08:28, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

:: I'd assume they are capitalised due to being proper names. A Region in this context is a local government entity which took over from sundry local committees such as catchment boards upon local government restructuring in 1989. See [[Regions of New Zealand]]. As to what to do with each individual article it depends on what the article is about. If it is about the local government entity then I think the capitals should be retained. If it is about a general area, does it really need to be called "region" at all? For example the [[Southland Region]] article would perhaps be better off at [[Southland, New Zealand]] than [[Southland region]]. (The clarity of this distinction is not helped by the habit of Regional Councils of giving themselves brand names emphasising their environmental work). Similarly the article currently at [[Canterbury Region]] could be moved to [[Canterbury, New Zealand]], subsequent to which the article currently at [[Canterbury Regional Council]] could be moved to [[Canterbury Region]]. [[User:Daveosaurus|Daveosaurus]] ([[User talk:Daveosaurus|talk]]) 10:35, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

:::Wait, are the geopolitical areas actually defined independently of the regional councils? Or are they officially the same thing? (I hope those questions make sense, because I'm a little confused.) I've gone through the [[Regions of New Zealand#List of regions|List of regions table]] at [[Regions of New Zealand]]:
:::*Of the five unitary authorities, three have separate articles for the geopolitical area and a regional council; Marlborough has no council article that I can find, while [[Gisborne District Council]] redirects to [[Gisborne region]];

:::*Of the 11 other regions, only three have separate region/council articles (Canterbury, Otago and Southland), while the others simply redirect to the Region article (or else don't have a council article).

:::Shouldn't we standardise all this as well? (Here I was thinking this would all be straightforward.) <span style="font-family:Verdana">– [[User:Liveste|Liveste]] <small>([[User talk:Liveste|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Liveste|edits]])</small></span> 12:35, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

:::: Standardisation would be a good idea. The Regions themselves each have a Regional Council, although in the case of unitary authorities (Nelson, Tasman, Marlborough, Gisborne, and I'm not sure what's gone on in Auckland) the District or City also has the powers of the Regional Council. The Regions also include areas which historically hadn't been thought of as part of that Region; for example, Kaikoura, Kurow and Otematata are in Canterbury Region, but wouldn't be considered part of Canterbury in normal contexts (Kaikoura only ended up part of Canterbury when Marlborough decided to be a unitary authority and Kaikoura didn't want to take part).

:::: To standardise them, I'd suggest move Foo Region (or Foo region) to Foo, New Zealand, and if any Regional Councils are actually independently notable (I'd doubt that for any other than the Canterbury Regional Council, which is a major ongoing political issue; Regional Councils are very much eclipsed by City or District Councils in newsworthiness) then their articles should be at Foo Region, or Foo Regional Council. [[User:Daveosaurus|Daveosaurus]] ([[User talk:Daveosaurus|talk]]) 00:02, 2 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::I inadvertently started this ball rolling a few weeks ago when I encountered the Hawke's Bay article that appeared under the title of '''Hawke's Bay Region'''. I was baffled by why the article had a title that included the word "Region", including a capital "R", as if it was part of the proper name; because there was a similarly-named article ([[Hawke Bay]]) that referred to the body of water, it seemed more logical to move the word "region" into parantheses as a disambiguation, in the style of [[Steve Martin (motorcycle racer)]] and [[Steve Martin (sportscaster)]]. I sought the help of an admin to move the page because of an existing redirect. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hawke%27s_Bay_region&diff=516787946&oldid=516733014] on October 9).

:::::I thought no more of it until I discovered a couple of weeks ago that other NZ regions had the word "Region" in the title also. I moved some to a new title with the "region" uncapitalised, then stopped when I wondered why the word "region" was in the title at all. My reasoning is that if [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] can exist as article titles without the word "state" in the title, so can Manawatu and Taranaki. The complication is those regions for which disambiguations are clearly needed (West Coast, Gisborne, Wellington). My suggestion would be to rename all articles ''without'' the word region ''unless'' a disambiguation is needed, in which case the word "region" would appear in parentheses, per the Steve Martin disambig examples. The high number of articles requiring the bracketed disambig shouldn't affect that: as a principle, the word "region" is just not needed.

:::::Sorry for not raising this here earlier; I could see no previous discussion on any of the articles I looked at, nor was I aware of this page (I did look at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject New Zealand]] without seeing anywhere the discussion would logically begin. Since someone did notice me changing the articles, it probably would have been helpful if they had directed my notice to this page once the discussion began. But no matter; I'm here now. [[User:BlackCab|BlackCab]] ([[User talk:BlackCab|talk]]) 10:29, 6 December 2012 (UTC)

::::::The caps read strangely to me too. For names where the region isn't the main topic (e.g. Auckland, Wellington), I think "XXX region" is probably the most natural way to refer to it, but I wouldn't object to "XXX (region)" and where necessary "XXX (New Zealand region)" if that keeps things reasonably consistent. (Consistency was the main reason given for changing to "XXX Region" in the 2009 discussion.) "XXX, New Zealand" only works in some cases (e.g. Canterbury), not others (e.g. Auckland, Wellington). So I don't think that's the best approach, especially since further disambiguation (e.g. "XXX, New Zealand (region)") starts to seem clumsy. 
::::::Where we have a separate article on the council, I think this should generally be titled using its official name [http://www.localcouncils.govt.nz/lgip.nsf/wpg_URL/Profiles-Councils-by-Type-Index?OpenDocument as listed on localcouncils.govt.nz].
::::::In some cases, the vernacular meaning of "XXX region" is quite different from the area governed by the regional council (e.g. Wellington, Waikato), and we may have extra regional articles that don't match the regional council boundaries (e.g. [[Wairarapa]]). In others, only some border areas are in the "wrong" region, and this can hopefully be covered in the articles on the relevant region council areas. --[[User:Avenue|Avenue]] ([[User talk:Avenue|talk]]) 15:08, 13 December 2012 (UTC)

:::::::Sorry for starting this section and then leaving it for two weeks. And apologies to BlackCab for not notifying you of the discussion. I don't mind which disambiguator we use, whether it be "XXX Region", "XXX region", "XXX (region)", "XXX (New Zealand region)", or anything else <small>(I'm a little over "Foo" right now)</small>. I'd probably pick "XXX region" because it's simple, and we haven't had any disambig issues with "XXX Region". Personally, I'd like to see consistency across all 16 articles, but I'm not fussed either way; I'll settle for some kind of consensus. I also agree with Avenue on regional council names.

::::::::With consistency the aim, we need to think more widely about other local govt divisions, such as the [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]], [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]], [[List of counties of New Zealand|counties]], etc. I'm not sure that "Province" was part of a proper name any more than "Region" is. The New Zealand Constitution Act [1852] said "The following Provinces are hereby established in New Zealand; namely, Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, ...". Would [[Auckland Province]] be renamed [[Auckland province]] or [[Auckland (province)]] or whatever? Likewise would [[Waikato District]] become [[Waikato district]] or [[Waikato (district)]]? Should [[Cook County, New Zealand]] be [[Cook county]] or [[Cook (county)]]? [[User:Nurg|Nurg]] ([[User talk:Nurg|talk]]) 21:11, 14 December 2012 (UTC)
:::::::::I'd like to see consistency combined with brevity for the regions. Any articles about the councils themselves should use their official names (and let the text and redirects cover any trading names). Cities and districts are called "City of ..." etc in legal documents, as were counties, so there's no legal requirement to prefer "Porirua City" over "Porirua city" and sentence case is the overall standard. U.S. county pages are "... County, ''State''" but we surely needn't follow that. It's a small step to suggest that our "region" pages could match the "case" of whatever we agree for the cities and districts.

::::::::::For the sake of simplicity, I support Daveosaurus' suggestion, but also taking into account Liveste's option when a disambig is required. 
::::::::::*For regions with no disambig issues, a simple '''Manawatu-Wanganui''', '''Otago''', '''Waikato''', '''Marlborough''' etc.
::::::::::*For regions with simple disambig issues involving only other NZ-related articles (such as Auckland, Wellington, [[Taranaki]] and Gisborne) '''Auckland (region)''', '''Gisborne (region)''' etc. 
::::::::::*For regions with wider (international) disambig issues on Wikipedia such as [[Northland]], [[Canterbury]] and [[Southland]],  '''Northland (New Zealand region)''', '''Canterbury (New Zealand region)''' etc.
::::::::::Queensland, Texas and New Zealand exist without further elaboration in the title; there is no reason to explain in the article namespace that Waikato is a region. I note that Nelson also appears in both the [[Template:Regions of New Zealand]] template and [[Regions of New Zealand]] article, yet the link directs to an article on the city. Is there in fact a Nelson region? If so, it should have an article of its own, no matter how brief. [[User:BlackCab|BlackCab]] ([[User talk:BlackCab|talk]]) 07:42, 12 January 2013 (UTC)

::::::::::: Nelson is a unitary authority, so the same organisation (the Nelson City Council) has the powers both of a City Council <i>and</i> of a Regional Council. (City councils' powers are what one would expect - local roads, water and sewerage, parks and reserves, etc. Regional councils are descended from the old Catchment Boards and organisations such as Pest Destruction Boards and a number of them have rebranded themselves to emphasise their oversight of water and air standards, so that, for example, the [[Canterbury Regional Council]] calls itself "Environment Canterbury".)
::::::::::: I honestly don't think a Nelson Region article needs to exist separately from the Nelson City Council other than as a redirect. A Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council did exist for a short time after 1989, when local government throughout New Zealand was reorganised, but within three years was split into four parts (Nelson, Tasman and Marlborough unitary authorities, and Kaikoura District, which became part of Canterbury Region). [[User:Daveosaurus|Daveosaurus]] ([[User talk:Daveosaurus|talk]]) 08:43, 12 January 2013 (UTC)

::::::::::::BlackCab says "For regions with no disambig issues, a simple Manawatu-Wanganui, Otago, Waikato, Marlborough etc" - come, Sir, I think you picked three poor examples out of four. "Manawatu-Wanganui" is the only good one. Otago, as mentioned above, includes many square kilometres of land that was put into the Canterbury region in 1989 for catchment reasons; it is therefore not the same as the Otago region, and the province was bigger still, including Fiordland and the south-western lakes. "Waikato" is a major river, a group of iwi, and a territorial authority district as well as a region; and Marlborough needs something to distinguish it from the surname or ducal title and several other overseas entities and from the province, which included Kaikoura.

[[Nelson Region]] currently redirects to [[Nelson, New Zealand]], which makes sense IMO. Waikato would need a disambiguator, as well; see [[Waikato (disambiguation)]]. I think the regional councils warrant individual articles, although named at "XXX Regional Council" for all of them (rather than "Environment XXX"). BlackCab's idea for regional disambiguation has merit, and it's probably more consistent with [[WP:DAB]]. I don't mind others, as well.

:A search for "Waikato" currently takes users to [[Waikato region]], which is the dominant subject. An <nowiki>{{About}}</nowiki> template to point to the [[Waikato (disambiguation)]] page should be sufficient there, which would allow the article about Waikato region to be simply titled '''Waikato'''.

===Proposal, December 2013===
There are 16 NZ regions listed at [[Template:Regions of New Zealand]]. Seven have the format '''Foo region'''. Eight have the format '''Foo Region'''. The odd one out is [[Nelson, New Zealand]], which actually is an article about the city (but also notes that it is the "economic and cultural centre of the Nelson region".)

Looking again at the options, the problems of ambiguity (either in a NZ sense or an international one) actually occur in ''most'' of those regions. The only ones for which there is definitely no ambiguity are '''Manawatu-Wanganui''' and '''Otago'''. I'd argue that '''Waikato''' is a third such case. There are other ''uses'' of Waikato, but these are covered under the disambig tag at the top of the article. It could be argued that Taranaki is a similar case and could be treated in exactly the same way, making the region the primary use of the name and a disambig tag at the top.

There are, then, two options:<br>
(1) Rename those three (or four) unambiguous articles by their region name only: ie, Waikato, Manawatu-Wanganui and Otago, and the remainder '''Foo (region)'''.<br>
(2) Rename all 16 articles '''Foo (region)'''.

For ease in searching for them, my preference would be No.1. Creating an article naming consistency by appending "(region)" would be tidy, but not really helpful. Few people would search for "Otago region". They would want the article on Otago, the region. I would ''oppose'' a naming convention of Foo region. No one refers to "Taranaki region" or "Marlborough region"; it's "Taranaki" and "Marlborough" and the use of parantheses makes it clear this is for a disambiguation purpose only.

I invite comments. [[User:BlackCab|BlackCab]] ([[User talk:BlackCab|talk]]) 22:09, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
:I'd go with (2), personally. Notes: (a) [[Auckland Region]] is not a proper name any more, it's now just [[Auckland]]; (b) [[Waikato]] is not unambiguous, due to the existence of [[Waikato_(iwi)]] (the Tainui is a modern disambiguator). [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 01:06, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
::[[Waikato (iwi)]] and [[Waikato (New Zealand electorate)]] could both theoretically lay claim to the article name "Waikato" — the river and sporting teams would obviously have more specific names. However the iwi article is currently a one-line stub, so I'd suggest that per [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]], it would be appropriate to name the article on the Waikato region simply "Waikato" and retain the current disambig line at the top of the article, which links to [[Waikato (disambiguation)]]. 
::Could you please elaborate on your point about Auckland, Stuart? This discussion is aimed at removing such titles as "Auckland Region", but according to the articles, [[Auckland]] is the metro area, while the [[Auckland Region]] article refers to a wider area.
