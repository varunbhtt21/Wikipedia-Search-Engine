Contested Prod. Very clearly doesn't meet WP:NVG. [[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 11:14, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Comment''' A Google search for ''talon video game'' finds mostly [[League of Legends]]-related content. --[[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 11:17, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
* '''Delete'''-I've been watching this for a while considering a afd as well-I have yet to find a page anywhere-Gamefaqs does not even have a page. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:04, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I can't find any sources to demonstrate notability, which means a [[WP:GNG]] failure. Perhaps once (if) the game releases, it will generate some coverage and become notable, but it isn't now. [[User:Novusuna|Novusuna]] <sup>[[User_talk:Novusuna|talk]]</sup> 21:09, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - There seems to be no RS coverage of the topic at all. That said, carpet-bombing the article with cleanup templates is kind of a cheap way to give it a black eye... These should be put together under a [[:Template:Multiple issues|"Multiple issues" template]]. -[[User:Thibbs|Thibbs]] ([[User talk:Thibbs|talk]]) 11:36, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*:Sorry, I got a bit lazy because usually Twinkle does that automatically.  Fixed! --[[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 09:01, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
