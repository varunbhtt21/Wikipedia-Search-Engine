'''Charles Meymott Tidy''' (1843–1892) was an English medical man and sanitary chemist, a barrister who wrote also on legal matters.

==Life==
Born on 2 February 1843, he was the son of William Callender Tidy, a physician in [[South Hackney]] and his wife, Charlotte Meymott. After private schools he went to the Hackney Church of England school, and then entered as a student at the [[London Hospital]] under [[Henry Letheby]], becoming M.R.C.S. and L.S.A. in 1864.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Tidy, Charles Meymott|volume=56}}</ref>

In 1865 Tidy entered the [[University of Aberdeen]], and in 1866 graduated C.M. and M.B. with the highest honours. On his return to London he took up his father's medical practice at Hackney, and continued in practice for about ten years. During this period he was also associated at the London Hospital with Letheby, as joint lecturer in chemistry, and became interested in questions of sanitary reform and [[public health]]. On the death of Letheby in 1876 Tidy succeeded to his appointments as professor of chemistry, [[medical jurisprudence]], and public health, and later was [[called to the bar]] and appointed reader in medical jurisprudence to the [[Inns of Court]].<ref name="DNB"/>

Tidy also became public analyst and deputy medical officer of health for the City of London, medical officer of health for Islington, and official analyst to the [[Home Office]].<ref name="DNB"/> At the trial of [[Florence Maybrick]], he testified that he had attended nearly 1000 [[post mortem]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernard Ryan|title=The Poisoned LIfe of Mrs. Maybrick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAMdwFKzHQcC&pg=PT196|date=1 March 2000|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-00095-1|page=196}}</ref>

In 1881 Tidy was appointed by the London water companies, with [[William Odling]] and [[William Crookes]], to examine the quality of the water supplied to the metropolis. He died at his residence in London on 15 March 1892.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Works==
Tidy gained a reputation and a large practice as an expert in [[water supply]] and the [[treatment of sewage]]. In 1879 he published a paper on ''The Processes for determining the Organic Purity of Potable Waters'' (Journal of the Chemical Society, 1879, p.&nbsp;46), in which he proposed a modification of [[Johan Georg Forchhammer]]'s original process for determining the amount of organic matter in waters by oxidation with [[potassium permanganate]]. This method was adopted by water analysts, and became known as "Tidy's process". In 1880 he published a major paper ''River Water'' (''Journ. Chem. Soc.'' 1880, p.&nbsp;268).<ref name="DNB"/>
