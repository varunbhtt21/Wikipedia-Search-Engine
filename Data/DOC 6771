Dr '''Qwominer William Osborne''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (usually referred to as '''Q.W. Osborne''' or '''William Osborne''') was a [[politician]] and [[physician]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]].
  
His political career started in the [[1963 British Virgin Islands general election|1963 general election]], when he was elected to the seat for the 5th District.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |page=69 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Prior to 1967 elections to the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands]] were on a non-party basis, and legislators who were elected governed collectively.

However, the [[1967 British Virgin Islands general election|1967 general election]] introduced [[party politics]] into the British Virgin Islands, and Osborne founded and became leader of the [[VI Democratic Party]].  Ultimately that party would come second in the election to the [[United Party (British Virgin Islands)|BVI United Party]] led by [[Hamilton Lavity Stoutt|Lavity Stoutt]]. Osborne thereby became the first ever [[Leader of the Opposition (British Virgin Islands)|Leader of the Opposition in the British Virgin Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |page=73 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the subsequent [[1971 British Virgin Islands general election|1971 general election]] led his party to the highest number of overall seats, but short of an outright majority.  Faced with potentially ruling as a [[minority government]], he formed a coalition with independent candidate [[Willard Wheatley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |page=77 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  However, Wheatley required that he be made [[Premier of the British Virgin Islands|Chief Minister]], and Osborne agreed. Osborne was appointed Minister for Natural Resources and Public Health.

The subsequent administration appeared not to be a happy one, possibly driven apart by Osborne's own desire to be Chief Minister{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}.  Wheatley removed Osborne from his Ministerial post in 1972.  The VI Democratic Party splintered, and officially offered no contestants in the [[1975 British Virgin Islands general election|1975 general election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |page=78 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Osborne stood as an independent candidate and was re-elected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |page=80 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Willard Wheatley threw his lot in with the BVI United Party and won, forming a new coalition government and remaining as Chief Minister.

Osborne ran again in the [[1979 British Virgin Islands general election|1979 general election]], but was easily defeated by [[Cyril Romney]] and retired for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |title=BVI election and information results 1950–2011 |publisher=BVI Deputy Governor's Office |page=85 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063531/http://216.197.123.192/Portals/0/Forms/Election%20Information%20and%20Results%201950-2011.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  In that election he was the only candidate who stood for the VI Democratic Party (by then referred to simply as the Democratic Party), and after his defeat the party ceased to exist. Osborne would later come out of retirement to run one more time, in 1986, but garnered barely any electoral support and lost by a wide margin.
