==Work==
Savo Gjirja graduated as a mechanical engineer at Tirana's University, Faculty of Engineering in 1969. In September 1972 he was appointed a lecturer of the scientific teaching staff at the same Engineering Faculty. From 1979 to 1983 he worked and studied as a researcher in the Department of Energy Conversion at the University of Technology "Chalmers" of Gothenburg, Sweden, where he defended his PhD dissertation. Four years later, Savo returned to Albania and began work at the Polytechnic University of Tirana, where he was appointed in charge of the Machinery department at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (1984). During this time he led the scientific and educational process of the department. For his work, the Higher Attestation Commission awarded him the title of Professor in 1987, while the Presidium of the Albanian National Assembly honoured him by awarding the Order "Naim Frashëri"

In 1991 Gjirja was invited by the Swedish Institute and the Department of "Thermo and Fluid Dynamics" at Chalmers University of Technology to collaborate with other scientists on further research to develop methods of using ethanol as an alternative engine fuel. He is the author of several scientific publications and has participated in various international conferences. In 2012, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Albania's independence, the Town Hall of the Kavaja city honored him with the title of "City Gratitude". Another passion of Savo is his love for literature. He wrote his first poem at the age of 15.
