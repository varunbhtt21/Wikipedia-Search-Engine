a community radio station based in [[Augusta, Western Australia]], 45&nbsp;km south of Margaret River in the states South West. Transmitting from the Augusta Community Resource Centre in Allnutt Terrace the station is run by volunteers from the Augusta Community. Broadcasting on the FM frequency 97.1MHZ and sponsored by local businesses around the Augusta region, the station offers a variety of music including song's from the 40's and 50's up to the current Top 40. On the stations web site there is also and option to listen online through streaming over the Internet.

==History==
The concept came about as a result of the frustration with the lack of local content on the very few radio stations broadcasting to the Augusta region. Attempts to acquire a frequency for the station to operate on, were met with issues due to the fact the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) specified that all the frequencies were being used by other local TV providers. The founders of the station pushed on with support of local communities, and after initially requesting the frequency 99.9MHZ the ACMA assigned 97.1MHZ for a community radio station in Augusta. With the help of donations from Lottery West, a local couple from the Augusta area and the South West Development Commission, 2 Oceans FM started broadcast during 2009.
