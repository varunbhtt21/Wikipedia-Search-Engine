Title : Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index
Text : The '''Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index''' (BRTI Index) is a synthetic measure combining [[rail transportation]] metrics (existence of modern rail networks and average speed of main inter-urban itineraries) and [[cost efficiency]] observations, used as an indicator a country’s relative development in modern land transportation.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.academia.edu/6494981/Transportation_Infrastructure_and_Country_Attractiveness| work= Revue Analyse Financière| location=Paris | title= Transportation Infrastructure and Country Attractiveness| first= M.

The index was first developed by [[World Pensions & Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] [[financial economist]]s within a cross-country comparative framework that included ten key jurisdictions: the UK, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, the US, and Brazil.

The relative advancement of a nation’s (rail) transportation infrastructure can also be measured using a more refined model called (Modified) Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index: ‘(M) RTI’ or simply ‘RTI’, whereby cost-efficiency is given more weight (x2) than average speed (x1), thus allowing for more robust cross-country comparisons   <ref>M.
