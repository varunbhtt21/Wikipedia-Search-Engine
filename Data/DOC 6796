In 2015, ''Newsweek'' mentioned Matarazzo in an article on the involvement of APA officials in U.S. interrogation programs and torture. When psychologists had complained about the involvement of their profession in such interrogation programs, Matarazzo had authored a memo stating that sleep deprivation did not amount to torture. He later held owned shares in a company that had designed the interrogation programs.<ref name=Newsweek>{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Rupert|title=Leading psychologists secretly aided U.S. torture program|url=http://www.newsweek.com/torture-cia-american-psychological-association-defense-department-352728|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=July 11, 2015|date=July 10, 2015}}</ref>
