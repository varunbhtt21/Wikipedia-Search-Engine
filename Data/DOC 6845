| ShortSummary    = The lively atmosphere of Soubu High School begins dissipating after the events of the recent festivals and the focus shifts to an upcoming field-trip to [[Kyoto]]. While the Service Club discuss the trip, they are rudely interrupted by Hayato Hayama and Kakeru Tobe, who request that they help the latter in a [[Dating|romantic pursuit]] of Hina Ebina. Hachiman Hikigaya decides to accept the request and outlines the risks of asking a girl out before they try to discern Kakeru's favorable traits. The following day, Yui Yuigahama outlines a plan to utilize the field-trip for the request until Hina interrupts them. Hina remarks about the [[Group dynamics#Intragroup dynamics|evolving relationships]] of her [[peer group]] and further adds her support for Hachiman to become more sociable. Eventually, the Soubu High students arrive in Kyoto, and Hachiman and Yui make little progress in assisting Kakeru with Hina. Afterwards, Hachiman gives Yukino Yukinoshita a progress report on the request. However, when they spot Shizuka Hiratsuka attempting to sneak out of the hotel, the latter convinces them to keep her nightly escapade under wraps and sends them off with some words of reassurance. Eventually, the first day of the field-trip ends with Hachiman escorting Yukino back to the hotel.

| ShortSummary    = On the second day of the Kyoto trip, Hachiman runs into Yumiko Miura at a convenience store and learns that Hina had rejected every one of her romantic suitors, with Yumiko voicing her content in the current status of their peer group. The Soubu students arrive in [[Arashiyama]] the next day and Hayato uncharacteristically confides in Hachiman about his [[Myopia|myopic fears]] on the consequences that Kakeru's confession will have on the integrity of their peer group. Hayato then reluctantly tasks Hachiman with saving it. As the Soubu students quietly observe Kakeru's confession to Hina later that night, Hachiman once again risks his [[Reputation#Reputation-based decisions|reputation]] by interrupting them and faking a confession to Hina. Hina rejects him and explains her desire to be single for the time being before running off. Kakeru then thanks Hachiman for saving him from the embarrassment of rejection before leaving with Hayato and the others. Despite Hachiman saving a peer group from imploding, Yukino voices her disgust at his choice of action and Yui tearfully yells at him for failing to see how his unorthodox problem solving methods hurt those who care about him. The next day, Hina thanks Hachiman for fulfilling her request in saving the [[status quo]] of her peer group.

| ShortSummary    = School resumes and the students of 2F ignore the events of the field-trip and continue their [[My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU|normal interactions]]—in contrast to the stark tension between Hachiman and Yukino in the Service Club. Meguri Shiromeguri and Isshiki Iroha interrupt the club and request their aid in helping Isshiki lose the upcoming Student Council president election, since she was nominated against her will in a prank. Hachiman then proposes an idea that would solve the request via [[Motion of no confidence|censure motion]] against Isshiki. This method only serves to infuriate Yukino and her [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] once again clashes with the [[lateral thinking]] of Hachiman. Afterwards, Yukino has Shizuka determine the status of the club contest and Shizuka also reminds Hachiman of the dangers of his methods. Much to his dismay, after school, Hachiman runs into Haruno Yukinoshita along with his middle school acquaintances Kaori Orimoto and Chika Nakamachi. At the next Service Club meeting, Hachiman chastises Yukino for developing a plan that fails to account for future complications should Isshiki get elected and argues that his plan bypasses the extra effort to solve said complications. Yukino then reproaches Hachiman for his methods, which prompts him to walk out on the club meeting. Later on, Isshiki goes after Hachiman and expresses her concern over the state of the Service Club, but he promises that they will figure something out.

| ShortSummary    = Hayato invites Hachiman to hang out with Kaori, Chika and himself one weekend but Hachiman unsurprisingly declines, only to reconsider after [[Peer pressure|pressuring]] from Haruno. The four of them eventually go out one afternoon and the Kaihin girls continuously poke fun at the expense of Hachiman. The evening eventually builds to a climax at a local café when Hayato sharply defends Hachiman's [[integrity]] from the girls. Afterwards, Yukino voices her disapproval for being deceived by Hayato into aiding his point to the girls instead of discussing the election and Haruno only adds fuel to the fire after observing the entire episode. In the aftermath, Hayato apologizes for creating an uncomfortable situation since he had only intended to get Hachiman to see the error of his [[Self-denial|self-sacrificial methods]]. This offends Hachiman to the point where he argues that the consequences of his choices are his alone and should not be the concern of others. The next day, Yukino decides to enter the election against Isshiki as a solution for her request. Since this effectively jeopardizes the future of the Service Club should Yukino emerge victorious, Yui also decides to enter the election in an attempt to preserve the Service Club should she win. The choices of his club members however, leaves Hachiman with a feeling of uneasiness.

| ShortSummary    = Hachiman decides to confide in his sister Komachi Hikigaya about the recent events and she gives him some words of encouragement before requesting that he find a way to keep both Yukino and Yui in the Service Club. The next afternoon, Hachiman meets with Yoshiteru Zaimokuza, Saika Totsuka, Saki Kawasaki and Komachi to brainstorm ideas for handling the student council election. They help Hachiman realize that his initial censure motion proposal was wrong since it would have damaged the only thing that Isshiki cares about, her [[self-image]]. Hachiman then has Saki draw up a list of potential candidates and further has Yoshiteru use the names to create an anonymous [[Social media#Twitter|social media campaign]]. The following day, Hachiman manages to convince Isshiki into accepting the presidential position by using a combination of the social media statistics and  clever [[reverse psychology]] to highlight its perks. Hachiman later presents the statistics to Yui and Yukino but does not tell them about how he [[Social media mining|falsely mined the data]], using it only as a means to convince the pair that they need not run anymore since Isshiki would win. Yui then thanks Hachiman with a small understanding for his method. Isshiki eventually wins the election by default due to having no competition as it originally was and life moves on once again.

| ShortSummary    = The Service Club tries harder to maintain their usual atmosphere after the recent events. This causes Hachiman to try to maintain this charade with his fellow club members by becoming more sociable with them after observing Hayato's peer group. Isshiki eventually interrupts the club and asks them to help the Student Council plan a joint Christmas event with Kaihin General. When Yukino grows tense however, Hachiman decides to reject the request on behalf of the club and instead takes it on as a personal favor to Isshiki in order to maintain the facade of normalcy with Yukino. Later that day, Hachiman meets with the Soubu and Kaihin Student Councils at the local community center to begin planning the event. While Hachiman has difficulty following the [[jargon]] of the Kaihin brainstorms, Isshiki unwaveringly accepts their thoughts based on nothing more than their official presentation, much to the dismay of her fellow Soubu members. The next day, Hachiman tries communicating an idea in the Kaihin [[gibberish]] but it backfires and gets doubly misinterpreted in the [[Communication#Noise|organizational noise]]. Making no progress at the end of the day, Kaori catches up with Hachiman and mockingly laughs at him when she learns of his membership to the Service Club.

| ShortSummary    = Yui laments on the state of the Service Club one afternoon before Hachiman later goes looking for Isshiki when she fails to arrive at the Kaihin-Soubu meeting. This lands him in an involuntary discussion with Hayato about their reactions to helping others. Isshiki later arrives and they discover that Tamanawa had outsourced some of the work to grade-schoolers. Hachiman then tries to get Tamanawa to begin weighing and eliminating possible ideas but he explains that everyone should have an idea somehow baked into the Christmas event. An unexpected encounter with Saika later makes Hachiman question his preconceived ideal for helping others. At the next meeting, Hachiman realizes that he had been made the virtual head of the Soubu council. This prompts him to once again try to get Tamanawa to narrow the ideas so that Isshiki can have a better understanding of what to do. Hachiman then assists Rumi Tsurumi with finishing the decorations and ponders on how his previous methods have affected others. Hachiman later runs into Yukino and while knowing that he had been assisting Isshiki with her request, she explains that he does not have to simultaneously look out for herself and Yui and offers a [[leave of absence]] from club activities to relieve him of that burden.

Shizuka gets right to his [[Emotion#Situated perspective on emotion|root emotional problem]] by explaining that his attempts to protect Yukino and Yui had in fact been the very cause of the rift within the Service Club. She then suggests that he contemplate his feelings until he figures out exactly what he had been trying to achieve. The following day, Hachiman takes Shizuka's advice and asks for Yui and Yukino's assistance after admitting the mess his plans had created. Yukino declines per her usual [[Trait theory|defensive trait]] and Yui tearfully highlights her unfairness to open up, but Yukino retorts by chastising Yui for hiding her true feelings as well. Hachiman then comes to the realization about what Shizuka had meant by not simply voicing one's feelings and fights back tears when he reveals that he truly wishes to understand the feelings of those around him. Hachiman's unfamiliar presentation then causes a conflict with Yukino's inability to discern a person's true emotional state which literally scares her off to the roof. Hachiman and Yui go after her and Yui's mutual sentiment for them to be more open with each other resonates with Yukino so much that she decides to help Hachiman.

| ShortSummary    = Hachiman fills Yukino and Yui in with the details of the next Kaihin-Soubu meeting before attending with Isshiki. This allows Yukino to witness first hand the disastrous state of the Christmas event preparations and the four decide to seek further guidance from Shizuka. Shizuka decides to encourage brainstorming ideas with tickets for a Christmas-themed event at the Destiny Land [[amusement park]] and Yui brings along Hayato, Yumiko, Hina and Kakeru for the outing. The group starts out the event by taking some pictures immediately followed by a space-themed ride and a panda bear-themed ride where Hachiman observes Isshiki's attempts to flirt with Hayato. The Service Club then takes a break at a gift shop to pick out presents for Komachi and Yui takes the opportunity to poke at her feelings for Hachiman. Hachiman and Yukino eventually get separated from the others on their way to another ride and Yukino opens up more to him about her relationship with Haruno. She explains that she would often think about the good traits that Haruno possesses and why she does not and further extends this train of thought to include Hachiman. They eventually meet up with the others for the fireworks show and with everyone distracted, Hachiman notices Isshiki and Hayato after which the former runs away in tears.

| ShortSummary    = Isshiki forces Hachiman to take her home after her rejection by Hayato and reveals that his recent outburst in the Service Club had prompted her to act prematurely. Hachiman has the Student Council meet with the Service Club some time later and proposes that they adamantly push for a drastic change in the Kaihin-Soubu meeting to prevent a disaster in the Christmas event. The Soubu students then try this tactic at the next meeting and when Tamanawa shoots them down, Hachiman calls them out on their fear of responsibility coupled with their inability to perform under said responsibility as further proposed by Yukino. This has the desired effect and they soon settle on a musical rendition and stage play. Finally on the day of the Christmas event, Isshiki takes charge and the event turns out a huge success. The Service Club go out to celebrate the [[Japanese New Year|New Year]] a week later and Hachiman gives Yukino some advice to spend the season with her family. Hachiman and Yui go shopping for Yukino's birthday the next day and run into Haruno and Hayato while waiting on their parents. Haruno then calls Yukino over from home, much to her annoyance. Her strained familial ties are expressed when her mother arrives.

| ShortSummary    = The senior students begin thinking about specializing their fields of study towards Liberal Arts during the new semester but quickly focus their attention on a rumor about [[Social relation|relations]] between Yukino and Hayato. This prompts Yumiko to visit the Service Club where she tearfully exposes a [[Separation anxiety disorder|fear of growing apart]] from Hayato since he had chosen not to share his future plans with their peer group. Hachiman then tries and fails in both directly confronting Hayato about his choice and indirectly from Haruno when she shows up at Soubu High to assist the Student Council. Hachiman eventually decides to use the Annual Winter Event Marathon Race to his advantage by using the stress of the event to goad Hayato into choosing Sciences. This unexpectedly causes Hayato's [[inferiority complex]] towards Hachiman to surface and he decides to do the opposite of the latter's words. Hayato eventually wins the marathon and dispels the rumor when he thanks Yumiko and Isshiki for their support. He also apologizes to Yukino for the rumor at the after-party. Hayato eventually tells Hachiman that he did not want to reveal his choice since the status quo of his peer group would have taken it entirely out of his hands and hence hurt his pride in deciding for himself.

| ShortSummary    = Haruno intercepts the Service Club on their way home one afternoon and lambastes Yukino for failing to make life choices on her own despite the immense freedom the Yukinoshita family has allowed her. Yui then allows Yukino to spend the night at the Yuigahama residence until things between the Yukinoshita sisters cool down. While Komachi heads out to her Soubu Entrance Examinations the next day, Yui invites Hachiman and Yukino out to the [[Kasai Rinkai Park]] where they spend the day at the aquarium and bond over their respective personalities while observing the various aquatic life. The three then share a reaction to the bonds of a pair of [[Humboldt penguin|penguins]] and Yukino makes an allusion to her strained [[Belongingness|sense of belonging]]. Yui eventually states the true reason she called them out and as the day draws to a close, she uses her initial Service Club request to claim responsibility for the fractured bonds between them and further requests that they continue feigning their blissful status quo. However, Hachiman interjects that it would be better to suffer in their uncertainty rather than live in a deception, and the girls decide to accept his compromise.
