The '''Indo-European migrations''' were the migrations of [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|speakers]], as proposed by contemporary scholarship, and the subsequent migrations of people speaking further developed [[Indo-European languages]], which explains why the [[Indo-European languages]] are spoken in a large area from India and Iran to Europe.

Modern scholarly understanding of these migrations depends on a synthesis of data from [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]] and [[genetics]]. [[Comparative linguistics]] describes the similarities between various languages and the linguistic laws at play in the [[Language change|changes]] in those languages (see [[Indo-European studies]]). Archaeological data traces the spread of cultures presumed to be created by speakers of Proto-Indo-European in several stages: from the hypothesized locations of the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], into their later locations [[Western Europe]], [[Central Asia|Central]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Eastern Asia]] by migrations and by language shift through élite-recruitment as described by anthropological research.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Beckwith| 2009}} Recent genetic research has increasingly contributed to understanding of the relations between various prehistoric cultures.

According to the widely held [[Kurgan hypothesis]], c.q. renewed Steppe hypothesis, the earliest proto-Indo-European speech community was identical with the archeological [[Yamnaya]] culture, and other related cultures in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]], around 4000 BCE. Their descendants spread throughout [[Europe]] and parts of [[Asia]], forming new cultures with the people they met on their way, including the [[Corded Ware culture]] in [[Northern Europe]] and the [[Vedic culture]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. These migrations ultimately seeded the cultures and languages of most of Europe, [[Greater Iran]], and much of the Indian subcontinent (and subsequently resulted in the largest and most broadly-spoken language-family in the world).

[[Proto-Celtic]] and [[Proto-Italic]] probably developed in and spread from Central Europe into western Europe after new Yamnaya migrations into the Danube Valley,{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp= 108 f.}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp= 345, 361–367}} while [[Proto-Germanic]] and [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]] may have developed east of the Carpathian mountains, in present-day Ukraine,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp= 368, 380}} moving north and spreading with the [[Corded Ware culture]] in Middle Europe (third millennium BCE).{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp= 108, 244–250}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p= 360}}{{r|group= web|Baldia06}}{{sfn|Haak|2015}}{{r|group= web|MPG_mass_migration}}{{r|group= web|Nature_EC}} Alternatively, a European branch of Indo-European dialects, termed "North-west Indo-European" and associated with the Beaker culture, may have been ancestral to not only Celtic and Italic, but also to Germanic and Balto-Slavic.<ref name="Mallory (2013)"/>

The [[Indo-Iranian language]] and culture probably emerged within the [[Sintashta culture]] (circa 2100–1800 BCE), at the eastern border of the [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya horizon]] and the Corded Ware culture, growing into the Andronovo culture (ca. 1800–800 BCE).{{sfn|Witzel|1998}}{{sfn|Witzel|2003}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Kuzmina|2007}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015}}{{sfn|Narasimhan et al.|2018}} Indo-Aryans moved into the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]] (ca. 2400–1600 BCE) and spread to the Levant ([[Mitanni]]), [[northern India]] ([[Vedic people]], ca. 1500 BCE), and [[China]] ([[Wusun]]).{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} The [[Iranian languages]] spread throughout the steppes with the [[Scyths]] and into [[Iran]] with the [[Medes]], [[Parthian language|Parthians]] and [[Persians]] from ca. 800 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith| 2009}}

A number of alternative theories have been proposed. Renfrew's [[Anatolian hypothesis]] suggests a much earlier date for the Indo-European languages, proposing an origin in [[Anatolia]] and an initial spread with the earliest farmers who migrated to Europe. It has been the only serious alternative for the steppe-theory, but suffers from a lack of explanatory power. The Anatolian hypothesis also led to some support for the [[Armenian hypothesis]], which proposes that the urheimat of the Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus. While the Armenian hypothesis has been cricitized on archeological and chronological grounds, recent genetic research has led to a renewed interest. The [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory]] suggests paleolithic origins, but has received very little interest in mainstream scholarship. The [[Indigenous Aryans|Out of India]] theory is a [[fringe theory]] propagated by Indian nationalists, which has no support in scholarship.

The similarities between various European languages, Sanskrit and Persian were noted by Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] in his ''Third Anniversary Discourse'' to the [[Asiatic Society]] in 1786, after learning Sanskrit in India, concluding that all these languages originated from the same source.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=7}}<ref group=web>[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/histling.html Jonathan Slocum, ''What is Historical Linguistics?

====Development of the Indo-European languages====
=====Proto-Indo-European language=====
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European language}}

The Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the [[linguistic reconstruction]] of a common ancestor of the [[Indo-European languages]] spoken by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. PIE was the first proposed [[proto-language]] to be widely accepted by linguists. Far more work has gone into reconstructing it than any other proto-language and it is by far the most well-understood of all proto-languages of its age. During the 19th century, the vast majority of linguistic work was devoted to reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European or its [[Daughter language|daughter]] proto-languages such as [[Proto-Germanic]], and most of the current techniques of [[historical linguistics]] (e.&nbsp;g. the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]) were developed as a result.

Scholars estimate that PIE may have been spoken as a single language (before divergence began) around 3500 BCE, though estimates by different authorities can vary by more than a millennium. The most popular hypothesis for the origin and spread of the language is the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], which postulates an origin in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] of Eastern Europe.

The existence of PIE was first postulated in the 18th century by Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], who observed the similarities between [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Latin language|Latin]]. By the early 20th century, well-defined descriptions of PIE had been developed that are still accepted today (with some refinements). The largest developments of the 20th century have been the discovery of Anatolian and [[Tocharian languages]] and the acceptance of the [[laryngeal theory]].  The Anatolian languages have also spurred a major re-evaluation of theories concerning the development of various shared Indo-European language features and the extent to which these features were present in PIE itself.

PIE is thought to have had a complex system of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that included [[Fusional language|inflections]] (suffixing of roots, as in ''who, whom, whose''), and [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (vowel alterations, as in ''sing, sang, sung''). Nouns used a sophisticated system of [[declension]] and verbs used a similarly sophisticated system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]].

Relationships to other language families, including the [[Uralic languages]], have been proposed but remain controversial. There is no written evidence of Proto-Indo-European, so all knowledge of the language is derived by reconstruction from later languages using linguistic techniques such as the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]].

=====Pre-Proto-Indo-European=====
The [[Indo-Hittite]] hypothesis postulates a common predecessor for both the Anatolian languages and the other Indo-European languages, called Indi-Hittite or Indo-Anatolian.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Although it is obvious that PIE had predecessors,{{sfn|Anthony|Ridge|2015}} the Indo-Hittite hypothesis is not widely accepted, and there is little to suggest that it is possible to reconstruct a proto-Indo-Hittite stage that differs substantially from what is already reconstructed for PIE.

A shared common ancestor of Indo-European and Uralic, [[Indo-Uralic]], has been postulated as a possible pre-PIE.{{sfn|Kortlandt|2010}} According to Kortlandt, "Indo-European is a branch of Indo-Uralic which was radically transformed under the influence of a North Caucasian substratum when its speakers moved from the area north of the Caspian Sea to the area north of the Black Sea."{{sfn|Kortlandt|2010}}{{refn|group=note|Kortlandt (2010) refers to Kortlandt, Frederik. 2007b. ''C. C. Uhlenbeck on Indo-European, Uralic and Caucasian.'' Several variants and elaborations of this theory exist:
* The "Sogdiana hypothesis" of [[Johanna Nichols]] places the homeland in the fourth or fifth millennium BCE to the east of the [[Caspian Sea]], in the area of ancient [[Bactria]]-[[Sogdiana]].{{sfn|Nichols|1997}}{{sfn|Nichols|1999}} 
* According to [[Allan R. Bomhard]], "Proto-Indo-European is the result of the imposition of a Eurasiatic language – to use Greenberg's term – on a population speaking one or more primordial Northwest Caucasian languages."<ref group=web>Allan Bomhard, [https://www.academia.edu/10261406/The_Origins_of_Proto-Indo-European_The_Caucasian_Substrate_Hypothesis_revised_November_2016_ ''The Origins of Proto-Indo-European: The Caucasian Substrate Hypothesis (revised November 2016)'']. Paper presented at "The Precursors of Proto-Indo-European: the Indo-Hittite and Indo-Uralic Hypotheses", a 2015 workshop at the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics, Leiden, The Netherlands, 9—11 July 2015.</ref> See also ''The Origins of Proto-Indo-European: The Caucasian Substrate Hypothesis''.<ref>[http://eurogenes.blogspot.nl/2015/05/the-origins-of-proto-indo-european.html The Origins of Proto-Indo-European: The Caucasian Substrate Hypothesis'']</ref>
* According to Bernard Sergent, the lithic assemblage of the first [[Kurgan culture]] in [[Ukraine]] (Sredni Stog II), which originated from the [[Volga Delta|Volga]] and [[Ural region|South Urals]], recalls that of the [[Mesolithic]]-[[Neolithic]] sites to the east of the [[Caspian sea]], [[Dam Dam Chesme II]] and the [[Cave of Dzhebel|cave of Djebel]].<ref>See [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Dzhebel Dzhebel], and V. A. Ranov and R. S. Davis (1979), ''[http://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=anth_pubs Toward a New Outline of the Soviet Central Asian Paleolithic]''</ref> He places the roots of Gimbutas' Kurgan cradle of Indo-Europeans in a more southern cradle, and adds that the Djebel material is related to a [[Paleolithic]] material of [[Northwestern Iran]], the [[Zarzian culture]], dated 10,000–8,500 BCE, and in the more ancient [[Kebarian]] of the [[Near East]]. He concludes that more than 10,000 years ago the Indo-Europeans were a small people grammatically, phonetically and lexically close to [[Semitic people|Semitic]]-[[Hamitic]] populations of the Near East.<ref>Bernard Sergent (1995), ''Les Indo-Européens – Histoire, langues, mythes''</ref>}}
Anthony states that the validity of such deep relationships cannot be reliably demonstrated due to the time-depth involved, and also notes that the similarities may be explained by borrowings from PIE into proto-Uralic.{{sfn|Anthony|Ridge|2015}} Yet, Anthony also notes that the North Caucasian communities "were southern participants in the steppe world".{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

=====Genesis of Indo-European languages=====
Using a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Don Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following evolutionary tree of Indo-European branches:{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=56–58}}
* [[Proto-Anatolian|Pre-Anatolian]] (before 3500 BCE)
* [[Proto-Tocharian|Pre-Tocharian]] 
* [[Proto-Celtic|Pre-Celtic]] and [[Proto-Italic|Pre-Italic]] (before 2500 BCE)
* <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Proto-Germanic|Pre-Germanic]]?]{{refn|group=note|name="Anthony2007_Germanic"|David Anthony: "Germanic shows a mixture of archaic and derived traits that make its place uncertain; it could have branched off at about the same time as the root of Italic and Celtic [but] it also shared many traits with Pre-Baltic and Pre-Slavic."{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=57}} Proto-Germanic dates from c. 500 BCE.{{sfn|Ringe|2006|p=67}}}}
* [[Proto-Armenian|Pre-Armenian]] and [[Proto-Greek language|Pre-Greek]] (after 2500 BCE)
* [Pre-Germanic?]{{refn|group=note|name="Anthony2007_Germanic"}}
* [[Proto-Balto-Slavic|Pre-Balto-Slavic]]{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=56–58}} 
* [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] (2000 BCE)

David Anthony, following the methodology of Ringe and Warnow, proposes the following sequence:{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=100}}
* Pre-Anatolian (4200 BCE)
* Pre-Tocharian (3700 BCE)
* Pre-Germanic (3300 BCE)
* Pre-Celtic and Pre-Italic (3000 BCE)
* Pre-Armenian (2800 BCE)
* Pre-Balto-Slavic (2800 BCE)
* Pre-Greek (2500 BCE)
* Proto-Indo-Iranian (2200 BCE); split between Iranian and Old Indic 1800 BCE

Ringe and Warnow's methodology may be outdated, and not accurately reflect the development of the IE languages.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Archaeology: migrations from the steppe Urheimat ===
[[File:Early Yamna.jpg|thumb|Location of early Yamnaya culture]]

Archaeological research has unearthed a broad range of historical cultures which can be related to the spread of the Indo-European languages. Various steppe-cultures show strong similarities with the Yamna-horizon at the Pontic steppe, while the time-range of several Asian cultures also coincides with the proposed trajectory and time-range of the Indo-European migrations.{{sfn|Mallory|1999}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

According to the widely accepted [[Kurgan hypothesis]] or ''Steppe theory'', the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European language]] and [[Proto-Indo-European culture|culture]] spread in several stages from the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Urheimat]] in the [[Eurasia]]n [[Pontic steppes]] into [[Western Europe]], [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]], through folk migrations and so-called elite recruitment.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} This process started with the introduction of cattle at the Eurasian steppes around 5200 BCE, and the mobilisation of the steppe herder cultures with the introduction of wheeled wagons and horse-back riding, which led to a new kind of culture. Between 4,500 and 2,500 BCE, this "horizon", which includes several distinctive cultures, spread out over the Pontic steppes, and outside into Europe and Asia.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

Early migrations at ca. 4200 BCE brought steppe herders into the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|lower Danube valley]], either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}} According to Anthony, the Anatolian branch,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=43}} to which the [[Hittites]] belong,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=43–46}} probably arrived in Anatolia from the [[Danube]] valley.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=262}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=37–38}}{{r|group=web|EB_AnatLang}} According to Mathieson & Reich et al. (2017), it is unlikely that the Anatolian branch arrived in Anatolia via the Balkans.<ref name="Mathieson_2017">Mathieson, Reich et al. (2017), ''The Genomic History of Southeastern Europe''.</ref>

Migrations eastward from the Yamnaya culture founded the [[Afanasevo culture]]{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=4}} which developed into the [[Tocharians]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=101, 264–265}} The [[Tarim mummies]] may represent a migration of Tocharian speakers from the Afanasevo culture into the [[Tarim Basin]].{{sfn|Loewe|Shaughnessy|1999|pp=83–88}} Migrations southward may have founded the [[Maykop culture]],{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=372}} but the Maykop origins could also have been in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Ivanova|2012}}{{r|group=web|Excav_Soyu_Kurgans}}

The western Indo-European languages ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]]) probably spread into Europe from the [[Balkan–Danubian culture|Balkan-Danubian complex]], a set of cultures in [[Southeastern Europe]].{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp=108 f.}} At ca. 3000 BCE a migration of Proto-Indo-European speakers from the Yamna-culture took place toward the west, along the Danube river,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=345, 361–367}} [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] developed a little later at the middle [[Dniepr]] (present-day Ukraine),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=368, 380}} moving north toward the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=101}} The [[Corded Ware culture]] in Middle Europe (third millennium BCE),{{r|group=web|Baldia06}} which materialized with a massive migration from the Eurasian steppes to [[Central Europe]],{{sfn|Haak|2015}}{{r|group=web|MPG_mass_migration}}{{r|group=web|Nature_EC}} probably played a central role in the spread of the pre-Germanic and pre-Balto-Slavic dialects.{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp=108, 244–250}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=360}}

The eastern part of the Yamnaya horizon and the Corded Ware culture contributed to the [[Sintashta culture]] (c. 2100–1800 BCE), where the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language]] and culture emerged, and where the [[chariot]] was invented.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} The Indo-Iranian language and culture was further developed in the [[Andronovo culture]] (c. 1800–800 BCE), and influenced by the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]] (c. 2400–1600 BCE). The [[Indo-Aryans]] split off around 1800–1600 BCE from the Iranians,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} whereafter Indo-Aryan groups moved to the Levant ([[Mitanni]]), northern India ([[Vedic people]], c. 1500 BCE), and China ([[Wusun]]).{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} The Iranian languages spread throughout the steppes with the [[Scyths]] and into Iran with the [[Medes]], [[Parthian language|Parthians]] and [[Persians]] from ca. 800 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}}

According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], the process of "''Indo-Europeanization''" of Europe was essentially a cultural, not a physical transformation.{{sfn|Gimbutas|1997}} It is understood as a migration of [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya]] people to Europe, as military victors, successfully imposing a new administrative system, language and religion upon the indigenous groups, referred to by Gimbutas as ''Old Europeans''.{{sfn|Gimbutas|1997|p=240}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gimbutas"|According to Gimbutas, these indigenous groups existed for nearly three millennia (c. 6500–3500 BCE, during the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Copper ages), consisting notably of the [[Narva culture|Narva]], [[Funnelbeaker]], [[Linear Pottery]], [[Cardium pottery]], [[Vinča culture|Vinča]], early [[Helladic period#Early Helladic|Helladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cultures etc. As a "truncation" of these cultures Gimbutas perceived (1) the "abrupt absences" of certain traditions of [[urbanism]], [[pottery]] and [[visual arts]] as well as in "symbols and script" as well as (2) the "equally abrupt appearance of thrusting weapons and horses infiltrating the Danubian Valley and other major grasslands of the Balkans and Central Europe", initiating "a dramatic shift in the prehistory of Europe, a change in social structure and in residence patterns, in art and in religion" which was to be "a decisive factor in the formation of Europe's last 5,000 years."}} The [[Yamnaya]] people's social organization, especially a [[patrilinear]] and [[patriarchal]] structure, greatly facilitated their effectiveness in war.{{sfn|Gimbutas|1997|p=361}} According to Gimbutas, the social structure of ''Old Europe'' "contrasted with the Indo-European Kurgans who were mobile and non-egalitarian" with a hierarchically organised [[Trifunctional hypothesis|tripartite social structure]]; the IE were warlike, lived in smaller villages at times, and had an ideology that centered on the virile male, reflected also in their pantheon. In contrast, the indigenous groups of ''Old Europe'' had neither a warrior class nor horses.{{sfn|Gimbutas|1997|pp=241, 316}}{{refn|group=note|name="Old Europe"|''Old Europeans'' were sedentary-horticulturalist, living in "large agglomerations"&nbsp;– probably part of theocratic monarchies presided over by a queen-priestess&nbsp;– and had an ideology which "focused on the eternal aspects of birth, death, and regeneration, symbolized by the feminine principle, a mother creatrix"; they buried their dead in communal [[megalith]] graves and were generally peaceful.}}

According to Guus Kroonen, Indo-Europeans encountered existing populations that spoke dissimilar, unrelated languages when they migrated to [[Europe]] from Yamnaya steppes.{{sfn|Kroonen|2015}} Relatively little is known about the Pre-Indo-European linguistic landscape of Europe, except for [[Basque language|Basque]], as the ''Indo-Europeanization'' of Europe caused a largely unrecorded, massive linguistic extinction event, most likely through language-shift.{{sfn|Kroonen|2015}} Guus Kroonen's study reveals that PIE speech contains a clear Neolithic signature emanating from the [[Tyrsenian languages|Aegean language family]] and thus patterns with the prehistoric migration of Europe's first farming populations.<ref>{{citation|last=Kroonen |first=Guus |title=Pre-Indo-European speech carrying a Neolithic signature emanating from the Aegean|date=2015 |page=10 |url= http://www.shh.mpg.de/105702/Abstractbook_Draft_Oct_2nd.pdf}}</ref>

According to [[Edgar Charles Polomé|Edgar Polomé]], 30% of non-Indo-European substratum found in modern German derives from non-Indo-European-speakers of [[Funnelbeaker Culture]] indigenous to southern Scandinavia.{{sfn|Karlene|1996}} When [[Yamnaya]] Indo-European speakers came into contact with the indigenous peoples during the third millennium BCE, they came to dominate the local populations yet parts of the indigenous [[lexicon]] persisted in the formation of [[Proto-Germanic]], thus lending to the Germanic languages the status of ''Indo-Europeanized'' languages.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones-Bley |first=Karlene |title=The Indo-Europeanization of northern Europe: papers presented at the international conference held at the University of Vilnius, Vilnius, Lithuania|publisher=Institute for the Study of Man |date=1996 |page=171 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Kurgan_Culture_and_the_Indo_European.html?id=hCZmAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780941694568 }}</ref> According again to [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Corded Ware]] cultures migration to Scandinavia "synthesized" with the [[Funnelbeaker culture]], giving birth to the Proto-Germanic language.{{sfn|Gimbutas|1997}}

David Anthony, in his "revised Steppe hypothesis"{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|p=205}} notes that the spread of the Indo-European languages probably did not happen through "chain-type folk migrations", but by the introduction of these languages by ritual and political elites, which were emulated by large groups of people,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=117}}{{refn|group=note|name="Anthony_Language_shift"|David Anthony (1995): "Language shift can be understood best as a social strategy through which individuals and groups compete for positions of prestige, power, and domestic security […] What is important, then, is not just dominance, but vertical social mobility and a linkage between language and access to positions of prestige and power […] A relatively small immigrant elite population can encourage widespread language shift among numerically dominant indigenes in a non-state or pre-state context if the elite employs a specific combination of encouragements and punishments. Ethnohistorical cases […] demonstrate that small elite groups have successfully imposed their languages in non-state situations."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=27}}}} a process which he calls "elite recruitment".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=118}}

According to Parpola, local elites joined "small but powerful groups" of Indo-European speaking migrants.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=67}} These migrants had an attractive social system and good weapons, and luxury goods which marked their status and power. Joining these groups was attractive for local leaders, since it strengthened their position, and gave them additional advantages.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=67–68}} These new members were further incorporated by [[matrimonial]] alliances.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=68}}{{sfn|Mallory|2002}}

According to Joseph Salmons, language shift is facilitated by "dislocation" of language communities, in which the elite is taken over.{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=118}} According to Salmons, this change is facilitated by "systematic changes in community structure", in which a local community becomes incorporated in a larger social structure.{{sfn|Salmons|2015|p=118}}{{refn|group=note|name="dislocation"|Note the dislocation of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] prior to the start of the Indo-Aryan migrations into northern India, and the onset of [[Sanskritisation]] with the rise of the [[Kuru kingdom]], as described by Michael Witzel.{{sfn|Witzel|1995}} Note also that the "Ancestral North Indians" and "Ancestral South Indians"{{r|Reich2009|group=web}}{{r|Metspalu2011|group=web}} mixed between 4,200 to 1,900 years ago (2200 BCE – 100 CE), where after a shift to endogamy took place.<ref name=Moorjani2013>{{cite journal |last1=Moorjani |first1=P. |last2=Thangaraj |first2=K. |last3=Patterson |first3=N. |last4=Lipson |first4=M. |last5=Loh |first5=P.R. |last6=Govindaraj |first6=P. |last7=Singh |first7=L. |display-authors=3 |year=2013 |title=Genetic evidence for recent population mixture in India |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=422–38 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.006 |pmid=23932107 |pmc=3769933 }}</ref>}}

===Genetic relations between historical populations===
Since the 2000s genetical studies are assuming a prominent role in the research on Indo-European migrations. Whole-genome studies reveal relations between various cultures and the time-range in which those relations were established. Research by Haak et al. (2015) showed that ~75% of the Corded Ware ancestry came from Yamna-related populations,{{sfn|Haak|2015}} while Allentoft et al. (2015) shows that the Sintashta culture is genetically related to the Corded Ware culture.{{sfn|Allentoft|2015}} Quiles (2017) has proposed a relation between the "expansion of peoples belonging to haplogroup [[R1b]] in Eurasia" and the diffusion of Indo-European languages.<ref>Carlos Quiles, ''Indo-European demic diffusion model''.

===Ecological studies: widespread drought, urban collapse, and pastoral migrations===
Climate change and drought may have triggered both the initial dispersal of Indo-European speakers, and the migration of Indo-Europeans from the steppes in south central Asia and India.

Around 4200–4100 BCE [[Piora Oscillation|a climate change occurred]], manifesting in colder winters in Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=227}} Steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo-European speakers, spread into the lower Danube valley about 4200–4000 BCE, either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}}

The Yamnaya horizon was an adaptation to a climate change which occurred between 3500 and 3000 BCE, in which the steppes became drier and cooler. Herds needed to be moved frequently to feed them sufficiently, and the use of wagons and horse-back riding made this possible, leading to "a new, more mobile form of pastoralism".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=300, 336}}

In the second millennium BCE widespread aridization led to water shortages and ecological changes in both the Eurasian steppes and south Asia.<ref group=web name="Kochhar2017">Rajesh Kochhar (2017), [http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aryans-dna-genetics-archaeology-4765740/ "The Aryan chromosome"], ''The Indian Express''.</ref>{{sfn|Demkina|2017}} At the steppes, humidization led to a change of vegetation, triggering "higher mobility and transition to the nomadic cattle breeding".{{sfn|Demkina|2017}}{{refn|group=note|Demkina et al.

==Origins of the Indo-Europeans==

[[File:Kurgan map.png|thumb|right|The development of the Kurgan culture according to Marija Gimbutas' [[Kurgan hypothesis]]]]

===Urheimat (original homeland)===
====Urheimat hypotheses====
{{Main|Proto-Indo-European homeland}}

The Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses are tentative identifications of the ''[[Urheimat]]'', or primary homeland, of the hypothetical [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. Such identifications attempt to be consistent with the [[glottochronology]] of the language tree and with the archaeology of those places and times. Identifications are made on the basis of how well, if at all, the projected migration routes and times of migration fit the distribution of Indo-European languages, and how closely the sociological model of the original society reconstructed from Proto-Indo-European lexical items fits the archaeological profile.

Since the early 1980s{{sfn|Bojtar|1999|p=57}} the mainstream consensus among Indo-Europeanists favors Marija Gimbutas' "[[Kurgan hypothesis]]",{{sfn|Mallory|1997}}{{sfn|Mallory|2013}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015}}{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} c.q. David Anthony's "Revised Steppe theory", derived from Gimbutas' pioneering work,{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} placing the Indo-European homeland in the [[Pontic steppe]], more specifically, between the Dniepr (Ukraine) and the Ural river (Russia), of the [[Chalcolithic]] period (4th to 5th millennia BCE),{{sfn|Mallory|1997}} where various related cultures developed.{{sfn|Mallory|1997}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} The Pontic steppe is a large area of [[grassland]]s in far [[Eastern Europe]], located north of the [[Black Sea]], [[Caucasus Mountains]] and [[Caspian Sea]] and including parts of eastern [[Ukraine]], southern [[Russia]] and northwest [[Kazakhstan]]. This is the time and place of the earliest [[domestication of the horse]], which according to this hypothesis was the work of early Indo-Europeans, allowing them to expand outwards and assimilate or conquer many other cultures.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} The [[Yamnaya culture]] (3300–2500 BCE),{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} located on the middle Don and Volga, is the specific culture from where this expansion in its major form started.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

The primary competitor is the [[Anatolian hypothesis]] advanced by [[Colin Renfrew]],{{sfn|Mallory|2013}}{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} which states that the Indo-European languages began to spread peacefully into Europe from [[Asia Minor]] (modern [[Turkey]]) from around 7000 BCE with the [[Neolithic revolution|Neolithic advance of farming]] (''wave of advance'').{{sfn|Mallory|1997}} Another theory which has drawn considerable attention is the Armenian plateau hypothesis of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, who have argued that the urheimat was south of the Caucasus, specifically, "within eastern Anatolia, the southern Caucasus and northern Mesopotamia" in the fifth to fourth millennia BCE.<ref>[[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze|T. V. Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|V. V. Ivanov]], Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans, 1995, Chapters Eleven and Twelve</ref>{{sfn|Mallory|1997}}{{sfn|Mallory|2013}}{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}

All hypotheses assume a significant period (at least 1500–2000 years) between the time of the Proto-Indo-European language and the earliest attested texts, at [[Kültepe]], c. 19th century BCE.

====The Kurgan hypothesis and the "revised steppe theory"====
{{Main|Kurgan hypothesis|Revised Steppe theory}}

The Kurgan hypothesis (also theory or model) argues that the people of an archaeological "Kurgan culture" (a term grouping the [[Yamnaya]] or Pit Grave culture and its predecessors) in the [[Pontic steppe]] were the most likely speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. The term is derived from ''[[kurgan]]'' ({{lang|ru|курган}}), a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] loanword in Russian for a [[tumulus]] or burial mound. An origin at the Pontic-Caspian steppes is the most widely accepted [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|scenario of Indo-European origins]].{{sfn|Mallory|1989|p=185}}{{sfn|Strazny|2000|p=163}}{{sfn|Parpola|2015}}{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}{{refn|group=note|Mallory: "The Kurgan solution is attractive and has been accepted by many archaeologists and linguists, in part or total. It is the solution one encounters in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and the ''Grand Dictionnaire Encyclopédique Larousse''."{{sfn|Mallory|1989|p=185}}<br />Strazny: "The single most popular proposal is the Pontic steppes (see the Kurgan hypothesis) […]"{{sfn|Strazny|2000|p=163}}}}

[[Marija Gimbutas]] formulated her [[Kurgan hypothesis]] in the 1950s, grouping together a number of related cultures at the Pontic steppes. She defined the "Kurgan culture" as composed of four successive periods, with the earliest (Kurgan I) including the [[Samara culture|Samara]] and [[Seroglazovo culture|Seroglazovo]] cultures of the [[Dnieper]]/[[Volga]] region in the [[Copper Age]] (early 4th millennium BCE). The bearers of these cultures were [[Eurasian nomads|nomadic pastoralists]], who, according to the model, by the early 3rd millennium expanded throughout the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] and into [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Gimbutas (1985) page 190.</ref>

Gimbutas' grouping is nowadays considered to have been too broad. According to Anthony, it is better to speak of the [[Yamnaya culture]] or of a "Yamnaya horizon", which included several related cultures, as the defining Proto-Indo-European culture at the Pontic steppe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} David Anthony has incorporated recent developments in his "revised steppe theory", which also supports a steppe origin of the Indo-European languages.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015}} Anthony emphasizes the Yamnaya culture as the origin of the Indo-European dispersal.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015}} Recent research by Haak et al. (2015) confirms the migration of Yamnaya-people into western Europe, forming the Corded Ware culture.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}

===Proto-Indo-Europeans===
{{Main|Proto-Indo-Europeans}}

The Proto-Indo-Europeans were the speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), a [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[prehistory|prehistoric]] language of [[Eurasia]]. Knowledge of them comes chiefly from the linguistic reconstruction, along with material evidence from [[archaeology]] and [[archaeogenetics]].

According to some archaeologists, PIE speakers cannot be assumed to have been a single, identifiable people or tribe, but were a group of loosely related populations ancestral to the later, still partially prehistoric, [[Bronze Age]] Indo-Europeans. This view is held especially by those archaeologists who posit an original homeland of vast extent and immense time depth. However, this view is not shared by linguists, as proto-languages generally occupy small geographical areas over a very limited time span, and are generally spoken by close-knit communities such as a single small tribe.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aikio|first1=Ante|title=An essay on Saami ethnolinguistic prehistory|journal=Mémoires de la Société Finno-Ougrienne|date=2012|issue=266, ''A Linguistic Map of Prehistoric Northern Europe''|pages=93f., 98|url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust266/sust266_aikio.pdf|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=[[Finno-Ugrian Society]]|location=Helsinki, Finland}}</ref>

The Proto-Indo-Europeans were likely to have lived during the late [[Neolithic]], or roughly the 4th millennium BCE. Mainstream scholarship places them in the forest-steppe zone immediately to the north of the western end of the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. Some archaeologists would extend the time depth of PIE to the middle Neolithic (5500 to 4500 BCE) or even the early Neolithic (7500 to 5500 BCE), and suggest [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|alternative Proto-Indo-European Urheimats]].

By the late third millennium BCE, offshoots of the Proto-Indo-Europeans had reached [[Anatolia]] ([[Hittites]]), the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] ([[Mycenaean Greece]]), [[Western Europe]], and southern [[Siberia]] ([[Afanasevo culture]]).{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|loc=4 and 6 (Afanasevo), 13 and 16 (Anatolia), 243 (Greece), 127–128 (Corded Ware), and 653 (Yamna)}}

=====Anatolian hypothesis=====
{{Main|Anatolian hypothesis}}

Alberto Piazza and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza have tried in the 2000s to align the Anatolian hypothesis with the Steppe theory. According to Alberto Piazza, writing in 2000, "[i]t is clear that, genetically speaking, peoples of the Kurgan steppe descended at least in part from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who immigrated there from Turkey."{{sfn|Cavalli-Sforza|2000}} According to Piazza and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] (2006), the Yamna-culture may have been derived from Middle Eastern Neolithic farmers who migrated to the Pontic steppe and developed pastoral nomadism.<ref name="Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza 2006">Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006)</ref>{{refn|group=note|Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza: "...if the expansions began at 9,500 years ago from Anatolia and at 6,000 years ago from the [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya culture]] region, then a 3,500-year period elapsed during their migration to the [[Volga River|Volga]]-[[Don River (Russia)|Don]] region from Anatolia, probably through the Balkans. There a completely new, mostly pastoral culture developed under the stimulus of an environment unfavorable to standard agriculture, but offering new attractive possibilities. Our hypothesis is, therefore, that Indo-European languages derived from a secondary expansion from the [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya culture]] region after the Neolithic farmers, possibly coming from Anatolia and settled there, developing pastoral nomadism.<ref name="Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza 2006">Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006)</ref>}} Wells agrees with Cavalli-Sforza that there is "''some'' genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East."{{sfn|Wells|2002}}{{refn|group=note|Wells: "... while we see substantial genetic and archaeological evidence for an Indo-European migration originating in the southern Russian steppes, there is little evidence for a similarly massive Indo-European migration from the Middle East to Europe. One possibility is that, as a much earlier migration (8,000 years old, as opposed to 4,000), the genetic signals carried by Indo-European-speaking farmers may simply have dispersed over the years. There is clearly ''some'' genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East, as Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues showed, but the signal is not strong enough for us to trace the distribution of Neolithic languages throughout the entirety of Indo-European-speaking Europe."{{sfn|Wells|2002}}}} Nevertheless, the Anatolian hypothesis has been rejected, since it is incompatible with the gowing data on the genetic history of the Yamnaya-people.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}

According to Anthony, the development of the Proto-Indo-European cultures started with the introduction of cattle at the Pontic-Caspian steppes.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=132}} Until ca. 5200–5000 BCE the Pontic-Caspian steppes were populated by hunter-gatherers.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=135}} According to Anthony, the first cattle herders arrived from the Danube Valley at ca. 5800–5700 BCE, descendants from the first European farmers.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=138}} They formed the [[Körös culture|Criş culture]] (5800–5300 BCE), creating a cultural frontier at the Prut-Dniestr watershed.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=132, 145}} The adjacent [[Bug–Dniester culture]] (6300–5500 BCE) was a local culture, from where cattle breeding spread to the steppe peoples.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=145, 147}} The Dniepr Rapids area was the next part of the Pontic-Caspian steppes to shift to cattle-herding. It was the densely populated area of the Pontic-Caspian steppes at the time, and had been inhabited by various hunter-gatherer populations since the end of the Ice Age. From ca.5800–5200 it was inhabited by the first phase of the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]], a hunter-gatherer culture contemporaneous with the Bug-Dniestr culture.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=155–157}}

At ca. 5200–5000 BCE the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]] (6000–3500 BCE), presumed to be non-Indo-European speaking, appears east of the Carpathian mountains, {{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=164}} moving the cultural frontier to the Southern Bug valley,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=173}} while the foragers at the Dniepr Rapids shifted to cattle herding, marking the shift to Dniepr-Donets II (5200/5000 – 4400/4200 BCE).{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=175}} The Dniepr-Donets culture kept cattle not only for ritual sacrifices, but also for their daily diet.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=182}} The [[Khvalynsk culture]] (4700–3800 BCE),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=182}} located at the middle Volga, which was connected with the Danube Valley by trade networks,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=185, 190}} also had cattle and sheep, but they were "more important in ritual sacrifices than in the diet".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=186}} The [[Samara culture]] (early 5th millennium BCE),{{refn|group=note|name=dating|There are several datings available:

The [[Khvalynsk culture]] (4700–3800 BCE){{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=182}} (middle Volga) and the Don-based Repin culture (ca.3950–3300 BCE){{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=275}} preceded the [[Yamnaya culture]] (3300–2500 BCE),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=300}} which originated in the Don-Volga area.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=300}} Late pottery from these two cultures can barely be distinguished from early Yamnaya pottery.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=274–277, 317–320}}

The Yamnaya [[Horizon (archaeology)|horizon]] was an adaptation to a climate change which occurred between 3500 and 3000 BCE, in which the steppes became drier and cooler. Herds needed to be moved frequently to feed them sufficiently, and the use of wagons and horse-back riding made this possible, leading to "a new, more mobile form of pastoralism".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=300, 336}} It was accompanied by new social rules and institutions, to regulate the local migrations in the steppes, creating a new social awareness of a distinct culture, and of "cultural Others" who did not participate in these new institutions.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=300}}

The [[Yamnaya culture]] c.q. horizon (a.k.a. Pit Grave culture) spreads quickly across the Pontic-Caspian steppes between ca. 3400 and 3200 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=321}} According to Anthony, "the spread of the Yamnaya horizon was the material expression of the spread of late Proto-Indo-European across the Pontic-Caspian steppes."{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=301–302}} Anthony further notes that "the Yamnaya horizon is the visible archaeological expression of a social adjustment to high mobility – the invention of the political infrastructure to manage larger herds from mobile homes based in the steppes."{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} The Yamnaya horizon represents the classical reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European society]] with [[Kurgan stelae|stone idols]], predominantly practising [[animal husbandry]] in permanent settlements protected by [[hillfort]]s, subsisting on agriculture, and fishing along rivers. According to Gimbutas, contact of the Yamnaya culture with late [[Neolithic Europe]] cultures results in the "kurganized" [[Globular Amphora culture|Globular Amphora]] and [[Baden culture|Baden]] cultures.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Anthony excludes the Globular Amphora culture.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

The [[Maykop culture]] (3700–3000) emerges somewhat earlier in the northern [[Caucasus]]. Although considered by Gimbutas as an outgrowth of the steppe cultures, it is related to the development of Mesopotamia, and Anthony does not consider it to be a Proto-Indo-European culture.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} The Maykop culture shows the earliest evidence of the beginning [[Bronze Age]], and Bronze weapons and artifacts are introduced to the Yamnaya horizon.

Between 3100 and 2600 BCE the Yamnaya people spread into the Danube Valley as far as Hungary.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=345, 361–362, 367}} This migration probably gave rise to Proto-Celtic{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=367}} and Pre-Italic.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=367}} Pre-Germanic dialects may have developed between the [[Dniestr]] (west Ukraine) and the [[Vistula]] (Poland) at c. 3100–2800 BCE, and spread with the Corded Ware culture.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=360, 368}} Slavic and Baltic developed at the middle [[Dniepr]] (present-day Ukraine){{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=368, 380}} at c. 2800 BCE, also spreading with the Corded Ware horizon.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=101}}

===Post-Yamnaya===
In the northern Don-Volga area the Yamnaya culture was followed by the [[Poltavka culture]] (2700–2100 BCE), while the [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800) extended the Indo-European culture zone east of the Ural mountains, giving rise to Proto-Indo-Iranian and the subsequent spread of the Indo-Iranian languages toward India and the Iranian plateau.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

==Early migrations: Archaic Proto-Indo-European==

===Europe and Anatolia (5th–4th millennium BCE)===

====Europe: Migration into the Danube Valley (4200 BCE)====
According to Anthony, steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo-European speakers, spread into the lower Danube valley about 4200–4000 BCE, either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}} According to Anthony, their languages "probably included archaic Proto-Indo-European dialects of the kind partly preserved later in Anatolian."{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=229}} According to Anthony their descendants later moved into Anatolia, at an unknown time, but maybe as early as 3,000 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=262}} According to Mathieson & Reich et al. (2017), it is unlikely that the Anatolian branch arrived in Anatolia via the Balkans.<ref name="Mathieson_2017"/>

According to Parpola, the appearance of Indo-European speakers from Europe into Anatolia, and the appearance of Hittite, is related to later migrations of Proto-Indo-European speakers from the Yamna-culture into the Danube Valley at ca. 2800 BCE,{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=345, 361–367}} which is in line with the "customary" assumption that the Anatolian Indo-European language was introduced into Anatolia somewhere in the third millennium BCE.{{r|EB_AnatLang|group=web}}

====Anatolia: Archaic Proto-Indo-European (Hittites; 4500–3500 BCE)====
[[File:Luwian Language de.svg|thumb|Area where the second millennium BCE Luwian language was spoken]]
{{Main|Anatolians|Hittites}}

The [[Anatolians]] were a group of distinct [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European peoples]] who spoke the [[Anatolian languages]] and shared a common culture.<ref name="Beckwith37">{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=37}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Fortson, IV|2011|p=48}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Fortson, IV|2011|p=170}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hock|Joseph|1996|pp=520–521}}</ref><ref name=MalloryAdams12>{{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=12–16}}</ref> The Anatolian languages were a branch of the larger [[Indo-European language family]].

[[File:Anatolian 03.png|thumb|Anatolian languages attested in the mid-first millennium BCE]]

Although the Hittites are first attested in the 2nd millennium BCE,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=43–46}} the Anatolian branch seems to have separated at a very early stage from Proto-Indo-European, or may have developed from an older Pre-Proto-Indo-European ancestor.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=47–48}} If it separated from Proto-Indo-European, it likely did so between 4500–3500 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=48}}

The archaeological discovery of the archives of the [[Hittites]] and the classification of the [[Hittite language]] to a separate [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages]] caused a sensation among historians, forcing a re-evaluation of Near Eastern history and [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European linguistics]].<ref name=MalloryAdams12/> In accordance with the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], [[J. P. Mallory]] notes in [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] that it is likely that the Anatolians reached the Near East from the north, either via the [[Balkans]] or the [[Caucasus]] in the 3rd millennium BCE.<ref name=MalloryAdams12/> According to Anthony, descendants of archaic Proto-Indo-European steppe herders, who moved into the lower Danube valley about 4200–4000 BCE, later moved into Anatolia, at an unknown time, but maybe as early as 3,000 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=133, 262}} According to Parpola the movement into Anatolia took place at a later date.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=37–38}} According to Mathieson & Reich et al. (2017), it is unlikely that the Anatolian branch arrived in Anatolia via the Balkans.<ref name="Mathieson_2017"/>

Together with the [[Tocharians]], the Anatolians constituted the first known wave of Indo-European emigrants out of the [[Eurasian steppe]].<ref name="Beckwith32">{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=32}}</ref> Although they had wagons, they probably emigrated before Indo-Europeans had learned to use [[chariots]] for war.<ref name="Beckwith32"/> It is likely that their arrival was one of gradual settlement and not as an invading army.<ref name="Beckwith37"/> The Anatolians' earliest linguistic and historical attestation are as names mentioned in [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] mercantile texts from 19th-century BCE [[Kanesh]].<ref name="Beckwith37"/>

The Hittites, who established an extensive empire in the [[Middle East]] in the 2nd millennium BCE, are by far the best known members of the Anatolian group. The history of the Hittite civilization is known mostly from [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] texts found in the area of their kingdom, and from diplomatic and commercial correspondence found in various archives in [[Egypt]] and the [[Middle East]]. Despite the use of ''Hatti'' for their core territory, the Hittites should be distinguished from the [[Hattians]], an earlier people who inhabited the same region (until the beginning of the 2nd millennium). The Hittite military made successful use of [[Chariot#Hittites|chariots]]. Although belonging to the [[Bronze Age]], they were the forerunners of the [[Iron Age]], developing the manufacture of [[Iron (material)|iron]] artifacts from as early as the 14th century, when letters to foreign rulers reveal the latter's demand for iron goods. The Hittite empire reached its height during the mid-14th century under [[Suppiluliuma I]], when it encompassed an area that included most of [[Asia Minor]] as well as parts of the northern [[Levant]] and [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. After 1180 BCE, amid the [[Bronze Age Collapse]] in the [[Levant]] associated with the sudden arrival of the [[Sea Peoples]], the kingdom disintegrated into several independent "[[Neo-Hittite]]" city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BCE. The lands of the Anatolian peoples were successively invaded by a number of peoples and empires at high frequency: the [[Phrygians]], [[Bithynians]], the [[Medes]], the [[Persian people|Persians]], the [[Greeks]], the [[Galatians (People)|Galatian Celts]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the [[Oghuz Turks]]. Many of these invaders settled in Anatolia, in some cases causing the extinction of the Anatolian languages. By the [[Middle Ages]], all the Anatolian languages (and the cultures accompanying them) were extinct, although there may be lingering influences on the modern inhabitants of Anatolia, most notably [[Armenians]].

===Northern Caucasus: The Maykop culture (3700–3000 BCE)===
{{Main|Maikop culture}}
[[File:Maykop culture-en.svg|thumbnail|Geographic extent of the Maykop culture]]

The Maykop culture (also spelled Maikop), c. 3700–3000 BCE,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ivanova|first=Mariya|title=The Chronology of the "Maikop Culture" in the North Caucasus: Changing Perspectives|journal=Armenian Journal of Near Eastern Studies|year=2007|volume=II|pages=7–39}}</ref> was a major [[Bronze Age]] archaeological culture in the Western [[Caucasus]] region of Southern Russia. It extends along the area from the [[Taman Peninsula]] at the [[Kerch Strait]] to near the modern border of [[Republic of Dagestan|Dagestan]] and southwards to the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]]. The culture takes its name from a royal burial found in [[Maykop kurgan]] in the [[Kuban River]] valley.

According to Mallory and Adams, migrations southward founded the [[Maykop culture]] (c. 3500–2500 BCE).{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=372}} Yet, according to Mariya Ivanova the Maykop origins were on the Iranian Plateau,{{sfn|Ivanova|2012}} while kurgans from the beginning of the 4th millennium at [[Soyuqbulaq, Agstafa|Soyuqbulaq]] in [[Azerbaijan]], which belong to the [[Leyla-Tepe culture]], show parallels with the Maykop kurgans. According to Museyibli, "the Leylatepe Culture tribes migrated to the north in the mid-fourth millennium and played an important part in the rise of the Maikop Culture of the North Caucasus."{{r|group=web|Excav_Soyu_Kurgans}}

===Asia (3500–2500 BCE)===
[[File:Afanasevo provisional.png|thumb|The geographic extent of the Afanasevo culture]]

====Afanasevo culture====
{{Main|Afanasevo culture}}

The Afanasievo culture (3300 to 2500 BCE) is the earliest [[Eneolithic]] [[archaeological culture]] found until now in south [[Siberia]], occupying the [[Minusinsk Hollow|Minusinsk Basin]], [[Altai Krai|Altay]] and [[East Kazakhstan Province|Eastern Kazakhstan]]. It originated with a migration of people from the pre-Yamnaya Repin culture, at the Don river,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=275}} and is related to the Tocharians.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=264–265}}

[[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] gives dates as early as 3705 BCE on wooden tools and 2874 BCE on human remains for the Afanasievo culture.{{r|Svyatko09|group=web}} The earliest of these dates has now been rejected, giving a date of around 3300 BCE for the start of the culture.<ref>D.W. Anthony, Two IE phylogenies, three PIE migrations, and four kinds of steppe pastoralism, The Journal of Language Relationship, vol. 9 (2013), pp. 1–21</ref>

====The Tocharians====
{{Main|Tocharians|Tocharian languages}}

The [[Tocharians]], or "Tokharians" ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|k|ɛər|i|ən|z}} or {{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|k|ɑr|i|ən|z}}) were inhabitants of medieval oasis city-states on the northern edge of the [[Tarim Basin]] (modern [[Xinjiang]], [[China]]). Their [[Tocharian languages]] (a branch of the [[Indo-European family]]) are known from manuscripts from the 6th to 8th centuries CE, after which they were supplanted by the [[Turkic languages]] of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] tribes. These people were called "Tocharian" by late 19th-century scholars who identified them with the ''Tókharoi'' described by ancient Greek sources as inhabiting [[Bactria]]. Although this identification is now generally considered mistaken, the name has become customary.

The Tocharians are thought to have developed from the [[Afanasevo culture]] of Siberia (c. 3500–2500 BCE).{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=264–265}} It is believed that the [[Tarim mummies]], dated from 1800 BCE, represent a migration of Tocharian speakers from the Afanasevo culture in the [[Tarim Basin]] in the early 2nd millennium BCE.{{sfn|Loewe|Shaughnessy|1999|pp=83–88}} By the end of the 2nd millennium BCE, the dominant people as far east as the [[Altai Mountains]] southward to the northern outlets of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] were anthropologically [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], with the northern part speaking [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] [[Scythian language|Scythian]] languages and the southern parts Tocharian languages, having [[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]] populations as their northeastern neighbors.<ref name="Beckwith70">{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|pp=59, 70–1}}. The dominant people in the western part of it, from the Altai of western Mongolia south through the [[Kroraina]] area around the Lop Nor to the Ch'i-lien Mountains, the northern outliers of the Tibetan Plateau, were Caucasoid in race; those in the northern region seem to have spoken North Iranian "Saka" languages or dialects, while those in the Kroraina area spoke Tokharian languages or dialects.</ref><ref name=EB_Stone_Age>{{cite web |title=Stone Age: Central Asia and Siberia |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/567232/Stone-Age/52381/South-and-East-Asia#ref509019 |url-access=subscription |access-date=15 February 2015 }}</ref> These two groups were in competition with each other until the latter overcame the former.{{r|EB_Stone_Age}} The turning point occurred around the 5th to 4th centuries BCE with a gradual Mongolization of Siberia, while Eastern Central Asia (East Turkistan) remained Caucasian and Indo-European-speaking until well into the 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=59}}

The [[Sinology|Sinologist]] [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]] has suggested that the [[Yuezhi]], the [[Wusun]] the [[Dayuan]], the [[Kangju]] and the people of [[Karasahr|Yanqi]], could have been Tocharian-speaking.<ref name="Pulleyblank">{{harvnb|Pulleyblank|1966|pp=9–39}}</ref> Of these the Yuezhi are generally held to have been Tocharians.<ref>{{harvnb|Mallory|1989|pp=59–60}}</ref> The Yuezhi were originally settled in the arid grasslands of the eastern [[Tarim Basin]] area, in what is today [[Xinjiang]] and western [[Gansu]], in [[China]]. After the Yuezhi were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]], in the 2nd century BCE, a small group, known as the Little Yuezhi, fled to the south, later spawning the [[Jie people]] who dominated the [[Later Zhao]] until their complete extermination by [[Ran Min]] in the [[Wei–Jie war]]. The majority of the Yuezhi however migrated west to the [[Ili River|Ili Valley]], where they displaced the [[Sakas]] ([[Scythians]]). Driven from the Ili Valley shortly afterwards by the Wusun, the Yuezhi migrated to [[Sogdia]] and then [[Bactria]], where they are often identified with the ''Tókharoi'' (Τοχάριοι) and ''[[Asioi]]'' of Classical sources. They then expanded into northern [[South Asia]], where one branch of the Yuezhi founded the [[Kushan Empire]]. The Kushan empire stretched from [[Turfan]] in the [[Tarim Basin]] to [[Pataliputra]] on the [[Gangetic plain]] at its greatest extent, and played an important role in the development of the [[Silk Road]] and the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|transmission of Buddhism]] to [[China]]. Tocharian languages continued to be spoken in the city-states of the Tarim Basin, only becoming extinct in the [[Middle Ages]].

==Europe==

===Decline of neolithic populations===
Between ca. 4000 and 3000 BCE, neolithic populations in western Europe declined, probably due to the plague and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. This decline was followed by the migrations of Indo-European populations into western Europe, transforming the genetic make-up of the western populations.<ref>Rascovan et al.

Three autosomal genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of [[Marija Gimbutas|Gimbutas]] regarding the [[proto-Indo-European homeland]]. According to those studies, haplogroups [[R1b]] and [[R1a]] would have expanded from the West Eurasian Steppe, along with the Indo-European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in [[Neolithic Europe]]ans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European Languages.<ref>[http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/10/013433 Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European languages in Europe, Haak et al, 2015]</ref><ref name="Allentoft et al.">{{cite journal |last1=Allentoft |last2=Sikora |displayauthors=etal |year=2015 |title=Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature14507 |volume=522 |issue=7555 |pages=167–172 |pmid=26062507|bibcode=2015Natur.522..167A |url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/population-genomics-of-bronze-age-eurasia(11286d58-42ae-4397-bc7a-3bb8b71c6c52).html }}</ref><ref>[http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/13/016477 Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe, Mathieson et al, 2015]</ref>

Mallory notes that the Italic, Celtic and Germanic languages are closely related, which accords with their historic distribution. The Germanic languages are also related to the Baltic and Slavic languages, which in turn share similarities with the Indo-Iranic languages.{{sfn|Mallory|1999|p=155}} The Greek, Armenian and Indo-Iranian languages are also related, which suggests "a chain of central Indo-European dialects stretching from the Balkans across the Black sea to the east Caspian".{{sfn|Mallory|1999|p=155}} And the Celtic, Italic, Anatolian and Tocharian languages preserve archaisms which are preserved only in those languages.{{sfn|Mallory|1999|p=155}} According to David Anthony, pre-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] split off earliest (3300 BCE), followed by pre-Italic and pre-Celtic (3000 BCE), pre-Armenian (2800 BCE), pre-Balto-Slavic (2800 BCE) and pre-Greek (2500 BCE).{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=100}}

The Balkan-Danubian complex is a set of cultures in Southeast Europe from which the western Indo-European languages probably spread into western Europe from c. 3500 BCE.{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp=108 f.}} According to Anthony, Pre-Italic, Pre-Celtic and Pre-Germanic may have split off here from Proto-Indo-European.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=344}}

The [[Usatovo culture]] developed in south-eastern Central Europe at around 3300–3200 BCE at the Dniestr river.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=349}} Although closely related to the [[Tripolye culture]], it is contemporary with the Yamnaya culture, and resembles it in significant ways.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=359}} According to Anthony, it may have originated with "steppe clans related to the Yamnaya horizon who were able to impose a patron-client relationship on Tripolye farming villages".{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=359–360}}

According to Anthony, the Pre-Germanic dialects may have developed in this culture between the [[Dniestr]] (west Ukraine) and the [[Vistula]] (Poland) at c. 3100–2800 BCE, and spread with the Corded Ware culture.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=360, 368}}

Between 3100 and 2800/2600 BCE, when the Yamnaya horizon spread fast across the Pontic Steppe, a real folk migration of Proto-Indo-European speakers from the Yamna-culture took place into the Danube Valley,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=345, 361–367}} moving along Usatovo territory toward specific destinations, reaching as far as Hungary,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=361–362, 367}} where as many as 3,000 kurgans may have been raised.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=362}} [[Bell Beaker]] sites at Budapest, dated c. 2800–2600 BCE, may have aided in spreading Yamnaya dialects into Austria and southern Germany at their west, where Proto-Celtic may have developed.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=367}} Pre-Italic may have developed in Hungary, and spread toward Italy via the [[Urnfield culture]] and [[Villanovan culture]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=367}} According to Anthony, Slavic and Baltic developed at the middle [[Dniepr]] (present-day Ukraine){{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=368, 380}} at c. 2800 BCE, spreading north from there.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=101}}

According to Parpola, this migration into the Danube Valley is related to the appearance of Indo-European speakers from Europe into Anatolia, and the appearance of Hittite.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|pp=37–38}}

The Balkan languages (Thracian, Dacian, Illyrian) may have developed among the early Indo-European populations of southeastern Europe. In the early Middle Ages their territory was occupied by migrating Slavic people, and by east Asian steppe peoples.

====Corded Ware culture (3000–2400 BCE)====
{{Main|Corded Ware|Bronze Age Europe}}

[[File:Map Corded Ware culture-en.svg|thumb|right|Approximate extent of the Corded Ware horizon with adjacent third-millennium cultures ([[Baden culture]] and [[Globular Amphora culture]]; after [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|''EIEC'']])]]

The [[Corded Ware culture]] in Middle Europe (c. 3200{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=127}} or 2,900{{r|group=web|Baldia06}}–2450 or 2350 [[calibrated years|cal.]]{{r|group=web|Baldia06}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=127}} BCE) is hypothesized to have played an essential role in the origin and spread of the [[Indo-European languages]] in Europe during the Copper and Bronze Ages.{{sfn|Mallory|1999|pp=108, 244–250}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=360}} David Anthony states that "Childe (1953:133-38) and Gimbutas (1963) speculated that migrants from the steppe Yamnaya culture (3300–2600 BCE) might have been the creators of the Corded Ware culture and carried IE languages into Europe from the steppes."{{sfn|Anthony|2017|p=54}} According to Gimbutas, the Corded Ware culture was preceded by the [[Globular Amphora culture]] (3400–2800 BCE), which she also regarded to be an Indo-European culture. The Globular Amphora culture stretched from central Europe to the Baltic sea, and emerged from the [[Funnelbeaker culture]].{{sfn|Mallory|1999|p=250}}

According to Mallory, the Corded Ware culture may be postulated as "the common prehistoric ancestor of the later Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, and possibly some of the Indo-European languages of Italy". Yet, Mallory also notes that the Corded Ware can not account for Greek, Illyrian, Thracian and East Italic, which may be derived from Southeast Europe.{{sfn|Mallory|1999|p=108}} According to Anthony, the Corded Ware horizon may have introduced Germanic, Baltic and Slavic into northern Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=367}}

The Corded Ware spread across northern Europe after 3000 BCE, with an "initial rapid spread" between 2900 and 2700 BCE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=367}} Around 2400 BCE the people of the Corded Ware replaced their predecessors and expanded to Danubian and northern areas of western Germany. A related branch invaded [[Denmark]] and southern [[Sweden]]. In places a continuity between Funnelbeaker and Corded Ware can be demonstrated, whereas in other areas Corded Ware heralds a new culture and physical type.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997}} According to Cunliffe, most of the expansion was clearly intrusive.<ref name=Cunliffe>{{cite book | title = The Oxford Illustrated Prehistory of Europe | first = Barry | last = Cunliffe | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 250–254 | year = 1994}}</ref> Yet, according to Furholt, the Corded Ware culture was an indigenous development,{{sfn|Anthony|2017|p=54}} connecting local developments into a larger network.{{sfn|Anthony|2017|p=58}}

Recent research by Haak et al. found that four late Corded Ware people (2500–2300 BCE) buried at Esperstadt, Germany, were genetically very close to the Yamna-people, suggesting that a massive migration took place from the Eurasian steppes to Central Europe.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}{{r|group=web|MPG_mass_migration}}{{r|group=web|Nature_EC}}{{sfn|Anthony|2017|p=54 f.}} Haak et al. (2015) note that German Corded Ware "trace ~75% of their ancestry to the Yamna,"{{sfn|Haak|2015|p=1}} envisioning a migration of both males and females from the Yamnaya culture through western Ukraine and Poland into Germany.{{sfn|Haak|2015|p=11, figure 4c}} Allentoft et al. (2015) envision a migration from the Yamnaya culture towards northern Europe, both via Central Europe and the territory of present-day Russia, toward the Baltic area and the eastern periphery of the Corded Ware culture.{{sfn|Allentoft|2015|p=108, topright map}} In supplementary information to Haak et al. (2015) Anthony, together with Lazaridis, Haak, Patterson, and Reich, notes that the mass migration of Yamnaya people to northern Europe shows that "the languages could have been introduced simply by strength of numbers: via major migration in which both sexes participated."{{sfn|Lazaridis|Haak|2015|p=136}}{{refn|group=note|They further note:
* "[…] the main argument in favor of the Anatolian hypothesis (that major language change requires major migration) can now also be applied to the Steppe hypothesis."{{sfn|Lazaridis|Haak|2015|p=136}}
* "[…] our results level the playing field between the two leading hypotheses [the Steppe hypotheses and the Anatolian hypothesis] of Indo-European origins, as we now know that both the Early Neolithic and the Late Neolithic were associated with major migrations."{{sfn|Lazaridis|Haak|2015|p=136}}}}

Anthony (2017) relates these close genetical similarities, and the development of the Corded Ware culture, to the early third century Yamna-migrations into the Danube-valley, stating that "[t]he migration stream that created these intrusive cemeteries now can be seen to have continued from eastern Hungary across the Carpatians into southern Poland, where the earliest material traits of the Corded ware horizon appeared."{{sfn|Anthony|2017|p=58}}{{refn|group=note|Yet, a major problem with this proposal is that those Yamna-migrants were R1b-carriers, which also appears in the Bell-Beaker people, while the Corded Ware people seem to have been R1a-carriers, which has not been found among Yamna-people.

Volker Heyd has cautioned to be careful with drawing too strong conclusions from those genetic similarities between Corded Ware and Yamna, noting the small number of samples; the late dates of the Esperstadt graves, which could also have undergone Bell Beaker admixture; the presence of Yamna-ancestry in western Europe before the Danube-expansion; and the risks of extrapolating "the results from a handful of individual burials to whole ethnically interpreted populations."{{sfn|Heyd|2017|p=350}} Heyd confirms the close connection between Corded Ware and Yamna, but also states that "neither a one-to-one translation from Yamnaya to CWC, nor even the 75:25 ratio as claimed (Haak ''et al.'' 2015:211) fits the archaeological record."{{sfn|Heyd|2017|p=350}}

The initial moves from the [[Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve|Tagus estuary]] were maritime. A southern move led to the Mediterranean where 'enclaves' were established in southwestern [[Spain]] and southern [[France]] around the [[Gulf of Lion|Golfe du Lion]] and into the [[Po valley]] in [[Italy]], probably via ancient western Alpine trade routes used to distribute [[jadeite]] axes. A northern move incorporated the southern coast of [[Armorica]]. The enclave established in southern [[Brittany]] was linked closely to the riverine and landward route, via the [[Loire]], and across the [[Gâtinais]] valley to the [[Seine]] valley, and thence to the lower [[Rhine]]. This was a long-established route reflected in early stone axe distributions and it was via this network that Maritime Bell Beakers first reached the Lower Rhine in about 2600 BCE.<ref name=cunliffebeaker/><ref>Johannes Müller, Martin Hinz and Markus Ullrich, "Bell Beakers – chronology, innovation and memory: a multivariate approach", chapter 6 in ''The Bell Beaker Transition in Europe: Mobility and local evolution during the 3rd millennium BC'', eds.

The term "Germanic" originated in [[Classical antiquity|classical times]], when groups of [[tribe]]s were referred to using this term by Roman authors. For them, the term was not necessarily based upon language, but rather referred to tribal groups and alliances who were considered less civilised than the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gauls]] living in the region of modern [[France]]. Tribes referred to as Germanic in that period lived generally to the north and east of the Gauls with the [[Rhine]] as an approximate border line.

In modern times the term occasionally has been used to refer to ethnic groups who speak a Germanic language and claim ancestral and cultural connections to ancient Germanic peoples.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Waldman |first1=Carl |last2=Catherine |first2=Catherine |authorlink= |title=Encyclopedia of European Peoples |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC |accessdate=May 25, 2013 |year=2006 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |location= |isbn=978-1-4381-2918-1 |page=xii}}</ref> Within this context, modern Germanic peoples include the [[Norwegians]], [[Swedes]], [[Danes]], [[Icelanders]], [[Germans]], [[Austrians]], [[English people|English]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Afrikaners]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]], [[Frisians]] and others.<ref>{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |authorlink= |title=One Europe, many nations: a historical dictionary of European national groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC |accessdate=May 25, 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |isbn=978-0-313-30984-7 |page=769}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Pavlovic |first=Zoran |authorlink= |title=Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rovXFnqXYMC |accessdate=9 March 2014 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |location= |isbn=978-1-4381-0455-3 |page=53}}</ref>{{r|group=web|freedic_Germans}}

The Germanic languages are spoken by a sizable population in Western Europe, North America, and Australasia. The common ancestor of all of the languages in this branch is called [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] (also known as Common Germanic), which was spoken in approximately the middle of the 1st millennium BCE in [[Pre-Roman Iron Age|Iron Age northern Europe]]. Proto-Germanic, along with all of its descendants, is characterized by a number of unique linguistic features, most famously the [[consonant]] change known as [[Grimm's law]]. Early varieties of Germanic enter history with the Germanic tribes moving south from [[northern Europe]] in the 2nd century BCE, to settle in north-central Europe.

The most widely spoken Germanic languages are [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], with approximately 300–400&nbsp;million native English speakers<ref group=web>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=eng |title=Ethnologue on English |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref><ref>Curtis, Andy.

===Italic and Celtic===
====Italic====
[[File:Latin Europe.png|thumb|Romance languages in Europe]]
{{Main|Italic languages|Italic peoples}}

The Italic languages are a subfamily of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family originally spoken by [[Italic peoples]]. They include the [[Romance languages]] derived from [[Latin]] ([[Italian language|Italian]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], etc.); a number of [[extinct language]]s of the [[Italian Peninsula]], including [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]], [[Oscan language|Oscan]], [[Faliscan language|Faliscan]], [[South Picene language|South Picene]]; and Latin itself. At present, Latin and its daughter Romance languages are the only surviving languages of the Italic language family.

The most widely accepted theory suggests that Latins and other proto-Italic tribes first entered in Italy with the late Bronze Age [[Proto-Villanovan culture]], then part of the central European [[Urnfield culture]] system.<ref name="Cornell 1995 44">Cornell (1995) 44.</ref><ref>''Encyclopædia Britannica'', s. v. "Latium".</ref> In particular various authors, like [[Marija Gimbutas]], had noted important similarities between Proto-Villanova, the [[South-German Urnfield culture]] of [[Bavaria]]-[[Upper Austria]]<ref name=Gimbutas>M.Gimbutas – Bronze Age Cultures in Central and Eastern Europe pp.&nbsp;339–345</ref> and [[Middle-Danube Urnfield culture]].<ref name="Gimbutas"/><ref>John M. Coles, ''The Bronze Age in Europe: An Introduction to the Prehistory of Europe C. 2000–700 BC'', p.&nbsp;422.</ref><ref>Massimo Pallottino, ''Etruscologia'', p. 40.</ref> According to David W. Anthony, proto-Latins originated in today's eastern [[Hungary]], kurganized around 3100 BCE by the [[Yamnaya culture]],<ref name=Anthony>David W. Anthony, ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language]]'', pp.&nbsp;344, 367.</ref> while [[Kristian Kristiansen (archaeologist)|Kristian Kristiansen]] associated the Proto-Villanovans with the Velatice-Baierdorf culture of [[Moravia]] and Austria.<ref>K. Kristiansen, ''Europe Before History'', p. 388.</ref>

Today the [[Romance languages]], which comprise all languages that descended from [[Latin]], are spoken by more than 800&nbsp;million native speakers worldwide, mainly in the Americas, Europe, and Africa.

The Balto-Slavic language group traditionally comprises the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], belonging to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] of languages. Baltic and Slavic languages share several linguistic traits not found in any other Indo-European branch, which points to a period of common development. Most Indo-Europeanists classify Baltic and Slavic languages into a single branch, even though some details of the nature of their relationship remain in dispute{{refn|group=note|{{cite web |title=Balto-Slavic languages. |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/51061/Balto-Slavic-languages|accessdate=10 December 2012 |quote=Those scholars who accept the Balto-Slavic hypothesis attribute the large number of close similarities in the vocabulary, grammar, and sound systems of the Baltic and Slavic languages to development from a common ancestral language after the breakup of Proto-Indo-European.

A [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language]] is reconstructable by the [[comparative method]], descending from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] by means of well-defined [[sound law]]s, and out of which modern Slavic and Baltic languages descended. One particularly innovative dialect separated from the Balto-Slavic dialect continuum and became ancestral to the [[Proto-Slavic]] language, from which all Slavic languages descended.<ref name=enc>{{Harvcoltxt|Young|2006}}</ref>

The Balts or Baltic peoples ({{lang-lt|baltai}}, {{lang-lv|balti}}) are an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] group who speak the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, which was originally spoken by tribes living in the area east of the [[Jutland]] peninsula in the west and west of [[Moscow River|Moscow]] and the [[Oka River|Oka]] and [[Volga]] rivers basins in the east. One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained.<ref>Bojtár page 18.</ref> Among the Baltic peoples are modern [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]] (including [[Latgalians (modern)|Latgalians]]) – all Eastern Balts – as well as the [[Old Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]] and [[Galindians]] – the Western Balts – whose people also survived, but their languages and cultures are now extinct, and are now being assimilated into the Eastern Baltic community.

[[File:Dacia 82 BC.png|thumb|Dacia during the reign of [[Burebista]]]]

The Thracian language was the Indo-European language spoken in [[Southeast Europe]] by the Thracians, the northern neighbors of the Greeks. Some authors group Thracian and [[Dacian language|Dacian]] into a southern [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] linguistic family.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mayer |first=Harvey E. |others=(Antanas Klimas ed.) |title=Dacian and Thracian as Southern Baltoidic Lituanus |volume=38 |issue=2 – Summer 1992 |journal=Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences |issn=0024-5089 |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1992_2/92_2_02.htm }}</ref>

This area extended over most of the Balkans region, and the [[Getae]] north of the [[Danube]] as far as beyond the [[Southern Bug|Bug]] and including Panonia in the west.<ref>The catalogue of [[Kimbell Art Museum]]'s 1998 exhibition ''Ancient Gold: The Wealth of the Thracians'' indicates a historical extent of Thracian settlement including most of the [[Ukraine]], all of [[Hungary]] and parts of [[Slovakia]].

The origins of the Thracians remain obscure, in the absence of written historical records. Evidence of proto-Thracians in the prehistoric period depends on artifacts of [[material culture]]. [[Leo Klejn]] identifies proto-Thracians with the [[multi-cordoned ware culture]] that was pushed away from Ukraine by the advancing [[timber grave culture]]. It is generally proposed that a proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of [[Neolithic Europe|indigenous peoples]] and [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] from the time of Proto-Indo-European expansion in the [[Early Bronze Age]]<ref name="Hoddinott, p. 27">Hoddinott, p. 27.</ref> when the latter, around 1500 BCE, mixed with indigenous peoples.<ref name="Casson, p. 3">Casson, p. 3.</ref> We speak of proto-Thracians from which during the [[Iron Age]]<ref>John Boardman, I.E.S.

=====Dacian=====

The Dacians ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|ʃ|ən|z}}; {{lang-la|Daci}}, {{lang-grc|Δάκοι,{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12}} Δάοι,{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,12}} Δάκαι}}<ref>[[Dionysius Periegetes]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fGg_AQAAMAAJ&dq= ''Graece et Latine'', Volume 1], Libraria Weidannia, 1828, p. 145.</ref>) were an [[Indo-European people]], part of or related to the [[Thracians]]. Dacians were the ancient inhabitants of [[Dacia]], located in the area in and around the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and west of the [[Black Sea]]. This area includes the present-day countries of [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], as well as parts of [[Ukraine]],{{sfn|Nandris|1976|p=731}} [[Moravian Banovina|Eastern Serbia]], [[Northern Bulgaria]], [[Slovakia]],{{sfn|Husovská|1998|p=187}} [[Hungary]] and Southern [[Poland]].{{sfn|Nandris|1976|p=731}}

The Dacians spoke the [[Dacian language]], believed to have been closely related to [[Thracian language|Thracian]], but were somewhat culturally influenced by the neighbouring [[Scythians]] and by the [[Celtic invasion of the Balkans|Celtic invaders of the 4th&nbsp;century BCE]].<ref name=EB_Dacia group=web>{{cite web |title=Dacia |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149413/Dacia#ref=ref24738&tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Dacia%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2016 }}</ref> The Dacians and Getae were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, [[Appian]], Strabo and Pliny the Elder), and were both said to speak the same Thracian language.{{sfn|Treptow |1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Ellis|1861|p=70}}

Evidence of proto-Thracians or proto-Dacians in the prehistoric period depends on the remains of [[material culture]]. It is generally proposed that a proto-Dacian or proto-Thracian people developed from a mixture of [[Neolithic Europe|indigenous peoples]] and [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] from the time of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] expansion in the [[Early Bronze Age]] (3,300–3,000 BCE)<ref name="Hoddinott, p. 27"/> when the latter, around 1500 BCE, conquered the indigenous peoples.<ref name="Casson, p. 3"/> The indigenous people were Danubian farmers, and the invading people of the 3rd millennium BCE were Kurgan warrior-herders from the Ukrainian and Russian steppes.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=58}}

Indo-Europeanization was complete by the beginning of the Bronze Age. The people of that time are best described as proto-Thracians, which later developed in the Iron Age into Danubian-Carpathian Geto-Dacians as well as Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|Hammond|Sollberger |1982|p=53}}

The Illyrians ({{lang-grc|Ἰλλυριοί}}, ''Illyrioi''; {{lang-la|Illyrii}} or ''Illyri'') were a group of Indo-European tribes in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], who inhabited part of the western [[Balkans]] and the southeastern coasts of the [[Italian peninsula]] ([[Messapii|Messapia]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Frazee|1997|p=89}}: "The Balkan peninsula had three groups of Indo-Europeans prior to 2000 BCE.

The name "Illyrians", as applied by the ancient [[Greek people|Greeks]] to their northern neighbors, may have referred to a broad, ill-defined group of peoples, and it is today unclear to what extent they were linguistically and culturally homogeneous.

===Armenian, Greek and Phrygian===
====Armenian====
{{Main|Armenian language|Armenians}}

The Armenian language was first put into writing in 406 or 407AD when a priest known as [[Mesrop Mashtots|Mesrop]] developed an Armenian alphabet.

There are three views amongst scholars about how speakers of Armenian came to be in what is now Armenia. One is that they came with Phrygians from the west, or with the [[Mitanni]] from the east, and took over from the non-Indo-European speaking [[Urartu|Urartians]], who were previously dominant in this area. Another view is that the Armenian people came to speak an Indo-European language after originally speaking a Caucasian language.  The third view is that the ancestor of the Armenian language was already spoken in the area during the time when it was politically dominated first by the [[Hittites]], and later by the Urartians.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Krause & Slocum |first1= |title=Classical Armenian Online- Romanized -Introduction |url=https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/armolr |website=Linguistics Research Center |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |accessdate=4 May 2019}}</ref>

A minority view also suggests that the [[Indo-European origins|Indo-European homeland]] may have been located in the [[Armenian Highland]].<ref>[[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], ''The Early History of Indo-European Languages'', March 1990, p.&nbsp;110.</ref>

==== Phrygian ====

[[File:Map Anatolia ancient regions-en.svg|thumb|right|Location of Phrygia in Anatolia]]

The Phrygians ([[Greek language|gr.]] Φρύγες, ''Phrúges'' or ''Phrýges'') were an ancient Indo-European people, who established their kingdom with a capital eventually at [[Gordium]]. It is presently unknown whether the Phrygians were actively involved in the collapse of the Hittite capital [[Hattusa]] or whether they simply moved into the vacuum left by the collapse of Hittite hegemony after the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]].

The Phrygian language {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɪ|dʒ|i|ə|n}} was the language spoken by the [[Phrygians]] in [[Asia Minor]] during [[Classical Antiquity]] (ca. 8th century BCE to 5th century CE).

According to [[Herodotus]], the Phrygians were initially dwelling in the southern [[Balkans]] under the name of [[Bryges]] (Briges), changing it to Phruges after their final migration to [[Anatolia]], via the [[Hellespont]]. Though the migration theory is still defended by many modern historians, most archaeologists have abandoned the migration hypothesis regarding the origin of the Phrygians due to a lack substantial archaeological evidence, with the migration theory resting only on the accounts of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Drews|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Drews|title=The end of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691025919|page=65}}</ref>

From tribal and village beginnings, the state of [[Phrygia]] arose in the eighth century BCE with its capital at [[Gordium]]. During this period, the Phrygians extended eastward and encroached upon the kingdom of [[Urartu]], the descendants of the [[Hurrians]], a former rival of the Hittites. Meanwhile, the Phrygian Kingdom was overwhelmed by [[Cimmerians|Cimmerian]] invaders around 690 BCE, then briefly conquered by its neighbour [[Lydia]], before it passed successively into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Cyrus the Great]] and the [[empire]] of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] and his [[Diadochi|successors]], was taken by the [[Attalids]] of [[Pergamon]], and eventually became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The last mention of the [[Phrygian language]] in literature dates to the fifth century CE and it was likely extinct by the seventh century.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Swain, Simon |author2=Adams, J.

[[File:Indo-Iranian origins.png|thumb|Archaeological cultures associated with the [[Indo-Iranian migration|Indo-Iranian]] and [[Indo-Aryan migration]]: The [[Andronovo culture]] is regarded as the origin of the Indo-Iranians, who later interacted with the [[BMAC]], from which they borrowed part of their distinctive religious beliefs. The [[Yaz culture]] is also associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The [[Gandhara grave culture|Gandhara grave]], [[Cemetery H culture|Cemetery H]], [[Copper Hoard Culture|Copper Hoard]] and [[Painted Grey Ware culture]]s are associated with Indo-Aryan migrations (according to [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|''EIEC'']]).]]

Indo-Iranian peoples are a grouping of [[ethnic group]]s consisting of the [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], [[Iranian people|Iranian]], [[Dard people|Dardic]] and [[Nuristani people]]s; that is, speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]], a major branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]].

The Proto-Indo-Iranians are commonly identified with the [[Sintashta culture]] and the subsequent [[Andronovo culture]] within the broader Andronovo horizon, and their homeland with an area of the [[Eurasian steppe]] that borders the [[Ural River]] on the west, the [[Tian Shan]] on the east.

The Indo-Iranians interacted with the Bactria-Margiana Culture, also called "[[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]]". Proto-Indo-Iranian arose due to this influence.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} The Indo-Iranians also borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices from this culture.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}}

The Indo-Iranian migrations took place in two waves.{{sfn|Burrow|1973}}{{sfn|Parpola|1999}} The first wave consisted of the Indo-Aryan migration into the Levant, founding the [[Mittani|Mittani kingdom]], and a migration south-eastward of the Vedic people, over the Hindu Kush into northern India.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} The Indo-Aryans split-off around 1800–1600 BCE from the Iranians,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} where-after they were defeated and split into two groups by the Iranians,{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33 note 20, p.&nbsp;35}} who dominated the Central Eurasian steppe zone{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33}} and "chased [the Indo-Aryans] to the extremities of Central Eurasia".{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33}} One group were the Indo-Aryans who founded the [[Mitanni]] kingdom in northern Syria;{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=454}} (c. 1500–1300 BCE) the other group were the Vedic people.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=33 note 20}} [[Christopher I. Beckwith]] suggests that the [[Wusun]], an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] people of [[Inner Asia]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], were also of Indo-Aryan origin.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=376–7}}

The second wave is interpreted as the Iranian wave,{{sfn|Malory|1989|pp=42–43}} and took place in the third stage of the Indo-European migrations{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}} from 800 BCE onwards.

===Sintashta-Petrovka and Andronovo culture===
====Sintashta-Petrovka culture====
{{Main|Sintashta culture}}
[[File:From Corded Ware to Sintashta.jpg|thumb|According to Allentoft (2015), the Sintashta culture probably derived from the Corded Ware Culture.]]

The Sintashta culture, also known as the Sintashta-Petrovka culture<ref name="Koryakova 1998b">{{Harvnb|Koryakova|1998b}}.</ref> or Sintashta-Arkaim culture,<ref name="Koryakova 1998a">{{Harvnb|Koryakova|1998a}}.</ref> is a [[Bronze Age]] [[archaeological culture]] of the northern [[Eurasian steppe]] on the borders of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]], dated to the period 2100–1800 BCE.<ref name="Anthony 2009">{{Harvnb|Anthony|2009}}.</ref> It is probably the archaeological manifestation of the Indo-Iranian language group.{{sfn|Anthony|2009|pp=390 (fig. 15.9), 405–411}}

The Sintashta culture emerged from the interaction of two antecedent cultures. Its immediate predecessor in the Ural-Tobol steppe was the [[Poltavka culture]], an offshoot of the cattle-herding [[Yamnaya culture|Yamnaya horizon]] that moved east into the region between 2800 and 2600 BCE. Several Sintashta towns were built over older Poltavka settlements or close to Poltavka cemeteries, and Poltavka motifs are common on Sintashta pottery. Sintashta [[material culture]] also shows the influence of the late [[Abashevo culture]], a collection of [[Corded Ware]] settlements in the [[forest steppe]] zone north of the Sintashta region that were also predominantly [[pastoralism|pastoralist]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=385–388}} Allentoft et al. (2015) also found close [[AuDNA|autosomal]] genetic relationship between peoples of [[Corded Ware culture]] and Sintashta culture.<ref name="Allentoft et al." />

The earliest known [[chariot]]s have been found in Sintashta burials, and the culture is considered a strong candidate for the origin of the technology, which spread throughout the [[Old World]] and played an important role in [[ancient warfare]].<ref name="Kuznetsov 2006">{{Harvnb|Kuznetsov|2006}}.</ref> Sintashta settlements are also remarkable for the intensity of [[copper]] mining and [[bronze]] [[metallurgy]] carried out there, which is unusual for a steppe culture.<ref name="Hanks & Linduff 2009">{{Harvnb|Hanks|Linduff|2009}}.</ref>

Because of the difficulty of identifying the remains of Sintashta sites beneath those of later settlements, the culture was only recently distinguished from the [[Andronovo culture]].<ref name="Koryakova 1998a"/> It is now recognised as a separate entity forming part of the 'Andronovo horizon'.<ref name="Koryakova 1998b"/>

====Andronovo culture====
{{Main|Andronovo culture}}
[[File:Andronovo culture.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of the approximate maximal extent of the Andronovo culture. The formative Sintashta-Petrovka culture is shown in darker red. The location of the earliest [[spoke]]-wheeled [[chariot]] finds is indicated in purple. Adjacent and overlapping cultures ([[Afanasevo culture]], [[Srubna culture]], [[BMAC]]) are shown in green.]]

The Andronovo culture is a collection of similar local [[Bronze Age]] [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] cultures that flourished c. 1800–900 BCE in western [[Siberia]] and the west [[Asian Steppe|Asiatic steppe]].{{sfn|Mallory|1997|pp=20–21}} It is probably better termed an archaeological complex or [[archaeological horizon]]. The name derives from the village of Andronovo ({{coord|55|53|N|55|42|E|}}), where in 1914, several graves were discovered, with skeletons in crouched positions, buried with richly decorated pottery. The older [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800), formerly included within the Andronovo culture, is now considered separately, but regarded as its predecessor, and accepted as part of the wider Andronovo horizon. At least four sub-cultures of the Andronovo horizon have been distinguished, during which the culture expands towards the south and the east: 
*'''Sintashta-Petrovka-Arkaim''' (Southern [[Urals]], northern [[Kazakhstan]], 2200–1600 BCE)
**the [[Sintashta]] fortification of ca. 1800 BCE in [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]]
** the [[Petrovka settlement]] fortified settlement in Kazakhstan
**the nearby [[Arkaim]] settlement dated to the 17th century
*'''Alakul''' (2100–1400 BCE) between [[Oxus]] and [[Jaxartes]], [[Kyzylkum desert]]
**'''Alekseyevka''' (1300–1100 BCE "final Bronze") in eastern Kazakhstan, contacts with [[Namazga]] VI in Turkmenia
** [[Ingala Valley]] in the south of the [[Tyumen Oblast]]
*'''Fedorovo''' (1500–1300 BCE) in southern Siberia (earliest evidence of [[cremation]] and [[fire worship|fire cult]]){{sfn|Diakonoff|1995|p=473}}
**[[Beshkent district|Beshkent]]-[[Vakhsh, Tajikistan|Vakhsh]] (1000–800 BCE)

The geographical extent of the culture is vast and difficult to delineate exactly. On its western fringes, it overlaps with the approximately contemporaneous, but distinct, [[Srubna culture]] in the [[Volga]]-[[Ural River|Ural]] interfluvial. To the east, it reaches into the [[Minusinsk]] depression, with some sites as far west as the southern [[Ural Mountains]],<ref name=camhist>{{citation|chapter=Inner Asia at the dawn of history|last=Okladnikov|first=A. P.|title=The Cambridge history of early Inner Asia|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-521-24304-9|page=83}}</ref> overlapping with the area of the earlier [[Afanasevo culture]].<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Mallory|1989|p=62}}</ref> Additional sites are scattered as far south as the [[Koppet Dag]] ([[Turkmenistan]]), the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] ([[Tajikistan]]) and the [[Tian Shan]] ([[Kyrgyzstan]]). The northern boundary vaguely corresponds to the beginning of the [[Taiga]].<ref name="camhist"/> In the Volga basin, interaction with the Srubna culture was the most intense and prolonged, and Federovo style pottery is found as far west as [[Volgograd]].

Most researchers associate the Andronovo horizon with early [[Indo-Iranian languages]], though it may have overlapped the early [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking area at its northern fringe. According to Narasimhan et al. (2018), the expansion of the Andronovo culture towards the BMAC took place via the [[Inner Asia Mountain Corridor]].{{sfn|Narasimhan et al.|2018}}

===Bactria-Margiana Culture===
{{Main|BMAC}}
[[File:BMAC.png|thumb|The extent of the BMAC (after [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|''EIEC'']])]]

The Bactria-Margiana Culture, also called "Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex" (BMAC), was a non-Indo-European culture which influenced the Indo-European groups of the second stage of the Indo-European migrations.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} It was centered in what is nowadays northwestern Afghanistan and southern Turkmenistan,{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} and had an elaborate trade-network reachings as far as the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus]] civilisation, the [[Iranian plateau]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref>C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, "Archaeology and Language: The Indo-Iranians", ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 43, no. 1 (Feb.  2002)</ref> Finds within BMAC sites include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a [[Harappa]]n seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe.{{sfn|Kohl|2007|pp=196–199}}

Proto-Indo-Iranian arose due to this BMAC-influence.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} The Indo-Iranians also borrowed their distinctive religious beliefs and practices from this culture.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the [[Zeravshan River]] (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} It was "a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements",{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} which borrowed "distinctive religious beliefs and practices"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} from the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria–Margiana Culture]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} At least 383 non-Indo-European words were borrowed from this culture, including the god [[Indra]] and the ritual drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=454 f.}}

====Syria: Mitanni====
{{Main|Mitanni}}
[[File:Near East 1400 BCE.png|thumb|Map of the Near East, c. 1400 BCE, showing the Kingdom of Mitanni at its greatest extent]]

''Mitanni''  ([[Hittite cuneiform]] {{transl|hit|[[KUR]]<sup>[[Cities of the ancient Near East|URU]]</sup>''Mi-ta-an-ni''}}), also ''Mittani'' ({{transl|hit|Mi-it-ta-ni}}) or ''Hanigalbat'' ([[Assyria]]n  ''Hanigalbat, Khanigalbat'' cuneiform {{transl|akk|Ḫa-ni-gal-bat}}<!--{{cuneiform|}}-->) or ''Naharin'' in ancient Egyptian texts was a [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] (non-Indo-European)-speaking state in northern [[Syria]] and south-east [[Anatolia]] from c. 1500–1300 BCE. Founded by an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] ruling class governing a predominantly [[Hurrian]] population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of [[Amorite]]<ref>{{ cite book | title = The Kingdom of the Hittites | author = Trevor Bryce | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 98 }}</ref> [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Babylon]] and a series of ineffectual [[Assyria]]n kings created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia.

At the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thutmosids]]. However, with the ascent of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BCE, Mitanni had outposts centered around its capital, [[Washukanni]], whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the headwaters of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]]. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to the status of a province of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]].

Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the [[Levant]] of a distinct pottery type.

The [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan peoples]] started to migrate into northwestern India around 1500 BCE, as a slow diffusion during the [[Late Harappan]] period, establishing the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] during the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1500–500 BCE).

The research on the Indo-Aryan migrations began with the study of the [[Rig Veda]] in the mid-19th century by [[Max Muller]], and gradually evolved from a theory of a large scale invasion of a racially and technologically superior people to being a slow diffusion of small numbers of nomadic people that had a disproportionate societal impact on a large urban population. Contemporary claims of Indo-Aryan migrations are drawn from linguistic,{{sfn|Bryant|2001}} archaeological, literary and cultural sources.

During the early part of the Vedic period, the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryans]] settled into northern India, bringing with them their [[Historical Vedic religion|specific religious traditions]]. The associated culture{{refn|group=note|Archaeological cultures identified with phases of Vedic culture include the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]], the [[Gandhara Grave culture]], the [[Black and red ware culture]] and the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]].{{sfn|Witzel|1989}}}} was initially a tribal, [[pastoralism|pastoral]] society centred in the northwestern parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]]; it spread after 1200 BCE to the [[Ganges]] Plain, as it was shaped by increasing settled agriculture, a hierarchy of [[Varna (Hinduism)|four social classes]], and the emergence of monarchical, state-level polities.{{sfn|Witzel|1995|pp=3–5}}{{sfn|Samuel|2010|pp=49–52}}

The end of the Vedic period witnessed the rise of [[Mahajanapada|large, urbanized states]] as well as of [[sramana|shramana]] movements (including [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]) which challenged the Vedic orthodoxy.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=82}} Around the beginning of the Common Era, the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]] formed one of the main constituents of the so-called [[Hinduism#Roots of Hinduism|"Hindu synthesis"]]{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002}}

====Inner Asia: Wusun and Yuezhi====
[[File:Tarimrivermap.png|thumb|right|The Tarim Basin, 2008]]
[[File:Wu-sun Lage.png|thumb|right|Wusun and their neighbours during the late 2nd century BCE, take note that the Yancai did not change their name to [[Alans]] until the 1st century.]]
[[File:Yueh-ChihMigrations.jpg|thumb|right|The migrations of the Yuezhi through Central Asia, from around 176&nbsp;BCE to 30&nbsp;CE]]
{{Main|Wusun|Yuezhi}}

According to [[Christopher I. Beckwith]] the [[Wusun]], an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] people of [[Inner Asia]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], were also of Indo-Aryan origin.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=376–377}} From the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term Wusun, Beckwith reconstructs the [[Old Chinese]] *âswin, which he compares to the [[Old Indic]] aśvin "the horsemen", the name of the [[Rigvedic deities|Rigvedic]] [[Ashvins|twin equestrian gods]].{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=376–377}} Beckwith suggests that the Wusun were an eastern remnant of the Indo-Aryans, who had been suddenly pushed to the extremities of the [[Eurasian Steppe]] by the [[Iranian peoples]] in the 2nd millennium BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=29–38}}

The Wusun are first mentioned by [[China|Chinese]] sources as vassals in the [[Tarim Basin]] of the [[Yuezhi]],{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|pp=84–85}} another Indo-European Caucasian people of possible [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] stock.{{sfn|Loewe|Shaughnessy|1999|pp=83–88}}<ref name="Beckwith380">{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|pp=380–383}}</ref> Around 175 BCE, the Yuezhi were utterly defeated by the [[Xiongnu]], also former vassals of the Yuezhi.<ref name="Beckwith380"/><ref name="ChineseHistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/wusun.html |title=Chinese History – Wusun 烏孫 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Chinaknowledge |publisher= |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref> The Yuezhi subsequently attacked the Wusun and killed their king (Kunmo {{zh|昆彌}} or Kunmi {{zh|昆莫}}) Nandoumi ({{zh|難兜靡}}), capturing the [[Ili River|Ili Valley]] from the [[Saka]] ([[Scythians]]) shortly afterwards.<ref name="ChineseHistory"/> In return the Wusun settled in the former territories of the Yuezhi as vassals of the Xiongnu.<ref name="ChineseHistory"/><ref name="Beckwith6">{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|pp=6–7}}</ref>

The son of Nandoumi was adopted by the Xiongnu king and made leader of the Wusun.<ref name="Beckwith6"/> Around 130 BCE he attacked and utterly defeated the Yuezhi, settling the Wusun in the Ili Valley.<ref name="Beckwith6"/>

After the Yuezhi were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]], in the 2nd century BCE, a small group, known as the Little Yuezhi, fled to the south, while the majority migrated west to the [[Ili River|Ili Valley]], where they displaced the [[Sakas]] ([[Scythians]]). Driven from the Ili Valley shortly afterwards by the [[Wusun]], the Yuezhi migrated to [[Sogdia]] and then [[Bactria]], where they are often identified with the ''Tokhárioi'' (Τοχάριοι) and ''[[Asioi]]'' of Classical sources. They then expanded into northern [[South Asia]], where one branch of the Yuezhi founded the [[Kushan Empire]]. The Kushan empire stretched from [[Turfan]] in the [[Tarim Basin]] to [[Pataliputra]] on the [[Gangetic plain]] at its greatest extent, and played an important role in the development of the [[Silk Road]] and the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|transmission of Buddhism]] to [[China]].

Soon after 130 BCE the Wusun became independent of the Xiongnu, becoming trusted vassals of the [[Han Dynasty]] and powerful force in the region for centuries.<ref name="Beckwith6"/> With the emerging steppe federations of the [[Rouran Khaganate|Rouran]], the Wusun migrated into the [[Pamir Mountains]] in the 5th century CE.<ref name="ChineseHistory"/> They are last mentioned in 938 when a Wusun chieftain paid tribute to the [[Liao dynasty]].<ref name="ChineseHistory"/>

====Mesopotamia – Kassites====
The Kassite language was not Indo-European. However, the appearance of the [[Kassites]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 18th century BCE has been connected to the contemporary [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] expansion into the region at the time.{{sfn|Hollar|2011|pp=62–63}}<ref name=EB_Art>{{cite web |title=Iranian art and architecture: Median period |last1=Lloyd |first1=Seton H.F. |author1link=Seton Lloyd |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293553/Iranian-art-and-architecture/37848/Median-period |url-access=subscription |access-date=14 February 2015 }}</ref><ref name="Harmatta361">{{harvnb|Harmatta|1992|p=561}}</ref>

The set of Iranian-speaking peoples is thus considered a kind of unity, in spite of their distinct lineage identities plus all the factors which may have further differentiated any one group's sense of self."}} (also known as Iranic peoples) are an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic group]] that comprise the speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name="Harmatta357">{{harvnb|Harmatta|1992|p=357}}</ref> Their historical areas of settlement were on the [[Iranian plateau]] (mainly [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]] and Afghanistan) and certain neighbouring areas of Asia (such as parts of the [[Caucasus]], Eastern [[Turkey]], Northeast [[Syria]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Oman]], northern [[Iraq]], Northwestern and Western [[Pakistan]]) reflecting changing geopolitical range of the [[Persian empire]]s and the Iranian history.<ref>{{cite web |last=Skjærvø |first=Prods Oktor |authorlink=Prods Oktor Skjaervo |date=15 December 2006 |title=Iran vi. Iranian languages and scripts |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iran-vi-iranian-languages-and-scripts |accessdate=1 May 2016 }}</ref><ref name="Britannica">{{cite web|title=Iranian languages|author=Ronald Eric Emmerick|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 Feb 2011|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293577/Iranian-languages}}</ref>

The [[Medes]], [[Parthia]]ns and [[Persia]]ns begin to appear on the western [[Iranian plateau]] from c. 800 BCE, after which they remained under [[Assyria]]n rule for several centuries, as it was with the rest of the peoples in the [[Near East]]. The [[Achaemenid]]s replaced Median rule from 559 BCE. Around the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Kambojas]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] began to settle on the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau, on the mountainous frontier of northwestern and western [[Pakistan]], displacing the earlier [[Indo-Aryans]] from the area.

Their current distribution spreads across the [[Iranian plateau]], and stretches from the [[Ossetia|Caucasus]] in the north to the [[Persian Gulf]] in the south, and from the [[Indus River]] in the east to eastern Turkey in the west – a region that is sometimes called the "Iranian cultural continent", or [[Greater Iran]] by some scholars, and represents the extent of the [[Iranian languages]] and significant influence of the Iranian peoples, through the geopolitical reach of the [[History of Iran|Iranian empire]].<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, Richard Nelson]], ''Greater Iran'', {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}} p.''xi'': "... Iran means all lands and people where Iranian languages were and are spoken, and where in the past, multi-faceted Iranian cultures existed. ..."</ref>

The Iranians comprise the present day [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Lurs]], [[Ossetians]], [[Kurds]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Baloch people|Balochs]], [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and their sub-groups of the historic [[Medes]], [[Massagetae]]s, [[Sarmatians]], [[Scythians]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Alans]], [[Bactrians]], [[Sogdia|Soghdians]] and other people of [[Central Asia]], the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Iranian plateau]]. Another possible group are the [[Cimmerians]] who are mostly supposed to have been related to either [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] or [[Thracian language|Thracian]] speaking groups, or at least to have been ruled by an Iranian elite.

====Scythians====
{{Main|Scythia|Scythians}}
[[File:ScythianGroups.png|thumb|left|Scythian and related archaeological groups in circum-Pontic region, c. 7th to 3rd centuries BCE]]
[[File:IndoScythianKingdom.svg|thumb|Territories (full line) and expansion (dotted line) of the Indo-Scythians Kingdom at its greatest extent]]

The first Iranians to reach the [[Black Sea]] may have been the [[Cimmerians]] in the 8th century BCE, although their linguistic affiliation is uncertain. They were followed by the [[Scythians]], who would dominate the area, at their height, from the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, to the eastern-most fringes of [[Central Asia]] in the east, including the [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian Kingdom]] in India. For most of their existence, they were based in what is modern-day Ukraine and southern European [[Russia]].

[[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, of whom the best known are the [[Roxolani]] (Rhoxolani), [[Iazyges]] (Jazyges) and the [[Alani]] (Alans), followed the Scythians westwards into Europe in the late centuries BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries of the Common Era (The [[Age of Migrations]]). The populous Sarmatian tribe of the [[Massagetae]], dwelling near the Caspian Sea, were known to the early rulers of Persia in the Achaemenid Period. In the east, the Saka occupied several areas in Xinjiang, from Khotan to Tumshuq.

====Decline in central Asia====
In Central Asia, the [[Turkic languages]] have marginalized [[Iranian languages]] as a result of the [[Turkic expansion]] of the early centuries CE. In Eastern Europe, [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples]] assimilated and absorbed the native Iranian languages (Scythian and Sarmatian) of the region. Extant major Iranian languages are [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], and [[Balochi language|Balochi]], besides numerous smaller ones.

==Alternative hypotheses==
===Anatolian hypothesis===
{{Main|Anatolian hypothesis}}
The Anatolian hypothesis proposes that the dispersal of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] originated in [[Neolithic]] [[Anatolia]]. The hypothesis suggests that the speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) lived in [[Anatolia]] during the [[Neolithic]] era, and associates the distribution of historical [[Indo-European languages]] with the expansion during the [[Neolithic revolution]] during the 7th and 6th millennia BCE. The alternative and more academically favored view is the [[Kurgan hypothesis]].

The main proponent of the Anatolian hypothesis was [[Colin Renfrew]], who in 1987 suggested a peaceful Indo-Europeanization of Europe from Anatolia from around 7000 BCE with the advance of farming by [[demic diffusion]] ("wave of advance"). Accordingly, most of the inhabitants of [[Neolithic Europe]] would have spoken Indo-European languages, and later migrations would at best have replaced these Indo-European varieties with other Indo-European varieties.<ref>{{harvnb|Renfrew|1990}}.</ref>

The main strength of the farming hypothesis lies in its linking of the spread of Indo-European languages with an archaeologically known event (the spread of farming) that is often assumed as involving significant population shifts.

===Armenian hypothesis===
{{Main|Armenian hypothesis}}

Gamkrelidze and Ivanov held that the urheimat was south of the Caucasus, specifically, "within eastern Anatolia, the southern Caucasus and northern Mesopotamia" in the fifth to fourth millennia BC.<ref>{{citation|last1=Gamkrelidze|first1=Thomas V.|last2=Ivanov|first2=Vjačeslav V.|title=Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans: A Reconstruction and Historical Analysis of a Proto-Language and Proto-Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2aqp2n2mKkC&pg=PA791|year=1995|publisher=Moutin de Gruyter|pages=791ff|isbn=9783110815030}}</ref> Their proposal was based on a disputed [[Glottalic theory|theory of glottal consonants]] in PIE. According to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, PIE words for material culture objects imply contact with more advanced peoples to the south, the existence of Semitic loan-words in PIE, Kartvelian (Georgian) borrowings from PIE, some contact with Sumerian, Elamite and others. However, given that the glottalic theory never caught on and there was little archaeological support, the Gamkrelidze and Ivanov theory did not gain support until Renfrew's Anatolian theory revived aspects of their proposal.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} Recent DNA-research has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian homeland for a 'proto-proto-Indo-European'.{{sfn|Haak|2015}}{{sfn|Reich|2018|p=177}}{{sfn|Damgaard|2018}}{{sfn|Wang|2018}}{{sfn|Grolle|2018|p=108}}

===Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm===
{{Main|Paleolithic Continuity Theory}}

The "Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm" is a [[hypothesis]] suggesting that the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) can be traced back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], several millennia earlier than the [[Chalcolithic]] or at the most [[Neolithic]] estimates in other scenarios of [[Proto-Indo-European origins]]. Its main proponents are [[Marcel Otte]], [[Alexander Häusler (archaeologist)|Alexander Häusler]], and [[Mario Alinei]].

The PCT posits that the advent of Indo-European languages should be linked to the arrival of [[Archaic humans|Homo sapiens]] in Europe and Asia from Africa in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].{{r|PCP_Alinei16|group=web}} Employing "lexical periodization", Alinei arrives at a timeline deeper than even that of [[Colin Renfrew]]'s [[Anatolian hypothesis]].{{refn|group=note|Mario Alinei (with reference to Francisco Villar, ''Los indoeuropeos y los orígines de Europa. Lenguaje y historia'', Gredos, Madrid 1991): "The sharp, and now at last admitted even by traditionalists (Villar 1991) differentiation of farming terminology in the different IE languages, while absolutely unexplainable in the context of [[Anatolian hypothesis|Renfrew's NDT]], provides yet another fundamental proof that the differentiation of IE languages goes back to remote prehistory."}}{{r|PCP_Alinei16|group=web}}

Since 2004, an informal workgroup of scholars who support the Paleolithic Continuity hypothesis has been held online.{{r|PCP_workgroup|group=web}}  Apart from Alinei himself, its leading members (referred to as "Scientific Committee" in the website) are linguists [[Xaverio Ballester]] ([[University of Valencia]]) and [[Francesco Benozzo]] ([[University of Bologna]]). Also included are prehistorian [[Marcel Otte]] ([[Université de Liège]]) and anthropologist [[Henry Harpending]] ([[University of Utah]]).{{r|PCP_Alinei16|group=web}}

===Indian origins===
{{Main|Indigenous Aryans}}

The notion of "indigenous Aryans" posits that speakers of Indo-Aryan languages are "indigenous" to the Indian subcontinent. Scholars like [[Jim G. Shaffer]] and B. B. Lal note the absence of archaeological remains of an Aryan "conquest", and the high degree of physical continuity between Harappan and Post-Harappan society.{{r|EB-IAS}} They support the controversial<ref name=EB-IAS>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Stanley A. Wolpert |title=The appearance of Indo-Aryan speakers |url= https://www.britannica.com/place/India/The-end-of-the-Indus-civilization |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] }}</ref> hypothesis that the Indo-Aryan civilization was not introduced by Aryan migrations, but originated in pre-Vedic India.{{r|EB-IAS}}

In recent years, the concept of "indigenous Aryans" has been increasingly conflated with an "Out of India" origin of the Indo-European language family. This contrasts with the model of Indo-Aryan migration which posits that Indo-Aryan tribes migrated to India from Central Asia. Some furthermore claim that all Indo-European languages originated in India.{{refn|group=note|Bryant: "It must be stated immediately that there is an unavoidable corollary of an Indigenist position. If the Indo-Aryan languages did not come from outside South Asia, this necessarily entails that India was the original homeland of all the other Indo-European languages."{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=6}}}} These claims remain problematic.{{clarify | reason=Very judgemental claim to make without any context or explanation|date=February 2018}}{{refn|group=note|Bryant: "There is at least a series of archaeological cultures that can be traced approaching the Indian subcontinent, even if discontinuous, which does not seem to be the case for any hypothetical east-to-west emigration."{{sfn|Bryant|2001|p=236}}}}
