'''Elizabeth Josephine Brown''' (June 12, 1839 â€“ January 16, 1874) was the daughter and biographer of escaped African-American slave [[William Wells Brown]] and his first wife Elizabeth Schooner. Josephine's account, ''Biography of an American Bondman, by His Daughter,'' was published in Boston by R. F. Wallcut in 1856.<ref name=DocSouth/> It was long believed to be the first biography written by an African American woman, but is now known to have been predated by [[Susan Paul]]'s ''Memoir of James Jackson, the attentive and obedient scholar'' (1835).<ref name=Paul>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Susan|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Lois|title=Memoir of James Jackson the attentive and obedient scholar, who died in Boston, October 31, 1833, aged six years and eleven months|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0674002377}}</ref>

''Biography of an American Bondman'' draws heavily on and generally parallels William Wells Brown's own account of his life, ''Narrative of William W. Brown, A Fugitive Slave'' (1847). However, Josephine was forthcoming about details of abuse and mistreatment which Wells Brown's account does not include, and openly addressed the problems of [[mulatto]] slaves. She also expands the account to include Brown's life in Europe.<ref name=DocSouth>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Jenn|title=Josephine Brown|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/brownj/summary.html|publisher=Documenting the American South|year=2004|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Josephine's father, William Wells Brown, was one of seven children born in slavery to Elizabeth, a slave of Dr. John Young near Lexington, Kentucky.<ref name=Southern>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=William Wells|title=My southern home or, the South and its people|year=2011|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=080786935X|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/brown80/menu.html|editor-last=Ernest|editor-first=John}}</ref>  Born in 1814, William was acknowledged as the son of George W. Higgins, a relative of Brown's owner.<ref name=DocSouth/><ref name=Website>{{cite web|title=Chronology: William Wells Brown|url=http://williamwellsbrown.org/chronology/|publisher=WilliamWellsBrown.org|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> In 1834, Brown escaped to the north and settled in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. There he married his first wife Elizabeth Schooner of Scipio Center, [[Seneca County, Ohio]] (now the town of [[Republic, Ohio]]) who was of mixed [[African-American]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry.<ref name=Farrisson>{{cite journal|last=Farrisson|first=William E.|title=WILLIAM WELLS BROWN IN BUFFALO|journal=The Journal of Negro History|year=1954|volume=39|issue=4|url=http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/1836WELLsbROWNBUFFALO.html|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref>

Two daughters were born to the Browns while they lived in Cleveland.  Their first daughter, born in 1835, died while still a baby.  Their second daughter, Clarissa, was born in the spring of 1836. That summer, the Browns moved to [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=Website/>  Although it has been long assumed that Elizabeth Josephine Brown, their third daughter, was born in Buffalo in 1839,<ref name=Farrisson/> on two occasions, Josephine (who went by her middle name) stated that she was born in the city of [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].<ref>1850 Federal Census for the city of New Bedford, Bristol County, Massachusetts; Marriage Certificate of George S.

In 1845, the Browns moved to [[Farmington, New York]].<ref name=Website/><ref name=Bolden>{{cite web|last=Bolden|first=Tonya|title=Biographies|url=http://digital.nypl.org/schomburg/writers_aa19/bio2.html|publisher=Digital Schomburg, New York Public Library|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>  Wells Brown and his Elizabeth Schooner separated in 1847. He retained custody of his daughters, and moved to [[Boston]].  While he traveled as an abolitionist and lecturer, Clarissa and Josephine attended boarding school, living at 21 Seventh Street in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].  There they were pupils of well-known abolitionist, Nathan Johnson.<ref name=DocSouth/><ref name=Bedford>{{cite web|title=William Wells Brown|url=http://www.nbhistoricalsociety.org/williamwellsbrown.html|publisher=New Bedford Historical Society|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

==European travel and education==
In 1849, Wells Brown was invited to attend the [[International Peace Congress]] in Paris, to speak against slavery.<ref name=DocSouth/> Following passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]], Brown decided to remain, lecturing and writing.<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Website/>

In 1851 Clarissa and Josephine joined Wells Brown briefly in London, before being placed at a boarding school in Calais, France. In 1852, the girls returned to London, training at the Home and Colonial School to become teachers or governesses.<ref name=Website/> During this time, Josephine may have sometimes worked with her father in support of abolition, joining him on his lecture tours and transcribing his correspondence.<ref name=DocSouth/>  In December 1853, Josephine passed her qualifying examinations, and accepted a position as school mistress of the East Plumstead School in Woolwich, England.<ref name=Website/>

Josephine's mother died in Buffalo in 1852.<ref name=Website/>  In 1854, Wells Brown's freedom was purchased from his owner by abolitionist supporters, and he returned to the United States.<ref name=Website/>  His daughters remained in England.

==Activism==

=== Anti-slavery lecturing and writing===
In 1855, Josephine chose to return to America, escorted on the transatlantic voyage by abolitionist [[Horace Greeley]].<ref name=Website/>  She joined her father in Boston, working with him for a time as an antislavery lecturer in New England.<ref name=DocSouth/>
[[File:Brown title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Biography of an American Bondman, by His Daughter'']]
Concerned that his biography was no longer in print, Josephine published ''Biography of an American Bondman'' (1856) to preserve his legacy.<ref name=DocSouth/>  Begun while Josephine was at school in France, her biography reworks material from Wells Brown's 1847 autobiography while adding additional detail on abuses he experienced while a slave, and the hostility that mulatto slaves experienced from both blacks and whites.  Josephine also describes his travels in Great Britain.<ref name=DocSouth/>
