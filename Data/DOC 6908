The '''2006 1000 Guineas Stakes''' was a [[horse racing|horse race]] held at [[Newmarket Racecourse]] on Sunday 7 May 2006. It was the 193rd running of the [[1000 Guineas]].

The winner was Pam Sly, Michael Sly and Tom Davies's [[Speciosa]], an Irish-bred [[bay (horse)|bay]] [[filly]] trained by Pam Sly at [[Thorney, Cambridgeshire|Thorney]] in Cambridgeshire and ridden by Micky Fenton. Speciosa's victory was the first in the race for her owner, trainer and jockey. The race was run on soft ground.

==The contenders==
The race attracted a field of thirteen runners, ten trained in the United Kingdom and three in Ireland: there were no challengers from [[continental Europe]]. The favourite was the [[Ballydoyle]]-trained [[Rumplestiltskin (horse)|Rumplestiltskin]] who had been named [[Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly|European Champion Two-year old Filly]] in 2005 when she had won the [[Moyglare Stud Stakes]] in Ireland and the [[Prix Marcel Boussac]] in France. The other Irish challengers were the favourite's stable companion Race for the Stars (winner of the [[Oh So Sharp Stakes]]), and the [[Tommy Stack]]-trained Alexander Alliance, who had won a Listed race at the [[Curragh Racecourse]] in October. The best of the British-trained runners appeared to be, Silca's Sister ([[Prix Morny]]), Flashy Wings ([[Queen Mary Stakes]], [[Lowther Stakes]]) and Nannina ([[Prestige Stakes]], [[Fillies' Mile]]). Other [[Group races|Group race]] winners included the [[Nell Gwyn Stakes]] winner Speciosa, Nasheej ([[Sweet Solera Stakes]], [[May Hill Stakes]], [[Fred Darling Stakes]]), La Chunga ([[Albany Stakes (Great Britain)|Albany Stakes]]), Confidential Lady ([[Prix du Calvados]]) and Donna Blini ([[Cherry Hinton Stakes]], [[Cheveley Park Stakes]]). Rumplestiltskin headed the betting at odds of [[Fractional odds|3/1]] ahead of Silca's Sister (13/2) with Flashy Wings and Nannina on 7/1.<ref name="racingpost2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=401435&r_date=2006-05-07&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=1000 Guineas result |work=[[Racing Post]] |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

==The race==
Shortly after the start, the fillies split into two groups across the wide Newmarket straight, with the larger group racing up the stands side (the left of the course from the jockeys' viewpoint), with the smaller group running down the centre of the course. Speciosa headed the stands side group from Confidential Lady and Wake Up Maggie, whilst Donna Blini led the centre group before being overtaken by Nasheej after three furlongs. Speciosa, Confidential Lady and Nasheej held the first three places for the rest of the race, with none of the fillies held up towards the rear making any impact. In the closing stages Speciosa steadily increased her advantage and won by two and a half lengths from Confidential Lady, with Nasheej a length away in third. Silca's Sister took fourth ahead of the outsiders Wake Up Maggie and [[Spinning Queen]], with Rumplestiltskin in seventh.<ref name="racingpost2006"/>

Speciosa's victory was enthusiastically received by the Newmarket crowd, who gave the filly and her connections [[three cheers]]. Pam Sly described the win as being "for all the little people" and the success of a small stable was contrasted with those achieved by the major international racing organisations such as [[Coolmore Stud|Coolmore]] and [[Godolphin Racing|Godolphin]].<ref name="telegraph1">{{cite news|author=Horse Racing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/2336577/Speciosa-strikes-major-blow-for-little-people.html |title=Speciosa strikes major blow for 'little people' |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>
