'''ObjectSecurity''' is an information technology company focusing on [[information security]] ([[model-driven security]], fine-grained [[access control]], [[middleware]] security), supply chain risk analysis, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. The company pioneered the development of [[model-driven security]],<ref name="mds">{{ cite web| url= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OMtUAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA103&ots=ExgEmlf-3v&sig=ygF7skKNujMm5IwHovlutnmcZms#v=onepage&q=lang%20%26%20schreiner&f=false | title = Atif Memon (editor). Advances in Computers Volume 93. Academic Press (Elseviwer), 2014, ISBN 978-0-12-800162-2, page 113 }}</ref> which was mostly an academic concept prior to the company's developments. The company is best known for their ''OpenPMF'' (Open Policy Management Framework) [[model-driven security]] product,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.openpmf.com | title = OpenPMF Website}}</ref> for which the company received a "''Cool Vendor''" award from [[Gartner]] in 2008.<ref name="coolvendor">{{cite web| url= https://www.gartner.com/doc/639714/cool-vendors-application-security-authentication | title = Cool Vendors in Application Security and Authentication, 2008 }}</ref>

==History==
ObjectSecurity was founded in 2000 by information security experts, Ulrich Lang and Rudolf Schreiner.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.objectsecurity.com/en-contact-team.html | title = ObjectSecurity Team Website }}</ref> At that time, Lang was a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]] [[Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge|Computer Laboratory]], working on "Access Policies for [[Middleware]]", and both were working as independent information security consultants.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-564.pdf | title = Dr. Lang, Access Policies for Middleware, PhD Thesis }}</ref>

Initially, ObjectSecurity was mainly working on customer projects around [[middleware]] security, esp. [[CORBA]], but they quickly remarked that it was not possible to author and maintain security configurations for interconnected, distributed application environments. In an attempt to solve this challenges, the team built a full [[Object Management Group|OMG]] [[CORBA]] Security SL3 & [[SSLIOP]] open source implementation based on [[MICO]] CORBA.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.artechhouse.com/Main/Books/Developing-Secure-Distributed-Systems-with-CORBA-749.aspx | title = Ulrich Lang, Rudolf Schreiner. Developing Secure Distributed Systems with CORBA. Artech House Publisher, 2002, ISBN 1-58053-295-0 }}</ref>

To solve various challenges around implementing secure distributed systems, ObjectSecurity released OpenPMF version 1,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.hoise.com/primeur/04/articles/monthly/AE-PR-09-04-61.html | title = Gerald Lorang. New Coach platform improves development of distributed applications. Primeur Magazine, 2004 }}</ref> at that time one of the first [[Attribute Based Access Control]] (ABAC) products in the market. It allowed the central authoring of access rules, and the automatic enforcement across all middleware nodes using local decision/enforcement points. Thanks to the support of several [[European Union|EU]] funded research projects, ObjectSecurity found that a central ABAC approach alone was not a manageable way to implement security policies.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://ec.europa.eu/research/transport/projects/items/ad4_en.htm | title = AD4EU FP6 Project Website }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://objectsecurity.com/doc/coachprojectflyer.pdf | title = COACH project flyer }}</ref>

ObjectSecurity released OpenPMF version 2. It is based on a concept called [[model-driven security]] which allows the intuitive, business-centric specification of security requirements and the automatic generation of enforceable securities policies.<ref name="mds" /><ref name="ltn">{{ cite web| url= http://objectsecurity.com/doc/LTnetwork-ICT-SIG-newsletter-April-2008-cached.pdf | title = The newsletter of LTNâ€™s Information & Communications Technologies Special Interest Group 2008, p.4 (PDF hosted by ObjectSecurity, LTN is not operating anymore )}}</ref> OpenPMF version 2 was designed to bridge the semantic gap between the policies that users manage, and the policies that are technically implemented. At the time of the release of OpenPMF version 2, [[model-driven security]] was tied together with a [[model-driven development]] process for applications, especially for agile [[service oriented architecture]] (SOA).<ref name="ltn" />

After years of publishing and presenting the scientific and technical approach, some analyst firms, such as [[Gartner]] took note of the scientific approach.<ref name="publist">{{cite web| url= http://www.objectsecurity.com/en-home-resources.html | title = ObjectSecurity Publications Website }}</ref> Several other awards and recognition followed.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.objectsecurity.com/doc/ISSE%202009-10-07_TeleTrusT%20Innovation%20Award_090930-EN.pdf | title = TeleTrusT Awards }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ring/awards.html | title = University of Cambridge Computer Lab Ring Awards }}</ref> OpenPMF version 3 was released in 2010, supporting advanced policies, Eclipse, cloud, BPMN,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.infoworld.com/article/2631386/open-source-software/open-source-software-best-of-open-source-software-awards-2009.html?page=2 | title = Best of Open Source Software Awards 2009 (mentions the OpenPMF 2.0 integration into the open source Intalio BPMS }}</ref> SOA, XACML, pub-sub/DDS, and numerous additional enforcement points.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.objectsecurity.com/doc/20100222_openpmf30.pdf | title = ObjectSecurity OpenPMF v3 Release }}</ref> ObjectSecurity also extended their [[model-driven security]] approach to include automatic compliance/accreditation analysis and evidence generation<ref>{{cite web| url= http://csis.gmu.edu/wisg2009/ | title = Rudolf Schreiner and Ulrich Lang, "Model Driven Security Accreditation (MDSA) For Agile, Interconnected IT Landscapes", WISG Conference Proceedings 2009 }}</ref>

In 2009, ObjectSecurity set up an independent legal entity in [[California]], United States to be closer to their US-based customers.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/07/20/smallb3.html?page=all/ | title = ObjectSecurity in Palo Alto aims to make security automatic, Silicon Valley Business Journal, 2009 }}</ref>

In recent years, ObjectSecurity has extended OpenPMF to support automatic system detection, automated formal testing <ref name="nist">{{cite web| url= https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Access-Control-Policy-Tool/Beta-Release-Of-Access-Control-Policy-Tool | title = Beta Release Of Access Control Policy Tool, retrieved 2018 }}</ref>, virtual reality support, API server etc., enabling security policy automation without the need to install local agents, and allowing the use of [[model-driven security]] without the need for a [[model-driven development]]. OpenPMF's support for advanced access control models including proximity-based access control, PBAC was also further extended.<ref name="pbac">{{cite web| url= https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/415285 | title = Proximity Based Access Control SBIR Award Notice, 2013 }}</ref>

In 2017, ObjectSecurity released OpenPMF version 4.0, which includes a new browser-based user interface, cloud support, and numerous other features.
