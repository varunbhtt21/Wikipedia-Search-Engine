== Background and development ==

Ringo Sheena had taken an interest in the band in the early 2000s, attending live concerts of theirs before their debut in 2003.<ref name="Musicshelf">{{cite web | url=http://musicshelf.jp/pickup/id424/ | title=特集 SOIL&"PIMP"SESSIONS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426113243/http://musicshelf.jp/pickup/id424/ |author=Taihei Kubota |publisher=Music Shelf |archivedate=April 26, 2014 | language=Japanese | date=August 8, 2013 | accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> They had collaborated several times in the past, the first time on the digital single "[[Karisome Otome|Karisome Otome (Death Jazz Version)]]" in 2006. They collaborated again in 2009 on Sheena's song "Mayakashi Yasaotoko" from the album ''[[Sanmon Gossip]]'',<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=''[[Sanmon Gossip]]'' |others=[[Ringo Sheena]] |year=2009 |language=Japanese |publisher=Universal |location=Tokyo, Japan}}</ref> and the Soil & "Pimp" Sessions song "My Foolish Heart" on their album ''6''.

"Koroshiya Kiki Ippatsu" was a single released to commemorate Soil & "Pimp" Sessions' 10th anniversary.<ref name="VictorNews">{{cite web | url=http://www.jvcmusic.co.jp/-/Information/A018653.html | script-title=ja:ニュース |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426103445/http://www.jvcmusic.co.jp/-/Information/A018653.html |publisher=Victor Entertainment |archivedate=April 26, 2014 | language=Japanese | accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> It was the second collaboration single released by Soil & "Pimp" Sessions in 2013, after "Jazzy Conversation" with [[Rhymester (group)|Rhymester]]. These were compiled on the album ''Circles'', an album featuring Soil & "Pimp" Sessions collaborating with different vocalists. Similarly, at the end of 2013, Ringo Sheena released the album ''[[Ukina]]'', an album that compiled collaborations she had undertaken between 1998 and 2013.

== Writing and production ==

The song features an arrangement by conductor [[Neko Saito]], who has collaborated with Sheena on many occasions. This was rare for Soil & "Pimp" Sessions, as they generally did not collaborate with outside arrangers for their music.<ref name="Musicshelf"/> As such, the song features many instruments that are not present in other Soil & "Pimp" Sessions songs: a string section, the [[timpani]], and the harp.<ref name="VictorNews"/> A bonus track on ''Circles'', "Koroshiya Kiki Ippatsu (Death Jazz Ver.)," features an arrangement by Soil & "Pimp" Sessions.<ref name="VictorNews"/>

== Promotion and release ==

On September 27, 2013, Soil & "Pimp" Sessions held a live at Billboard Live in Tokyo. Sheena made a guest appearance, performing "Koroshiya Kiki Ippatsu" and her previous collaborations with the band, "My Foolish Heart" and "Karisome Otome." The single's B-side "Pimp Panther" was also performed by the band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://natalie.mu/music/news/100206 | title=SOIL×椎名林檎、六本木夜景をバックに豪華セッション |trans-title=Soil x Sheena, luxurious session backed with the Roppongi night skyline |publisher=Natalie | language=Japanese |date=September 27, 2013 | accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> During Sheena's ''Tōtaikai'' concerts in November 2013, she performed "Koroshiya Kiki Ippatsu" with her concert band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/237797/products/cinema/1062141/1/ | script-title=ja:党大会　平成二十五年神山町大会 |publisher=Oricon | language=Japanese | accessdate=April 10, 2014}}</ref>
