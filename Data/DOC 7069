The '''Lewis–Cutler ministry''' or '''First Lewis ministry''' was the 68th ministry of the [[New South Wales Government]], and was led by the 33rd [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]], the Honourable [[Tom Lewis (Australian politician)|Tom Lewis]] {{post-nominals|AUS|MLA}}, of the [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal Party]] in [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] with the [[National Party of Australia – NSW|Country Party]], led by the Honourable Sir [[Charles Cutler]] {{post-nominals|AUS|KBE|ED|MLA}}. It was the first of two occasions when Lewis was Premier; and the seventh and final occasion when Cutler served as [[Deputy Premier of New South Wales|Deputy Premier]].

==Background==
Lewis was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] in 1957 and served continuously until 1978, representing the seat of [[Electoral district of Wollondilly|Wollondilly]]. When the Askin government came to power in 1965, Lewis was given relatively junior portfolios of Lands and Mines. In 1972, Tourism was added to his ministerial responsibilities when [[Eric Willis]] moved to Education. Late in 1974, Askin announced his resignation and Lewis was chosen as leader over Willis and Justice Minister [[John Maddison]].

Cutler was elected to the NSW Legislative Assembly in 1947 and served continuously until 1975, representing the seat of [[Electoral district of Orange|Orange]]. Elected Deputy Leader of the Country Party in 1958, Cutler was elected as leader of his party following the 1959 state election, replacing Davis Hughes.

Lewis inherited a relatively stable government that had been in power for ten years. However, the Liberal government was engaged in almost daily warfare with the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor federal government, most notably over the [[Medibank]] health care scheme, to which New South Wales was the last state to sign.

==Tenure of ministry==
This ministry covers the period from 3 January 1975, when the former Premier, Sir [[Robert Askin]] {{post-nominals|AUS|KCMG|MLA}} resigned as Premier and as Member for Pittwater, until 17 December 1975,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/Archives_MemberPage |title=Former Members - Chronological List of Ministries 1856 to 2009 (requires download) |work=Project for the Sesquicentenary of Responsible Government in NSW |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |format=[[Microsoft Excel|MS Excel spreadsheet]] |accessdate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315063124/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/Archives_MemberPage/ |archivedate=15 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Wah |first=Malvyne Jong |author2=Page, Jeffrey E. |date=November 2007 |title=New South Wales Parliamentary Record 1824 &ndash; 2007 |volume=VI |pages=[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/cbe381f08171c2e8ca256fca007d6044/83a94d96a772d982ca257b89000d89ad/$FILE/Part%206.pdf#page=41 41] |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/cbe381f08171c2e8ca256fca007d6044/83a94d96a772d982ca257b89000d89ad/$FILE/Part%206.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=26 April 2014 }}</ref> the day after Cutler resigned as Deputy Premier, the Leader of the Country Party, and as Member for Orange.

The Hon. [[Leon Punch]], MLA succeeded Cutler as the Leader of the Country Party and became Deputy Premier, and entered into a Liberal/Country coalition with Lewis, necessitating a reconfiguration of the ministry. The Lewis/Punch ministry lasted a few months until Lewis was deposed as Liberal leader by The Hon. [[Eric Willis]] {{post-nominals|AUS|CMG|MLA}} in January 1976, necessitating a further reconfiguration of the ministry.

==Composition of ministry==

===First arrangement===
The composition of the ministry was announced by Premier Lewis and sworn in on 3 January 1975, and covers the period until 30 June 1975, when the Hon. [[Milton Morris]] resigned from the ministry, necessitating a minor rearrangement. Ministers are listed in order of seniority and in some cases, serve the full term of this ministry.
