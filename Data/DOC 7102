| text    = '''Sir Leslie Patrick Abercrombie ''' (6 June 1879 â€“ 23 March 1957) was an English town planner. After training as an [[architect]], he became [[Professor]] of Civic Design at the [[Liverpool University]] School of Architecture, and later Professor of Town Planning at [[University College London]]. He was closely involved in the founding of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England ([[Council for the Preservation of Rural England|CPRE]]). After its formation in December 1926, he served as its Honorary Secretary. He was knighted in 1945. In 1948, he became the first president of the newly formed [[International Union of Architects]] or UIA (Union Internationale des Architectes).

Abercrombie is best known for the post-[[Second World War]] replanning of [[London]] and other British and international cities. He created the [[County of London Plan]] (1943) and the [[Greater London Plan]] (1944) which are commonly referred to as the ''Abercrombie Plan''. The two plans proposed widespread reconstruction and replanning of the city and the urban areas of the surrounding counties and road and rail infrastructure including the construction of a series of concentric ring roads and underground rail loops to connect main line stations below ground to replace surface routes.
