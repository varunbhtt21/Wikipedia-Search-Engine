While I support advocacies like this, there is not enough coverage for this in reliable sources. Only source given is Change.org and an endorsment. Having notable signers is not necessarily a claim to notability. PROD was removed by author.

'''Delete''' as advertising for a change.org petition which has had no media coverage and is not notable. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.3.144|101.117.3.144]] ([[User talk:101.117.3.144|talk]]) 22:58, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:'''Update''' Hi. I'm not used to using the talk page. I appreciate the note about supporting advocacies like this. I thought from the instructions that it would be okay to remove the PROD because of the paragraph I added about the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer. I've now added a further paragraph about an article amplifying the issues in the petition that was published in the Medical Journal of Australia's MJA InSight newsletter. The petition is linked in the author bio at the end of the article. Thanks for making this article better.[[User:TheKwais|TheKwais]] ([[User talk:TheKwais|talk]]) 02:32, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::*[[Paul Sanderson]] is notable, and we have an article about him. [[Cancer immunotherapy]] is notable, and we have an article about it. This petition is '''not''' notable, and Paul Sanderson's newletter article does not contribute to making it so, since that article is not independent/3rd-party. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.110.186|101.117.110.186]] ([[User talk:101.117.110.186|talk]]) 09:00, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' There is no demonstrated notability . Adding the material on the Society does not help the situation. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer ''might'' however be notable, including a redirect from the name of its journal. The society however did not originate the petition, but is merely supporting it, so I am not even sure that a mention of the petition would  be appropriate there any more than its other supporters.. The policy is NOT ADVOCACY, ait applies to links as well as articles, and it applies even to the best causes. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 16:35, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
