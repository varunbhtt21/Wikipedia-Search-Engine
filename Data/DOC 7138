On 23 February 2016 Pysz appeared at London's [[PizzaExpress Jazz Club]] with his Quartet.

==Instruments==
Pysz mainly plays acoustic and flamenco/classical guitars with various models of Godin guitar. While his favourite guitar is a Godin Grand Concert SA, he also plays a Tanglewood steel string acoustic guitar.

==Style==
Pysz mostly plays with a plectrum and has his own picking style, he uses a lot of rhythm variations in his playing, and sometimes uses a fingerstyle, often switching from one to the other in one song. His style is soft, clean, melodic and highly emotional.<ref name="londonjazznews.com">Ryan, Al in London Jazz News"[http://www.londonjazznews.com/2013/07/cd-review-maciek-pysz-trio-insight.html "Review of Insight"],(01/07/2013) retrieved 30 June 2014.</ref> Of his style on ''Insight'', the critic Jack Massarik in [[Jazzwise]] said [this is] "Melodic music played with sensitivity and conviction in a style that borrows more from folk and contemporary classical music than jazz...".<ref name="Maciek Pysz Trio Insight">Massarik, Jack.

Bruce Lindsay in [[All About Jazz]] wrote "Pysz favors a crystal clear acoustic sound, delicate yet precise finger-work and fluid melodies. Pysz overdubs lead and rhythm guitar on much of the album, creating a fuller, richer sound in so doing. "Those Days" is a fine opening track: Pysz' lead lines are forceful and upbeat, his rhythm playing full-toned."<ref name="All About Jazz"/> In London Jazz News, John Watson wrote of a performance in March 2017 "However impressive his technique may be, it is certainly not “showy” – everything is at the service of creative expression." <ref name="London Jazz News">Watson, John (11 March 2017) [http://www.londonjazznews.com/2017/03/review-maciek-pysz-quartet-at-red-lion.html "Review: Maciek Pysz Quartet at The Red Lion Birmingham"], London Jazz News, retrieved 19 July 2017</ref>
