== Personal life ==
Mandal was born in [[Birbhum]] during the 1960s.  He is one of the founders of the Trinamool Congress in Birbhum. He is a controversial figure in [[West Bengal]].<ref name="AV">{{cite AV media |people=Anubrata Mandal |date= 26 April 2014|title=Bhin Desh e tara|trans-title=On a different country|medium= Television|language=Bengali|time= 5:30 p.m 26 April 2014 IST|location= Kolkata|publisher=Focus Bangla |id=|isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

It was claimed by Trinamool leaders that he has [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] for which he has to carry oxygen with him.<ref name="TOI3" /> Mandal has supported other Trinamool leaders in political campaigns for the [[election|2014 Lok Sabha general elections]].<ref name="AV" />

== Political controversy ==
Mandal became embroiled in political controversy at the time the Trinamool Congress came to power. During the [[panchayat]] elections of July 2013, he publicly encouraged Trinamool supporters to hurl bombs at the police and burn down the houses of independent candidates.<ref name="TOI1" /> Less than a week after Mandal made that speech, independent candidate Sagar Ghosh was shot and killed at his home in the village of Parui; the victim's family claimed that Mandal was involved.<ref name="TOI2">{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Parui case Kin to appeal in Supreme Court|deadurl= |newspaper= [[Times of India]]|location=Kolkata|publisher= Times of India |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=28 April 2014|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/City/Kolkata/Parui-case-Kin-to-appeal-in-SC/articleshow/33925895.cms}}</ref>

Opposition parties charged that Mandal's speeches strongly provoked Trinamool supporters, resulting in the murder of Ghosh. The chief minister of [[West Bengal]], [[Mamata Banerjee]], supported Mandal, calling him "an efficient organizer" and vowing to "defend him to the end".<ref name="TOI3">{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title= Mamata defends murder accused leader Anubrata Mandal|deadurl= |newspaper= Times of India|location= Kolkata

While speaking at a party event in [[Katwa]], Burdwan in November 2013, Mandal is reported to have said: "If anyone threatens Trinamool supporters, then our workers will also attack their houses at night."<ref name="Eco">{{cite news |last= |first= |date=9 November 2013 |title= Trinamool leader Anubrata Mandal threatens again, party leadership stands by him|deadurl= |newspaper=[[The Economic Times|Economic Times]] |location=Kolkata|publisher= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=28 April 2014|url=http://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tmc-leader-anubrata-mandal-threatens-again-party-leadership-stands-by-him/articleshow/25517597.cms}}</ref> Mandal also reportedly threatened to chop off the hands of [[Indian National Congress]] candidates, although a party official denies he ever said that.<ref name="Eco" />

He has been cited on two different occasions for showing a disrespectful altitude towards opposition parties.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title= Second showcause notice to Trinamool Congress leader Anubrata Mandal|deadurl= |newspaper= Business-Standard|location=Kolkata|publisher= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 28 April 2014|url=http://wap.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/second-showcause-notice-to-tmc-leader-anubrata-mandal-114032900618_1.html}}</ref>
