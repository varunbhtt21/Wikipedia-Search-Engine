*'''Delete''' - unreferenced software article of unclear notability; a search turned up incidental mentions and one substantial review at photoshopdaily.co.uk [http://www.photoshopdaily.co.uk/reviews/engraver-ii-by-alphaplugins-review/], on its own not sufficient to establish notability. Article was created by an [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|SPA]] as possibly promotional.[[User:Dialectric|Dialectric]] ([[User talk:Dialectric|talk]]) 14:51, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
