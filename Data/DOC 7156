Non-notable game development company. Lots of sources, some may even be non-affiliated, but they describe individual games, not the company, so [[WP:INHERIT]] applies. [[User:Qwertyus|Q<small>VVERTYVS</small>]] <small>([[User talk:Qwertyus|hm?]])</small> 13:43, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' The company itself appears to have little to no coverage in secondary sources that would show notability. The only thing I could find in a news search was a press release from the company itself, which obviously doesn't meet our standards. Unfortunately, this seems to fail [[WP:ORG]] and [[WP:GNG]].
