The '''Winchester Memorial Church''', also known as the '''New Hampshire Conservatory of Music and the Arts''', is a historic civic building in the center of [[Winchester, New Hampshire]], United States. The brick building was designed by S. Winthrop St. Clair and built in 1912 to replace a meeting house that was destroyed by fire. The meeting house it replaced was the location of the Winchester Profession, a key development in the history of [[Unitarian Universalism]]. It is a well-proportioned [[Colonial Revival]] structure, whose facade is embellished by four [[pilaster]]s supporting a [[modillion]]ed pediment.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=80000276}}|title=NRHP nomination for New Hampshire Conservatory of Music and the Arts|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>
