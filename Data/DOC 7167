After deleting some material that was not about Muslim resistance but about what the Sikhs did, I looked at the lead (should have started there I guess). This seems to be just an anti-Sikh article, not about Muslim resistance. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 13:53, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:'''Delete''': Lead contains unsubstantiated claims and it look like a baised POV work. The section ''Shaheed Ganj Mosque'' seems entirely copied from [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque]]. The section named ''Peshawar'' seems like POV, with the last sentence possibly OR.--[[User:Siddhartha Ghai|Siddhartha Ghai]] ([[User talk:Siddhartha Ghai|talk]]) 19:24, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' This is a reflective essay with two sources for statements which aren't relevant to the article's\essay's central point. [[User:MezzoMezzo|MezzoMezzo]] ([[User talk:MezzoMezzo|talk]]) 04:11, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
