{{Politics of the British Virgin Islands}}

The '''Leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition in the British Virgin Islands''' (more commonly known as the '''Leader of the Opposition''') is a [[politician]] who is appointed by the [[Governor of the British Virgin Islands|Governor]] who leads the [[political party|political parties]] and elected legislators who are not aligned with the Government of the day.  Under the [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands|Constitution]] the Governor is required to appoint a member of the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|House of Assembly]] recommended by a majority of the elected members of the House who are members of any opposition party whose numerical strength in the House is greater than that of any other opposition party, or if no such person exists, the member of the House of Assembly who in the judgement of the Governor is best able to command the support of the members of the House in opposition to the Government.<ref name="Article 70">Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007, article 70(2)</ref>

Prior to the introduction of the current Constitution, which codified the position, the Leader of the Opposition by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]] led the largest party which is not part of the government: where one party wins outright this is the party leader of the second largest political party in the [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|House of Assembly]].  However, in 1990 [[Cyril Romney]] was appointed Leader of the Opposition as an Independent and in 1995 [[Walwyn Brewley]] was appointed despite leading the party with the third largest number of seats.  The Leader of the Opposition is normally viewed as an alternative [[Premier of the British Virgin Islands|Premier]].

On 28 February 2019 Marlon Penn was appointed as the most recent leader of the opposition.<ref name=Penn>{{cite news|url=https://bvinews.com/marlon-penn-sworn-in-as-opposition-leader/ |title=Marlon Penn sworn in as Opposition Leader |work=BVI News |date=28 February 2019}}</ref>

== Overview ==

To date a total of fourteen people (all men) have served as Leader of the Opposition - over twice the number who have served as Premier or Chief Minister.  Every person who has served as Chief Minister or Premier has also served as Leader of the Opposition at some point.  No person has ever served consecutive terms as Leader of the Opposition.  On four occasions has the Leader of the Opposition changed between elections: in 1977 (when Austin Henley died), in 1988 (when Ralph O'Neal left the United Party to join the Government), in 2017 (when [[Andrew Fahie]] ousted Julian Fraser as leader of the opposition [[Virgin Islands Party]]) and in 2018 (when a split in the ruling government party led to Ronnie Skelton becoming the leader of the largest non-Government party).  

== 2015 deadlock and controversy ==

In 2014, whilst [[Ralph O'Neal]] was Leader of the Opposition he stepped down as leader of the [[Virgin Islands Party]] in favour of [[Julian Fraser]].  However O'Neal remained the official Leader of the Opposition under the Territory's constitution until he stood down in subsequent [[British Virgin Islands general election, 2015|general election in June 2015]].  In that election only two members of the opposition Virgin Islands Party won their seats - Julian Fraser and Andrew Fahie.  Subsequently Fraser and Fahie argued over who should be named as Leader of the Opposition;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvibeacon.com/1/index.php/news-articles-2/1947-june-18-2015/local-news-june-18-2015/6985-two-man-opposition-deadlocked-over-leadership|title=Two-man opposition deadlocked over leadership |publisher=''[[BVI Beacon]]''|date=22 June 2015}}</ref> Fahie believed he commanded majority support within the party and should take over as party leader following the general election defeat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1437486350|title=Fraser Appointed Opposition Leader|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=21 July 2015|quote=[S]everal of the party's losing candidates have written to the Governor to support Hon. Fahie as the Leader of the Opposition.}}</ref>  As the Constitution required that the Leader of the Opposition commanded a support of the "majority" of the opposition members,<ref name="Article 70" /> and the only two opposition members disagreed, there was an impasse.  Governor [[John Duncan (diplomat)|John Duncan]] gave the men a month to resolve their differences, but they were unable to do so, and eventually the Governor appointed Fraser as the official Leader of the Opposition.<ref name=Fraser>{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=1437486350|title=Fraser Appointed Opposition Leader|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=21 July 2015}}</ref>  Fahie would later oust Fraser as party leader, and would then be appointed as Leader of the Opposition in his stead.<ref name=Fahie>{{cite web|url=http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=26475|title=BREAKING NEWS: Fahie Appointed Opposition Leader|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=6 February 2017}}</ref>

== Leaders of the Opposition from 1967 ==

Prior to 1967 politicians were not elected on a party political basis, and thus Leaders of the Opposition only came into being with the introduction of [[party politics]] and Ministerial rule after the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 1967|1967 general election]].

The following is a list of the Leaders of the Opposition in the British Virgin Islands from 1967 to date.
