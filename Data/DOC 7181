*'''Delete''', no evidence of significant coverage in [[WP:RS]]. As written, this appears to qualify as [[WP:CSD#A7]]. Not sure how this has survived for so long... --<font face="Book Antiqua">[[User:Kinu|<font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font>]]&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Kinu|<font color="red">''t''</font>]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Kinu|<font color="red">''c''</font>]]</sub></font> 16:51, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I'm not finding any coverage in reliable sources for this group; does not appear to meet [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:BAND]]. <small><span style="border:1px solid">[[User:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:black">&nbsp;Gongshow&nbsp;</span>''']]</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color:black">[[User_talk:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:#ffffff">talk</span>''']]</span></small> 09:40, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I cannot find anything that indicates how this band meets the [[|WP:BAND|guidelines for inclusion]]. I'm pretty impressed that they managed to keep an article here since Dec 2007, though.[[User:Sparklism| — sparklism]] <sup><small>''[[User_talk:Sparklism| hey!]]''</small></sup> 11:11, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
