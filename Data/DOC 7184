This article contains strong language and notions for promoting of the company "Mindtree" on wikipedia, after detailed investigation on creator of the page, the contributions made by him on Wikipedia seems to be only on the article Mindtree and its related content, It seems he made account on Wikipedia just to create the article for this company "Mindtree".

The major contributor to the article are non registered users, Doing a reverse-IP search on those IP addresses revels that, all IP addresses are from Bangalore, India, headquarter of the company. Therefore article is unethical and violates Wikipedia policies on promotion & advertising. This article needs to be deleted, to implement Wikipedia's tighter policy norms and let people know that opensource communities are for knowledge and education, not for cheap advertising & self-promotion <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Science.Warrior|Science.Warrior]] ([[User talk:Science.Warrior|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Science.Warrior|contribs]]) 14:34, 26 April 2014‎ (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

* Your argument is not relevant to the article's notability -- what do you think about the Times of India references? [[User:Shii|Shii]] [[user_talk:Shii|(tock)]] 17:42, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' @ [[user: shii]] All the links provided as reference are weak & most of them are from company website itself. The one you talking about looks like paid advertising, with no further reviews or comments on them, Yes they have references on some websites but this does not states that any company can have a same promotional article with their self proclaimed facts and figures on Wikipedia, This community is for sharing knowledge, not for greedy & conspiracy minded people, we should convey this message strongly to the people.

::I just cleaned the page up to remove the worst parts of it. [[WP:BOLD|You could have done that]] instead of nominating for deletion; this seems to be a pretty high-profile company.
::As for violating [[WP:SOAPBOX]], that's not a reason to delete if there is material to be salvaged. Just delete the rest and warn or report the users involved (but make sure you have strong evidence).

*'''Delete''' per [[WP:B2B]]. I can't find sources that would satisfy [[WP:CORPDEPTH]]. The tone of the article suggests that redlink would be an easier start for proper article if valid sources are ever found. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D. Czarkoff]] ([[user talk:czarkoff|talk]]•[[Special:Contributions/czarkoff|track]]) 18:00, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strong quick keep''' You must be kidding. Did you even search for its notability? It has significant presence in Bombay Stock Exchange, India's main stock market ([http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/stocks-in-news/infosys-wipro-mindtree-slip-over-10-since-march-is-it-time-to-revisit-it-stocks/articleshow/34152969.cms], [http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/mindtree-to-consider-bonus-issue/article5911078.ece], [http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/mindtree-gains-as-board-to-consider-bonus-issue-proposal-114041500454_1.html]). Major financial publications are covering this company (and I searched only recent news, you'd get a lot if you go back in time). A company that employs ~ 13,000 people and has major presence in share market is un-notable? Really? If you have problem with tone of the article, please go ahead and change the language. That has nothing to do with its notability.--[[User:Dwaipayanc|Dwaipayan]] ([[User_talk:Dwaipayanc|talk]]) 21:22, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' i agree with user czarkoff but @Dwaipayan "13,000 employs" where you get that data from? didn't you noticed that "citation needed" tag beside that self proclaimed number? This article has been nominated 2 times before and this is the 3rd time, i can definitely feel some conspiracy going on here. Please have a look at [[WP:B2B]], [[WP:PROMOTION]] and finally [[WP:BEANS]]. [[User:Science.Warrior|Science.Warrior]] ([[User talk:Science.Warrior|talk]]) 22:15, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
**I was not aware of [[WP:B2B]]. Thanks for pointing this out. I completely agree with that essay, majority of IT-company related articles are bogus. However, this particular company has notability (and that's what decides the result of AfD). For convenience in Indian source search, you can use [https://googledrive.com/host/0B3ke7sJYbO1gVkRjUVh6bmtqeVU/IndianEnglishNewspaperSearch.html#gsc.tab=0 this engine].  Read, for example, [http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/mindtree-to-scale-up-us-operations/article5631351.ece this coverage] or [http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/mindtree-may-spin-off-two-companyincubated-startups/article5836529.ece this]. And you can disregard my comment about number of employees, as I do not have any source. You should delete that info from the article. Thanks.--[[User:Dwaipayanc|Dwaipayan]] ([[User_talk:Dwaipayanc|talk]]) 22:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
***These sources are not much different from those in article: they look like mildly edited press releases. Could you provide at least two citations with at least [http://www.thomaswhite.com/global-perspectives/arkady-volozh-principal-founder-and-ceo-yandex/ this depth of coverage]? — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D. Czarkoff]] ([[user talk:czarkoff|talk]]•[[Special:Contributions/czarkoff|track]]) 07:19, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
****I did not read the article you linked (for the example of depth coverage).

***** @ user_Dwaipayan "what are you trying to say or prove?". Wikipedia governance is based on its set rules made by community members, which are been clearly stated to you on above comments, with links on them and you come up with some facts and figures of your own, u look desperate. I am surely reporting the matter now to administrators. [[User:Science.Warrior|Science.Warrior]] ([[User talk:Science.Warrior|talk]]) 13:45, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
******LoL. Be my guest. Please go ahead and report my activity in this AfD :) And bye the way, if you are not clear about what I am trying to prove, I am trying to prove the notability of this company, which is the main question of this AfD. --[[User:Dwaipayanc|Dwaipayan]] ([[User_talk:Dwaipayanc|talk]]) 14:28, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

**@user-Vensatry "yes and we were also wondering why u didn't showed up till now"!, we saw your talk page history logs, which reflects immense friendship you and user-"Dwaipayan" have, i think that's where that STRONG KEEP is coming from, lol! the conspiracy theory prediction was true.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Science.Warrior|Science.Warrior]] ([[User talk:Science.Warrior|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Science.Warrior|contribs]]) 20:36, 28 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:::Ha, nice try! your rationale is just a case of "[[WP:IDL|I'm so ashamed this article is on Wikipedia]]". This [https://web.archive.org/web/20131102204614/http://www.mphasis.com/pdfs/FortuneRanking.pdf list] is more than necessary to prove its notability.

:::* I know what you  are trying to do here ([[User:Vensatry]]), '''"you scratch mine, i scratch yours"''', I am so amazed how you guys come up with some random PDF files and claim them to be notable, I am not sure you are a neutral wikipedia editor or a paid employee of this "Mindtree" company?

*'''Keep'''. On just the merits of the article, I agree with Dwaipayan that there is coverage out there for this company to meet [[WP:CORP]]. The BSE and NSE listings don't give it automatic notability; the coverage in media sources does. On the merits of the nomination, Science.Warrior has not presented a case for the article having such deep flaws in its ''content'' that it can't be cleaned up. Editors with conflicts of interest are not prohibited from editing articles; they're discouraged to do so and encouraged to strongly source everything. The article is not hopeless spam, and COI is a situation better dealt with by cleanup than deletion. —'''[[User:C.Fred|C.Fred]]''' ([[User_talk:C.Fred|talk]]) 17:10, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Dwaipayan.  Reasons stated in nomination not cause for deletion.  [[User:78.26|<span style="border:1px solid black;color:red; padding:1px;background:1h5h1h"><font color="008B8B"><b>78.26</b></font></span>]] ([[User talk:78.26|I'm no IP, talk to me!]]) 18:54, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
