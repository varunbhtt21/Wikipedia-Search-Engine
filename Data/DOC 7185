'''''Leonardoceras''''' is a genus of [[nautiloid]] cephalopods from the lower Middle Ordovician of Nevada (USA), the shell a small slender exogastric cyrtocone with the venter more narrowly rounded than the dorsum, resembling in overall form  a small ''[[Bassleroceras]]''. Septa are close spaced, the living chamber short, the siphuncle close to the venter.

The type species, ''Leonoardoceras parvum'' Flower was found the Antelope Valley limestone, in the north wall of Ikes Canyon in the Toquima Range, Nevada, about 11 feet below the top of the asaphid trilobite beds. No other species were named.

Although in basic form ''Leonardoceras'' resembles ''Bassleroceras'', it differs in the siphuncle. [[Bassleroceratidae|bassleroceratids]] have thick connecting rings inherited from their [[Ellesmeroceratidae|ellesmeroceratid]] ancestors, which were passed on to the [[Tarphycerida]]. ''Leonardoceras'' has a poorly preserved, narrow siphuncle, apparently with thin connecting rings characteristic of the [[Oncocerida]] and later [[Nautilida]].

''Leonoardoceras'' is considered, as of ref. date, to be the most primitive of the Graciloceatidae, the ancestral family of the Oncocerida.
