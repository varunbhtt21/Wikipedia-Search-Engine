The '''women's 4 × 110 yards relay at the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]''' as part of the [[Athletics at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|athletics programme]] was held at the [[Perry Lakes Stadium]] on Saturday 1 December 1962.

They narrowly finished ahead of English team of [[Ann Packer]], [[Dorothy Hyman]], [[Daphne Arden]] and [[Betty R. Moore (runner)|Betty Moore]] and the New Zealand quartet of [[Nola Bond]], [[Molly Cowan]], [[Doreen Porter]] and [[Avis McIntosh]] who won bronze. England was leading by five yards coming in the final baton change, however Moore started her run too early and had to stop almost dead before receiving the baton. This cost England dearly as Cuthbert caught Moore two yards from the finish.<ref name="times">{{cite news|first=Harold|last=Abrahams|title=Snell wins disappointing mile|newspaper=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Limited]]|location=[[London]]|page=22|date=2 December 1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Clarkson|title=Our girls' great day|newspaper=[[The Sun-Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media|John Fairfax and Sons]]|location=[[Sydney]]|page=24|date=2 December 1962}}</ref>
