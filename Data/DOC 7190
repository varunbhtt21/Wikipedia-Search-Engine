The '''Lewis–Punch ministry''' or '''Second Lewis ministry''' was the 69th ministry of the [[New South Wales Government]], and was led by the 33rd [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]], the Honourable [[Tom Lewis (Australian politician)|Tom Lewis]] {{post-nominals|AUS|MLA}}, of the [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal Party]] in [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] with the [[National Party of Australia – NSW|Country Party]], led by the Honourable [[Leon Punch]] {{post-nominals|AUS|MLA}}. It was the first of two occasions when Lewis was Premier; and the first of two occasions when Punch served as [[Deputy Premier of New South Wales|Deputy Premier]].

==Background==
Lewis was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] in 1957 and served continuously until 1978, representing the seat of [[Electoral district of Wollondilly|Wollondilly]]. When the Askin government came to power in 1965, Lewis was given relatively junior portfolios of Lands and Mines. In 1972, Tourism was added to his ministerial responsibilities when [[Eric Willis]] moved to Education. Late in 1974, Askin announced his resignation and Lewis was chosen as leader over Willis and Justice Minister [[John Maddison]].

Punch was elected to the NSW Legislative Assembly in 1959 and served continuously until 1985, representing variously the seats of [[Electoral district of Upper Hunter|Upper Hunter]] (1959-1962) and then [[Electoral district of Gloucester|Gloucester]] (1962-1985. Elected Deputy Leader of the Country Party in 1973, Punch was elected as leader of his party following the retirement and resignation of the Hon. Sir [[Charles Cutler]] {{post-nominals|AUS|KBE|ED|MLA}} in December 1975.

Lewis inherited a relatively stable government that had been in power for ten years. However, the Liberal government was engaged in almost daily warfare with the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor federal government, most notably over the [[Medibank]] health care scheme, to which New South Wales was the last state to sign.

==Tenure of ministry==
This ministry covers the period from 17 December 1975, when the former Deputy Premier, Sir Charles Cutler resigned as Deputy Premier, Leader of the Country Party and as Member for Orange, until 23 January 1976,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/Archives_MemberPage |title=Former Members - Chronological List of Ministries 1856 to 2009 (requires download) |work=Project for the Sesquicentenary of Responsible Government in NSW |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |format=[[Microsoft Excel|MS Excel spreadsheet]] |accessdate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315063124/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/Archives_MemberPage/ |archivedate=15 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Wah |first=Malvyne Jong |author2=Page, Jeffrey E. |date=November 2007 |title=New South Wales Parliamentary Record 1824 &ndash; 2007 |volume=VI |pages=[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/cbe381f08171c2e8ca256fca007d6044/83a94d96a772d982ca257b89000d89ad/$FILE/Part%206.pdf#page=42 42] |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/cbe381f08171c2e8ca256fca007d6044/83a94d96a772d982ca257b89000d89ad/$FILE/Part%206.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=26 April 2014 }}</ref> when Lewis was deposed as Liberal leader by the Hon. Sir [[Eric Willis]] {{post-nominals|AUS|KBE|CMG|MLA}} following a spill motion on 20 January 1976, necessitating a reconfiguration of the ministry as the [[Willis–Punch ministry]].
