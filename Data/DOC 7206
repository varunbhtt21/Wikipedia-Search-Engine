'''Clonmoyle Racecourse''' was a [[racecourse]] in the [[townland]] of [[Clonmoyle West]], situated {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Aghabullogue]] village and {{convert|6.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Coachford]] village.

The Ordnance Survey name book c. 1840 refers to Clonmoyle Racecourse as situated on the eastern side of Clonmoyle West townland, '60 chains north-east from Aghabologue Chapel'({{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}). Measuring approximately one 'English mile' in circumference, it was located in a 'barren mountainous field' on the highest part of the townland, in which races took place 'three or four times' some years, and with no races taking place during other years.

The racecourse is clearly depicted on the 1841 surveyed OS Map.<ref>{{cite web|title=1841 surveyed OS map (maps.osi.ie)|url=http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,545372,578238,7,7|accessdate=26 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829114800/http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V1,545372,578238,7,7|archive-date=29 August 2012|dead-url=yes}}</ref> The Cork Placenames Archive refers to related placenames, such as 'Racecourse Crossroads' and 'Racecourse Hill'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lankford|first=Dr. Ã‰amon|title=A Collection of Placenames from Cork County: Barony of East Muskerry (Vol. 1)|year=2008|publisher=Cork Place Names Archive}}</ref>

Today, Clonmoyle Racecourse is no longer used, with the land being employed for agricultural purposes. An annual race meeting, the Aghabullogue [[Point-to-point (steeplechase)]], takes place each January in the adjoining townland of Dromatimore.
