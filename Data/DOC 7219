'''Formula Acceleration 1''' ('''FA1''') was a [[One-make racing|single make]], [[Open-wheel car|open wheel auto racing]] series. It was unusual in its field in that competitors solely represented their [[nation]] as opposed to themselves or a team, the usual format in most [[formula racing]] series.

FA1 was created in 2014 as the signature category in the [[Acceleration 2014]] series of motorsport festivals. Rather than developing their own car, the series reduced costs substantially by using the [[Lola B05/52]] which was used in the early years of the [[A1 Grand Prix]] series. They also continued to use the same 3.4 litre V8 engine built by [[Zytek Engineering]]. On 22 December 2014, it was announced that the series would be merged with [[2015 Auto GP season|Auto GP in 2015]]. This to ensure that at least 18 cars will participate in each race. It was also announced that the 2015 champion will be granted a [[Formula 1]] test.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/index.php?nav=Artikel&nid=63572|publisher=RaceXpress|title=Auto GP en FA1 bundelen krachten in nieuw kampioenschap|trans-title=Auto GP and FA1 join forces in new championship|date=22 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/117209|publisher=Autosport|title=Auto GP set for Formula Acceleration merger in bid to boost grids|date=22 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> However, the season was halted after two rounds due to the lack of entrants.

==Technical specifications==
All cars are mechanically identical and have been built with reducing costs in mind, which has led to an approximate price for the whole season of €450,000. FA1 will use the [[A1 Grand Prix cars#Lola-Zytek car (2005–06 to 2007–08)|Lola B05/52]], used in the [[A1 Grand Prix]] between [[2005-06 A1 Grand Prix season|2005]] and [[2007-08 A1 Grand Prix season|2008]].
