This article was speedy deleted, and the deletion was [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2014 April 18|contested at deletion review]].  As a result of that review, I'm bringing it to AfD, so a proper consensus can be reached.  This is an administrative action; I offer no opinion on the outcome. -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 14:25, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I'm happy with the work {{u|Niels Olson}} has done to bring this article up to scratch. It has had mentions in several major publications, including most recently [http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/panache/how-a-new-start-up-digitalocean-poses-threat-to-amazon/articleshow/34103009.cms here.] [[User:Jamesx12345|James]]<sup>x</sup>[[User talk:Jamesx12345|12345]] 14:33, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''': The subject is notable per the sources cited and there are no problems in the article as it stands. This version is not promotional and I declined a G11 nomination for that reason. [[User:BethNaught|BethNaught]] ([[User talk:BethNaught|talk]]) 15:31, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Full disclosure, I started the article, but I just want to note a few things. In terms of notability, the article had been created twice before I created it. Since my article was also speedy-deleted and I recreated it, it has now been created 4 times now. Regarding NPOV, I have no relation to the company, I'm not even a customer, just a potential customer looking for NPOV information. With regards to the original deletion review, let me leave a [[Wikipedia:Deletion_review#DigitalOcean_.28closed.29 | link to the discussion]] and note that even my speedy deleter, [[User:Deb]], has revisited the article and edited it.

*'''Keep'''  As far as I'm concerned, now that the promotional wording has been amended, this is okay. [[User:Deb|Deb]] ([[User talk:Deb|talk]]) 10:01, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', I'm seeing secondary source coverage. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 10:35, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
