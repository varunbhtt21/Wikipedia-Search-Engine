Really not seeing much evidence of notability for this concept. Most of the references are just "here's a book about the name I just dropped" or to other Wikipedia articles. Only saw hits in French language where "art organique" was mentioned in passing on Google Books (21st century filtered) rather than as a proper noun. Much as I like the sound of a movement based on "organic art", I'm afraid this article sounds like fabrication to me. Bringing to discussion just in case Art Organique IS actually a thing.

*'''Delete'''. This is an essay. The term is a moderately venerable one, coming up for example in [[Walter Benjamin]] [http://books.google.com/books?id=rg3thELP_dgC&pg=PA275&dq=%22Art+organique%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T9ZbU5yUMoioyATmvIGACQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22Art%20organique%22&f=false] and [http://books.google.com/books?id=p9vEQlh9HMYC&pg=PA140&dq=%22Art+organique%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ttVbU4S4O8-PyASZnYDADg&ved=0CFsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22Art%20organique%22&f=false this philosophical essay] presents a similar conception to that in the article: "L'art organique, en effet, imite moins la nature que sa loi de formation," but it's not so much a movement as a perennial idea - see for example [http://www.worldcat.org/title/spielarten-des-organischen-in-architektur-design-und-kunst/oclc/60519959&referer=brief_results this conference book] for various uses of the concept or approach, and I think myself first not of Henry Moore but of [[art nouveau]]. I don't find any evidence of its being applied to any coherent set of artists in either French, German, or English. On the other hand we quite properly have [[organic architecture]]; in architecture, as this article states, the concept has been fairly well developed and the term is used of an approach or a shared mindset.

*'''Delete''', unsourced (where it matters) essay, no evidence that this is a term used by critics for any movement (as opposed to referring to 'organic forms', as eg Henry Moore or Art Nouveau).[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 18:36, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''', as TheLongTone says, it is effectively unsourced and, in places, makes some farcical claims. [[Organic architecture]] is a known phenomenon, but there's certainly no defined movement called Organic Art that I know of. [[User:Sionk|Sionk]] ([[User talk:Sionk|talk]]) 19:30, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
