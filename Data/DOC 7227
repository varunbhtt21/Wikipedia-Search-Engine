The '''Richmond Public Library''' of [[Richmond, New Hampshire]], is located in '''Richmond School House No. 6''', a small wood frame building west of the junction of [[New Hampshire Route 32]] and [[New Hampshire Route 119]] in the center of the town.  The one-room schoolhouse was built in 1850 and converted to library use in 1962.  Alterations at that time and in 1974 include the removal of a belfry, the addition of an extension to the west (which included a below-grade fireproof vault for archives), and of the pedimented entrance cover.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=80000279}}|title=NRHP nomination for Richmond School House No. 6|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>
