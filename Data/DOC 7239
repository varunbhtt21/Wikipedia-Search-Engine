==Family==
Nephi Steed Jeffs was born to the polygamous FLDS prophet [[Rulon Jeffs]] and his fourth wife Marilyn Steed. He is the full brother of Warren, [[Lyle Jeffs|Lyle]] and [[Seth Jeffs]], among others. Members of the Jeffs family are considered polygamist elite and FLDS members consider their members to be of "royal blood."<ref name=NPR1>{{cite news |title= From Polygamist Royalty To FLDS Lost Boy |url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104359348 |accessdate= 18 April 2014 |publisher= [[NPR]] |date= 21 May 2009}}</ref> Being the son of prophet Rulon Jeffs and the brother of prophet [[Warren Jeffs]] has secured his place in the FLDS hierarchy.

As of May 2008, Nephi had acquired 14 wives. Of members of his [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] listed on records obtained by a federal investigation, Nephi had the second highest number of wives.<ref name=NBC1>{{cite news|title=Records offer glimpse into polygamist families|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24530190/ns/us_news-life/t/records-offer-glimpse-polygamist-families/#.U1HHJfldWSp|accessdate=19 April 2014|newspaper=NBC News|date=8 May 2008}}</ref> Church elder Wendell Nielsen had the most wives listed at 21, while the third highest number of wives in the ward was Isaac Jeffs, another Jeffs brother, with 10.<ref name=usatoday1>{{cite news |title= Church records offer rare look inside polygamist families |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-05-09-polygamist-church_N.htm|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=9 May 2008}}</ref> One of Nephi's wives is Elizabeth Jessop, who in 2008 was 16 while Nephi was 38.<ref name=commonroom1>{{cite web|title=FLDS for May 9th|url=http://thecommonroomblog.com/2008/05/flds-for-may-9th.html|publisher=The Common Room|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

==In the FLDS==
Rulon Jeffs' secretary had always been [[Rebecca Musser]]'s "sister-wife Mother" Noreen. In Musser's memoir ''The Witness Wore Red'', she describes how Noreen was abruptly replaced with Nephi, who reported to Warren instead of Rulon.<ref name=Musser1>{{cite book|last=Musser|first=Rebcecca|title=The Witness Wore Red: The 19th Wife Who Brought Polygamous Cult Leaders to Justice|year=2013|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.|isbn=9781455527847}}</ref> After Rulon died and Warren solidified power, Nephi continued being his secretary and personal confidant,<ref name=Brower1>{{cite book|last=Brower|first=Sam|title=Prophet's Prey: My Seven-Year Investigation Into Warren Jeffs and the Fundamentalist Church of Latter-Day Saints|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781608192755|page=302}}</ref> also acting as a general personal assistant.<ref name=letter1>{{cite web|title=Letter on FLDS persons of interest|url=http://www.childbrides.org/control_KXAN_letter_on_13_FLDS_men_of_interest.html|publisher=Child Brides|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

As of the 8th August 2016, Nephi Jeffs was named as the presiding Bishop of the Short Creek Stake, following his Brother Lyle Jeff fleeing from the US judicial system.

==Warren Jeffs' incarceration==
After Warren was apprehended and incarcerated, Nephi frequently visited Warren in jail. Of the ten trips that he made to see Warren, he was accompanied on eight of them by Lindsay Barlow, another FLDS member who acted as Nephi's security.<ref name=fox1>{{cite news|title=Jailed Polygamist Sect Leader's Many Visitors Suggest He Still Controls Church|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/30/jailed-polygamist-sect-leader-many-visitors-suggest-still-controls-church/|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=30 Nov 2006}}</ref><ref name=deseret1>{{cite news|title=Washington County sends dossiers of select FLDS members to Texas officials|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700233581/Washington-County-sends-dossiers-of-select-FLDS-members-to-Texas-officials.html?pg=all|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Deseret News|date=11 Jun 2008}}</ref> Barlow also accompanied Nephi to the courtroom hearings as security.<ref name=ksl>{{cite news|title=Jeffs Appears in Court; Evidence Hearing Set for Nov. 21|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=521985|accessdate=26 Apr 2014|newspaper=KSL|date=27 Sep 2006}}</ref>

While Warren was being held at the [[Purgatory Correctional Facility|Purgatory Jail]] in [[Hurricane, Utah|Hurricane]], Utah, he made the confession to Nephi that he was not the true prophet and had taken power even though he "was not called of God." Nephi did not believe the statement and refuted it with Warren, who told him to spread the news to his followers. Nephi did not distribute the January 25 video like Warren wanted, though it found its way to the public eventually.<ref name=Weyermann1>{{cite book|last=Weyermann|first=Debra|title=Answer Them Nothing: Bringing Down the Polygamous Empire of Warren Jeffs|year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781569769157|pages=247–248}}</ref> Jeffs suggested that Warren was "being tested by the Lord" and promised Warren that his followers "will not forsake you."<ref name=Mullins1>{{cite news|last=Mullins|first=Ki|title=Warren S.
