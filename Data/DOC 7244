Resnick wrote the con statement to that petition, expressing concern that the petition was too broad and that it would be difficult to determine which settings violated the resolution.<ref name=Con>{{cite web|title=2008 APA Petition Resolution Ballot - Con Statement|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/statements/work-settings-con.aspx|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> The resolution was subsequently approved following a vote of the organization's membership.<ref name=Petition>{{cite web|title=2008 APA Petition Resolution Ballot|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/statements/work-settings.aspx|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref>
