== Background ==

Since the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|last general elections]], the Malaysian government began to renege on many of their election promises by raising the prices over a broad scope of cost of living items to arrest the high budget deficit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramasamy |first=Manirajan |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-02/malaysia-s-najib-raises-fuel-prices-to-trim-budget-gap.html |title=Malaysia’s Najib Raises Fuel Prices to Trim Budget Gap |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-09-02 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>  The Malaysian government then introduced legislation calling for the introduction of a 6% goods and services tax in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/93702 |title=What 6% GST means to Malaysians |publisher=My Sinchew |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref> The protest organisers also objected to the signing of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement]] between Malaysia and the [[United States]], and pushed for greater women's, indigenous peoples', students' and migrants' rights, as well as an increase in the [[minimum wage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/on-may-day-trade-unions-to-rally-against-gst-tppa |title=On May Day, trade unions to rally against GST, TPPA &#124; Malaysia |publisher=The Malay Mail Online |date=2014-04-18 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>

== 1 May 2014 Declaration ==

The following Declaration (1 May 2014 Declaration) was read prior to the start of the rally.

"2014 is the year of protesting the GST, or the goods and services tax. The Barisan Nasional government has passed the GST Act despite the repeated objections of the rakyat to its implementation.

In Malaysia, only 15% of the rakyat are able to pay income tax, with over 38% of the population falling beneath the poverty line income of RM860 per month, and the implementation of the minimum wage of RM900 still being far from comprehensive.

Moreover, according to the Governor of Bank Negara, Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, [[household debt]] in Malaysia is 83% of GDP—the highest in Asia—compared to Singapore at 67%, and Hong Kong at 58%. Given this dire situation, how will the rakyat fare if GST is implemented?

The GST will cause the price of all goods and services to increase, despite the Government’s justification that there are 40 essential items which will not be subject to price hikes. This is because every product will undergo processes of production or preparation before reaching the consumer—all of which are taxable under GST. Even if indirectly, this will result in consumers paying more for goods and services in the long run.

The rakyat of Malaysia, especially the workers who represent the 99%, will doubtless suffer as a result of GST, regardless of the Government’s spurious claims of its implementation being good for the country. The same pro-corporate Government that was able to reduce income tax from 40% in the 1980s to 26% today is now ready and willing to jeopardise the welfare of the rakyat with the burden of GST."

Additionally, a list of 15 demands were also read out at the beginning of the rally, which pertain to GST, the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), minimum wage policy, workers' union rights, women workers' rights, migrant workers' rights, privatisation of public services, media freedom, price of goods, students' rights, Orang Asal rights, environmental protection, affordable housing, and oppressive laws.

== Pre-rally incidents ==

The Malaysian police claimed they would declare the Anti-GST Rally as illegal as the organisers did not obtain the necessary permission to hold the rally at Dataran Merdeka, and added that the site was undergoing upgrading works on the day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perimbanayagam |first=Kalbana |url=http://www.nst.com.my/latest/may-1-anti-gst-rally-yet-to-obtain-permit-to-carry-out-rally-1.576928 |title=May 1 anti-GST rally yet to obtain permit to carry out rally - Latest - New Straits Times |publisher=Nst.com.my |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=m. kumar |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/04/23/may-1-anti-gst-rally-illegal/ |title=May 1 anti-GST rally illegal, say cops - Nation &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>  The organisers insisted that the rally would be held regardless, informing the police they would not cause any problems.<ref>{{cite web|author=nicholas cheng |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/04/21/Organisers-of-anti-GST-rally-to-converge-at-Dataran/ |title=Organisers of anti-GST rally determined to converge at Dataran Merdeka - Nation &#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2014-04-21 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref> The police also advised the organisers to choose a different venue in the city, such as [[Stadium Merdeka]] or Padang Merbok.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/latest/cops-want-change-of-location-for-rally-protesting-gst-on-may-1-1.579884 |title=Cops want change of location for rally protesting GST on May 1 - Latest - New Straits Times |publisher=Nst.com.my |date= |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/cops-want-may-day-anti-gst-rally-to-change-location |title=Cops want May Day anti-GST rally to change location &#124; Malaysia |publisher=The Malay Mail Online |date= |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>

===Rally Incident===

====Clueless protestors====
It was reported that a majority of the protesters were clueless on what they were protesting. A protester was noted to have said " I don't know what is GST. What I know is that it is a burden to the people.That's all I care, I don't care to know what is GST." <ref>http://www.universitynewscapital.com/2014/05/saya-tak-tahu-apa-maksud-gst-jelas.html</ref> The acronym for GST itself was wrongly interpreted as "Government Service Tax" rather that "Goods and Service Tax".<ref>http://says.com/my/news/62-rakyat-malaysia-bantah-gst-tapi-majoriti-tak-faham-mekanisma-gst</ref>

====Attack on Media Personnel====
A 100-strong group protesters which named themselves  "Rejimen Anarki" and "Antifa" assaulted several media personnel on the scene.<ref>{{cite web|author=FZ Malaysia Malaysia|title=Minor scuffle between SAMM, press after anti-GST rally |url=http://www.fz.com/content/minor-scuffle-between-samm-press-after-anti-gst-rally|date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref> The group, which mostly wearing black attire, cursed, kicked and punched several media photographers on duty.<ref>http://www.bnbbc.my/?p=13181</ref> A Malaysian Reserve photographer was also hurled with wooden stick. Some of their cameras were also broken.<ref>http://www.astroawani.com/berita-malaysia/polis-akan-dedah-foto-peserta-himpunan-anti-gst-serang-petugas-media-35304</ref> General Secretary of Association of Malaysian Media Photographers (MPPA) condemned the attack. This has prompted the [[Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture (Malaysia)|Minister of Communication and Multimedia]], [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek|Dato' Sri Ahmad Shabery Cheek]] to urged the public to respect the journalists' presence as they were merely doing their duty.<ref>http://www.astroawani.com/berita-malaysia/sekumpulan-peserta-perhimpunan-bantah-gst-serang-jurufoto-media-35050</ref><ref>http://bm.theantdaily.com/Terkini/Perhimpunan-anti-GST-dicemari-serangan-ke-atas-jurugambar-media</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=MSN Malaysia |url=http://news.malaysia.msn.com/malaysia-news/geramm-releases-press-statement-on-anti-gst-rally |title=Geramm releases press statement on Anti-GST rally - MSN Malaysia News |publisher=News.malaysia.msn.com |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1034314 |title=Peaceful rally marred by attack on press &#124; theSundaily |publisher=The Sun Daily |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>

====Hijacked by Pakatan Rakyat====
An activist, Asiah Abd Jalil was deeply dampened when she alleged that the rally was being hijacked by [[Pakatan Rakyat]] even though the organisers were NGOs. She criticised [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Unit Amal PAS]] which forced the rally-goers to hear political speeches by their leaders and blocking access to [[Dataran Merdeka]]. She was also cynical, questioning whether Unit Amal PAS were the self-appointed "Demonstration Police".<ref>http://www.anwaraidc.com/2014/05/kesal-perhimpunan-anti-gst-dihijacked-orang-politik/</ref> Protestors were also seen pushing through Unit Amal PAS in the rally.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKWW80lAd2s</ref>
