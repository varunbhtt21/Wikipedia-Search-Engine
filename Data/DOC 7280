:({{Find sources|Mandy Heng}})
Been aware of this for a while, occasionally looked for sources as I thought to have a quick check, but after another unsuccessful search, I'm afraid I think it's time to ask whether Heng is notable. I see no in-depth articles on her work, really very little coverage (and generally passing mentions of the "Someone wore Mandy Heng somewhere, someone else wore somebody else..." type.) If there IS coverage worth mentioning, it's really not readily accessible. Sorry Mandy... [[User:Mabalu|Mabalu]] ([[User talk:Mabalu|talk]]) 14:43, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as non notable woman. -[[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 20:46, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I think it's a bit too soon for this promising young designer. But if substantial coverage in reliable independent sources occurs woul be happy to see recreation an expansion of the article.
