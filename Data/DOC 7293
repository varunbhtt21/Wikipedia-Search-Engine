== History ==
In 1978, the responsibilities of the Florida Department of Commerce were split with the Department of Labor and Employment Security.
 
In 1996, under Governor [[Lawton Chiles]], Florida became the first state in the country to place principal responsibility for economic development, international trade, research and business image marketing in the hands of a public-private partnership. Driving the effort was the belief that, with hands-on participation by Florida businesses, Florida could move from its traditional economic drivers of tourism and agriculture to a sophisticated mix of industries and international business. This model has been adopted by many U.S. states.

== Leadership ==
On January 7, 2019, Jamal Sowell was named President & CEO of Enterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI).     

Sowell leads EFI in facilitating job growth through recruitment and retention; small business growth through international trade and exporting programs; promotion and protection of Florida’s military bases; promotion of sporting events; and capital funding programs to assist small and minority businesses. The organization works with county and regional organizations across the state, as well as utility, state agency and community partners to strengthen and diversify Florida’s economy.

Previously, Sowell served as Port Tampa Bay’s Chief of Staff. He was responsible for coordinating the operations of the President/CEO’s office as well as assisting the Port’s Executive Team in the management of public affairs with Hillsborough County, The City of Tampa and the state of Florida. Additionally, he also served as a liaison to the Governor and state executive branch. Other responsibilities included preparation of the President/CEO's vision and plans while spearheading initiatives for port business leaders and stakeholders.

A sixth-generation Floridian, Sowell was the University of Florida (UF) Student Body President and member of the UF Board of Trustees. He was awarded as UF Outstanding Male Leader, UF Hall of Fame, UF Outstanding Young Alumni Award and is currently on the UF Alumni Association Board of Directors. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps enlisting as a Private First Class in the Reserve, and was eventually commissioned, completing his time as a Captain. He is a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom Afghanistan.

Prior to joining Port Tampa Bay, Jamal was Special Assistant to the UF President and Assistant Corporate Secretary to the UF Board of Trustees. Sowell has a Masters of Education from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with coursework in 19th century American literature at Amherst College. He has a law degree from Indiana University Bloomington Maurer School of Law where he was a Pat Tillman Scholar. Indiana Governor Mike Pence appointed Sowell to a state board regulating health facility administrators.
