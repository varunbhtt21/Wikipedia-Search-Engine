Title : Milano Films
Text : '''Milano Films''' was an Italian [[film production]] company of the [[silent era]]. Founded in [[Milan]] in 1908, it was one of the leading Italian film companies of the 1910s employing directors such as [[Baldassarre Negroni]] and [[Augusto Genina]] and actors including [[Lina Millefleurs]], [[Mercedes Brignone]] and [[Pina Menichelli]].<ref>Moliterno p.207</ref>

Milano was unusual in refusing to join the [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Unione Cinematografica Italiana]] in 1919. It continued its own production programme until the late 1920s, but slowly declined in importance.<ref>Moliterno p.207</ref> By the time the company closed, the Italian film industry was in a general crisis.

In 1909 the company constructed the [[Bovisa Studios]], at the time amongst the best in Europe.<ref>Moliterno p.207</ref> The studios continued to be used sporadically by other companies after Milano's demise, although filmmaking was increasingly centralised in [[Rome]].
