'''''Cafundó''''' is 2005 Brazilian [[historical drama film]] written and directed by [[Paulo Betti]] and Clóvis Bueno and starring [[Lázaro Ramos]]. 

==Background==
''Cafundó'' is a biopic of [[miracle worker]] ''preto velho'' João de Camargo of [[Sorocaba]] and is based on the book ''João de Camargo de Sorocaba: O Nascimento de uma Religião'' by Carlos de Campos and Adolfo Frioli. The title comes from a former ''[[quilombo]]'', the source of João de Camargo's original spiritual inspiration, located in today's [[Salto de Pirapora]].

==Plot==
[[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]], 1890s. João (Lázaro Ramos) is a former slave and the son of an [[Orisha]] priestess and works as a muleherd for a ''[[Coronelismo|coronel]]''. One day, he and his close friend Cirino ([[Leandro Firmino da Hora]]) decide to leave the farm. João takes his mother to Cafundó, the bastion of [[Afro-American religion]] in the vicinity. However, João leaves the community and takes errands to work in menial jobs. He meets a [[Spirit possession|possessed]] [[White Brazilians|white]] prostitute named Rosário ([[Leona Cavalli]]) and falls in love. Only after an unhappy marriage with Rosário and his mother's demise, João has a series of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] and decides to work as a spiritual leader for Sorocaba. In 1906, he builds a church with help from Cirino and begins to preach his syncretic faith, which is a blend of Orisha worship, [[veneration]] of Catholic saints, and eventually [[Allan Kardec|Kardecist]] [[spiritism]].
