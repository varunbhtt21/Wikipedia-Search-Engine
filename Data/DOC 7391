Initially nominated for speedy deletion, but I do not feel this fits A7. Apparently about a historical family from England, I can find some passing mentions in books (such as [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tQqV7kdX1Y0C&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq=lincolnshire+%22south+family%22&source=bl&ots=S372LP3N4_&sig=Tp4O9Uucq2oLhhOlZw-Bs-oMZ6A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UcxbU5ioCo_X7Ab3nYDwDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=lincolnshire%20%22south%20family%22&f=false this]) but nothing that I believe establishes notability.

*'''Delete''' - Some individual family members may have notability, but it does not make the family [[WP:N]]. (AfD is fine, I did A7:organization from unobserved notability and no references.)--[[User:Loriendrew|<font color="#005000">&#9790;Loriendrew&#9789;</font>]] [[User talk:Loriendrew|<font color="#000080">&#9743;''(talk)''</font>]] 17:13, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

::Even if that were a [[WP:RS|reliable source]], I can't see how any of the people mentioned on that page are notable. Simply being provably alive hundreds of years ago does not confer notability.
