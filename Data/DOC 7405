On 15 February 1917, the ship was in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] steaming from [[Taranto]], Italy, to [[Salonika]], [[Greece]], when she was attacked near [[Cape Matapan]] by the [[Imperial German Navy]] [[submarine]] {{SMU|U-39||2}} under the command of [[Walter Forstmann]].<ref name=Uboat.net/> On board were Italian, [[Serbia]]n, and French soldiers on their way to the [[Salonika Front]]. The ship was also carrying weapons and ammunition, which exploded when two [[torpedo]]es hit the ship. This caused the ship to sink very quickly, killing 870 people. Eleven crew members and 315 Italian soldiers were among the dead.<ref>Silvia, Musi (9 April 2012).

Pietri Grande Guerra.</ref> One of the lost soldiers was Vittorio Locchi, a young [[Florence|Florentine]] poet, who had written ''The Feast of Santa Gorizia'' in 1916. It was also rumored that the ship carried 25 boxes of [[gold bullion]].<ref>Causo, Lucio (7 February 2012).
