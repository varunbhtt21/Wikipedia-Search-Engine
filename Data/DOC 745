MS 161 starts at an intersection with US 61, US 278, and [[Mississippi Highway 322|MS 322]] in Clarksdale. The route travels northeast, [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] to MS 322, across several farms before reaching Sherard Road, where MS 322 continues westward to [[Sherard, Mississippi|Sherard]]. Known as South State Street, MS 161 continues northeastward towards a commercial area of Clarksdale,<ref name=Coahoma/> and it crosses the [[Sunflower River]]. The road name changes to North State Street, and it intersects Desoto Avenue, which travels to downtown Clarksdale northbound and [[U.S. Route 49 in Mississippi|US 49]] southbound.<ref name=Clarksdale/> The intersection is home to the "Crossroads" sign, a sculpture that commemorates the alleged location where musician [[Robert Johnson]] sold his soul to the devil to learn how to play the [[blues]].<ref name="crossroads">{{cite news |last1=Harpaz |first1=Beth J. |title=Mississippi Delta rich with stories |url=https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2017/04/20/mississippi-delta-rich-stories/100716056/ |accessdate=August 8, 2018 |work=The Clarion-Ledger |date=April 20, 2017 |location=Jackson, Mississippi |language=en}}</ref> MS 161 turns east briefly at Lincoln Place, before continuing northeastward past Sycamore Street.
