The '''Commonwealth Railways G class''' was a class of {{whyte|4-6-0}} [[tender locomotive]]s of the [[Commonwealth Railways]], Australia. The class operated on the {{RailGauge|sg}} [[Trans-Australian Railway]].

==History==
[[File:G18 + Trans-Australian Express, Cook, 1935.jpg|thumb|left|G18 with the [[Trans-Australian|Trans-Australian Express]], [[Cook, South Australia]], 1935|alt=G18 with the Trans-Australian Express, Cook, South Australia, 1935]]
In order to operate passenger trains on the then under construction Trans-Australian Railway, [[Commonwealth Railways]] ordered sixteen locomotives of the same design as the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]' [[New South Wales C32 class locomotive|P class]] (later the C32 class), but with higher capacity tenders.<ref name=LOberg>{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=122}}</ref><ref name=Chris>[http://www.comrails.com/cr_locos/r_g.html#1 G class] Chris's Commonwealth Railways Pages</ref>

Four were built by [[Clyde Engineering]], [[Sydney]] and twelve by the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], [[Philadelphia]] with all delivered between March and August 1914. A further ten were delivered by the [[Toowoomba Foundry]] between June 1916 and August 1917.<ref name=LOberg/><ref name=Chris/>

Initially they were used on construction trains, until the line opened in October 1917, when they commenced hauling passenger trains including the ''[[Trans Australian]]''. Although just as successful as their New South Wales counterparts, the high mineral content of the water caused problems. Two were withdrawn in 1925 followed by a third in 1930.<ref name=LOberg/>

In the 1930s, seven were fitted with superheated boilers to replace the saturated examples. These were reclassified as the Ga class. Following their displacement by the larger [[Commonwealth Railways C class|C class locomotives]] in 1938, they were gradually withdrawn.<ref name=LOberg/>

By the time dieselisation commenced in 1951, only eleven remained in service. Most were withdrawn in 1952 as the [[Commonwealth Railways GM class|GM class]] diesels entered service. The last remained in service as a shunter at [[Port Pirie Junction railway station|Port Pirie]] until withdrawn in September 1958.<ref name=LOberg/>

One has been preserved and today is on display at the [[National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide]]. It is believed that although numbered G1, it was actually originally G2.<ref name=Chris/><ref>[http://www.natrailmuseum.org.au/rollingstockexhibit.php?exhibitID=34 G-class 4-6-0 steam locomotive No.1] National Railway Museum</ref>
