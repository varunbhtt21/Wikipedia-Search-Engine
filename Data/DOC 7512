*'''Keep''' Notable people have acted in the movie. The article needs plot and review section but not deletion.--[[User:Skr15081997|Skr15081997]] ([[User talk:Skr15081997|talk]]) 03:37, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' ''[[Sify]]'' describes the film as a blockbuster. IE: [http://www.sify.com/movies/k-v-raju-steps-into-rajadhani-news-kannada-kkfq2Pbggci.html "Raju had directed blockbusters Belli Modagalu, Kadana, '''Indrajeeth''', Bandha Mukta, Belli Kalungoora, Yuddha Kaanda and Huliya."] Actor [[Devaraj]] describes the film as setting the course for his own career: [http://www.sify.com/movies/kannada/interview.php?id=6005845&cid=2404 "luckily for me director K.V. Raju has given a police officer's role in the film 'Indrajith'. Though this was an average hit, it paved away for my later films."]  These refs were found in just a very few moments.  If a 1989 Kannada film made enough of a mark be be spoken of 2 decades later, I can only wonder what gems of coverage are out there to be found. I think allowing this '''new''' stub to grow over time and through regular editing benefits Wikipedia (IE: [[WP:IMPERFECT]], [[WP:WIP]]). Deletion does not.

*'''Keep''' Meets notability criteria for films. Totally agree with Schmidt.--[[User:Dwaipayanc|Dwaipayan]] ([[User_talk:Dwaipayanc|talk]]) 21:26, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Schmidt – A highly successful Kannada film of the late 1980s. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;[[User:Vensatry|<font color = "indigo" >'''Vensatry'''</font>]] <sub> [[User talk:Vensatry|<font color = "Indigo" >'''(Ping)'''</font>]] </sub></span> 05:45, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
