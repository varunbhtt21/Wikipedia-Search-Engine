Jim Reichert, author of ''Yamada Bimyō: Historical Fiction and Modern Love,'' wrote that Bimyō was "one of the most influential literary reformers of the 1880s" who had "an instrumental role" in producing ''rekishi shōsetsu'', the modern form of a Japanese historical novel.<ref name=Reichertp99>Reichert, p. [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=eoIE0PcHwPAC&pg=PA99 99].</ref> According to Reichert, during the 1880s the public perceived Bimyō "to be at the forefront of the literary reform movement, offering a fresh and exciting strategy for reforming Japanese literature."<ref name=Reichertp99/>

Louis Frédéric, author of the ''Japan Encyclopedia'', wrote that Bimyō was, along with [[Kōda Rohan]], "the most representative authors" of the first modern [[school of literature]] to appear in [[Meiji period|Meiji]] Japan.<ref>Frédéric, Louis.

==History==
Bimyō was a part of the "Ken'yūsha" ("Friends of the Inkstone") Meiji literary group formed in February 1885, along with [[Ozaki Kōyō]], [[Ishibashi Shian]], and [[Maruoka Kyūka]].<ref>Wallace, Denton, and Fulton, page unstated ([[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=TV4gtMoPXdUC&pg=PT86 PT86]).</ref>

Bimyō married the writer [[Tazawa Inabune]] (Tazawa Kin) after she traveled to Tokyo to meet him.<ref name=Tanakap84>Tanaka, Yukiko. ''Women Writers of Meiji and Taisho Japan: Their Lives, Works and Critical Reception, 1868-1926''. [[McFarland & Company|McFarland]], September 1, 2000. {{ISBN|0786481978}}, 9780786481972. p. [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5l0tBGoEjIcC&pg=PA84 84].</ref> At the time, Bimyō's financial situation was deteriorating, and Inabune's family was wealthy. Yukiko Tanaka, author of ''Women Writers of Meiji and Taisho Japan: Their Lives, Works and Critical Reception, 1868-1926'', stated that the marriage would not have occurred if his financial troubles did not exist.<ref name="books.google.com.hk">Tanaka, Yukiko. ''Women Writers of Meiji and Taisho Japan: Their Lives, Works and Critical Reception, 1868-1926''. [[McFarland & Company|McFarland]], September 1, 2000. {{ISBN|0786481978}}, 9780786481972. p. [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5l0tBGoEjIcC&pg=PA85 85].</ref>

During the marriage Bimyō had affairs with other women.<ref name=Tanakap84/> Bimyō told Ozaki Kōyō, who criticized his affairs, that the dalliances were to enhance his artistic abilities.<ref>Tanaka, Yukiko. ''Women Writers of Meiji and Taisho Japan: Their Lives, Works and Critical Reception, 1868-1926''. [[McFarland & Company|McFarland]], September 1, 2000. {{ISBN|0786481978}}, 9780786481972. p. [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5l0tBGoEjIcC&pg=PA84 84]-[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=5l0tBGoEjIcC&pg=PA85 85].</ref> The marriage attracted scrutiny from the press, and after three months Bimyō and Inabune divorced, and Inabune was forced to return home.<ref name="books.google.com.hk"/>

The man's relationships with his colleagues eventually deteriorated.<ref name=MillerAZ>Miller, J. Scott.<!--Google Books says Scott J. but the cover says J. Scott--> ''The A to Z of Modern Japanese Literature and Theater'' (Volume 187 of The A to Z Guide Series). [[Scarecrow Press]], April 1, 2010. {{ISBN|1461731887}}, 9781461731887. p. [https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=ZPBsJ3-IDloC&pg=PA141 141].</ref> Bimyō's ex-wife died in 1896, and many newspapers erroneously reported that she had committed suicide. Melek Ortabasi, author of "Tazawa Inabune (1874-1896)", wrote that Inabune's death ended Bimyō's career "in large part" because Bimyō received criticism for how he had treated Inabune.<ref>Ortabasi, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TjBnHCkc32IC&pg=PA158 158].</ref>

Bimyō died at age 42. At the time of his death he was in a poor economic situation.<ref name=MillerAZ/> In 2006 Reichert stated that Bimyō had "faded into relative obscurity".<ref name=Reichertp99/>

==Writing style==
[[file:YamadaBimyo1910.jpg|thumb|Yamada Bimyō in 1910]]
Tomi Suzuki, author of ''Narrating the Self: Fictions of Japanese Modernity'', wrote that Bimyō's writing style "was in fact far from the spoken languages of the time."<ref name=SuzukiTomip44/> Bimyō favored ''[[genbun-itchi]]'' ([[:ja:言文一致|言文一致]]), which means unifying spoken and written language, and also used Western literature features including different grammatical persons, ellipses, passive voice, personification, and Western tense styles. He wrote an 1889 article advocating ''genbun-itchi''.<ref name=SuzukiTomip44/>
