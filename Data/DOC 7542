So far no films-just an upcoming film-now while it is likely that she can have a page in the future-for now it seems too soon. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:47, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::*'''Comment'''-A redirect can be useful for her right now as well. While I do think a page for an upcoming person could be interesting, it still falls under too soon. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 15:49, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
