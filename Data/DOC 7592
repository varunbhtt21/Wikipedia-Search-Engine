'''Ballinadihy Bridge''' is an Irish bridge situated {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Aghabullogue]] village in [[County Cork]], Ireland {{convert|4.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Coachford]] village, and is depicted on both the 1841 and 1901 surveyed OS maps. The bridge is located at the meeting point of the [[townlands]] of [[Clonmoyle West]] and Peake, and lies within both the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] and catholic [[parish]] of [[Aghabullogue]].

The Ordnance Survey name book (''c''. 1840), refers to it as 'Ballinadighey Bridge'. In the Archaeological Inventory of County Cork, it is described as a road bridge over the Delehinagh River, with two semi-circular arches, roughly cut [[voussoir]]s, a pointed breakwater, and overflow channel to the south-west.<ref name=power>{{cite book|first=Denis |last=Power|title=Archaeological inventory of county Cork, volume 3|year=1997|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|isbn=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Many of the surviving bridges in mid-Cork are originally constructed of stone, arched in shape, and late eighteenth or early nineteenth century in date. Typical features often include semi-circular arches and pointed breakwaters. Earlier bridges are often narrower, although some were widened at a later stage.<ref name=power/>

O'Donoghue (1986) refers to Ballinadihy Bridge as being located at the southern end of Clonmoyle West townland, and holds the Irish version of Ballinadihy as ''Béal Áth na Daibhche'', meaning 'ford mouth of the hollow'.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Donoghue, B.|title=Parish histories and place names of west Cork|year=1986|location=Kerryman Ltd.}}</ref> According to local information, the bridge is reputed to be haunted.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
