==Biography==
Julián Ercolini became a judge of the federal court in 2004. He worked on a denunciation of then-president Néstor Kirchner, accused of illicit enrichment. He declared him innocent in 2005. Three years laters, he worked on a large denunciation for criminal conspiracy against Kirchner and other politicians, filed by legislator [[Elisa Carrió]].

He received a judicial case started in 2010 around the sale of shares in the [[Papel Prensa]] manufacturer of newsprint, which was claimed to have been done under duress during the [[Dirty War]]. He ruled in 2016 that [[Héctor Magnetto]] and [[Ernestina Herrera de Noble]] (from the [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] newspaper) and Bartolomé Mitre (from [[La Nación]] newspaper) were innocent, as there was no evidence of any wrongdoing on their part.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1967747-papel-prensa-sobreseyeron-a-bartolome-mitre-hector-magnetto-y-ernestina-herrera-de-noble|title= Papel Prensa: sobreseyeron a Bartolomé Mitre, Héctor Magnetto y Ernestina Herrera de Noble|trans-title=Papel Prensa: they surrendered to Bartolomé Mitre, Héctor Magnetto and Ernestina Herrera de Noble |language= Spanish|author= |date= 16 December 2016|newspaper= La Nación|location=Buenos Aires|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref>
