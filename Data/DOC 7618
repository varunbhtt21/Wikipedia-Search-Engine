Only refs seem to be for songs, also the date of birth is completely different in both the infobox and the person data box (January 1973 and April 1989, those dates are not even close to each other) as well as a ref to just an advertisement. Looks like an advertisement page as well. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 16:02, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' No evidence whatever of notability. In fact, speedy deletion might not be out of the question, as the article in its present form does not make any claim of significance, and its earlier versions consisted largely of unsubstantiated blatantly promotional stuff. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 12:45, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - perhaps the article could be worked on to include more sources, otherwise, delete. [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 06:28, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
