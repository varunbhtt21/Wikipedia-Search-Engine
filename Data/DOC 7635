Title : Monolith (catalyst support)
Text : '''Monolithic catalyst supports''' are [[extrusion|extruded]] structures that are the core of many [[catalytic converter]]s,<ref name="Williams_2001">Williams, J.; ''Monolithic structures, materials, properties and uses''; Catalysis Today, 69 (2001) 3-9</ref> most [[diesel particulate filter]]s, and some [[chemical reactor#Catalytic reactor|catalytic reactors]]. Most catalytic converters are used for [[vehicle emissions control]]. Stationary catalytic converters can reduce [[air pollution]] from [[fossil fuel power station]]s.

Monoliths for automotive catalytic converters are made of a [[ceramic]] that contains a large proportion of synthetic [[cordierite]], 2MgO•2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>•5SiO<sub>2</sub>, which has a low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]].<ref name="Williams_2001"/>

Each monolith contains thousands of parallel channels or holes, which are defined by many thin walls, in a [[honeycomb structure]]. The channels can be square, [[hexagon]]al, round, or other shapes. The hole density may be from 30 to 200 per cm<sup>2</sup>, and the separating walls can be 0.05 to 0.3&nbsp;mm. The many small holes have a much larger [[surface area]] than one large hole. High surface area facilitates catalytic reaction or filtration. The open spaces in the cross-sectional area are 72 to 87% of the frontal area, so resistance to the flow of gases through the holes is low, which minimizes energy consumed forcing gases through the structure.

The monolith is a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]] that [[catalyst support|supports]] a [[catalyst]]. After the monolith is complete, a washcoat is applied that deposits oxides and catalyst(s) (most commonly [[platinum]], [[palladium]], and/or [[rhodium]]) on the walls of the holes.

Alternative structures include corrugated metal and a [[packed bed]] of coated pellets or other shapes.
