Title : Base58
Text : '''Base58''' is a group of [[binary-to-text encoding]] schemes used to represent [[large numbers|large integers]] as alphanumeric text, introduced by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] for use with [[Bitcoin]].<ref>
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding#Background</ref> It has since been applied to other [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] and applications.  It is similar to [[Base64]] but has been modified to avoid both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which might look ambiguous when printed. It is therefore designed for human users who manually enter the data, copying from some visual source, but also allows easy [[copy and paste]] because a [[double-click]] will usually [[Selection (user interface)|select]] the whole string.

Compared with Base64, the following similar-looking letters are omitted: 0 (zero), O (capital o), I (capital i) and l (lower case L) as well as the non-alphanumeric characters + (plus) and / (slash). In contrast with Base64, the digits of the encoding do not line up well with [[bit]] boundaries of the original data. For this reason, the method is well-suited to encode large integers, but not designed to encode longer portions of [[binary data]]. The actual order of letters in the alphabet depends on the application, which is the reason why the term “Base58” alone is not enough to fully describe the format. A variant, Base56, excludes 1 (one) and o (lowercase o) compared with Base 58.

'''Base58Check''' is a Base58 encoding format that unambiguously encodes the type of data in the first few characters and includes an [[error detection]] code in the last few characters.<ref>
