The result was    '''Rename'''. Consensus is to rename.  "Mobile applications" is more reasonable that "apps" from what I can see <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User talk:DangerousPanda|<font style="color:#ffffff;background:black;"> the panda </font><font style="color:#000000;background:white;"> ₯’</font>]]</span></small> 22:43, 17 May 2014 (UTC)

:({{Find sources|Wikipedia App}})
[[WP:SELFREF|Self-refential]] article that cites no [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that discuss the article's topic in some detail. No indication of [[WP:WEB|notability]]. Instead it's a spamlink farm. Was prodded for that reason, prod removed by [[Special:Contributions/71.163.241.12|71.163.241.12]], who claimed that  "Wikipedia apps have extensive major media coverage" without providing a single example. I'm not opposed to turning the page into something in the Wikipedia namespace if someone wants to do so, but it's not a valid topic for an article.

*'''Keep''', nice amount of sourcing and more out there available. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 10:35, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' or '''rename''' and change the scope of the article to [[List of Wikipedia apps]] or something similar. Most of the non-affiliated sources pertain to ''different'' apps than the main topic of the article, artificially inflating its notability.

:Rename to that suggestion, by {{u|Qwertyus}}, is also another good idea. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 17:48, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Rename''' seems like the best solution. [[User:VMS Mosaic|VMS Mosaic]] ([[User talk:VMS Mosaic|talk]])
*'''Merge''' or '''Redirect''' to [[Wikipedia]]. The sourcing is really really poor as it is. There are plenty of "top 5 ways to access Wikipedia on your phone" lists out there, but the notable subject is Wikipedia. Even if it scrapes by GNG, it doesn't merit its own article. The only thing that would make sense is [[List of Wikipedia mobile applications]], but the number of such applications with their own Wikipedia articles (such that they would be included) is so small it would again make sense to incorporate them into [[Wikipedia]]. --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 15:33, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
