* '''Support as nominator''' --&mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC) 
*'''Note:''' Transcribed text to English Wikisource at [[s:The Impact of Wikipedia by Adrianne Wadewitz]]. Also available in captions in other languages at [[m:Fundraising 2012/Translation/Adrianne Wadewitz video (captions)]], so could be added to other Wikisource sites. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:28, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' (no support or oppose yet as I haven't had the time to view the film; rather late) - This is unlikely to run in POTD in the near future, owing to the possible COI of having an image/video of a Wikipedian in the slot. Our image of [[Mike Godwin]], for instance, did not run until 3 years after he left the Wikimedia Foundation.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 16:42, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:*Understood, and no worries about that! &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:43, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' A good-quality, professionally produced video by a notable Wikipedian. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])</sup></span> 17:14, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''' --<font style="white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0em 0em 0.8em,#FF4500 -0.8em -0.8em 0.9em,#90EE90 0.7em 0.7em 0.8em;color:#696969"><span style="font-family:Old English Text MT;color:black"><big>[[User:The Herald|The herald]]</big></span></font> 15:18, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - In the captions, "Nineteenth Century" needs to be "nineteenth-century". There may be other issues with the closed captions, but for some reason this isn't streaming well right now.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 05:35, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:*{{Ping|Crisco 1492}} how can I help fix this? &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 18:09, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::*I'm not familiar with fixing captions, otherwise I'd have done it myself. Does anyone know?&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 23:51, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*I fixed it, at [[m:Fundraising 2012/Translation/Adrianne Wadewitz video (captions)]]. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 00:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*That didn't seem to fix the video file, itself, however. I could still use some help with that. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 00:35, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::*I think [[Wikipedia:Timed text]] fits in here, somewhere, but I'm not sure.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 00:38, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::*I asked Victor, and he gave me [[:commons:TimedText:The Impact of Wikipedia Adrianne Wadewitz.webm.en.srt|the correct link]], so I fixed it (note that the italics display on the video themselves). If I missed anything, just don't fiddle with the timings. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])</sup></span> 14:25, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''', though main page appearance should be discussed in a couple years at the earliest.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 15:10, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:*Thank you, {{u|Crisco 1492}}, and no worries about some time passing before main page appearance. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 17:37, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::*Although I do think that six months to a year should be ample. It's not like she was employed by Wikipedia. The one year anniversary might not be bad. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.118em 0.118em 0.118em; class=texhtml">'''[[User:Adam Cuerden|Adam Cuerden]]''' <sup>([[User talk:Adam Cuerden|talk]])</sup></span> 21:17, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*Agreed, but that could be a separate discussion for a later point in time, after this discussion has been closed. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 22:45, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::::*That's my plan.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 22:51, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' (unless addressed, the closer should consider this an oppose vote)''':''' I was under the impression that FP was not accepting videos. That's a large part of the reason that Featured Sounds, during its revival a few years ago, accepted videos. If we're going to allow this one, we need to allow high quality videos at FP in general, and that needs to be a change that the Featured Pictures community is willing to live with (and back with support votes when warranted). [[User:Sven Manguard|<font color="207004">'''<big>S</big>ven&nbsp;<big>M</big>anguard'''</font>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Sven Manguard|<small><font color="F0A804">'''Wha?'''</font></small>]] 00:24, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:*'''Reply:''' Actually, {{u|Sven Manguard}}, the criteria at '''[[Wikipedia:Featured picture criteria]]''' specifically allows for video files. Please see for example last line under existing criteria for point number two (2): ''[[Wikipedia:Featured picture criteria|"Animations and video may be somewhat smaller."]]'' Thank you, &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 00:35, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::*What is allowed in theory and what happens in practice are not always the same thing though. It might be written into the rules, but back when I was involved in FS, people seemed to believe that a video didn't have a chance in FP. That's why I really need to hear from FP regulars that they would support videos in the future.

:::*What you heard was wrong. We have featured several videos, including of [[:File:Cheetahs on the Edge (Director's Cut).ogv|a cheetah running]], [[:File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|a controversial ad]], and [[:File:Experime1940.ogv|a "living" decapitated dog's head]]. We don't have many videos (there's still a few more, but not many... I think [[plasma globe]] and [[surfing]] both have featured videos), but we do promote them.&nbsp;—&nbsp;[[User:Crisco 1492|Crisco 1492]] ([[User talk:Crisco 1492|talk]]) 01:16, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*Thank you, {{u|Crisco 1492}}, for this helpful explanation. Most appreciated, &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 03:29, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
