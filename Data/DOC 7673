I also put a merge tag on this-yes it is listed as upcoming albums-but with no info-so I say the best might be to merge this with that band until more info comes. Or if an expert about the band can come in. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 16:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:'''Keep''': Album has release date and tracklisting, as well as some coverage in music press. Will only be recreated a month from now if deleted --[[User:Drowninginlimbo|Drowninginlimbo]] ([[User talk:Drowninginlimbo|talk]]) 21:32, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''-I think in that case-a merge or redirect might be the best until it gets closer. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:38, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''': Where is the line for notability here?  I am somewhat unfamiliar with how the notability of a band, an album, a song, etc. are decided upon.  I would lean here towards a merge if the thing is even <u>notable</u>/<u>going to be notable</u>/<u>considered notable</u>.  But we don't know this yet, or do the music and pop culture articles use a different standard than the rest of Wikipedia.  These type of AfDs always seem subjective to me.  Is this a much-awaited release; or notable for some other reason?  (To me, it's an obscure album by an obscure band.)  Or, does everything in the music and entertainment genres just get an article, no proof needed?  I really would like to know.

*'''Merge''' - I hesitate to try to predict which albums will be notable before they are actually released. I've never heard of this band, which doesn't necessarily mean anything, but it makes me think that a merge onto their general page would be a better option at this point. To me, it seems unlikely that this album will gain enough notability that it will warrant its own page even if it has a reasonable amount of coverage after its release. The only time I'd argue to keep an article about a yet to be released album is if it's like Michael Jackson or Lady Gaga and it's being talked about to death. I'd say there likely won't be enough about this album that it can't be reasonably covered on the band's main page. [[User:Bali88|Bali88]] ([[User talk:Bali88|talk]]) 06:19, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''': Seconding [[User:Drowninginlimbo|Drowninginlimbo]], I created article and "album has release date and tracklisting, as well as some coverage in music press." It will be recreated if deleted. I'm not sure why notability is a part of this proposal as it doesn't apply here, there is already a huge article and [[Template:E6]] covering these groups.  --[[User:Dylanbud|Dylanbud]] ([[User talk:Dylanbud|talk]]) 01:43, 10 May 2014 (UTC)
::'''Comment''' A stand-alone article in Wikipedia must first and foremost be notable to be kept around.  And keep in mind, a lot of "buzz" is not notability-inducing, just publicity which quickly fades.  Since notability [[Wikipedia:NOTINHERITED|is not inherited]] (automatic), nor [[Wikipedia:Notability#Notability requires verifiable evidence|can future notability be guessed]] at, there is a huge question as to the creation of, and the keeping of, this article as a stand-a-lone article.  What is notable about this album?  or any of Circulatory System's albums?  I would suggest they should all be merged into the main article per [[WP:Notability (music)|Wikipedia music notability policies]].
