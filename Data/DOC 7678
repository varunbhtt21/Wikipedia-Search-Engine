The '''Jane Cameron National Archives''' are the official national archives of the [[Falkland Islands]]. Government records in the Falklands were started by the first [[Governor of the Falkland Islands]], [[Richard Moody]], in 1841. The records were initially kept in Stanley Town Hall and the Secretariat Building and remained largely intact, despite fires in 1944 and 1959.<ref name="JCNA About">{{cite web | url=http://www.fig.gov.fk/archives/index.php/about-archives| title=Our Holdings | work=Jane Cameron National Archives| date= | accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

In 1989 the Falkland Islands Government created the post of Government Archivist to look after the archives. The inaugural holder of the position was Jane Cameron, who was the granddaughter of a former Governor of the Falklands and a sibling to the Falkland Islands' UK Representative, Sukey Cameron. The archives were moved to a custom made building on Jeremy Moore Avenue in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] in 1998.<ref name="JCNA About"/>

On 26 December 2009 Jane Cameron died from injuries she had sustained the previous month in a car crash while travelling in [[Argentina]].<ref name="MercoPress">{{cite web | url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/01/12/islands-pay-tribute-to-fierce-champion-of-falklands-tradition | title=Islands pay tribute to "fierce champion of Falklands’ tradition"| work=[[MercoPress|MercoPress, South Atlantic News Agency]] | date=12 January 2010 | accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="MuseumMedia">{{cite web| url=http://museummedia.nl/news/jane-cameron-1950-died-yesterday-due-to-her-injuries-of-the-beagle-car-accident/| title=Archivist Jane Cameron (1950), died yesterday due to her injuries in the ‘Beagle’ car accident| work=Museum Media| date=27 December 2009| accessdate=26 April 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215202/http://museummedia.nl/news/jane-cameron-1950-died-yesterday-due-to-her-injuries-of-the-beagle-car-accident/| archivedate=26 April 2014| df=}}</ref> In 2010 the archives were renamed in her honour and officially made the national archives of the Falklands.<ref name="JCNA About"/>
