This is a template for describing a Colored Convention. '''If the convention is an annual event, do not make a page for a single occurrence'''â€”that is, do not make a page for "The Second Annual Convention for the Improvement of the Free People of Color". Instead, add information about that convention under a heading in the page for "The Annual Convention for the Improvement of the Free People of Color".

Fill out the infobox above with as much information as possible. Then describe the state or national convention briefly in this section.

==Historical context==

A brief historical context of the era of the Colored Conventions. If this is a state convention, you can put some information about the national Colored Conventions many state conventions were inspired by or offshoots of. Link back to the [[Colored Conventions Movement]] page, and to pages like [[African-American history]].

==The Convention==

Information about this convention. For how long was this convention held? Where? When did it stop? Why?

===Title of an individual meeting of this Convention, Year===

What happened? What effect did it have? Try to link to other Wikipedia pages about: the attendees; the causes and interests people brought to the event; the results of the convention politically and socially, if any.
