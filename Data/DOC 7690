== History ==

Formed at a nightclub in 2005 when a mutual friend invented a silly band name to try to impress a girl,<ref>{{cite web|author=Gandalf&#x27;s Fist |url=http://gandalfsfist.com/bio |title=Gandalf's Fist Bio (Official Website) |publisher=gandalfsfist.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref> Gandalf's Fist began as the creative collaboration of multi-instrumentalist Dean Marsh and lyricist-vocalist Luke Severn. Meeting at university and becoming good friends, the duo spent the subsequent two years releasing experimental instrumental tracks. The origins of their music were influenced by the golden era of progressive rock in the 1970s and traditional English [[folk music]].<ref name="Fist Website"></ref>

After their LPs ''Road to Darkness'' and ''From a Point of Existence'' were favorably reviewed by G. W. Hill at ''Music Street Journal''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicstreetjournal.com/artists_display.cfm?id=102424 |title=Gandalf's Fist at Music Street Journal |publisher=Musicstreetjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref> for their mix of [[Neo-progressive rock|neo-prog]], folk and [[hard rock]], they recruited German drummer Stefan Hepe to work on their fourth full release, listing him in the liner notes as one of the "Additional Wanderers Intercepting the Signal".<ref>{{cite web|author=Gandalf&#x27;s Fist |url=http://gandalfsfist.com/newalbum |title=Album "A Day in the Life of a Universal Wanderer" (Official Website) |publisher=gandalfsfist.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>
Gandalf's Fist released the subsequent LP ''A Day in the Life of a Universal Wanderer'' in September 2013, being the last release by the band under the US label Musik&Film<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musikandfilm.com/gandalfs-fist-releases-album-from-outside-the-solar-system-with-musik-and-film-records/ |title=Gandalf’s Fist releases Album from ‘Outside the solar system’ with Musik and Film records |publisher=musikandfilm.com |date=2014-09-16 |accessdate=2014-10-05}}</ref> and received widespread coverage from progressive rock journalists (''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Magazine]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/123461089@N06/albums/72157647421810688|title=Classic Rock FEB 2014|publisher=}}</ref> ''[[Prog_magazine|Prog Magazine]]'',<ref name="Prog41" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/123461089@N06/albums/72157647398039097|title=Prog Magazine #42|publisher=}}</ref> ''Powerplay Magazine'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/123461089@N06/albums/72157647417957170|title=Powerplay Magazine #161|publisher=}}</ref> ''Fireworks Magazine''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/123461089@N06/albums/72157647771507886|title=Fireworks Magazine #62|publisher=}}</ref>).

After accepting the offer to play at the "Second Stage" at Planet Radio "Planet Rockstock" in Great Yarmouth, Gandalf's Fist promoted guest musician drummer Stefan Hepe and touring bassist Christopher Ewen, making them full members.

As a four-piece, the band wrote new material for their fifth full length release called ''A Forest of Fey'',<ref name="ArchiveFey">{{cite web|author=Progarchives |url=http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=46398 |title=GANDALF'S FIST - A Forest of Fey (2014) |publisher=progarchives.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> which features [[Troy Donockley]], [[John Mitchell (musician)|John Mitchell]], [[Dave Oberlé]] and [[Clive Nolan]] as guest musicians.<ref name="TeamRockFey">{{cite web|author=Martin Kielty |url=http://teamrock.com/news/2014-08-12/donockley-nolan-stevens-guest-with-gandalf-s-fist |title=Teamrock News: Donockley, Nolan, Stevens and Mitchell guest with Gandalf’s Fist |publisher=teamrock.com |date=2014-08-12 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> It was released on 20 October 2014.

During the first half of 2015, the band released two EPs at once: an [[Acoustic music|unplugged]] album containing songs of their career so far,<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Munro |url=http://teamrock.com/news/2015-05-19/gandalf-s-fist-to-launch-acoustic-ep |title=Teamrock News: Gandalf’s Fist to launch acoustic EP |publisher=teamrock.com |date=2015-05-19 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}</ref> and a "best of" compilation, giving the opportunity to check out a song from every studio album released so far. Three songs were completely re-recorded or mixed, and the album is available as "name your price" via their [[Bandcamp]] page.

In November 2015, the band announced work on their sixth album,<ref>{{cite web|author=Martin Kielty |url=http://teamrock.com/news/2015-11-10/gandalf-s-fist-tease-6th-album |title=Teamrock News: Gandalf’s Fist tease 6th album |publisher=teamrock.com |date=2015-11-14 |accessdate=2015-11-14}}</ref> stating it will again be a concept album planned to be released in 2016.
