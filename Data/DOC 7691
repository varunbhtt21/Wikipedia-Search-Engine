The '''Telekom S-League''', commonly known as just the '''Solomon Islands S-League''' or more simply the '''S-League''' for sponsorship reasons, is a semi professional league and the top division of the [[Solomon Islands Football Federation]]. It was known as the Solomon Islands National Club Championship from 2000 until 2010, when the official name was changed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/solomchamp.html|title=Solomon Islands - List of Champions|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>

==Format==
In the current season, 2016, all teams compete in a round robin, where the team that ends at the first place are crowned champions. Together with the second-placed team, they qualify for the [[OFC Champions League]]. The bottom team is then relegated to the Second Division, while the best performing team from that league is promoted to this league.

==History==

=== Interprovincial Tournament (1977-1985) ===
This tournament had begun the early football in Solomon Islands. It was held by the FA of the Solomon Islands.

===[[Solomon Islands National Club Championship (2000–10)|National Club Championship (2000–10)]]===
The Solomon Islands S-League was founded in 2000, with [[Koloale F.C.|Koloale]] taking out the first premiership title. The final championship was the 2009–10 season, with the next season renamed to the Telekom S-League.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.siff.com.sb/category/telekom-s-league/|title=Category: Telekom S-League|website=Solomon Football|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>

===The Knockout Championship (2011–12)===
All teams of the league played a knockout tournament after the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons, called the Knockout Championship. The winners of both competitions played a two legged play-off for a place in the [[OFC Champions League]]. In the case of the 2011–12 season play-off, [[Solomon Warriors F.C.|Solomon Warriors]] won both these competitions and automatically qualified. The 8-team competition was abandoned in the 2013–14 season due to the increase of teams from 8 to 9.

===Telekom S-League (2010–present)===
In 2011, the competition was renamed to the Telekom S-League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siff.com.sb/News/ViewArticle/tabid/1258/Article/ed63f6c8-1824-4e26-857b-47bd1219948d/language/en-US/Default.aspx|title=Telekom S-League kicks off Saturday|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=14 May 2011|publisher=Solomon Islands Football Federation}}</ref> Marist, Koloale, Kossa, Solomon Warriors, Makuru, Hana, Western United and Fasi Roos participated in the initial season of the new league. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siff.com.sb/News/ViewArticle/tabid/1258/Article/9db2712f-d646-4bd5-a2c9-d3855136a70e/language/en-US/Default.aspx|title=NSL Media Statement|date=5 January 2011|accessdate=14 May 2011|publisher=Solomon Islands Football Federation}}</ref> The first inaugural S-League was won by [[Koloale F.C.|Koloale]].
