*'''Regirect''' to [[computer graphics]]. Provided that this is a dictionary definition, this article may be safely deleted per [[WP:NOTDIR]], but [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/CG_artwork page views count] suggests that this page could be linked from external websites. I believe that landing at related article would serve readers better then deletion log notice. — [[user:czarkoff|Dmitrij D.

*'''Redirect''' - [[Computer graphics]] seems like it makes sense. Not substantially different enough to merit its own article (probably not even a whole section of the other article). --&mdash; <tt>[[User:Rhododendrites|<span style="font-size:90%;letter-spacing:1px;text-shadow:0px -1px 0px Indigo;">Rhododendrites</span>]] <sup style="font-size:80%;">[[User_talk:Rhododendrites|talk]]</sup></tt> |&nbsp; 15:19, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
