==History==
There has been a church on this site since the [[Middle Ages]]. This was probably a [[stave church]] which was replaced by a timber church in 1613. The second church was probably similar design to the nearby [[Hamre Church]]. That church was torn down to make room for the present church in 1874.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osteroy.kyrkja.no/Haus.html|title=Haus kyrkje|publisher=Osterøy kyrkjeleg fellesråd|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2014-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165517/http://www.osteroy.kyrkja.no/Haus.html|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}</ref>
