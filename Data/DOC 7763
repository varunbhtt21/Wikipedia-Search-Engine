'''The Buzztones''' are a UK-based a cappella group formed in 2011. They were finalists of the 2013 [[The View from The Shard|View from The Shard]] singing competition and debuted at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] with their sell-out show 'Nevermind the Buzztones' in 2013. They returned to the Fringe with a new show, Buzzology, in August 2015.

The group were founded as a break-away group from London male chorus, Eschoir. Their musical output is predominantly made up of 'pop' covers and 'mash-ups' of songs by UK and US-charting artists.

Hailing from London, The Buzztones have performed at the BBC's Pink Tent, also headlining [[The Bedford, Balham]] with sell-out shows in 2012, 2013 & 2015. They performed the anthems at the England vs Wales Rugby World Cup match held at Twickenham Stadium on 26 September 2015.

The groups comedic leanings have seen their musical talents being put to use on TV shows such as [[Channel 4]]'s [[The Last Leg]] & [[Loaded (TV series)]], and [[BBC Three]]'s [[Siblings (TV series)]], as well as several appearances on BBC's [[The One Show]].

On 7 May 2018, The Buzztones were crowned as 1st place winners<ref>[https://www.aluxurytravelblog.com/2018/05/15/moscows-a-cappella-festival-gala-concert-part-of-moscow-seasons/ Moscow a cappella festival]</ref> of the Moscow Spring A Cappella Competition in their group category.
