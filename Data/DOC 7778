==History==
There has been a church at Hosanger since the [[Middle Ages]]. The first time Hosanger Church is mentioned in historical records is in 1329. That church was most probably a [[stave church]]. That church was replaced at some unknown time by a timber-framed church. A report from 1686 described as "very run down" because of poor exterior maintenance, which suggests that the church, at that time was already relatively old. At Christmas 1795, lightning struck the church and it burned down. A new stone church was built on the same site the following year. That stone church was renovated and enlarged from 1863–65 and again from 1962–64.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osteroy.kyrkja.no/Hosanger.html|title=Hosanger kyrkje|language=Norwegian|publisher=Osterøy kyrkjeleg fellesråd|accessdate=2014-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165522/http://www.osteroy.kyrkja.no/Hosanger.html|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}</ref>
