==Production==
[[File:Fox Film Studio, Rome, Italy - Jan 1922 EH.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fox studio in Rome where the film was made]]
The film was made by an Italian subsidiary of the [[Fox Film Corporation]] as part of an ambitious plan to make major films in Europe (with Britain and France planned as destinations as well as Italy). The film was shot on location in and around [[Rome]], including at the [[Colosseum]]. Despite the fact that production costs were cheaper in Italy than Hollywood, the film's budget continued to grow. Some differences in labor demands (Italian extras insisting on lap breaks in the afternoons) caused some difficulty for the production as well.<ref>Brownlow, Kevin and John Kobal. ''Hollywood: The Pioneers''. NY: Alfred A Knopf. p. 226. {{ISBN|0-394-50851-3}}</ref> The film ultimately cost $358,000 to make.<ref name="SolomonP58"/> Although the film was eventually able to gross $522,000 this came out as a nearly $60,000 loss due to [[advertising]] and [[film distribution|distribution]] costs. The film ended Fox's European scheme after only one production, with an announced film of ''Mary, Queen of Scots'' never being made.
