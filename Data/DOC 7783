The '''Vatican News App''' is an official [[mobile application software]] issued by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s [[Dicastery for Communication]]. Formerly titled '''The Pope App''', the app was launched on January 23, 2013 under the auspices of the [[Pontifical Council for Social Communications]], a now-defunct dicastery that was merged into the Secretariat (now Dicastery) for Communication in March 2016. 

Initially, The Pope App was available only on [[iOS]] devices, but became available for Android phones at the end of February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pope has a new App-titute|url= http://cnsblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/the-pope-has-a-new-app-titude/|publisher=Catholic News Service - Blog|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> The app is available for download on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in five languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

It was originally promoted as an application with focus on the figure of the Pope which made it possible to follow the Pope's events while they are taking place. Alerts notified the followers by informing and offering access to "official papal-related content in a variety of formats".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pope App|url=http://www.news.va/thepopeapp/|publisher=Official Vatican Media|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> The app also enabled its users to see areas of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] through webcams allocated throughout [[St. Peter's Square]] in [[Rome]] that broadcast images.

In early 2018, The Pope App was relaunched as the Vatican News App, accompanied by a redesign that eliminated many of the previous version's features, reducing the app to a more conventional news service, with increased emphasis on news from the Vatican and the worldwide [[Catholic Church]] and less focus on the day-to-day activities of the Pope.
