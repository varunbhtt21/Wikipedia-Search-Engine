Sources consist of weibo and lol posts. Failed to find reliable sources for verification. [[User:Brycehughes|Brycehughes]] ([[User talk:Brycehughes|talk]]) 16:53, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-seems to be just for some team on an online program, which to my knowledge Wikipedia does not do. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 17:40, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Wikipedia does have articles on gamers and could have articles on teams.  However, The lack of any reliable refs makes that argument moot.  No refs, no article. [[User:Bgwhite|Bgwhite]] ([[User talk:Bgwhite|talk]]) 21:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' No [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] = no [[WP:N|notability]]. Reads more like a fansite posting than a Wikipedia article.
