Title : Child abuse image content list
Text : {{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}

The child abuse image content URL list (CAIC List) is a list of URLs and image hashes provided by the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] to its partners to enable the blocking of [[child pornography]] & [[Obscene Publications Acts|criminally obscene adult content]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and by major international technology companies.<ref name="bigtech">{{cite news|last1=Newsmedia|title=UK Charity Starts Sharing Database With Tech Giants to Fight Sexual Abuse|url=http://www.dispatchtimes.com/uk-charity-starts-sharing-database-with-tech-giants-to-fight-sexual-abuse/41545/|accessdate=11 August 2015|date=11 August 2015}}</ref>

Cleanfeed is a [[content blocking system]] technology implemented in the UK by [[BT Group|BT]], Britain's largest Internet provider.

==Technical implementation==
The confidential url hash [[blacklist]] contains [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s of pages (not whole sites) to be blocked. A less confidential list of sites potentially containing blocked pages is available to [[Internet service provider|ISPs]]. Routers on the edge redirect traffic to these sites to special HTTP [[proxy server]]s which perform the actual filtering by matching HTTP requests to URLs on the blacklist. Traffic that does not match the specific URL is forwarded through the proxy filter.

Chapter 7 of a research paper by Richard Clayton<ref name=Clayton>{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-653.pdf|title=Anonymity and traceability in cyberspace|last=Clayton|first=Richard|date=November 2005|work=Richard Clayton|publisher=Richard Clayton|accessdate=10 December 2008}}</ref> provides an overview of the Cleanfeed technology.

The [[Router (computing)|routers]] at an ISP that has implemented Cleanfeed technology check traffic destination against a list of [[IP address]]es of sites that are suspected of hosting filtered traffic.  If there is no match, the traffic is directed to the content host:

[[File:URL Filtering (1).svg|none|587px]]

If the site IP address is found in the list of suspected sources of unwanted material, the traffic is routed to proxies (highlighted as IWF proxies)<ref name="ORG">{{cite web|url=http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2008/12/08/iwf-censors-wikipedia-chaos-ensues/|title=IWF censors Wikipedia, chaos ensues|last=Hogge|first=Becky|publisher=[[Open Rights Group]]|accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> that check the specific page against a confidential blacklist of pages.

[[File:URL Filtering (2).svg|none|800px]]

This two-pass implementation reduces the load on the proxy servers by not requiring that ''all'' traffic pass through them.

==Technical Detection==
Due to the filtering mechanism, to detect whether a site is being filtered via an individual ISP's connection, one must first capture the filtering servers IPs by running [[traceroute]] for the first few hops to some websites [[List of websites blocked in the United Kingdom|known to be blocked]]<ref name=Clayton/><ref>{{cite web|title=Check The IWF list|url=http://iwfchecker.lightning-bolt.net/|publisher=lightning-bolt.net}}</ref>

[[Demon Internet]] are the only ISP to notify users routinely when content is blocked and offer the option to intercept and serve filtered content over https connections.<ref>{{cite web|last=McIntyre|first=T J|title=Child Abuse images and Cleanfeeds: Assessing Internet Blocking Systems|url=https://www.academia.edu/771272/Child_Abuse_Images_and_Cleanfeeds_Assessing_Internet_Blocking_Systems|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref>

==Filtering comparison==
The other popular way of blocking content is [[Domain name system|DNS]] manipulation. Compared to this, Cleanfeed has the following properties:

* Slightly harder to circumvent, although users can use [[open proxies]], or the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network]], and servers can use another port than 80, or [[HTTPS]].
* Less collateral damage. DNS-based blocking is criticized for blocking all content on a site with the same domain name. Cleanfeed only blocks what is explicitly blacklisted. For example, it would be possible to block only one image in an article. DNS-based schemes also break the whole concept of [[DNSSEC|DNS security]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.circleid.com/pdf/PROTECT-IP-Technical-Whitepaper-Final.pdf |title=Security and Other Technical Concerns Raised by the DNS Filtering Requirements in the PROTECT IP Bill |year=2011 |author=Steve Crocker, Shinkuro, Inc. |author2=David Dagon, Georgia Tech |author3=Dan Kaminsky, DKH |author4=Danny McPherson, Verisign, Inc. |author5=Paul Vixie |author6=Internet Systems Consortium }}</ref>

==Related surveys of opinion==
The first UK survey of Internet regulation was carried out in 2007 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3266/3071|title=Internet regulation: The need for more transparent Internet filtering systems and improved measurement of public opinion on Internet filtering - Koumartzis - First Monday|work=firstmonday.org|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>Book: BT's Cleanfeed and Online Censorship in UK, N Koumartzis, London College of Communication (University of the Arts London)</ref> 90.21% of the participants in the limited scale survey were unaware of the existence of CleanFeed; of those who had heard about it, only 14.81% percent understood it completely. 11.1% learned about CleanFeed from UK government statements, and 22.2 percent from BT's statements. 60.87% did not trust BT, and 65.22% did not trust IWF to be responsible for a silent content blocking system in the UK.

A majority of the participants preferred an open content blocking system targeting child abuse content, rather than no Internet regulation. More specifically, 65.2% would prefer to see a message stating that a given site was blocked, 57.3% would like to have access to a form for unblocking a given site, and 68.5% would prefer more frequent briefing by BT, IWF and the UK.

==Criticism==
One of the criticisms of Cleanfeed is its lack of transparency. This is a consequence of the list of blocked sites being secret. There are no safeguards to stop sites unrelated to Child Pornography being added to the list as a result of policy changes.<ref name=BBCcopyright /> It thus has a potential for the censorship of materials outside of its original remit. Indeed, the Home Office in the UK has previously indicated that it has considered requiring ISPs to block access to articles on the web deemed to be "glorifying terrorism", within the meaning of the new [[Terrorism Act 2006]], saying: "our legislation as drafted provides the flexibility to accommodate a change in Government policy should the need ever arise."<ref name="LINX">"[http://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=497 Government sets deadline for universal network-level content blocking] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601194532/http://publicaffairs.linx.net/news/?p=497 |date=1 June 2006 }}", LINX, 29 May 2006. Retrieved 29 May 2006.</ref> This has led some to describe Cleanfeed as the most perfectly invisible censorship mechanism ever invented and to liken its powers of censorship to those employed currently by China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol3-3/editorial.asp|title=From child porn to China, in one Cleanfeed|author=Professor Lilian Edwards, University of Southampton|access-date=26 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516015335/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol3-3/editorial.asp|archive-date=16 May 2013|dead-url=yes}}</ref> However, at present no legislation is in place, and the implementation of the IWF URL list is still a voluntary agreement between ISPs and the IWF.

The measures have also been criticised for being inadequate as they only block accidental viewing and does not prevent content delivered through encrypted systems, file sharing, email and other systems.<ref name="Ref_2009">"[http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=97151 Restricting All but the Predators]", Dark Reading, 14 June 2006. URL accessed on 24 June 2006.</ref>

Another criticism is that Newzbin claims to have successfully circumvented Cleanfeed following a court order forcing BT to censor the website over copyright infringement claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15572495 |title=Newzbin claims BT block 'not working'|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ispreview.co.uk/story/2011/10/06/banned-piracy-website-expands-bt-circumvention-tool-to-include-the-pirate-bay.html |title=Banned Piracy Website Expands BT Circumvention Tool to Include The Pirate Bay|author=Mark Jackson|work=ispreview.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref> This poses the question as to whether websites hosting child pornography could adopt similar measures to allow their users access to blocked content .

Due to the [[Proxy Server|proxy server]] implementation of the Cleanfeed system, websites that [[Ingress filtering|filter users by IP address]] such as a [[wiki]]s and [[File hosting service|file lockers]] will be significantly broken through the system,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterwallet.com/six-uk-isps-block-a-wikipedia-article-locking-out-wikipedia-edits/4194 |title=Six UK ISPâ€™s block a Wikipedia article locking out Wikipedia edits|work=bitterwallet.com|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref> even if only a tiny proportion of its content is blocked.

Finally, information has surfaced that suggests that Cleanfeed could potentially be manipulated to provide a blacklist of blocked websites.<ref>[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/cleanfeed.pdf Failures in a Hybrid Content Blocking System]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/may/26/onlinesupplement|title=Back door to the black list|author=SA Mathieson|work=the Guardian|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref> This is problematic as it could allow the dissemination of child pornography, rather than the prevention of access to it. Again this has led some to question Cleanfeed as a successful system for blocking illegal internet content.
