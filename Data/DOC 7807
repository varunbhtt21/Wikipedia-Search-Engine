===Mahayana Buddhism===
According to Jun Hong Lu, Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door belongs to the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist tradition. It encourages people to recite Buddhist scriptures (sutras and mantras) on a daily basis, practise life liberation (that is, saving the lives of beings destined for slaughter), and make great vows to help more people. It is believed that these three "golden practices" lay a solid foundation for improved physical and mental well-being.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Rz2U4PrI50VU1xUi1JZkxSVEE/view |location= |publisher= |page=4 |isbn=}}</ref>

====Three Golden Buddhist Practices of Guan Yin Citta====
#Reciting Buddhist sutras/mantras: Guan Yin Citta believes that reciting Buddhist sutras and mantras on a daily basis helps one benefit from the blessings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Recitation will not only help eliminate one’s negative karma; it will also bring strength, wisdom and inner peace, so that one can overcome all kinds of obstacles. The three major sutras and mantras recited by Guan Yin Citta followers are: [[Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī|the Great Compassion Mantra]], the [[Heart Sutra]], and the Eighty-eight Buddhas Repentance.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Rz2U4PrI50VU1xUi1JZkxSVEE/view |location= |publisher= |page=7 |isbn=}}</ref>
#Practising life liberation: that is, Release of animals, especially those in grave danger of being killed, is a popular practice performed by all schools of [[Buddhism]]. Guan Yin Citta believes that setting animals free helps one cultivate compassion towards all beings, and deepens the understanding that all living beings are all interdependent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://lujunhong2or.com/%E7%B2%BE%E5%BD%A9%E5%BC%80%E7%A4%BA%E4%B8%93%E9%A2%98%EF%BC%9A%E6%95%91%E5%BD%BC%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%91%E5%B7%B1%E5%BF%83%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%89-%E6%94%BE%E7%94%9F%E7%9A%84|title=救彼命，救己心——放生的重要性}}</ref>
#Making great vows: When one makes a vow, he or she will be motivated to fulfill the vow. The vow then becomes very strong energy; it can overcome countless obstacles. This is especially true when one makes a vow out of compassion. Seeing the suffering and hearing the cries of sentient beings, Bodhisattvas bring forth immense compassion and vow to benefit all sentient beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?t=19411|title=Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door – Dharma Wheel}}</ref>

===Organization===
On Jun Hong Lu's official Chinese-language blog,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lujunhong2or.com|title=东方台卢军宏台长的博客}}</ref> he emphasises the importance of Guan Yin Citta followers' abiding by the rules and regulations in their respective countries and regions when practising Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lujunhong2or.com/%E4%B8%AD%E5%8D%8E%E6%96%87%E5%8C%96%E6%99%AE%E5%88%A9%E4%BC%97%E7%94%9F%E6%8C%87%E5%AF%BC%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F-%E4%BD%9B%E6%B3%95%E7%B2%BE%E9%AB%93%E6%95%91%E5%BA%A6%E4%BC%97%E7%94%9F%E8%A7%89%E6%82%9F|title=中华文化普利众生指导人生 佛法精髓救度众生觉悟人生}}</ref>

===Religions===
In an interview with [[Radio France Internationale]], Master Lu stated that "The reason of having 84,000 Dharma is to accommodate all beings and creatures to understand One's self in order to create a soulful world. It will be good enough as long as you have the heart and soul to create a better place for all beings. That is why I respect the Dharma. It doesn't matter which Dharma you choose; it will still be the path that you have to proceed. This is a very important point. Therefore, Chinese in Sydney will practice vegetarian during the first and the fifteenth of the Chinese calendar. There are also a lot of Chinese worshipping the Buddha during festive seasons. Some even know how to practice loving kindness. A few organizations in Sydney such as the [[Tzu Chi Foundation]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]] by Master [[Chin Kung]] and also Master [[Hsing Yun]]'s [[Nan Tien temple]] are all well established with the same priority, and that is to carry forward the Buddhism Teaching in order to unite everyone physically, mentally and soulfully. Hence, I believe that every Buddhist Chinese from all over the world should continue to practice Buddhism as it will benefit in the cultivation of One's mindset, and also to create a peaceful and harmonious world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cn.rfi.fr/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20120718-%E8%87%AA%E5%BA%A6%E5%BA%A6%E4%BA%BA-%E9%87%87%E8%AE%BF%E6%BE%B3%E6%B4%B2%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%9B%E6%95%99%E5%AD%A6%E4%BC%9A%E5%8D%A2%E5%86%9B%E5%AE%8F%E4%BC%9A%E9%95%BF|title=采访澳洲华人佛教学会卢军宏会长}}</ref>

In August 2016, Lu stated that, "We want the world to be filled with compassion; we want love to spread to all over the globe; we want countries to be well; we want the people to be well; we want every family to be well - this is Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door.
