==Plot==
A young woman ([[Sameena Jabeen Ahmed]]) has run away from her Pakistani family and is living with her Scottish boyfriend. Living in a caravan, the couple get along on minimal resources with Laila working as an assistant at a local hairdresser while Aaron looks for work. Laila's brother, a gang of friends and two hired thugs track her down. When Aaron is out at a local shop, the Asian men track Laila down to the caravan. Laila's brother enters alone, and, after a struggle, he is accidentally wounded and dies, allowing  Laila to escape through a window.

When Aaron receives a photograph on his phone showing his mother tied up and gagged, he and Laila decide to give themselves up. As they walk towards both cars the Pakistani group walk forward and one man repeatedly hits Aaron with an axe. The elder man of the other party, Tony, runs out of his car with a pistol, furious at the men and tells Laila to get in the car.

They drive off, Laila is returned to her distressed father and the man is paid and drives away. The film ends with Laila forced to place a noose around her neck and stand on a chair. She begs her father to let her take it off but, in a state of confusion and anger over his son's death, he sits on the floor, head in hands. The film ends leaving the audience to speculate upon Laila's fate.
