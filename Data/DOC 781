'''Walnut and coffee cake''' or '''coffee and walnut cake''' is a cake made with a normal [[sponge cake]] recipe with the addition of [[coffee]], usually either [[instant coffee]] or [[Camp Coffee]], and [[walnut|walnut pieces]].

The cake is often filled with flavoured [[butter icing]] and topped with more butter icing and [[walnut|half-walnut]]s.

The cake is widely available in supermarkets in the [[United Kingdom]]. English food writer [[Nigel Slater]] has said it would be his final meal if he had a choice.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/sep/28/foodanddrink.shopping Nigel Slater: The last supper | Life and style | The Observer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
