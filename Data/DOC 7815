'''''Gandhi Before India''''' is a 2013 book by the Indian historian [[Ramachandra Guha]], the first part of a planned two-volume biography of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. The book deals with Gandhi's life up to his return to India following a 21-year period as a lawyer and civil-rights activist in [[South Africa]]. During this period in [[South Africa]], [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] experienced discrimination that all coloured people there faced, including the Indian community he became a part of. In response to the government's policies developed ''[[Satyagraha]]'', a form of protest that translates loosely to "truth force".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Guha |first1=Ramchandra |title=Gandhi before India |date=5 April 2014 |publisher=Knopf; F |isbn=9780385532297}}</ref>
