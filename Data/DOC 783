'''Racine Danish Kringles''' is a family run bakery located at 2529 Golf Avenue, on the North Side of [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], [[Wisconsin]], that specializes in [[Kringles]]. The bakery uses the tagline "It's not just a treat, it's a tradition."<ref>{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Deborah|title=Signature of Racine|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/signature-of-racine/article_c710a457-c1d8-57a1-ad48-1f2bac7ad9c9.html|publisher=Journal Times|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref>

Kringles are made by hand and involve rolling butter between layers of [[Danish pastry]] dough in order to create a flaky crust. Originally shaped like a knotted pretzel, a typical Racine Kringle is formed into an oval. It can be filled with a variety of fruit, nut and candy flavor combinations before the pastry is baked.

== Early history ==

The bakery opened in 1981 and primarily distributed Kringles through wholesale; supplying Kringles to grocery stores throughout the Midwest and DSD (Direct Store Delivery) where fresh Kringles are delivered to nearby stores. Kringles were also available to local fundraising groups. In October 1988, Mike and Roylene Heyer officially purchased Racine Danish Kringles. At the time, the business was producing 400,000 Kringles annually and employed about eight people. An important step to growing the business was to build awareness of Kringles beyond Wisconsin borders.<ref>{{cite news|title=Danish Pastry brings sweet success to career switch|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&dat=19990920&id=d-UcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2o4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6781,9797307|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''|date=20 September 1999}}</ref>

In 1994, Mike Heyer introduced his Kringles as a corporate gift at the Tomorrow's Products and Services Exhibit.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nielsen|first=Christine Marie|title=Sweet Deal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19941020&id=VZpQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JhMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4356,6600531|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=20 October 1994}}</ref>
