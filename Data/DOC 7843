'''Fowlea Brook''' flows through [[Staffordshire]] and the outlying areas of [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[England]]. It is a tributary stream of the [[River Trent]], and is {{convert|6|miles|km}} long.<ref name=OSmap118>{{cite book| last=Ordnance Survey| authorlink=Ordnance Survey |title=118 Stoke-on-Trent & Macclesfield |publisher=Ordnance Survey |year=2006 |series=OS Landranger Map Series| isbn=9780319229064}}</ref><ref name=EAmap2>{{cite web| url=

==Course and catchment==
Its source is on the high ground near Peacock Hay.  The brook flows south-east in a narrow valley, past Chatterley where it is partially culverted near the Chemical Lane industrial estate. It reappears as it passes Westport Lake, but is culverted again beneath [[Longport, Staffordshire|Longport]], where it is joined by its only named tributary the Scotia brook.<ref name=wvlnr>{{cite web| url = http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/leisure-and-culture/parks-and-open-spaces/westport-lake.en|work=Nature Reserves  | title= Westport Lake  |publisher=Stoke on Trent City Council | accessdate= 14 March 2014}}</ref>

It then flows through the [[Etruria, Staffordshire|Eturia]] valley alongside the Festival Park site, and [[Cliffe Vale, Staffordshire|Cliffe Vale]], before passing through the city centre of Stoke-on-Trent, where it also culverted. The brook then flows to the east, joining the Trent between Stoke and Fenton, beneath the dual carriageway of the A500.<ref name=OSmap118/> The brook has been designated as [[main river]] between Middleport and the confluence with the Trent.<ref name=EAmapx>{{cite web| url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?topic=floodmap&layerGroups=default&lang=_e&ep=map&scale=7&x=384709&y=353341#x=387117&y=347607&lg=1,&scale=8 |title=Flood Map for planning|work= What's in your Backyard |publisher=Environment Agency |accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>

The catchment or drainage basin lies between that of the [[Ford Green Brook]] to the north and east, and that of the Lyme brook to the south and west, has an area of {{convert| 29|km2|mi2}}.<ref name="WFD"/><ref name=EAmap2/>

==Pollution==
During the industrial revolution the Fowlea valley was chosen as the location for the Wedgwood pottery factory, further growth took place with the arrival of the [[Trent & Mersey canal]], with brick, tile and sanitary ware factories being built nearby. Heavy industry in the form of coal mines, and steel works also developed in the valley, culminating in the [[Shelton Bar]] steel works and rolling mill in the 1960s.
[[File:Shelton steelworks by canal, 1961 (a) - geograph.org.uk - 1629705.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Shelton Bar steelworks</center>]]
The discharges from these industrial processes and the effluent from sewage works meant that the brook and River Trent in the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] became heavily polluted. Effluent from [[Burslem]], [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]] and [[Wolstanton]] all found its way into the brook. In Tunstall, prior to the opening of a sewage works in 1878, legal action had been threatened due to the continued pollution of the canal and the brook.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53366 |title=Tunstall |author=J.

In the 1950s when the pollution was at its worst, the [[River Board|Trent River Board]] stated that "in the Stoke-on-Trent area, reaches of the Trent and the Fowlea brook were considered to be a potential danger to public health".<ref name=wwt>{{cite book| editor-last= Rofe | last=Martin|last2=Brewin |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BbjkzblQAOQC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq  |work= Wastewater Treatment: Evaluation and Implementation and Implementation : Proceedings of Water Environment '94 | title=Quality Improvements in the Trent Catchment |publisher=Thomas Telford |year=1994 | isbn= 9780727719911 }}</ref> The brook was then the most heavily polluted stream in the Potteries, and devoid of any fish.<ref name=rcm>{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aBAewUQIqb8C&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq | last= Langford|last2=Worthington |last3=Shaw |editor-last=Boon |editor-last2=Raven  |title= River Conservation and Management |work=The Unnatural History of the River Trent: 50 Years of Ecological Recovery, in River Conservation and Management |publisher=  John Wiley & Sons |year=2012 | isbn= 9781119961819 }}</ref>

The improvements that were subsequently made to the brook mean that it is classed as having moderate ecological quality under the [[Water Framework Directive]]. This is middle of the bands in the five part framework scale, which ranges from high, good, and moderate, through to poor and finally bad.<ref name=EAmap2/>

At Westport Lake, a local nature reserve, the brook is now considered a significant nature corridor where it runs through the wildlife site.<ref name=wvlnr/>
