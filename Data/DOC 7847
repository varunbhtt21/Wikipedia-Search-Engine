==Plot==
Viviane Amsalem ([[Ronit Elkabetz]]) has been married to her husband, Elisha ([[Simon Abkarian]]), for over twenty years. She goes to a religious court in order to obtain a [[Get (divorce document)|gett]] as they are living apart and she no longer wants to be married to him. He still hopes to reunite and asks her to move back in with him. The court of rabbis order a trial reunion for the couple which Viviane tries to comply with. After several attempts to comply with the order the marital discord is so severe that she insists on a separation and the divorce trial begins.

Over the course of several years Viviane struggles to obtain a divorce even as her husband does his best to slow the process. Though he tries to prove that he is a good husband and a pious man, witnesses reveal that Elisha is vengeful and petty and that Viviane has in fact been unhappy with him for years. After Elisha's brother, who is acting as his representative, accuses Viviane's lawyer, Carmel, of being in love with her the two brothers feud and Elisha tries to avoid more court appearances. He is then held in contempt of court and finally agrees that he will divorce his wife if the rabbinical judicial panel orders him to. However, when they do so he refuses to grant the divorce. Viviane pleads for help and mercy from the panel but they tell her they are unable to help her.

Sometime later Viviane and Elisha return to court having reached an agreement to divorce. Witnesses sign the gett and the rabbis give the document to Elisha to hand to Viviane. However, during the divorce ceremony Elisha finds himself unable to say that Viviane is free to be with other men. Viviane and Elisha are kicked out of the court. Elisha begs for a last minute audience with Viviane and agrees to grant her the divorce if she will promise to never be with another man. Viviane promises and the two return to the courtroom to have their divorce finalized.
