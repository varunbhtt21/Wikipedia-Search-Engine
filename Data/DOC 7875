The historic [[manor]] of [[Tawstock]] was situated in North Devon, in the [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] of [[Fremington, Devon|Fremington]],<ref>Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, part 2, 1:40</ref> 2 miles south of [[Barnstaple]], England. According to [[William Pole (antiquary)|Pole]]<ref name=Po14>Pole, p.14</ref> the [[Feudal barony of Barnstaple|feudal baron of Barnstaple]] Henry de Tracy (died 1274) made Tawstock his seat, apparently having abandoned Barnstaple Castle as the chief residence of the barony.<ref name="historyofparliamentonline.org">Strong, H.W., History and Description of Tawstock Church, Barnstaple, 1889, p.8, Tawstock thought to have been a later seat of the feudal barons of Barnstaple; "None of the lords of the borough" (i.e. of Barnstaple) "ever resided there, and this circumstance doubtless assisted the townsmen in their moves towards self-government", per Woodger, L.

The manor house, known in the 17th century as Tawstock House and today known as Tawstock Court, is situated at the west end of the parish church and is in the Georgian neo-gothic architectural style, having replaced the former Tudor mansion which was destroyed by fire in 1787. The only survival from the earlier house is the splendid Tudor gatehouse with the 1574 datestone, one of only a few in Devon.

The Church of St Peter is very unusual in having a tower over the crossing and not as usual at the west end. Only a few other churches in Devon display this feature, for example at [[Crediton]], [[Colyton, Devon|Colyton]] and [[Axminster]].<ref>Pevsner, p.788</ref> The unusual and small 16th century manorial pew of the Bourchiers{{efn|"The Renaissance of the South-West, whether in clerical or in secular woodwork, is nearly always richer in detail than in the East of England. It is also, as a rule, exceedingly varied, yet possessing marked characteristics which are typical and recognisable. Such examples as the fine Wrey pew in Tawstock Church...may be cited as representative of the expression of the French Renaissance in Devonshire. So closely was the style assimilated, and so fine in execution and full in design are many of these Devonshire examples, that the hand of the French carver and designer has often been suspected, and with reason. In spite of this foreign character, very strong in such details as the balusters supporting the tester of this rich pew, there is no question as to its English origin, although French collaboration may be granted in its designing".<ref>Herbert Cescinsky, Ernest.

The [[Bourchier knot]] is much in evidence within the church, in windows, on bench-ends and on monuments. Much detail concerning the administration of the manor in the 17th century survives in the form of the household accounts maintained by the 5th Earl of Bath and his wife and include a complete inventory of the household contents room by room in 1648.<ref>Gray, 1996, p.304 et seq</ref>

Contains the [[Achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] of [[William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath]] (died 1623).]]
The Elizabethan mansion re-built by [[William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath]], no longer exists apart from the gatehouse, with date-stone 1574. Four years after Sir Bourchier Wrey, 7th Baronet, inherited the estate the house burned down in 1787 and was rebuilt by him in the Neo-Gothic style by about 1800, when Rev. [[John Swete]] described visiting it in his travel journal: "Entering through a gateway of antient date by the stables I arrived in front of Tawstock House the seat of Sir Bourchier Wrey which when completed (for it is now but a shell) will be one of the finest houses in the county".<ref>Gray & Rowe, 1999, vol.1, p.33</ref> Part of the Elizabethan house survives today on the south front. The north front was re-modelled in 1885.<ref>Pevsner, N. (1952) ''North Devon''. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 154</ref>

The principal east front, with crenellated parapet and two end turrets, faces towards St Peter's Parish Church and has an extensive view across the [[River Taw]] to [[Bishops Tawton]] village and Codden Hill. Sir Robert Bourchier Sherard Wrey, 11th Baronet (1855–1917) was the last to live at Tawstock Court and "to keep house in the old manner".<ref name=L156 /> In about 1940 it was let by the 13th Baronet to St Michael's Preparatory School. His nephew and heir, the 14th Baronet sold Tawstock Court to the school in the 1970s. The school continued to occupy Tawstock Court until 2012 when it became insolvent and went into administration, upon which the preparatory school closed. On 17 July 2012 the property with 32 acres was purchased from the administrator by a property investor and developer, as a private residence.<ref name="gva.co.uk">GVA.

==Descent of the manor==

===Royal demesne===
In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 it was recorded as ''TAVESTOCHE'', the 40th of 72 holdings in Devon held in [[demesne]] by King [[William the Conqueror]].<ref>Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, part 1, 1:40</ref>

===de Totnes===

;Juhel de Totnes : King Henry I (1100–1135) granted the manor to [[Juhel de Totnes]] (died 1123/30), [[feudal barony of Barnstaple|feudal baron of Barnstaple]] (died 1123/30). Tawstock thus became one of the many manors which comprised the barony. He gave the [[tithes]] of the [[rectory]] to the [[Barnstaple Priory|Priory of St Mary Magdalene]]<ref name="Thorn & Thorn, part 2, 1:40">Thorn & Thorn, part 2, 1:40</ref> in Barnstaple which he had founded near his seat [[Barnstaple Castle]] in about 1107.

;Alfred de Totnes : Juhel's son and heir was Alfred de Totnes, who died ''[[sine prole]]'' some time before 1139, leaving two sisters as his co-heiresses each to a [[Moiety title|moiety]] of the barony: Aenor, who married the Welsh [[Marcher Lord]] [[Philip de Braose]] (died 1134/55), 2nd feudal baron of [[Bramber]], Surrey, and a sister whose name is unknown, who married Henry de Tracy (died before 1165). The inheritance of the barony of Barnstaple by two co-heiresses split its possession during the period c. 1139 to 1213 into two moieties, which later became re-united under the de Tracy family. Amongst the manors which were inherited by Aenor as her share was Tawstock.

;Aenor de Totnes : Sister and co-heiress of Alfred de Totnes, who married [[Philip de Braose]] (died 1134/55), 2nd feudal baron of [[Bramber]].

===de Braose===

;[[William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]] (died c. 1192/3):<ref>Date of death of William de Braose as given by Sanders, p.105</ref> Eldest son and heir.

;[[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]] (died 1211) : Son and heir. He gave the manor of Tawstock to his daughter [[Loretta de Braose]] together with two other [[knight's fee]]s within his moiety of the barony, as her [[Dowry|marriage portion]] on her marriage to [[Robert FitzPernel|Robert FitzPernel, Earl of Leicester]] (''alias'' [[Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester]] (died c.1204)).<ref>Pole, p.14, "Tawstock" mis-transcribed in 1791 edition from 17th-century manuscript as "Tavistocke", see Pole p.xv re transcription errors</ref> William III's son and heir was Reginald de Braose, who due to [[John, King of England|King John]] (1199–1216) having in 1208 confiscated his father's lands, never inherited the Braose moiety of the barony of Barnstaple.

;[[Loretta de Braose]] : Daughter of [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]] (died 1211) and wife of [[Robert FitzPernel|Robert FitzPernel, Earl of Leicester]] (''alias'' [[Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester]](died c.1204)). Loretta was childless and according to [[William Pole (antiquary)|Pole]]<ref>Pole, pp.14, 389</ref> gave Tawstock (2/3rds of the manor only according to Thorn<ref name="Thorn & Thorn, part 2, 1:40"/>) to her niece Matilda de Braose, daughter of the disinherited Reginald de Braose (son of William de Braose (died 1211)) and wife of Henry de Tracy (died 1274). Henry was the great-grandson of the second unnamed daughter and co-heiress of Alfred de Totnes, and thus had already inherited the other moiety of the feudal barony of Barnstaple. The remaining 1/3rd of the manor of Tawstock was given, apparently by Loretta, to [[Buckland Priory]] in Somerset, for the support of the sisters of the [[Order of St John of Jerusalem]].<ref name="Thorn & Thorn, part 2, 1:40"/> In 1213 King John granted the Braose moiety which he had confiscated from William de Braose to Henry de Tracy (died 1274),<ref>Sanders, p.105</ref> the husband of his granddaughter Matilda de Braose.<ref name=Po14 /> Thus were the two moieties of the barony re-united together and with 2/3rds of the manor of Tawstock.

===de Tracy===
Matilda de Braose was given 2/3rds of the manor of Tawstock by her childless aunt [[Loretta de Braose|Loretta, Countess of Leicester]]. Matilda married Henry de Tracy (died 1274), feudal baron of Barnstaple, who according to Pole<ref name=Po14 /> made Tawstock his seat, apparently having abandoned Barnstaple Castle as the chief residence of the Barons of Barnstaple.<ref name="historyofparliamentonline.org"/> Tawstock then descended via her daughter Eve de Tracy., by her husband Henry de Tracy (died 1274), feudal baron of Barnstaple.

===FitzMartin===
Henry de Tracy's heir to the entire barony, including 2/3rds of the manor of Tawstock, was his granddaughter Maud de Brian (or Briene) (died before 1279), daughter of Guy de Brian of [[Laugharne Castle]], Carmarthenshire by his wife Eve de Tracy, daughter of Henry de Tracy.<ref>Sanders, p.105, note 9</ref> Maud's first husband was [[FitzMartin|Nicholas FitzMartin]] (died 1260), who had pre-deceased his father Nicholas FitzMartin (died 1282), feudal baron of [[Blagdon]], Somerset.<ref>Sanders, p.15, Blagdon, note 5</ref> Maud married secondly Geoffrey de Camville (died 1308), of [[Clifton Campville]], Staffordshire, who had summons to attend the king at Portsmouth, with horse and arms, to embark in the expedition then proceeding to Gascony. He was subsequently summoned to parliament as Baron Camville, of [[Clifton Campville|Clifton]], in the county of Stafford, from 23 June 1295 to 22 February 1307.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celtic-casimir.com/webtree/3/28875.htm|title=celtic-casimir.com|publisher=}}</ref> Camville survived her by about 29 years during which time he retained possession of the barony, including 2/3rds of the manor of Tawstock, under [[Curtesy tenure|the curtesy of England]].

The barony was recovered on Geoffrey's death by Maud's son [[FitzMartin|William FitzMartin]] (died 1324) whose son and heir William FitzMartin died ''[[sine prole]]'' in 1326.

===Audley===

The heirs of William FitzMartin (died 1326) were his surviving sister Eleanor FitzMartin (died 1342), who died childless, albeit having married twice, and [[James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley]] (died 1386), the son of his other sister Joan FitzMartin (died 1322), by her second husband [[Nicholas Audley, 1st Baron Audley]] (died 1316) of [[Heleigh Castle]], Staffordshire. James Audley thus in 1342 inherited his childless aunt Eleanor's moiety of the barony of Barnstaple, giving him possession of the whole, including 2/3rds of the manor of Tawstock. In 1370 James Audley, 2nd Baron, settled the manor of Tawstock in [[entail|tail male]] successively to his three sons from his second marriage, Thomas, Rodeland and James, who all died without children.<ref name="GEC Complete Peerage p.501">GEC Complete Peerage, vol.V, p.501, Baron FitzWarin, note a, [[inquisition post mortem]] of Nicholas Audeley (died 1391)</ref> On the death of [[James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley]] (1312/13–1386) in 1386 the barony of Barnstaple, including 2/3rds of the manor of Tawstock, passed to his surviving son, [[Nicholas Audley, 3rd Baron Audley]] (c. 1328 – 1391), who died without issue. His co-heiresses were his two full-sisters Joan and Margaret and his half-sister, also Margaret, who inherited Tawstock:

The FitzWarin family were powerful [[Marcher Lord]]s seated at [[Whittington Castle]] in Shropshire and at [[Alveston]] in Gloucestershire. The title [[Baron FitzWarin]] was created by [[Hereditary Peerage#Writ of Summons|writ of summons]] for [[Fulk FitzWarin, 1st Baron FitzWarin|Fulk FitzWarin]] in 1295.

;Fulk FitzWarin, 5th Baron FitzWarin (1362–1391) : Son of Margaret Audley (died 1373), married Elizabeth Cogan, heiress of her brother John Cogan (died 1382), [[Feudal barony of Bampton|feudal baron of Bampton]], Devon, who died as a minor in the wardship of the king. She was the daughter of Sir William Cogan by his second wife Isabel Loring, the elder daughter and co-heiress of Sir [[Nele Loring]] (c. 1320 – 1386), [[Knight of the Garter|KG]], of Chalgrave, Bedfordshire,<ref>GEC Complete Peerage, vol.

Sir [[Richard Hankford]] (c. 1397 – 1431) (grandson and heir of Sir [[William Hankford]] (died 1422) of [[Annery, Monkleigh|Annery]], Devon, [[Lord Chief Justice of England]]) married as his first wife the heiress of Tawstock [[Elizabeth FitzWarin, 8th Baroness FitzWarin]] (c. 1404 – c. 1427). They had no male children. Upon her death the barony must have been in abeyance between her daughters Thomasine Hankford (1423–1453), born and baptised at [[Tawstock]],<ref>GEC, Vol.V, p.507</ref> and Elizabeth Hankford (c. 1424 – 1433) until the death of the latter in 1433, when Thomasine became 9th Baroness. By Thomasine's marriage to [[William Bourchier, 9th Baron FitzWarin]] (1407–1470), the estates including Tawstock passed into the Bourchier family, which originated at the manor of [[Little Easton]] in Essex.

===Bourchier===

The later heir of the FitzWarins was the Bourchier family, [[Earl of Bath|Earls of Bath]] and [[Baron FitzWarin|Barons FitzWarin]], who made Tawstock their seat and were highly influential in Barnstaple society and politics. They also inherited via the Audleys other manors formerly part of the barony of Barnstaple, including [[Nymet Tracy]],<ref>Risdon, p.291</ref> [[St Marychurch]],<ref>Pole, p.271</ref> [[Kingston, Devon|Kingston]],<ref>Risdon, pp.182, 386</ref>[[Marwood, Devon|Marwood]]<ref>Risdon, p.334</ref> and [[Upexe]].<ref>Risdon, p.80</ref> Another manor which descended from the Audleys was [[Holne]] on the [[River Dart]], which was later used as a hunting estate ("Holne Chase") by the Wreys.<ref>White's Devonshire Directory, 1850, re: Holne</ref> Their 17th century landholdings in total comprised 36 manors in the counties of Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Berkshire.<ref>Gray, 1996, p.xxv, landholdings of 5th Earl of Bath, map 3</ref> The Bourchier Barnstaple [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]] is thought to survive as no. 62 Boutport Street,<ref>Fea, Allan, Nooks and Corners of Old England, New York, 1908, p.165</ref> with its surviving ornate plaster barrel-ceilings dated 1620 (or 1629<ref name="Lamplugh, Lois 2002, p.165">Lamplugh, Lois, Barnstaple: Town on the Taw, South Molton, 2002, p.165, note 2 of chapter 12</ref>), showing the arms of Bourchier,<ref name="Lamplugh, Lois 2002, p.165"/> which survives next to the Royal and Fortescue Hotel, and was converted in about 1760 to premises of the "Golden Lion" coaching inn.<ref>Lamplugh, Lois, Barnstaple: Town on the Taw, South Molton, 2002, p.106</ref> It was converted to premises for the National Westminster Bank in 1936,<ref name="Lamplugh, Lois 2002, p.165"/> in 1991 housed a branch of the Woolwich Building Society<ref>Pevsner, p.154</ref> and in 2014 is a restaurant. The Bourchier family, the Devon branch of which, seated at [[Tawstock|Tawstock Court]], was later created [[Earl of Bath|Earls of Bath]], retained the manor of Bampton until at least the time of Risdon (died 1640) who states in his ''Survey of Devon'' that "the [[William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath|Earl of Bath]] is lord of this manor".<ref>Risdon, p.64</ref> The descent of Bampton was as follows:

The whole issue was then exhaustively considered by the Committee for Privileges of The House of Lords in 1914, which determined that Ellen Caroline`s eldest son, Reginald Joseph Weld, was coheir to the Baronies of Martin and Fitzwaryn, which he would not have been had she been illegitimate.<ref>Dynaunt, Fitzwaryn, and Martin Peerage Claims: Minutes of Evidence taken before the Committee of Privileges; London 1915</ref> It is of course also impossible to prove that the marriage of 1818 was not bigamous, but the presumption in law is that all public acts, including marriages, are duly and lawfully performed unless the contrary be shown.
