When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''delete'''. I don't see the value in a redirect, so I'm not going to make that part of the close, but if somebody feels strongly a redirect is warranted, go for it. -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 00:21, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' for now to [[Lukas Ammann]] where it is already mentioned. Being the return-to-screen of the oldest actor in the world is a decent [http://www.blick.ch/people-tv/schweiz/comeback-mit-101-id2662451.html and sourcable] assertion of notability.
