'''Lovability Inc.''' is a company that designs, manufactures, and markets [[condom]]s. Based in [[New York City]] and founded by Tiffany Gaines, the company has the stated mission "to empower women to take responsibility for their sexual health." The company's primary products are male condoms approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) that are packaged in small tins designed to blend in with cosmetics and other items a woman might carry in her purse.

== History ==
Lovability was founded in [[New York City]] by the mother-daughter team of Pam and Tiffany Gaines. Tiffany Gaines, a 2012 [[NYU]] graduate with a degree in Social Entrepreneurship, was the company's initial president and CEO. Gaines was also a graduate student in the Design for Social Innovation program at the [[School of Visual Arts]]. Prior to starting Lovability, Gaines was a Corporate Innovations Consultant for [[Hyatt Hotels]].<ref name=2014HuffPostPhilanthropy/> Her mother Pam has thirty years experience as an entrepreneur.<ref name=LCWebsite>{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Our Story|url=http://www.lovabilitycondoms.com/#!our-story/c1c9t|publisher=LovabilityCondoms.com|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

Gaines credits inspiration for the company and its product as a result of a personal experience. She explained that she was purchasing tampons at a convenience store in front of a group of men and that the tampons were located high on a shelf behind the register, next to the condoms, and the clerk had to retrieve an "orange-picking" claw to get them.<ref name=2014HuffPostPhilanthropy/> This led to the idea to change the perception of condoms as a male-oriented product and to destigmatize their purchase and carrying by women.<ref name=2013ForbesProfile/> The result of this idea was condoms in gold wrappers that come in small tins that are more aesthetically appealing than traditional condoms and ideally less awkward for women to carry. The tins are designed to blending in with other women's products, such as cosmetics.<ref name="2014HuffPostPhilanthropy" />

== Operations ==
The company has a multiple marketing and operational objectives that were laid out in a 2013 [[Forbes]] article.<ref name="2013ForbesProfile" /> An eight-point plan was presented that includes:
* Making condoms available for purchase in places that condoms aren’t typically available such as beauty supply stores, lingerie stores, department stores, and accessory boutiques
* The use of packaging that is "chic, discrete, and resembles a high-end cosmetic product".
* Promotion of condoms on college campuses to educate others on the importance of safe sex and use the product to raise money for their designated philanthropy.
* Encouraging women to take charge of their [[sexual health]] and practice [[self-love]].
* Use of an ecommerce website so that women can send condoms either with a personalized note or anonymously.
* Use of celebrity spokespeople such as the cast members of [[MTV]]’s ''[[Teen Mom]]'' series.
* Engaging women of all ages.
* Being responsive and adaptive based on customer feedback.

=== Leadership ===
According to their website, Lovability's leadership team primarily consists of Tiffany Gaines (Founder, President) and Claire Courtney (Director of Outreach). Tiffany and Claire united through their passion for safe sex. Tiffany had already been running Lovability Inc. for about a year when Claire reached out to her while she was working on her college thesis paper, "Pleasure in the Condom Industry." After Tiffany competed her Master's degree in Design for Social Innovation at SVA and Claire finished her undergraduate degree in Sexual Politics at [[Scripps College]], they united in New York City to further Lovability's mission of bringing male condoms into the hands of women.

=== Fundraising ===
In 2015, Lovability started a funding campaign on the [[crowd funding]] website IndieGoGo. In an article about the company and the campaign, it was noted that the condoms are [[vegan]] and sustainably produced and that "they’re also 100 percent natural latex and free of weird chemicals and additives."<ref name=2015Bustle>{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Lucia|title=Should Women Carry Condoms?

== Outreach & Philanthropy ==
In January 2014 the company announced a program for [[sororities]] called the "Lovability Lady" Brand Advocate Program.<ref name=2014HuffPostPhilanthropy>{{cite web|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|title=A Company Called Lovability Wants To Help Sororities By Selling Condoms|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/15/lovability-condoms-sororities_n_4604268.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> The program allows sororities to purchase Lovability condoms at wholesale prices and sell them to promote condom use and [[safe sex|safer sex]] in Greek communities, while keeping the profits for their sorority or designated philanthropy. The program is also available to other non-profit organizations and individuals to encourage women to participate in direct social action by providing condoms to their social circles.<ref name=2014HuffPostPhilanthropy/>

* In October 2013, Gaines spoke at a [[TED (conference)|TED]] event at the School of Visual Arts, [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxSVA]].<ref name="2014HuffPostPhilanthropy" /><ref name="2013YouTubeTEDx">{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Real Life Sex and the City: Tiffany B.

* In December 2013, Gaines and her company were interviewed and profiled on [[Forbes]] magazine's website.<ref name="2013ForbesProfile">{{cite web|last=Restauri|first=Denise|title=The Entrepreneur Making Condoms Chic Enough For Women To Buy|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deniserestauri/2013/12/12/the-entrepreneur-making-condoms-chic-enough-for-women-to-buy/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>
* In April 2014, Gaines was a guest writer on the website [[XoJane.com]] where she detailed her experience with Chase bank's initial refusal to do business with her company.<ref name="2014XOJaneChase">{{cite web|last=Gaines|first=Tiffany|title=Chase Bank Said They Wouldn't Do Business With Me Because I Run a Condom Company, and Now I'm Fighting Back I was stunned that a product that encourages sexual health and wellness would be so frowned on by society.|url=http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/chase-bank-lovability-condoms|publisher=XOJane.com|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>
* In January 2015, [[Upworthy]] featured a post about Lovability condoms and their effort to make condoms more female friendly while using fair labor and sustainable practices in manufacturing the condoms.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.upworthy.com/she-noticed-a-huge-problem-with-condoms-there-she-fixed-it|title = She Noticed A Huge Problem With Condoms.

* In March 2015, a story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' highlighted the company's use of [[Fair Trade]] materials in the production of its products.<ref name="2015NYP-Fair">{{cite news|last1=Donnelly|first1=Tim|title=Fair-trade condoms are now a thing|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/28/fair-trade-condoms-are-now-a-thing/|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=New York Post|date=March 28, 2015}}</ref>

=== Chase bank ===
In 2014, the company was initially rejected by [[Chase (bank)#Targeted account closures|Chase]] Paymentech services "as processing sales for adult-oriented products is a prohibited vertical" and was told that it was a "reputational risk" to process payment for condoms. Gaines then started a petition to ask Chase to review and change its policy of classifying condoms as an "adult oriented product". The petition gained 3,400 signatures in its first week. The bank later reversed its decision and invited Gaines to submit an application citing that it was already doing business with a "wide variety of merchants, including grocers and drug stores, that sell similar products." Gaines stated that she does not plan to use Chase Paymentech's services until she feels confident that no other condom companies will face the resistance that she did.<ref name="2014HuffLuvCondom">{{cite web|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|title=Chase Will Process Payments For Lovability Condoms After All|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/chase-condom-payments_n_5051636.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>
