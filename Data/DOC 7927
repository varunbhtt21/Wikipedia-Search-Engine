Seems to be a giant advertisement, even contains email addresses for contacts, now this could be a very interesting article if done correctly. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:01, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' (leaning delete) - [[WP:AFDISNOTCLEANUP]]. The fact that an article reads like an advertisement is not relevant at AfD, because it can be cleaned up with editing. What is relevant is whether or not we are ''able'' to clean the article, particularly through adding reliable sources. To do this, we have to look at the ''availability'' of reliable sources--the [[WP:N|notability]] of the subject. So far, I'm not seeing any such sources jumping out at me. It looks like the Spanish name for this is "Gaztetxe de Vitoria-Gasteiz". That may be helpful for finding sources. [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 14:56, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
