*'''Comment'''-the article makes it sound like she could be in quite a few films, yet I can find no references for her in English. I am on the delete site for this as of now. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 16:55, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - I am very suspicious of any actor whose Fandango page is blank.  Her Yahoo movies page has one named role.  Her [[Rotten Tomatoes]] page is empty, too.  Even my partner has a Imdb page, but her only role on Imdb is for a single TV show, ''[[Seven Hours Difference]].'' I don't buy it.

*'''Comment''' - Apparently she played a main character in this film (not sure whether it makes her qualify for notability):
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2797340/
*'''Comment''': Didn't see her on the imdb and I don't see her on that page either. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 18:37, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
