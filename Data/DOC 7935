The result was  '''procedural keep'''.

The existence of this article screams of [[WP:UNDUE]] and [[WP:RECENTISM]] and is a [[Wikipedia:POV_fork#Point_of_view_.28POV.29_forks|POV fork]]. Yes, its well sourced as most of its content is rehashed from other articles. In fact everything in it is carefully selected content. There have been other (just as horrific) events that have generated public outcry and debate, but we do not have separate articles on their "after effects" with regard to any particular political movement. The articles themselves include the information along with related articles. If this were a List article, I would venture to say that few would think twice about its deletion, and that is essentially what this article is with some Editorial Opinion thrown in.

*'''Procedural keep''' Last nom was literally closed five hours back; way too soon to put this right back on the block. You have problems with the page, there's a talk page; bring your concerns there. <font face="Myriad Web">'''[[User:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:royalblue4">Nate</span>]]''' <span style="color:dark blue">•</span> <small>''([[User_talk:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:darkgoldenrod">chatter</span>]])''</small></font> 19:57, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Procedural keep''' As [[User:Mrschimpf|Nate]] said, this is too soon for a renomination, per [[WP:DELAFD|the deletion policy]]. [[User:Novusuna|Novusuna]] <sup>[[User_talk:Novusuna|talk]]</sup> 20:48, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::And I'm asserting that it was a bad close. It was done by a basic vote tally, not an application of policy. --[[User:Scalhotrod|Scalhotrod - Just your average banjo playing, drag racing, cowboy...]] ([[User talk:Scalhotrod|talk]]) 03:44, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Procedural keep''' Too soon after the AFD was closed, I did open a DRV however [[Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2014_April_27]]
