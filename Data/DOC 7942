This character hasn't achieved the level of notability required to warrant its own article and hence fails at last 4/5 points outlined at [[WP:GNG]]. The article should either be userfied until notability can be attained (unlikely) or redirected to the [[List of Devil Survivor characters]] where a paragraph of two best describes it. Per some of the reasons I outlined at [[Talk:Yamato Hotsuin#Notability issues]] [[User:KirtZJ|<font color=#2F4F4F>'''''—KirtZ'''''</font>]]<sup>[[User talk:KirtZJ|<font color=#000000>'''Mail'''</font>]]</sup></sup> 18:16, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[List of Devil Survivor characters#Yamato_Hotsuin]]. There is nothing to suggest that the character himself has notability separate from the game, failing [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:GAMECRUFT]].

* '''Redirect'''. Next to nothing in [[WP:VG/RS]] search.

::<small>In light of below, I still think redirect is the best option as I don't believe the added sourcing is sufficient <span style='font:1.1em"Avenir";padding:1px 3px;border:1px solid #909;color:#909'>czar&nbsp;[[User:Czar|<font color="#909">♔</font>]]</span> 04:29, 11 May 2014 (UTC)</small>
* '''Redirect'''. An initial search found nothing to add onto this article, and considering the young age of DS2, I doubt that we'll find much in the way of reliable sources that go beyond video game-specific works. - [[User:New Age Retro Hippie|New Age Retro Hippie]] <small>[[User talk:New Age Retro Hippie|(talk)]]</small> <small>[[Special:Contributions/New Age Retro Hippie|(contributions)]]</small> 07:02, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''', I managed to expand the reception section. Don't know if it is enough though.[[User:Tintor2|Tintor2]] ([[User talk:Tintor2|talk]]) 12:15, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''', the changes Tinto2 made, look satisfying. [[User:Lucia Black|Lucia Black]] ([[User talk:Lucia Black|talk]]) 18:12, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::That reception only focuses on the anime though. It seems to me like we're trying to pass this article on a technicality. The character isnt covered in detail anywhere else and the reception still uses a critics review of the anime and not the character himself. The technicality here is that the critic will obviously have to mention one or two traits of the character for an episode review. If we waive this, Yamato isnt notable.
