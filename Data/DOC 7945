[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''Ayscoghe Boucherett''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|JP|DL}} (16 April 1755 – 15 September 1815) was a British landowner, businessman and Member of Parliament for [[Great Grimsby]] from 1796 to 1803.

Born into a family of the Lincolnshire landed gentry, Boucherett became involved in local politics in Lincolnshire, and (owing mainly to his marriage) with artistic and mercantile circles in London. He was the chairman of the [[Grimsby Haven Company]], which oversaw the reopening and expansion of [[Old Dock, Grimsby|Grimsby's first dock]]. He was a friend of the artist [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]] and the proprietor of Willingham, Lincolnshire, where he constructed his country seat, [[Willingham House]], in 1790. For his investment in the Haven Company, he received the support of [[Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Baron Yarborough|Lord Yarborough]], one of its main investors and a principal land-owner in Grimsby; owing largely to Lord Yarborough's patronage, Boucherett was returned as the Member of Parliament for that borough at the 1796 election. He was not a frequent voter, but used his position to further the interests of his corporation. Nonetheless, the company met with financial difficulties after it opened the Harbour in 1800. In 1803, Boucherett resigned his seat in favour of Yarborough's heir and pursued a quieter political life. He died in a carriage accident in 1815.

Boucherett was born on 16 April 1755, the son of Ayscoghe Boucherett of [[North Willingham|Willingham]] and [[Stallingborough]], Lincolnshire, and his wife, Mary White.<ref name="Stokes 1986">Stokes 1986</ref> The elder Boucherett had been the [[High Sheriff of Lincolnshire]] in 1754,<ref>''London Gazette''. 29 January 1754, p. 1.</ref> and was a landed gentleman in Lincolnshire, whose family was descended from Huguenot merchants; they married into the Ayscoghe family and inherited the Willingham estate through this marriage.<ref>Burke 1847, p. 122</ref> The elder Boucherett's daughter, Mary, had married [[Michael Barne (politician)|Michael Barne]] of Sotterley, Suffolk, an army officer and a member of parliament for [[Dunwich]].<ref>Burke 1847, 1, p. 122 ; Maddison 1902, p. 163 ; Howard & Crisp 1899, p. 158 ; Stokes 1986</ref>

Boucherett paid for the construction of a new family seat in 1790; Willingham House was a larger and grander mansion than the family's previous seat closer to Willingham, and was constructed in the neoclassical style, most likely by Robert Mitchell, two miles west of the earlier house.<ref>Pevsner (1964), p. 76 ; Britton (1807), IX, p. 694</ref>

==Friendship with Sir Thomas Lawrence==
The family's connection with the art connoisseur John Julius Angerstein led to them becoming acquainted with certain artistic circles in the late eighteenth century; most notably, they established a close friendship with the portrait painter [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]], who would go on to be [[President of the Royal Academy]]. He visited Willingham House, the Boucherett family's country home, composing a number of studies in pastel of Boucherett's young children, beginning in 1793.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/sir-thomas-lawrence-pra-head-studies-of-5639298-details.aspx |title = Sir Thomas Lawrence, P.R.A.

==Member of Parliament and public service==

In the 1790s, Boucherett began to rise through Lincolnshire's civic and mercantile circles, especially in the north of the County, where the family had their seat; his connexions helped him to become involved with a group of businessmen planning to reopen and expand Grimsby's harbour. His rise is charted in his appointments to several civic posts: to be High Steward of Grimsby from 1794 (he remained as such until his death), succeeding Christopher Clayton, and to be High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1795–6.<ref>Oliver 1825, p. 123 for list of High Stewards ; Stokes 1986 ; ''Gentleman's Magazine''. 1815, pt. 2, p. 371</ref> As these plans for the harbour came to fruition, he was appointed chairman of the company tasked with performing the required work; it was the Grimsby Haven Company, which was created by an Act of Parliament in 1796 (36 Geo III, chap. 98) for the express purpose of building the dock and repairing the Haven.<ref>Stokes 1986 ; ''Gentleman's Magazine''. 1815, pt. 2, p. 371 ; Bates 1893, p. 8</ref> He secured the friendship and patronage of [[Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Baron Yarborough|Charles Anderson Pelham, 1st Baron Yarborough]], a prominent local land-owner involved in the Haven Company, and was returned as the Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby in 1796 owing to this friendship.<ref name="Stokes 1986"/>

Yarborough, Boucherett's patron, was an opponent of the administration of [[William Pitt the Younger]] and supported the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] during the 1790s.<ref>Thorne 1986a</ref> Boucherett was an infrequent voter, but he told the diarist [[Joseph Farington]] that, when he did vote, he tended to do so with [[Charles James Fox]], rather than [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], although, he later became "disgusted" at Fox's style of opposition;<ref>Farington 1807 (1924 print), pp. 154–5</ref> he is also known to have voted against the [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)|Ferrol Expedition]] in 1801.<ref name="Stokes 1986"/> The seat did allow for him to further the interests of the Haven Company, with him proposing a bill to grant more funds in 1799.<ref>Stokes 1986 ; ''Journals of the House of Commons'', lvi (1799), p. 531</ref> He found, though, that his funds and the financial success of the company were both in decline by 1801.<ref name=":0" /> Although re-elected in 1802, the following year he resigned in favour of Lord Yarborough's eldest son and heir, ''the Hon''. [[Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Earl of Yarborough|Charles Anderson Pelham]], later 1st Earl and 2nd Baron Yarborough.<ref name=":0">Stokes 1986 ; he accepted the Steward of the Manor of East Hendred in 1803 (<span>J.

==Later life==

Although opened in 1800 at the cost of £100,000,<ref>Bates 1893, p. 8</ref> the new harbour at Grimsby failed to attract the levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely by a lack of inland transport networks.<ref>Clarke 2000, p. 717</ref> The financial problems facing the Grimsby Haven Company led to factions and difficulty in its running and put strain on Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time in the now failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.<ref name="Stokes 1986"/>

Aside from Parliamentary and business commitments, he served as a Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire and a Justice of the Peace.<ref>''Gentleman's Magazine''. 1815, pt. 2, p. 371</ref> Boucherett was also an officer in the Yeoman volunteers, being a Captain the Market Raisin [[Yeomanry]] in 1798 and then a Lieutenant-Colonel in and Commandant of the North Lincolnshire Yeomanry from 1814 until his death. He died in a carriage accident on 15 September 1815.<ref>Stokes 1986 ; ''Gentleman's Magazine''. 1815, pt. 2, p. 371</ref> At his death, his assets barely covered the debts he had accrued in his lifetime.<ref name=":0" /> He was succeeded as the High Steward of Grimsby by ''the Hon''. [[George Anderson Pelham]], the second son of the first Lord Yarborough.<ref>Thorne 1986b ; Oliver 1825, p. 123</ref>
