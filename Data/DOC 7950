'''Ludwig Wilhelm Wichmann''' (10 October 1788, [[Potsdam]] – 28 June 1859, [[Berlin]]) was a German sculptor. He specialized in making portrait busts.<ref name="ADB">{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|42|314|316|Wichmann, Ludwig Wilhelm|Werner Weisbach|ADB:Wichmann, Ludwig Wilhelm}}</ref>

== Life ==
From 1800, he was a pupil in the studios of [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]]. While there, he assisted in creating the [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] Monument in [[Rostock]] and the [[Martin Luther|Luther]] Monument in [[Wittenberg]].<ref name="ADB" />

From 1809 to 1813 he lived in Paris, where he worked in the studios of [[François Joseph Bosio]] and [[Jacques-Louis David]]. When he returned to Berlin, he rejoined the staff at Schadow's workshop. From 1813 to 1815, he participated in the installation and finishing of the [[Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars]] (Nationaldenkmal für die Befreiungskriege), designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].<ref>[http://www.berlin-die-hauptstadt.de/wichmann.htm Berlin Geschichte: Brief biography]</ref> Faced by approaching deadlines, [[Christian Daniel Rauch]] and [[Christian Friedrich Tieck]] appointed him to finish the designs of their two figures on the Monument: those representing the [[Battle of Katzbach]] and the [[Battle of Bar-sur-Aube]]. Following the death of [[Emanuel Bardou]] in 1818, Wichmann took over his classes at the Berlin School of Arts and Crafts. In 1819, he was named a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]].

He spent the years 1819 to 1821 in Italy with his older brother Karl, who was also a sculptor. On their return, they opened a studio that specialized in portrait busts. In 1832, Ludwig was appointed a Professor at the Prussian Academy. Over the years, he produced many designs and models for his father-in-law {{ill|Tobias Feilner|de}}, a Master Potter and [[terracotta]] maker. The figure of the [[Archangel Michael]] in the [[Friedrichswerder Church]] is based on one of his clay models.<ref name="ADB" />
