The '''2014–15 NIFL Premiership''' (known as the '''[[Danske Bank (Northern Ireland)|Danske Bank]] [[NIFL Premiership|Premiership]]''' for sponsorship reasons) was the seventh season of [[Northern Ireland]]'s highest national football league in this format since its inception in 2008, the 114th season of Irish league football overall, and the second season of the league operating as part of the [[Northern Ireland Football League]].<ref name="nifl">{{cite news|url=http://www.ifapremiership.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=870&catid=3&Itemid=12|title=NORTHERN IRELAND FOOTBALL LEAGUE|work=NIFL Premiership}}</ref> The season began on 9 August 2014, and concluded with the final round of fixtures on 25 April 2015.

[[Cliftonville F.C.|Cliftonville]] were the defending champions, after they won a second consecutive title the previous season, a first consecutive title win in the club's history - their fourth outright league title and fifth overall.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27113832|title=Cliftonville retain Irish Premiership title for first time|date=22 April 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref> Ten years after suffering relegation to the second tier in [[2004–05 Irish Premier League|2004–05]] and just eight years after their return to the top flight in [[2006–07 Irish Premier League|2006–07]], [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] were this season's champions. They lifted the title for the fifth time overall on 18 April 2015 – their first top flight title in the 18 years since their last win in the [[1996–97 Irish League|1996–97 season]].<ref name="Crusaders1415">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32366061|title=Irish Premiership: Crusaders 2-0 Glentoran|date=18 April 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>

For the second successive season, the newly promoted club finished bottom of the table and suffered relegation. [[Institute F.C.|Institute]] were relegated back to the second tier after only one season in the top flight. This was confirmed after they lost 2–1 against [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] on 11 April 2015, leaving them bottom of the table by nine points with only two fixtures remaining.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32266807|title=Irish Premiership: Institute 1-2 Ballymena Utd|date=11 April 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref> [[Warrenpoint Town F.C.|Warrenpoint Town]] once again finished in 11th place – the [[#Promotion/relegation play-off|Promotion/relegation play-off]] place – and faced [[Bangor F.C.|Bangor]] over two legs for a place in next season's Premiership.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32265685|title=Irish Premiership: Dungannon Swifts 1-1 Warrenpoint Town|date=11 April 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref> After a 2–2 draw on aggregate, Warrenpoint Town won 3–1 on penalties to retain their Premiership status for next season.<ref name="playoff">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32558724|title=Premiership play-off: Warrenpoint beat Bangor on penalties|date=1 May 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>

==Teams==
In their first season back in the top flight since [[2005–06 Irish Premier League|2005–06]], [[Ards F.C.|Ards]] finished bottom of the table the previous season. This was confirmed on 12 April 2014, after [[Warrenpoint Town F.C.|Warrenpoint Town]] defeated [[Dungannon Swifts F.C.|Dungannon Swifts]] 4–0 to leave Ards 10 points adrift in 12th place with only three fixtures remaining.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26995097|title=Irish Premiership: Dungannon Swifts 0-4 Warrenpoint Town|date=12 April 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref> Subsequently, Ards were relegated to Championship 1. [[Institute F.C.|Institute]] replaced them in the Premiership, after securing the [[2013–14 IFA Championship|2013–14 Championship 1]] title. Institute returned to the top flight for the first time in four years since they were relegated in the [[2009–10 IFA Premiership|2009–10 season]].

The [[2013–14 NIFL Premiership#Promotion/relegation play-off|Promotion/relegation play-off]] was not played the previous season because the runners-up of Championship 1, [[Bangor F.C.|Bangor]], were ineligible for promotion as they did not possess a licence to participate in top-flight football. As a result, this gave a reprieve to the previous season's 11th-placed team, [[Warrenpoint Town F.C.|Warrenpoint Town]], who retained their Premiership status by default.<ref name="Institute">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27154450|title=Ards relegated as Bangor draw gifts promotion to Institute|date=26 April 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

===Windsor Park redevelopment===
As a result of Windsor Park being redeveloped, its capacity was limited to approximately 10,500. This was still more than large enough to accommodate the average Premiership attendance at the stadium. Linfield were forced to play their first six league games of the season away from home while a new playing surface was laid at the stadium. Linfield's first home league game of the season was on 13 September 2014 against Warrenpoint Town, which resulted in a 1–0 home win.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29192709|title=Irish Premiership: Linfield 1-0 Warrenpoint Town|date=13 September 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref> On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32137105|title=Windsor Park: Safety fears over West Stand after cracks spotted|date=31 March 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref> The closure of the stand ultimately forced Linfield to play their remaining two home games of the season against Glenavon and Crusaders at the [[Ballymena Showgrounds]] and the [[The Oval (Belfast)|Oval]] respectively.
