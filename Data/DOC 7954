*'''Delete''' - very poorly cited with newswire sources.  Everybody in Italy claims to be born in Roma; their maternity wards must be filled to the hallways. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 21:20, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-184512356.html This] Highbeam article may or may not be enough to establish notability, but it does suggest that Cao's been involved in something more newsworthy than the current puff would suggest.
