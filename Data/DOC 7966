'''Terese Willis''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by [[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]. The actress was cast in the role after attending an audition in late 2012. Before she began filming her first scenes in early February 2013, Elmaloglou had to ask the producers to change the pronunciation of her character's name. Elmaloglou's character and her family were created and introduced to ''Neighbours'', as part of an ongoing overhaul of the show's cast and renewed focus on family units within the show. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 14 May 2013.

Terese is portrayed as being ambitious, organised, hard-working and a good mother. Elmaloglou said she admired Terese and that while they shared some similarities, but they did not have much in common. Terese was introduced as the manager of Lassiter's Hotel, which was owned by [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]). Terese and Paul share a love/hate relationship, but despite the tension between them, they work well together. Terese's other storylines have often revolved around her marriage to [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad Willis]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) and their family. Terese has struggled to accept that her husband has a daughter with his ex-girlfriend and her friend, [[Lauren Carpenter|Lauren Turner]] ([[Kate Kendall]]). Later storylines have focused on her [[alcoholism]], her subsequent marriage breakdown as Brad left her for Lauren, an attempted assault by [[Ezra Hanley]] (Steve Nation), and a breast cancer diagnosis.

==Creation and casting==
On 7 February 2013, it was announced that the four-strong Willis family would be introduced to ''Neighbours'', as part of an ongoing overhaul of the show's cast and renewed focus on family units.<ref name="NewFamily">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a457193/neighbours-to-introduce-another-new-family.html|title=Updated: 'Neighbours' to introduce another new family|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 February 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> News of the Willis family's introduction came shortly after producers decided to also bring in the five-strong Turner family.<ref name="NewFamily"/> Executive producer [[Richard Jasek]] commented "As viewers will find out shortly, the Turners are a family of secrets, and the unique backstory of the Willis family is just as compelling."<ref name="NewFamily"/> The character of [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad Willis]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) was reintroduced to the show, along with his wife Terese and their teenage twins; [[Josh Willis (Neighbours)|Josh]] ([[Harley Bonner]]) and [[Imogen Willis|Imogen]] ([[Ariel Kaplan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/scoop/a459985/neighbours-new-willis-family-more-pictures.html|title='Neighbours' new Willis family – more pictures|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=19 February 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

Before she began filming, Elmaloglou asked the producers to change the pronunciation of her character's name.<ref name="NameTweak">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a483319/neighbours-rebekah-elmaloglou-sparked-terese-name-tweak.html#~oCzgcZOwUuKsOE|title='Neighbours' Rebekah Elmaloglou sparked Terese name tweak|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=21 May 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> Elmaloglou was initially happy with her character's name, as it was a deviation of her mother's name, Theresa.<ref name="NameTweak"/> However, she was concerned about the pronunciation chosen by the producers, explaining "At first I thought, 'That's nice, I'll always have mum close to me' – until I realised it's pronounced exactly how mum hates it!

==Development==

===Characterisation===
Elmaloglou described Terese as being "ambitious, organised and extremely capable when it comes to her job".<ref name="Elmaloglou"/> She thought her character would appear to be "a tough nut", but she displays a softer side when it comes to her family.<ref name="Elmaloglou"/> Elmaloglou liked that Terese's personality was changeable as it made her interesting.<ref name="Elmaloglou"/> She did not think Terese had a devious side, but she often riled people when she made decisions on their behalf.<ref name="Elmaloglou"/> A writer for the show's official website called Terese "a devoted wife, loving mother and hard working career woman."<ref name="TW"/> They also agreed that she was ambitious and had put in the hard work to achieve her dreams.<ref name="TW"/>

Elmaloglou said "Terese is a good mum, but she's also very career-orientated too. I think Terese worries about it a little bit more than she should."<ref name="Doug"/> Elmaloglou thought Terese was the kind of person she would be friends with, branding her an "all-rounder".<ref name="Fling">{{cite journal|date=26 October – 1 November 2013|title=Everyone wants Terese to a have a fling with Paul|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=43|pages=52–53}}</ref> She explained that she admires Terese and is quite similar to her in terms of how organised they both were.<ref name="Fling"/> However, Elmaloglou thought Terese was more businesslike than her and she was unsure if she could be the mother of three children.<ref name="Fling"/> She later commented that she and Terese did not really have anything in common and that she was much naughtier than Terese was.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/interviews/stefan-dennis-paul-may-not-find-love-but-hell-find-lust|title=Stefan Dennis: Paul may not find love, but he'll find lust!|date=22 April 2014|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

===Marriage to Brad Willis and family===
[[File:Kip Gamblin, 2012.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Kip Gamblin]] (''pictured'') played Terese's husband [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad Willis]].]] 
Terese married Brad Willis (Gamblin) when she was 21. They have three children; twins Josh and Imogen, and Piper.<ref name="TW"/> Gamblin explained that Brad and Terese met and married very quickly. Terese has some issues with Brad's former wife [[Beth Brennan|Beth]] ([[Natalie Imbruglia]]) because of their history and Gamblin called the situation "a bit messy".<ref name="Ex">{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Kerry|date=8–21 June 2013|title=The ex-factor!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=298|page=28}}</ref> Gamblin added that Brad and Terese's marriage was pretty strong.<ref name="Ex"/> Elmaloglou agreed, calling the marriage "absolutely solid" and saying that although Brad and Terese are different, they work well together.<ref name="Future">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a519460/neighbours-rebekah-elmaloglou-on-imogen-story-willis-clan-future.html#~oCErY4NWAaXGZ2|title='Neighbours': Rebekah Elmaloglou on Imogen story, Willis clan future|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=30 September 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> Prior to relocating to Erinsborough, Terese had become the breadwinner and was running the family, as Brad was busy coaching Josh, who was a competitive swimmer.<ref name="Ex"/> Shortly after her arrival, Terese was introduced to Brad's ex-girlfriend [[Lauren Carpenter|Lauren]] ([[Kate Kendall]]). Elmaloglou explained that Terese was aware of Brad's past and she was fairly relaxed about it.<ref name="Mrs">{{cite journal|date=8–14 June 2014|title=Meet Mrs Brad Willis!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=23|page=23}}</ref> As Terese felt secure in her marriage, she got on well with Lauren and their respective husbands became rivals instead.<ref name="Mrs"/>

Elmaloglou was initially shocked that she was cast as the mother of three teenagers and told a ''[[New Idea]]'' writer that she liked to think Terese was a very young mother.<ref name="Fab">{{cite journal|date=7 April 2014|title=We feel fab at 40!|journal=[[New Idea]]|issue=14|page=31}}</ref> After Imogen was diagnosed with an [[eating disorder]], Elmaloglou said Terese and Brad would feel guilty for not noticing, as they had been too focused on Josh and his swimming.<ref name="Future"/> The actress said the situation wakes them up and makes them realise that they had been neglecting their daughter. Elmaloglou commented "There is an element of regret that they weren't more in tune with Imogen and her problems."<ref name="Future"/> Imogen found it hard to accept that her parents knew about her condition and their reaction was just added pressure.<ref name="Collapse">{{cite journal|date=21–27 September 2013|title=Imogen's shock collapse!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=38|page=24}}</ref> In an effort to help Imogen, Terese opened up to her about her own eating disorder she had suffered with as a teenager. Kaplan called the moment "really powerful" and thought it would bring Imogen and Terese closer together, as well as help Imogen to come to terms with her own condition.<ref name="Collapse"/>

Elmaloglou hoped that Brad and Terese's youngest daughter, Piper, would be introduced at some point, especially after the character's began talking about her more during storylines. Elmaloglou thought Piper's introduction would add another dynamic to the family because of her young age.<ref name="Future"/> In early 2014, Lauren told Brad that she had given birth to his daughter twenty years ago. Lauren had believed that their daughter died soon after birth, but she had actually been adopted out.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lake|first=Rebecca|date=8–14 March 2014|title=Haunted by the past|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=10|page=38}}</ref> Terese did not take the revelation well and Elmaloglou said it was definitely a shock and not something she had ever prepared for.<ref name="Excited">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/neighbours/news/neighbours-rebekah-elmaloglou-im-so-excited-were-reuniting-as-father-and-daughter|title=Neighbours' Rebekah Elmaloglou: 'I'm so excited we're reuniting as father and daughter'|date=31 March 2014|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> She explained that Terese had been fine with the fact that Lauren and Brad had dated, but she struggled with the new situation and she worried about her own family and how the news would affect them.<ref name="Excited"/> When asked what advice she would give Terese, Elmaloglou replied "My advice to Terese would be to think before reacting and while it's a huge ask, try to put herself in Lauren's shoes... And watch Lauren like a hawk!"<ref name="Excited"/>

In April 2014, [[Terence Donovan (actor)|Terence Donovan]] returned to ''Neighbours'' as [[Doug Willis]], Brad's father. Donovan had previously played Elmaloglou's on-screen father in ''Home and Away''.<ref name="Excited"/> The actress was pleased to be reunited with Donovan "as father and daughter-in-law after all these years."<ref name="Excited"/> On-screen, Terese expressed her fears that Doug preferred Brad's ex-wife Beth to her. As Doug was "old school", he was not keen on Terese balancing her career and family. He was also not used to Terese's feisty side.<ref name="Excited"/> Elmaloglou thought Terese was being a little paranoid and said the fact was Doug and his wife, [[Pam Willis|Pam]] ([[Sue Jones (actress)|Sue Jones]]), had spent more time with Beth.<ref name="Doug">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a566294/neighbours-rebekah-elmaloglou-i-hope-doug-pam-return-again.html#~oCJFFFrajhW6At|title=Neighbours' Rebekah Elmaloglou: 'I hope Doug, Pam return again'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=23 April 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref> During Doug's visit, Terese was "bemused" when she found the television remote in the fridge and assumed Doug was getting a little forgetful due to his old age. Doug continued to have memory lapses, but Brad refused to listen to Terese's assumptions that it might be more serious, insisting that Doug was fine.<ref name="Denial">{{cite journal|date=May 2014|title=A son in denial|journal=[[nextmedia|Soap World]]|issue=255|page=20}}</ref> However, Doug was later diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="Doug"/> Elmaloglou added that the diagnosis would affect the family and she hoped Donovan and Jones would return to explore the storyline further, as it is a common disease.<ref name="Doug"/>

===Lassiter's Hotel===
Terese is introduced as the new manager of Lassiter's Hotel, which is owned by [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]).<ref name="Mrs"/> Terese decides to visit Erinsborough alone to check out the hotel and meet with Paul. Elmaloglou told an ''[[Inside Soap]]'' reporter, "This is the perfect chance for Terese to see things at the hotel as they really are, before Paul can cover anything up!"<ref name="Mrs"/> Paul believes he is conducting an interview for the manager's job, so he is surprised when Terese lets slip that his sister, [[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]] ([[Melissa Bell (actress)|Melissa Bell]]), has already offered her the job without consulting him.<ref name="Mrs"/> Elmaloglou said Terese is keen to get on with things and it would not take her long to get the measure of Paul.<ref name="Mrs"/> She also said that Terese and Paul are "fantastic foils for each other" and she believed Terese is capable of holding her own with Paul.<ref name="Excited"/> Dennis found that Terese and Paul shared a love/hate relationship and said Paul respected Terese for her business skills and the way she stands up to him. Stefan added that while there is a tension between them, they did work well together.<ref name="SDennis">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a547628/neighbours-stefan-dennis-on-paul-stories-rebecca-return-and-more.html#~oCG24MquQjyUF3|title=Neighbours: Stefan Dennis on Paul stories, Rebecca return and more|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=30 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

In January 2014, Terese and Paul's working relationship is strained when Paul tries to make things intolerable for Terese at Lassiter's.<ref name="Burfitt">{{cite journal|last=Burfitt|first=John|date=30 January 2014|title=Birthday blitz|journal=[[nextmedia|TV Soap]]|issue=2|pages=14–15}}</ref> Dennis told John Burfitt from ''TV Soap'' that Paul wants to make Terese as uncomfortable as possible in order to get rid of her from the hotel.<ref name="Burfitt"/> He explained, "I actually don't think he genuinely dislikes her, but he has decided to dislike her as he had no control in her being there and being such a control freak, he didn't like Lucy coming in and telling him who was going to work there. He then decided to buck back against the decision and push her out in every way he can."<ref name="Burfitt"/> After Paul pushes Terese too far, she quits her job with immediate effect. Lucy is "furious" by the new, as she knows that Terese is a great employee. Lucy then threatens to remove the hotel from the Lassiter's chain to make Paul see sense.<ref name="Burfitt"/> Neither Elmaloglou or Dennis thought Terese and Paul would have an affair in the immediate future, with Elmaloglou saying that Terese's marriage to Brad was very solid.<ref name="Fling"/><ref name="SDennis"/> However, she thought with all the tension between Terese and Paul, there could be an underlying attraction between them.<ref name="Fling"/>

===Marital problems and Ezra Hanley===
When Brad and Terese experienced difficulties in their marriage, Terese walked out on Brad and moved into Lassiter's.<ref name="NewLight">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a612543/neighbours-rebekah-elmaloglou-youll-see-terese-in-a-new-light.html#~pccUIA2xXWs3KE|title=Neighbours' Rebekah Elmaloglou: 'You'll see Terese in a new light'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=26 November 2014|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> Elmaloglou enjoyed working on the storyline, but she also found it hard as she loved that Brad and Terese had such a solid marriage. The storyline also gave her a chance to explore Terese's many levels and said that "a different side of her" would emerge.<ref name="NewLight"/> Elmaloglou explained that Terese did not think her marriage was over, but she had realised that instead of blaming her problems on other people, she needed to work out what had gone wrong within the marriage and her relationship with Brad.<ref name="NewLight"/> She continued, "Terese is not moving out because of a final decision over her marriage, it's just that the last six to twelve months have been so overwhelming and she needs space. Who knows whether moving into Lassiters is really a good idea, but it's just a way for her to take some time out of the Ramsay Street situation."<ref name="NewLight"/> While Terese was staying in the hotel, Paul invited her former boss, [[Ezra Hanley]] (Steve Nation), to Erinsborough. Terese had previously admitted to having feelings for Ezra. Elmaloglou said viewers would be questioning why Paul would bring Ezra and thought the most likely reason was that he did not like Brad.<ref name="NewLight"/>

The actress was concerned that some people would think that Terese was trying to get payback on Brad by spending time with Ezra, but she said that Terese was just confused and placed in "a very vulnerable situation".<ref name="NewLight"/> Elmaloglou added "There's so much going on at home, so Terese falls into a trap and gets caught up in a situation. It was challenging to film, but it was something a little bit different, which I liked."<ref name="NewLight"/> When Ezra later asked Terese to dinner, she accepted following another argument with Brad, who suggested that they make their split more permanent.<ref name="Danger">{{cite journal|date=15–21 November 2014|title=Date with danger|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=46}}</ref> Dennis said Paul was pleased with the development as he wanted Terese to have some fun and be with someone more "intellectually matched with her".<ref name="Danger"/> After dinner, Ezra suggested that he and Terese should go to her room to continue working on plans for the Erinsborough Festival. Tereese "ignored her fears" and agreed.<ref name="Danger"/> However, she regretted her decision when Ezra made advances towards her and chose not to accept her refusal.<ref name="Danger"/>

Terese was "furious" with Paul for bringing Ezra back into her life and for telling Brad that she had spent the night with him. When she told Paul that Ezra had tried to attack her, Paul felt guilty and Dennis said he was "genuinely concerned" about Terese.<ref name="Attacked">{{cite journal|last=Wulff|first=Alana|date=20 November – 3 December 2014|title=Terese attacked!|journal=[[TV Week Soap Extra]]|issue=9|page=16}}</ref> Brad later found Terese and admitted that he still loved her, causing her to break down in his arms and confess what had happened with Ezra.<ref name="Attacked"/> After Ezra was dismissed from his job, he tried to sue Paul and Terese. When Terese suggested that they give him a settlement, Paul assures her that he has another idea to get rid of him.<ref name="BetterCall">{{cite journal|date=29 November – 5 December 2014|title=Better call Paul|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=48|pages=18–19}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, Terese found Ezra badly beaten and unconscious. During the police investigation, Terese was found to be physically incapable of committing the crime, while Paul had an alibi.<ref name="BetterCall"/> The police then suggested that either Josh or Brad could be responsible, with Brad having recently had a hand injury treated. However, it soon emerged that Paul had hired [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) to assault Ezra.<ref name="BetterCall"/>

In May 2015, Ezra returned to Erinsborough as the acquisitions manager for Lassiter's following its sale to another hotel chain.<ref name="Testing">{{cite journal|last=Crick|first=Claire|date=9–22 May 2015|title=Testing times!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=348|page=32}}</ref> Elmaloglou told ''All About Soap's'' Claire Crick that Terese was initially worried about her job after the sale, but Paul assured her she would be okay. After she started to relax, Terese was "mortified" to discover that Ezra was in charge.<ref name="Testing"/> Elmaloglou explained, "She tries to be grown-up about it, but he makes her life miserable. She hasn't forgotten what happened when he was last in Erinsborough."<ref name="Testing"/> Terese later quit her job after she could not take it anymore. Elmaloglou stated that Brad was behind Terese's decision and suggested that she should take a break and go to Canada to see their youngest daughter Piper.<ref name="Testing"/> The actress commented that Terese was worried about leaving Brad behind with Lauren, but she just had to have faith in them. Elmaloglou added that she hoped Terese would get her job back, so she could continue to work with Paul.<ref name="Testing"/>

===Alcoholism===
As Terese worries about her job, her children's problems, and Brad's closeness with Lauren, whose husband Matt died, she turns to alcohol to cope.<ref name="Grog">{{cite journal|date=August 2015|title=Who's stealing the grog?|journal=Soap World|issue=272|page=17}}</ref> The storyline initially sees Terese drinking more at lunch time and after work, but she tries to cover it up, as she does not want to risk losing her job. However, [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) soon notices some of the stock at The Waterhole has been stolen and sets up CCTV on the storeroom, where Terese is caught helping herself.<ref name="Grog"/> Shelia confronts Terese, who tries to dismiss her concerns. But Sheila goes through the Willis' bins for evidence and finds a bottle that was taken from The Waterhole.<ref name="Grog"/> A fearful Terese tells Sheila off for questioning her integrity, but a Waterhole employee later comments on Terese's drinking, leading Sheila to ask whether she has a problem with alcohol.<ref name="Grog"/> In an attempt to prove that she does not have a drinking problem, Terese agrees to Brad's suggestion that they take part in the "Alcohol-free August" campaign, but Terese later enjoys a bottle of wine with Paul, causing more strain on her marriage.<ref name="Grog"/>

While attending an [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA meeting]], Terese meets [[Walter Mitchell (2016 character)|Walter Mitchell]] ([[Greg Stone]]) and has an instant connection with him.<ref name="ShockKiss">{{cite journal|date=21–27 May 2016|title=Shock kiss for Terese!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=20|page=29}}</ref> Sonya warns Terese that Walter's intentions might not be honourable, but Terese arranges a date with him, which ends in a kiss between them.<ref name="ShockKiss"/> Elmaloglou commented, "Walter is attractive and funny, and a nice diversion from all the stuff Terese has had to go through."<ref name="ShockKiss"/> When Paul goes on trial for causing an explosion at Lassiter's, which contributed to the deaths of Doug and Josh, Terese commits perjury in a bid to see him jailed.

In another issue-led storyline, Terese is diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in mid-2017.<ref name="McGrane">{{cite web|url=https://nz.news.yahoo.com/neighbour-secret-diagnosis-200024363--spt.html|title=The Neighbour with the secret diagnosis|last=McGrane|first=Danielle|date=7 July 2017|publisher=[[Australian Associated Press]]|accessdate=18 February 2019}}</ref> When the producers were creating the storyline, they decided to consult Elmaloglou first, as they were aware that her mother had breast cancer the previous year. She accepted the story immediately, saying "I didn't hesitate at all because it is so common and people can relate to it."<ref name="McGrane"/> Elmaloglou spoke with her mother about her experience in order to portray the condition accurately.<ref name="McGrane"/> The plot begins with Terese finding a lump in her breast and undergoing a [[lumpectomy|biopsy]], which comes back all clear. However, Terese "senses that something isn't quite right" and she soon learns that her grandmother died from breast cancer, so she asks to be re-tested.<ref name="ShockDiagnosis">{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=24–30 June 2017|title=Terese's shock diagnosis!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=25|page=23}}</ref> Doctor [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) informs Terese that she does have breast cancer after all. Elmaloglou said that the moment is "pretty overwhelming" for Terese.<ref name="ShockDiagnosis"/> Of filming the scenes, she commented "I'm quite good at separating my work life from real life – but because my mother has just gone through breast cancer, those emotions are still quite raw. Having to say the words 'I have cancer' was quite confronting."<ref name="ShockDiagnosis"/> She also said that the message about following up test results when your not satisfied with the diagnosis was really important.<ref name="ShockDiagnosis"/> 

Terese decides to keep the news from her family and partner, Gary Canning. Elmaloglou was understanding of Terese's reaction, but due to her experience with her mother, she felt that someone diagnosed with cancer needed love and support from their family, as the treatment could be "very debilitating".<ref name="ShockDiagnosis"/> Terese ends up confiding in Paul, who has suffered a cancer scare of his own.<ref name="McGrane"/> Elmaloglou added that Terese was "a tough cookie" and she was confident for her survival.<ref name="ShockDiagnosis"/> Terese eventually reveals her diagnosis to her family.

==Storylines==
After accepting the Lassiter's Erinsborough general manager's job, Terese meets with the hotel's owner Paul Robinson for a tour. Paul is initially unaware that she has the job and Terese allows him to interview her, before telling him that she just wanted to make sure they would work well together. Terese moves into Number 22 [[Ramsay Street]] with her husband Brad and their twins Imogen and Josh. She learns that Brad's former girlfriend, Lauren Turner, is living across the street and befriends her. Terese fires receptionist [[Caroline Perkins]] (Alinta Chidzey) for being lazy and rude, but Caroline then sues the hotel, claiming that Paul sexually harassed her. Terese arranges for Caroline to be paid off. After Terese stays late at work, Brad accuses Paul of trying to take advantage of her in front of an inspector, costing the hotel its five star rating. Terese assures Brad that he got it wrong. [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) becomes concerned that Imogen might have an eating disorder, but Terese dismisses her concerns. However, Imogen later collapses and is admitted to hospital with a torn oesophagus, as a result of [[bulimia]]. Terese tells Imogen about her own eating disorder in an attempt to get her to open up.

Paul promotes Terese to Head of Operations for the Lassiter's complex. He installs paid parking for the complex, angering the business owners. Terese realises Paul set her up, so she increases the maintenance rates for the apartment tenants and scraps the paid parking. Relations between Paul and Terese deteriorate and she quits her job. Paul threatens to sue her for breach of contract, but Terese counter-sues him for defamation. Lucy convinces Paul to reinstate Terese. Brad sues [[Mason Turner]] ([[Taylor Glockner]]) when Josh is injured in an abseiling accident, causing tension between the Willis and Turner families. Terese tries to persuade Mason to leave Erinsborough for a job in Darwin and Lauren accuses her of wanting to get rid of her son. Terese struggles to cope when Lauren informs Brad that they have a daughter together, who was adopted out. When Brad's father, Doug, visits, Terese believes that he prefers Brad's first wife, Beth, to her, but they rebuild their relationship when Doug is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Brad's mother, Pam, soon arrives in Erinsborough and Terese helps her see that Doug needs her support.

Terese begins seeing Imogen's counsellor as a way of coping with all the stress in her life. Brad and Lauren fly to Adelaide to find their daughter. Brad stays longer than planned, causing further estrangement from Terese. When he returns, Terese questions the strength of their marriage but they reconcile. Terese pushes Brad to take a teaching position at Erinsborough High. She also tries to help Paul when he becomes depressed, and clashes with hotel guest [[Paige Novak]] ([[Olympia Valance]]). Paige is revealed to be Lauren and Brad's long lost daughter and Terese struggles to accept her. Upon learning Paige trashed Harold's Store, Terese has her arrested. She tries to convince Lauren's husband [[Matt Turner (Neighbours)|Matt]] ([[Josef Brown]]) to join her in keeping an eye on Paige, but he refuses. Terese later drops the charges and decides to give Paige the benefit of the doubt. When Terese learns that Brad kissed Lauren in Adelaide, she orders Brad to stay away from Lauren, suspecting a continuing affair. Terese and Brad's marriage becomes strained, and Terese moves into the hotel.

Paul invites Terese's former boss Ezra Hanley to Erinsborough to help her organise a festival. Terese and Ezra almost kiss, but Terese pulls away, realising she loves Brad. She asks Ezra to leave her room, but he refuses and Terese has to physically force him to go. Brad asks Terese to work on their marriage and she agrees. Ezra attempts to sue Terese and Paul, but he soon leaves after he is attacked by a mystery assailant. Terese's brother [[Nick Petrides]] ([[Damien Fotiou]]) takes up a job at the hospital. She learns that the day before her wedding to Brad, Nick engineered a meeting between Brad and his ex-wife, to see if Brad was faithful to her. She tries to calm things between Brad and Nick as they feud. Terese stops Matt from having an affair with [[Sharon Canning]] (Natasha Herbert). After he dies, Terese tries to keep Sharon from talking to Lauren and sends her on a cruise. She starts to worry about Brad and Lauren's closeness. It soon emerges that Nick has been treating Paul for leukaemia that he does not have and he is arrested.

Ezra returns as the acquisitions manager for the Quill Group, who purchase Lassiter's. He reduces Terese's responsibilities and when he makes a suggestive comment, Terese quits her job. Upon her return, Terese learns from Ezra's son [[Clem Hanley|Clem]] (Max Whitelaw) that his former girlfriend, [[List of Neighbours characters (2015)#Chloe Jones|Chloe Jones]] (Gaby Seow), accused Ezra of assaulting her. Terese encourages Chloe to go to the police, which results in Ezra's arrest. The Quill Group hire Terese as the manager of Lassiter's. Still feeling insecure in her marriage, Terese pushes Lauren and [[Robin Dawal]] (Max Brown) together. Terese also realises Paige is trying to reunite Brad and Lauren, so she encourages Paige's adoptive mother [[Mary Smith (Neighbours)|Mary]] ([[Gina Liano]]) to reconcile with her daughter and take her to Singapore. Terese begins drinking and develops alcoholism, causing further issues in her marriage. Terese later learns Brad had sex with Lauren, ending their marriage. Brad and Terese's youngest daughter [[Piper Willis|Piper]] (Mavournee Hazel) returns from Canada. Terese is caught up in a fire that breaks out at Erinsborough High. She and Lauren become trapped beneath some lockers, and Brad is only able to rescue Lauren. Terese serious burns and has to undergo a skin graft. Terese develops [[sepsis]] and Brad vows to help out more while she recovers.

Terese invites Paul to live with her after he loses ownership of Lassiter's, despite a conflict of interest as Terese's new boss, [[Julie Quill]] (Gail Easdale), is an old enemy of Paul's. Lauren nominates Terese for a "Women in Business Award". Terese kisses Paul and tries to seduce him, only to change her mind at the last moment. When Paul keeps trying to undermine Julie, Terese, caught in the middle, chooses her job over her friendship with Paul, and asks him to move out. The hotel boiler explodes and both Josh and Doug die. Paul supports her and tells her he loves her, but she is horrified when Paul is arrested for the explosion. Terese meets Walter Mitchell at an AA meeting and they briefly date. Terese bribes [[Cecilia Saint]] ([[Candice Alley]]) into committing perjury, so Paul is sent to prison. However, during the trial, Terese drinks and admits to the bribery. She is charged with perverting the course of justice and fired by Julie. Terese continues drinking and collapses in the laundry room. She then leaves Erinsborough for a health retreat in Tasmania, and is later given a suspended sentence. With the financial help of the Udagawa family, Terese buys Lassiter's.

Terese disapproves of Piper's relationship with [[Tyler Brennan]] ([[Travis Burns (actor)|Travis Burns]]), due to the age gap between them. Piper accuses Terese of hypocrisy when she has a brief romance with [[Ryan Prescott (Neighbours)|Ryan Prescott]] (James Sweeny), who is much younger than her. Terese and Brad hold a divorce party, and she witnesses Brad proposing to Lauren. Terese has a date with [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]), but soon discovers he is working for Paul. [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) attempts to play Terese and Paul off against each other, and he later outbids them for the Men's Shed tender. Terese bans Piper from dating Tyler while she is living at home, so Piper moves out. Terese and Gary grow closer and begin a relationship. Terese breaks up with Gary after suspecting he is having an affair with his former partner [[Brooke Butler]] ([[Fifi Box]]). Gary explains that he was just helping Brooke reconnect with her daughter Jessie. He and Terese reconcile and become engaged. Paul later declares his feelings for her.

Terese experiences a pain in her chest and finds a lump on her breast. She undergoes a biopsy, which comes back negative. Terese asks for the test to be run again after learning her grandmother died from breast cancer and it comes back positive. Terese keeps her diagnosis a secret, but later confides in Paul, who keeps her company at her first chemotherapy session. Gary wrongly assumes Terese is pregnant or drinking again, so she tells him and Piper that she has cancer. Terese is sick during a meeting with potential investors and [[Jasmine Udagawa]] (Kaori Maeda-Judge) admits to being concerned about her recent performance. After firing her assistant, Terese offers Paige the job. Terese begins losing her hair and tells Paul that she does not think her treatment is working. Gary meets with Nick to discuss her diagnosis and persuades Terese to visit him. Nick tells Terese that [[immunotherapy]] could help her and she agrees to speak at his parole hearing. Nick is released from prison and he oversees Terese's new treatment. Jasmine learns about Terese's cancer and the Udagawas threaten to remove their investment. Paul persuades [[Mr Udagawa|Toshiro Udagawa]] (Lawrence Mah) to stand by Terese. After Terese learns her tumours have shrunk, she and Paul have sex. Terese fires [[Courtney Grixti]] (Emma Lane) when she wrongly assumes that she has been giving the male clients of the day spa erotic massages. Courtney later tries to sue her. Lassiters is also downgraded to a three star hotel. Terese tells Susan about her affair with Paul, and Susan pulls out of performing the wedding ceremony. Terese decides to go ahead with the wedding, but during the ceremony she tells Gary she cheated on him with Paul. Devastated, he ends their engagement. Terese goes to Paul, but learns he is engaged to Courtney after an apparent whirlwind romance. Paul informs Terese that he has bought Mr Udagawa's share of Lassiters, making him her boss. He also installs Courtney as a rejuvenation consultant for the hotel and she regularly clashes with Terese. 

Weeks after their failed wedding, Terese and Gary reconcile, but their relationship is constantly troubled by Gary's distrust of Paul. Terese proposes to Gary and he accepts, but after finding Terese and Paul working late at the hotel, he realises he cannot move past her betrayal and ends their relationship. Paul asks Terese to mentor his son [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano). After months of working together closely, Leo declares his feelings for Terese. She rejects him and ends the mentorship, but slowly realises she reciprocates Leo's feelings and they have sex. They keep their fling a secret from Paul, who is still hopeful for a reconciliation with Terese. He catches them together at the penthouse and seeks revenge for their betrayal. Evicted from Paul's penthouse, Leo moves in with Terese and their relationship strengthens, despite constant opposition from Paul. Leo tells Terese that he loves her, but suddenly breaks up with her to pursue a relationship with [[Delaney Renshaw]] (Ella Newton). Terese tries to find out why he broke up with her, but eventually accepts that he has moved on. After Piper overhears Delaney taking a suspicious phone call, Terese goes through her things, but is caught. She then attempts to seduce Paul, but he rejects her advances. Leo tells Terese that he broke up with Delaney and still loves her, but she refuses to listen to him. Delaney's uncle, [[Ivan Renshaw]] (Michael Shanahan) shoots at Leo, but Terese jumps in front of him taking the bullet.

Terese was taken to the hospital and makes a full recovery. Leo and Terese gets back together and Leo propose to her, but she rejects the proposal as she doesn't see to have a future with him, and breaks up with him. Paul confronts Terese about breaking Leo and Terese admits to Paul that she still has feelings for him and they kiss. They secretly start a relationship but Leo walked in on them kissing and accuses Terese and Paul for having an affair behind his back. Terese and Paul were shocked when Leo threw the Lassiter's Valentine display at [[Vera Punt]] (Sally-Anne Upton), who sues the hotel. A drunken Leo cause a scene in front of Terese's house. Imogen returns to Erinborough to fill in for Toadie while he's in America. 

As Leo makes an apology to Vera, he gets into an argument with Paul and Terese. Terese was shocked when Leo is now dating Piper. Terese accuses Leo for seducing Piper out of revenge and also takes Piper, as she thought Piper had more self respect. Terese later apologise to Piper.
