The '''Logan/Esterly Upper Ditch''' is an abandoned, [[Ditch|artificial watercourse]] in the [[Illinois River (Oregon)|Illinois River]] Valley of northern [[California]] and southern [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. Built in 1854 to supply water from the river's East Fork in California to several [[hydraulic mine]]s in Oregon, it quickly returned a large profit to its [[investor]]s. The ditch supplied mines worked by its own owners, as well as providing water for sale to other nearby diggings and incidentally powering at least one [[sawmill]]. Mines it served include the [[Waldo Mine|Waldo]], [[Fry Gulch Mine|Fry Gulch]], and [[Cameron Mine|Cameron]] mines. It continued in operation until 1942, when the last hydraulic mining operations in the upper Illinois Valley ceased. Several wooden structures associated with the ditch, such as [[trestle]]s and [[flume]]s, disappeared by the end of the 20th century, but the earthen components remained mostly intact.<ref name="UpDitchNom">{{Citation | last1 = Atwood | first1 = Katherine C. | last2 = Tonsfeldt | first2 = Ward | date = August 17, 2000 | title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Upper Ditch | url = {{NRHP url|01001149}} | accessdate = April 21, 2014 | format = PDF}}.</ref>
