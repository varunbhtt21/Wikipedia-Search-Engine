On the appearance of "Starstruck" on ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'', [[Ray Davies]] claimed that "It is strange to think of this song being recorded by The Kinks, because it is definitely a song that should be on somebody's solo album."<ref name="33 and 1/3">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Andy|title=Kinks' The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society}}</ref>

As well as being the tenth track on ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'', "Starstruck" has appeared on the compilation album ''[[The Ultimate Collection (The Kinks album)|The Ultimate Collection]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/starstruck-mt0030511691 |title=Starstruck - The Kinks &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>
