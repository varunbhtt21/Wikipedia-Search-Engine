This article primarily concerns [[Enactive interfaces]] and that content already has been placed on the new page [[Enactive interfaces]]. The remainder concerns [[Enactivism]] and already has been moved to [[Enactivism]]. Consequently there is no further reason for this page. These actions are an outgrowth of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Enaction_%28philosophy%29#Two_proposals_.E2.80.94_Comments an analysis of these articles] by MachineElf1735, Bob K31416, Snowded, and Brews_ohare.

:::The approach I have taken will work just fine. If you want to use a different approach and re-do all the work involved in transferring material to two different articles, then you do it. I am not going to try again to implement the plan decided upon. [[User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]] ([[User talk:Brews ohare|talk]]) 21:30, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Reasons provided are clear: the article is redundant having had all its content moved to [[Enactive interfaces]] and [[Enactivism]]. [[User:Brews ohare|Brews ohare]] ([[User talk:Brews ohare|talk]]) 14:42, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
