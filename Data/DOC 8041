==Community activism==
Bowers was a member of several literary societies.<ref name=Yellin/> He was one of the signatories of the constitution of the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons, instituted on January 1, 1833. The Company's object was "the collection of a library of useful works of every description, for the benefit of its members, who might there successfully apply without comparatively any cost, for that mental good which they could not readily obtain elsewhere". For a membership fee of $1, African Americans of all classes were afforded an opportunity to further educate themselves. The library's members adopted a system of organized reading and weekly debate that enabled its members to practice elocution and public speaking.<ref name=Willson>{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Joseph|title=Sketches of the Higher Classes of Colored Society in Philadelphia|year=1841|publisher=Merrihew and Thompson, Printers|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-271-02021-0|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008585241}}</ref>{{rp|96–100}}  In spite of its name, the Library Company was a male institution.<ref name=sisterhood/> Bowers also supported the education of women, writing to the ''Liberator'' in 1834 in praise of women's literary groups.<ref name=sisterhood>{{cite book|author-first=Julie|author-last=Winch|chapter=You have talents &#8211; only cultivate them", Philadelphia's Black Female Literary Societies and the Abolitionist Crusade|editor-last1=Yellin|editor-first1=Jean Fagan|title=The Abolitionist sisterhood: women's political culture in Antebellum America|year=1994|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=0801480116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDnCTyp5ZkgC&pg=PA110|editor-first2=John C.|editor-last2=Van Horne}}</ref> Bowers was involved in starting the Gilbert Lyceum, instituted on January 31, 1841, which enabled women and men to work together in literary and scientific pursuits.<ref name=Willson/>{{rp|109–111}} He became secretary of the weekly newspaper ''[[The Colored American (New York City)|The Colored American]]'' in 1841.

When the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1838 (known as the Reform Convention) met to amend the state constitution to restrict [[suffrage]] to whites, blacks formed their own Committee to respond. J. C. Bowers was one of that committee, along with [[Robert Purvis]], James Cornish, Robert B. Forten, J. J. G. Bias, James Needham, and John P. Burr. They prepared and published the "Appeal of Forty Thousand Citizens Threatened with Disenfranchisement, To the People of Pennsylvania", hoping to convince white citizens not to approve the amended constitution. Bowers was active in raising money for the publication.<ref name=Winch/>{{rp|154}} In spite of their efforts, the citizens of Pennsylvania ratified the new state constitution on October 9, 1838, [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchising]] free African Americans in Pennsylvania.
