'''George Lawrence Davis''' (1830-1894) was commended to [[Madrid]] (Spain) from [[Leominster]] (Herefordshire) in 1863 to preach the gospel.

After some years traveling through Spain with a Bible Carriage, dubbed "the armored vehicle" <ref>Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo "Historia de los Heterodoxos Españoles" (Madrid, 1880–1882)</ref> after an escape from being shot at, he moved to [[Gràcia]] (Barcelona), where he established free schools for children and adults, and where he published magazines containing different educational and religious topics, such as ''La Aurora de la Gracia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protestantes.net/libros.asp?subcategoria=La%20Aurora%20de%20la%20Gracia|title=La Aurora de la Gracia 1874-1876|publisher=Centro de Estudios de la Reforma|language = Spanish|accessdate=2013}}</ref> He also founded a hospital that would be the embryo of the current “Hospital Evangèlic” in [[Barcelona]].

Looking for healthcare he came to [[Caldes de Montbui]], a spa town near Barcelona, where he settled. Here he founded and directed a school known as "Escola dels Pobres" and a church called "Església Evangèlica Caldes de Montbui". In acknowledgment of his charitable work, one of the downtown streets in Caldes de Montbui is now named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.naciodigital.cat/naciogranollers/noticia/12094/missioner/lawrence/davis/pren/carrer/caldes/al/militar/espartero
