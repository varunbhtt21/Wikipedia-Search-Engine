Title : Zurvandad
Text : '''Zurvandad''' (also spelled '''Zurwandad''') was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] nobleman from the [[House of Suren]] who served as the leader of the [[Zoroastrian]] priesthood. He was the eldest son of the powerful minister [[Mihr Narseh]], and had two brothers named Kardar and Mahgushnasp.{{sfn|Daryaee|2012a}} His name means "given by [[Zurvanism|Zurvan]]".{{sfn|Daryaee|2012b}} Bearing that name does not automatically imply that a person was an adherant of Zurvanism.{{sfn|Daryaee|2012b}} However, Zurvandad's father was a Zurvanist, meaning that Zurwandad himself was also probably a Zurvanist.{{sfn|Daryaee|2012b}} During the reign of king [[Peroz I]], Zurvanism was declared illegal and was shunned from the Zoroastrian society.{{sfn|Daryaee|2012b}} Zurvandad may be the same person mentioned in the [[Vendidad]] who had disputed [[Ahura Mazda]] as the supreme god of Zoroastrianism.{{sfn|Daryaee|2012b}} Nothing more is known about Zurvandad.
