'''Louis John Wicker''' (born September 30, 1959) is an American atmospheric scientist with expertise in numerical analysis, numerical simulation, and [[Weather forecasting|forecasts]] of severe [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] and [[tornado]]es. Doing [[storm chasing]] field research, Wicker deployed the [[TOtable Tornado Observatory]] (TOTO) and was in leadership roles in the [[VORTEX projects]]. He is also known for pioneering work simulating convection at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (UIUC).<ref name="CV">[http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/lwicker/public_html/Professional_Vita.pdf Curriculum Vitae for Dr. Louis J. Wicker]</ref>

Wicker earned a B.S. and M.S. in [[meteorology]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]] (OU) in 1984 and 1986, respectively, with the masters thesis: ''A Simulation Study of a Data Assimilation Scheme Designed for VAS Temperature Soundings''. He was awarded a Ph.D. in [[atmospheric sciences]] from UIUC in 1990 with the doctoral dissertation: ''A Numerical Study of a Tornado-Scale Vortex in a Three-Dimensional Cloud Model''. From 1990-1992 he was a Visiting Associate Research Scientist at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at UIUC and at NCSA. Wicker was a professor at [[Texas A&M University]] (TAMU) from 1992-1999. In 1999 he joined the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) as a research meteorologist and is a Fellow of the [[Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies]] (CIMMS).<ref name="CV"/> At NSSL/CIMMS, he is an affiliate associate professor in the School of Meteorology at OU.<ref>[http://som.ou.edu/profiles.php?facID=184 Lou Wicker] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140426191859/http://som.ou.edu/profiles.php?facID=184 |date=2014-04-26 }}</ref> He was on the steering committee and was a [[principal investigator]] (PI) of [https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/vortex2/ VORTEX2], the field phase of which occurred from 2009-2010.<ref>[http://www.vortex2.org/home/ VORTEX2]</ref>
