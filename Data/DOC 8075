==Sonnets==

Ray's ''Sonnets'' (1893) was a short book of 12 sonnets on [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Raphael]], and [[Beethoven]], among other subjects.<ref>Ray, H. Cordelia, ''Sonnets''. New York: Press of J.J. Little & Co., 1893.</ref> Her sonnet on the [[Haiti]]an revolutionary [[Toussaint L'Overture]] is notable for its belated engagement in black politics (absent from her earlier verse) and for its allusions to [[William Wordsworth]]'s famous sonnet [http://www.bartleby.com/41/390.html "To Touissaint L'Overture"]:<ref>Ray, Henrietta Cordelia, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/182743 "To Touissaint L'Overture"] at [[Poetry Foundation]].</ref>

<blockquote>
To those fair isles where crimson sunsets burn,<br>We send a backward glance to gaze on thee,<br>Brave Toussaint! thou was surely born to be<br>A hero; thy proud spirit could but spurn<br>Each outrage on the race. Couldst thou unlearn<br>The lessons taught by instinct? Nay! and we<br>Who share the zeal that would make all men free,<br>Must e’en with pride unto thy life-work turn.<br>Soul-dignity was thine and purest aim;<br>And ah! how sad that thou wast left to mourn<br>In chains ’neath alien skies. On him, shame! shame!<br>That mighty conqueror who dared to claim<br>The right to bind thee. Him we heap with scorn,<br>And noble patriot! guard with love thy name.<ref name=Banks>Banks, M. O. (2000). ''HENRIETTA CORDELIA RAY. African American Authors, 1745–

1945: Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook'', 366.</ref></blockquote>

Ray's reputation as a poet rests primarily on her 1910 volume, from which poems were republished widely in anthologies in the early twentieth century.<ref>[[Jesse Fauset|Fauset, Jessie]], "What to Read", ''[[The Crisis]]'' 4:4 (August 1912): 183.</ref> Her work has been rediscovered in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref name=Banks /><ref>Looney, Dennis, ''Freedom Readers: The African American Reception of Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedy''.
