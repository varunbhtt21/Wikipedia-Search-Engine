*It is believed that the use of this image on the English-language Wikipedia to illustrate an article on the person in question falls under the "Non-profit educational" clause of the Fair Use doctrine currently upheld by United States law.

*It is only being used to illustrate the article in question
*It does not limit the copyright owner's rights to sell the image in any way
*For the same reasons, the portion of the copyrighted work used is of inherently lower quality than the original, reducing the risk of competitiveness and therefore the effects of this copy on the market for or value of versions held by the owner of the copyright
*Furthermore, the image is being used in an informational capacity and thus contributes to the article as a whole
