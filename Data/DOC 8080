In 2001, at age six, Coltrane was cast by filmmaker [[Richard Linklater]] to play the title character of sorts of the film ''[[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]]''; Linklater wanted to make an unprecedented film that would show a boy's [[coming of age]], but with the actors growing up or aging on screen. Coltrane and other members of the cast were filmed intermittently for several days at a time between May 2002 and August 2013, when Coltrane turned 19; there were 45 days of filming altogether.<ref>{{cite web|first=Larry|last=Carroll|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1546688/got-plans-for-2013-check-out-richard-linklaters-12-year-movie|title=Got Plans For 2013?
