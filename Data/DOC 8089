Title : HWB color model
Text : '''HWB''' is a [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical-coordinate]] representation of points in an [[RGB color model]], similar to [[HSL and HSV]]. It was developed by [[HSL and HSV|HSV]]’s creator [[Alvy Ray Smith]] in 1996 to address some of the issues with HSV. HWB was designed to be more intuitive for humans to use<ref name="W3C, CSS Color, HWB" >{{Cite web

'''W''' and '''B''' stand for '''Whiteness''' and '''Blackness''' respectively and range from 0–100% (or 0–1). The mental model is that the user can pick a main hue and then “mix” it with white and/or black to produce the desired color.<ref name="Smith" >{{cite journal

HWB came to prominence in 2014 following its use in the [[CSS]] Level 4 Color Module.<ref name="W3C, CSS Color, HWB" />

==Converting to and from HSV==
HWB is very closely related to [[HSL and HSV|HSV]], and therefore the conversion formulas are fairly simple. <ref name="Smith" /> Before conversion, if the sum of W and B is greater than 1, both W and B must be scaled back proportionally to make the sum 1.
