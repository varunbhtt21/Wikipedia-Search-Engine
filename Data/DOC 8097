Title : Pollen beetle
Text : '''Pollen beetle''' is an informal term for any species of beetle associated intimately with suitably pollen-rich species of flowers. Typically such a beetle is adapted to the pollen as a major part of its diet. Species in at least sixteen families of the order [[Coleoptera]] could be counted as pollen beetles,<ref>McCall, Andrew C & Irwin, Rebecca E. Florivory: the intersection of pollination and Herbivory. Ecology Letters, (2006) 9: 1351–1365 doi: 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00975.x</ref><ref name="MM">{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/classes/ento596c/topic/session3.html|title=Pollen Use in Insects|author=|date=|website=ag.arizona.edu|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref> and "pollen beetle" also is a [[common name]] for some such species.

==Pollen feeding==
Many insects of small to modest size benefit from feeding on pollen of suitable plants; pollen tends to be rich in protein, plentiful in season and easily available. Many plants, such as some members of the [[Araceae]] and [[Zamiaceae]], produce large amounts of nutritious pollen, while producing little or no nectar. The pollen of such plants attracts and nourishes specialist pollen feeders that perform pollination, and many of those pollen feeders are beetles. In accessing the pollen of such plants, many pollen-feeding insects form mutually beneficial ecological relationships. Others damage the flowers however, reducing seed set, and harming the crop rather than benefiting it.

The nutritious Pollen from plants adapted to such pollinators contrasts with the also copious pollen from specialist [[Anemophily|anemophilous plants]]. Strict anemophiles commonly produce pollen that is low in nutritive value, since it is not adapted to attract or feed pollinators. Furthermore, as an adaptation to being borne effectively by the wind, anemophilous pollen must be very light.

More specifically than speaking loosely of "pollen beetles" as a [[common name]] the expression is the common name for certain species of beetle in particular, mainly a few members of the families [[Melyridae]], [[Nitidulidae]] and [[Oedemeridae]]. However, there are many others that, though not commonly called "pollen beetles", do feed avidly on pollen, including species in the following:<ref name="MM"/>

==Pollen beetles in the Melyridae==
[[File:Astylus atromaculatus Coetze4.jpg|thumb|''[[Astylus atromaculatus]]'']]
Among the [[Melyridae]] the most prominent example of a species commonly referred to as a pollen beetle is ''[[Astylus atromaculatus]]''. It feeds particularly on the large amounts of pollen produced by members of the grass family [[Poaceae]], and related wind-pollinated families such as the [[Cyperaceae]]. It does however also visit many other flowers, such as members of the [[Asteraceae]]. It is not clear whether it causes more harm to crops by eating pollen and young tissues than it does good by promoting pollination.

Another species of "pollen beetle" in the family Melyridae is ''[[Dicranolaius bellulus]]''. It is more of a predator than say, ''[[Astylus]]'' species, and is accordingly valued as an agent in pest management programs, but pollen is a major part of its diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_beetles/RedAndBlueBeetle.htm|title=Red and Blue Beetle, Pollen Beetle - Dicranolaius bellulus|first=Peter|last=Chew|date=|website=www.brisbaneinsects.com|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.padil.gov.au/maf-border/pest/main/140370|title=Red and Blue Pollen Beetle|author=|date=|website=www.padil.gov.au|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref>

==Pollen beetles in the Nitidulidae==
[[File:Meligethes.aeneus.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|''[[Meligethes aeneus]]'']]
Several members of the [[Nitidulidae]] are similarly referred to as pollen beetles. In particular, practically all the species in the genus ''[[Meligethes]]'' are called pollen beetles. Of these the most notorious is probably the one now accepted as being properly called [[Brassicogethes aeneus|''Meligethes aeneus''/''Brassicogethes aeneus'']].  It is called the "Brassica pollen beetle", "Rape pollen beetle" and similar names, because it first became prominent as a pest of such crops in the first quarter of the 20th century.<ref name="England1923">{{cite book|author=Kirton agricultural institute, Lincolnshire, England|title=Annual Report ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yu1HAAAAYAAJ|year=1923|publisher="Guardian" printing works}}</ref>

==Pollen beetles in the Oedemeridae==

Many species in the family [[Oedemeridae]] are similarly called "pollen beetles". For example, the Southern Pollen Beetle in the United States is ''[[Oxycopis notoxoides]]'').<ref name="Jr.2000">{{cite book|author=Ross H.
