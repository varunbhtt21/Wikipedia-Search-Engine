The investigation into the murder of the German<ref>[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/niece-of-german-ira-victim-to-speak-at-stormont-1-6620905 "Niece of German IRA victim to speak at Stormont"], ''[[News Letter]]'', 08 March 2015. Retrieved on 23 November 2016.</ref> citizen was reopened in March 2015. The German Federal Attorney may not regard the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]] as relevant in terms of favourable terms, e.g., reduced prison terms for PIRA members, etc. The murder of Hazell, a German citizen, took place in Germany and the country is not bound by the Agreement between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==Background==
Heidi Hazell was born in [[Worpswede]], [[West Germany]], as Heidi Schnaars.{{cn|date=June 2019}} In 1986, she married a [[British Armed Forces|British soldier]] stationed in the country.{{cn|date=June 2019}} On 7 September 1989, in [[Unna]] near [[Dortmund]], Hazell was sitting in the family car at her home. She was approached by a member of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) in British Army battle dress, who opened fire with a [[Kalashnikov rifle|Kalashnikov]] automatic weapon, shooting her over a dozen times. The gunman got into a car driven by another person and drove away.<ref>[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/British-Soldier-s-Wife-Killed-in-Attack-Claimed-by-IRA/id-93ef5e3a4962253bd19117ba192b359f "British Soldier's wife killed in attack claimed by IRA"], ''[[AP News]]'', 8 September 1989. Retrieved on 09 April 2015.</ref>

[[Prime Minster of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] branded the murder of Hazell as "evil and cowardly". Speaking during a visit to [[Forres Academy]], she said: "Let this message get across: [[Terrorist]]s don't hesitate to attack wives and children, people who are totally innocent. That shows the evil nature of the work they do." The [[Generalbundesanwalt]] investigated against five individuals, known to be involved in [[Terrorism in Germany|terrorist]] activity, amongst which was [[Dessie Grew]]. The investigation against Grew was closed upon his death on 9 October 1990. It was the second IRA attack in West Germany that week, a previous one resulting in two British soldiers shot near [[Münster]].{{cn|date=June 2019}}

In a statement released in [[Dublin]] the following day, the IRA said:
<blockquote>An IRA [[Active Service Unit]] carried out last night's shooting in West Germany. The woman killed was believed to have been a member of the [[British Crown Forces]] [[garrison]]ed in Dortmund. It has now emerged that she was the German wife of a British Army staff [[sergeant]]. As we intend continuing our campaign until the British Army withdraws from Ireland, the outcome of last night's attack reinforces a warning we gave on Aug. 2, 1988, for civilians to stay well clear of British military personnel. This warning applies to the use of vehicles personally belonging to British soldiers and all modes of military transport.</blockquote>

[[Sinn Féin]] President [[Gerry Adams]] responded to civilians that had been recently killed by the IRA, such as Hazell, husband and wife James and Ellen Sefton, Islania Niurati the six-month-old child of a British soldier in Germany, and teenager Terry Love, saying:
<blockquote>There can be no doubt where Sinn Fein stands on actions which lead to the deaths of civilians or injuries to civilians. I don't want to see anyone killed, much less a 19-year-old soldier, an Australian citizen or an Irish citizens, but there is a conflict. There is a war going on. People join armies to fight.</blockquote>

==Campaign of Melanie Anan==
Melanie Anan, the niece of Hazell, started campaigning for justice, she inquired with witnesses and spoke to the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]. On 9 March 2015, she spoke at the European Day for Victims of Terrorism at [[Stormont Parliament]].<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/niece-cries-out-for-justice-for-german-woman-killed-by-ira-31050394.html "Niece cries out for justice for German woman killed by IRA"], ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 9 March 2015.

On 16 March 2015, Anan wrote an open letter to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], which was subsequently published by the [[Belfast Telegraph]]. Turning to the President's relationship with Sinn Fein, Anan urged Obama to distance himself. "As we have been doing our research and inquiries as a family, we came across a picture of you and [[Gerry Adams]]; centered in the picture, [[Rita O'Hare]], a wanted woman in [[Northern Ireland]], as she shot a soldier in Northern Ireland," she wrote.<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/niece-of-german-ira-victim-pleads-with-barack-obama-to-keep-distance-from-sinn-fein-31075260.html "Niece of German IRA victim pleads with Barack Obama to keep distance from Sinn Fein"], ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 18 March 2015.
