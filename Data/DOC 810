The result was    '''delete'''. Few of those arguing ''keep'' make reference to the presence of independent sources, and those arguing ''delete'' state that such sources are few and do not address the subject directly in enough detail to provide material upon which to base the article. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">-- [[User:Trevj|Trevj]]</span> ([[User talk:Trevj#top|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Trevj|contribs]]) 19:16, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

I couldn't find any articles or stories that were independent and reliable about the subject in question on Google News and Google. Therefore it fails [[WP:NWEB]] and thus is elligible for deletion.

:'''Keep''' There are references from ''Eurogamer'', ''Edge'', ''Joystiq'', ''Radio Times'', ''Metro'' etc - notability has definitely been asserted through widespread coverage in major publications. Also, I found every one of these via Google and Google News, so unsure why you are apparently having problems.

::The subject only got ''mentions'' in ''Eurogamer'', ''Edge'', ''Joystiq'', ''Radio Times'', ''Metro'', etc. Mentions are most often not enough to assert notability, as per first bullet point of [[WP:GNG]]. I've found nothing in Google News searching '''Daniel Hardcastle -wikipedia''' or '''NerdCubed -wikipedia''', so I'm not really sure what you're talking about there. I appreciate your vote.

*'''Delete''' Sources only mention Hardcastle in passing. ''Joystiq'' has one sentence, which mentions someone describing him as a "big YouTuber", which isn't enough of a claim of notability; ''Radio Times'' is an article about an interview he did with Steven Moffatt, and says nothing about Hardcastle - not everyone who interviews a famous person is themselves famous; ''Edge'' has one sentence, describing him as a "YouTube personality", which again isn't a significant enough claim to notability. Clearly, he has some kind of following on YouTube, but not enough for reliable sources to discuss his work in depth, and not enough to meet our notability criteria.

*'''Keep'''. Nice amount of source coverage for this comedian. &mdash; '''[[User:Cirt|Cirt]]''' ([[User talk:Cirt|talk]]) 16:13, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Not enough secondary sources to pass [[WP:N]] ''comfortably'', but the article meets other parts of WP:N well enough to grant a pass. [[User:SpeedyAstro|SpeedyAstro]] ([[User talk:SpeedyAstro|talk]]) 06:38, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

::: WP:N "There is no fixed number of sources required since sources vary in quality and depth of coverage, but multiple sources are generally expected." There are enough sources that just give a mention to give some information, (what is there to give? You can learn a lot about this person from his own fan following and channel, so secondary sources don't really have to analyze it) but not enough high-depth sources. Unless something happens, this page may stay a permanent stub, but, in my opinion, it is notable. Barely. [[User:SpeedyAstro|SpeedyAstro]] ([[User talk:SpeedyAstro|talk]]) 17:29, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  There are a lot of sources, yes, but most of them aren't about him and can't reasonably be used to build more information into the article.

*'''Keep'''. Daniel has a large following on YouTube spanning several million users. I think this in itself grants him notability. [[Special:Contributions/217.23.235.99|217.23.235.99]] ([[User talk:217.23.235.99|talk]]) 15:01, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. As the user just above me said, this page is purely promotional and is only gaining him notability, not informing users. Most of the sources are straight from Hardcastle himself.

*'''Keep''' As you mentioned above many of the sources are from Hardcastle, who better to give information about a man than the man himself.
*:: '''Delete.''' That is precisely the reason why this article is being considered for deletion - there need to be reliable third-party sources. Dan can say whatever he wants about himself, but that doesn't mean it's true. There needs to be confirmation from sources other than the subject themselves. Xomm 22:24, 5 May 2014 (UTC) 
* It should be noted that this deletion consideration vote has been linked<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/nerdcubed/comments/24sw3u/dans_wikipedia_entry_is_being_deleted_hes_not/</ref> on Dan's official subreddit today, so there may be a new voters coming in who are very biased. Just thought I would warn everyone. I'm not voting nor using my normal account because I know my vote would be biased.

*'''Delete'''. I do feel biased towards keeping this article, but at the same time, the only sources that are available are ones that come from Dan himself or ones that barely mention him. Unless this can be addressed, this article should be deleted.
*'''Keep'''. My POV is biased, but the article seems well-written and sourced properly. Dan has 1.6 million subscribers which to me speaks of notability for itself. [[User:Amunak|Amunak]] ([[User talk:Amunak|talk]]) 22:49, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. There are not enough third party sources with enough information for people to educate themselves about Daniel Hardcastle other than his own videos. If all you need for an article is your own videos as a source, anyone could make an article about themselves.

*'''Keep'''. Compare the article to the likes of Total Biscuit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Biscuit among others who are of a similar field. While it may be shorter or not as detailed it could be improved or updated with various content.
*'''Delete''' as no indication of notability. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 23:43, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Dan has had a pretty big impact in the gaming world, influencing the futures of quite a few indie games, for example. I think that's worth some notability. Also, it's not as if this page is just a page about some random guy. Dan has a rather huge following of over one and a half million people, with over 750 videos uploaded. If this online celebrity isn't worthy of his own page, are any of them? [[User:Rakki9999111|Rakki9999111]] ([[User talk:Rakki9999111|talk]]) 07:26, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::His popularity isn't the issue. The problem is verifying information about him.

*'''Neutral''' Eventhough I am an avid supporter and subscriber to nerdcubed, it can not be overlooked, that the lack of anything substantial makes him appear as non notable. As much as the fan base might want a page on wikipedia for him, this is not the venue for such articles if they do not fit what Wikipedia requires. If you search for nerdcubed under news on google, nothing, nothing, returns. If you search for him by name, very little returns and nothing indicating notability. That said, video's such as [[The_Crazy_Nastyass_Honey_Badger]] have a page and even the creator when he doesn't even have over 200k subscribers or anything notable apart from a viral video that is less then amazing. I have seen many articles on wikipedia in my time that are significantly less notable than [[Daniel_Hardcastle]] and as such, we as a community, can not in good faith delete this article because of a lack of news articles. There were a lack of news articles about the holocaust during WWII, as such, would this community have said "Because there are no news articles showing notability, the holocaust will not have an article?? I know this is a bit of an extreme example, but there is NO compelling reason to have the article deleted. I suggest that instead of deletion, we give the community time to come up with a more valid group of sources and other information that will point at notability. I purpose a template and give the community 30 days to make it suitable to Wikipedia standards. I will also note, that some of the reason that there is a lack of articles is due to Dan  not being very socially involved. He is slightly reclusive and as such, because he has not agreed to interviews or the like, we can not condemn this article because the subject in question, doesn't like being in the center of attention. [[User:Jab843|Jab843]] ([[User talk:Jab843|talk]]) 02:45, 7 May 2014 (UTC). In response to there being a lack of articles, under Wikipedia guidelines, notable is not the same as famous, I do not see this article going against Wikipedia guidlines.

*'''Delete'''. Yikes, what a mess.

The article would need actual coverage of the subject himself and not a series of mentions of the notable guests he has had or what things surrounding him have gone on to do.
