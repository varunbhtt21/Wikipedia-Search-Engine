A high school basketball player who is in consideration for college basketball, does not yet fit as of now. Too soon it seems if ever. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 19:39, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Delete''' : Probably too soon, recreate when he's a senior. [[User:Soxrock24|SOXROX]] ([[User talk:Soxrock24|talk]]) 05:01, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per substantial coverage in reliable independent sources already in cited in article and elsewhere. Passes the "GNG". [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:26, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I'm skeptical that a high school player has received ''substantial'' coverage in ''national'' reliable sources.  Please find and add them to the article before I'll be convinced. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 21:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::The articles already cited cover the subject subsantially and are from the Sydney Morning Herald and NBC Sports. We should delete is because you refuse to believe there is coverage? Lame. This is America, a 7-foot high school player who is a refugee and a tauted recruit is highly likely to be notable. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:38, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
::[http://si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1210201/index.htm Three page story from Sports Illustrated], [http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20140111/SPORTS11/301110076/ Story in the Courier-Journal] and at [http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/172416/thon-maker ESPN] where he's ranked #1 as a recruit in several categories. Obviously there is an abundance of substantial coverage so there is no policy based argument to be made for deletion. It's just "I don't like it". Which is unfortunate. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:42, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''-yeah he does sound notable-but under the rules he is not yet a pro or in college. (and as far as we know he might not even become a player, he might want to quit and do something else), could be a good up coming article though. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:58, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' - if he's notable, he's notable.  Doesn't matter if he isn't in college yet. [[User:Rikster2|Rikster2]] ([[User talk:Rikster2|talk]]) 13:56, 4 May 2014 (UTC)

'''Keep''' - meets GNG demonstrated by reliable sources put forth by [[User:Candleabracadabra]]. [[User:Rikster2|Rikster2]] ([[User talk:Rikster2|talk]]) 13:56, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Passes GNG, as stated above, whether or not he ever plays basketball beyond high school. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 22:36, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
:I'm still waiting for better, or even any more, sources. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 17:41, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::And the goal is to specifically convince you ... why?  Have you looked for sources yourself or are you just waiting for others to bring you a certain type of rock to be named later? The sources so far are specific articles about the player (not just as part of a team) from an independent newspaper and a national sports magazine.  There are sources currently on the article from the Sydney Morning Herald and NBCSports.com (again, about the player specifically).  [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/basketball/boomers-coach-excited-by-giant-16yearold-prospect-thon-maker/story-fni2u9cl-1226881451493 Here is an article from the Melbourne Herald-Sun].  [http://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/article.cfm?ID=38184&back=archives Here is another from the Martinsville Bulletin], another independent newspaper.  [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-06-27/sports/bal-insidemdsports-5star-center-thon-maker-takes-notice-of-terps-alex-len-20130626_1_maryland-recruiting-feature-edward-smith-terps Here is one from the Baltimore Sun]. [[User:Rikster2|Rikster2]] ([[User talk:Rikster2|talk]]) 20:16, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
:::By the way, "national" sources are not a requirement of [[WP:GNG]].  Though Maker dies have some of these in the SI and NBC Sports articles already provided. [[User:Rikster2|Rikster2]] ([[User talk:Rikster2|talk]]) 21:41, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
