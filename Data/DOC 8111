Title : I'll Close My Eyes (song)
Text : '''I'll Close My Eyes''' is a song with words and music originally written by the English songwriter and bandleader [[Billy Reid (British songwriter)|Billy Reid]] and published in 1945.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forties|publisher=International Music Publications Ltd|pages=43|author=Billy Reid|authorlink=I'll Close My Eyes (sheet music)}}</ref>  It is usually performed in a later version with different words by the American songwriter [[Buddy Kaye]] to Reid's original music. It has become a [[jazz]] standard.

==Original version==
The original version of the song had both music and lyrics written by [[Billy Reid (British songwriter)|Billy Reid]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forties|publisher=International Music Publications Ltd|pages=43|author=Billy Reid|authorlink=I'll Close My Eyes (sheet music)}}</ref>

In this original version, the song is a song of regret, with a verse introducing the theme in words which include:  ''"Love was mine, you gave me a chance; But my heart was not content and I lost my romance.."''  The main song refrain then begins (as it does in the later version) ''"I'll close my eyes"'' but continues ''"and make believe it's you"''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forties|publisher=International Music Publications Ltd|pages=43|author=Billy Reid|authorlink=I'll Close My Eyes (sheet music)}}</ref>  The song then continues on the theme that the singer has foolishly lost his love and can now only close his eyes and imagine her in his loneliness.

It was recorded with the original Billy Reid words by the English singer [[Dorothy Squires]], who had a close association with Billy Reid.<ref>{{cite web|last=Squires|first=Dorothy|title=I'll Close My Eyes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuFCregHfo|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

==Version with lyrics by Buddy Kaye==

Soon after its release, new words were written for the Billy Reid tune by the American songwriter [[Buddy Kaye]].<ref>{{cite web|title=I'll Close My Eyes (lyrics, both versions)|url=http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/i/illclosemyeyes.shtml|work=International Lyrics Playground|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

The new words make the song more upbeat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=See e.g. the performance of the new lyrics by the Sliding Hammers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3cdVL8E3Ns|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=2008}}</ref>  The initial phrase of the song remains ''"I'll close my eyes"'' but now it continues ''"...to everyone but you"''.  The song then continues on the theme that the singer will always be faithful, will ''"lock my heart to any other caress"'' and will close his eyes to see his love ''"through the years"'' in ''"those moments when we're apart"''.<ref>{{cite web|title=I'll Close My Eyes (lyrics, both versions)|url=http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/i/illclosemyeyes.shtml|work=International Lyrics Playground|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>  It thus becomes, not a song of loss, but a commitment to fidelity in a relationship which is expected to last.

In this form, it was taken up by a number of singers.  It was broadcast by [[Frances Langford]] with the new words as early as 1947, in a Maxwell House Radio Show.<ref>{{cite web|last=Langford|first=Frances|title=I'll Close My Eyes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HlAYfEYc7I|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

==Gender neutrality==
The words in both versions of the song are gender neutral, written in the first person ("I") and addressed to an unnamed love ("You").<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forties|publisher=International Music Publications Ltd|pages=43|author=Billy Reid|authorlink=I'll Close My Eyes (sheet music)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=I'll Close My Eyes (lyrics, both versions)|url=http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/i/illclosemyeyes.shtml|work=International Lyrics Playground|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

The song has been sung both by men and women.

==Jazz standard==
Like other jazz songs, the song has been used as a theme in purely instrumental performances and versions by a number of jazz performers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Blue|title=Trumpet version from "Blue's Moods"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Oh-Dl-KbF0|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>
