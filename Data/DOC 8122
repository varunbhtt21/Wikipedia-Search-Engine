'''Jaysh al-Sham''' ({{lang-ar|جيش الشام}}, "Army of the [[Levant]]") is a rebel group that was active during the [[Syrian Civil War]].<ref name=Carnegie>{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/syriaincrisis/?fa=55334|title=Politics of the Islamic Front, Part 6: Stagnation?|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|date=14 April 2014|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> The group began when the [[Suqour al-Sham]] brigade called Suyouf al-Haq split from its parent organization because it did not want to participate in the [[Inter-rebel conflict during the Syrian Civil War|fighting]] between Suqour al-Sham and the [[Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS).<ref name=Carnegie/>

In July 2014, the [[Liwa Dawud]] unit defected from Jaysh al-Sham to ISIS,  bringing with them 1000 men and 10 tanks. Jaysh al-Sham claimed that it had expelled them.<ref name=McClatchy>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/07/08/6542074/1000-syrian-rebels-defect-to-islamic.html|title=1,000 Syrian rebels defect to Islamic State in sign it’s still strengthening|publisher=McClatchy News Service|date=8 July 2014|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> The group was disbanded on 28 July 2014, giving the remaining affiliated groups the option to join other groups.<ref name="disbanding"/>
