The result was  '''snow close'''. This is just too soon for an article. When the editor gets a new screen name I'm willing to userfy this, although it will be important that they see assistance from someone at the film WikiProject to help with concerns of [[WP:COI]] and general concerns of notability.

Too soon, not even close to being filmed and not a major film at all. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 19:53, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' The article is unsourced and somewhat promotional in tone, and a quick search shows no sign that the film has commenced principal photography, which is the minimum requirement of [[WP:MOVIE]]. We aren't a [[WP:CRYSTALBALL|crystal ball]], we can have an article about this film if it proves to be notable.

*'''Delete''' per being [[WP:NYF|WAY TOO SOON]]. Even the unsourced article tells us its in pre-production and currently in script-writing phase. The article ''should'' be saying "will be" not "is". Once completed and released (if ever) and  receiving the requisite coverage, this ''might'' merit an article... but not yet.  [[WP:SPECULATION|Policy]] tells us that future events be at somehow sourcable. This is not. Send the  [[User:DicePictures|author]] to [[WP:NF]], [[WP:COI]] and [[WP:PRIMER]] once he has a new username.
