==Textiles==
Amtek was established as a small {{convert|1|acre|adj=on}} factory in Ajman in 1995. In the early years, most of the products sold in the shop was for apparel fabrics. As the time went by, consumption of apparel fabrics dwindled down as the number of sewing machines usage at households were decreased and parallel to economical growth, demand for off-the-rack products were increased. Due to these reasons, by 1997 most of the collections sold in the shop consisted of drapery fabrics. In 1999, the wholesale store was opened in order to sell in bulk to retailers. In the same year, the company participated in the inaugural Evteks Exhibition.

In 2000, the export business gathered speed with the opening of the Laleli store. 

The companyâ€™s head office is still located in Ajman where most of the activities are carried out. <ref>http://www.amtek.ae</ref>
