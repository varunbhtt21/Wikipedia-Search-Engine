Non-notable local musician.  I can find very little about him in reliable sources.  Almost everything is primary promotional sources with an occasional bit of coverage by local small newspapers and other local media.

::Please explain how this in particular is a reliable source that establishes notability [http://robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=rick+berlin].  I think your sources range from marginal at best, to downright comically short. We have a blog, a local newspaper calander of events, a very short article on a local newspapers website, and I'm not even sure what robertchristgau.com is.

:::@[[User:Ridernyc]]: The article [[Robert Christgau]] explains who he is.[[User:Sparklism| — sparklism]] <sup><small>''[[User_talk:Sparklism| hey!]]''</small></sup> 11:07, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Yes, the existence of Christgau reviews is probably the most notable source in that bunch. [[User:Mrmctorso|Mrmctorso]] ([[User talk:Mrmctorso|talk]]) 15:55, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Yes but when checking the link provided all I see are a few listing of reviews, no reviews.  Yes it appears he war reviewed by a notable reviewer, in some notable publications but really all we have are a few listings.  We are still way short of the GNG.
