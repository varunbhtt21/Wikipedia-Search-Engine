*<s>Keep, or at least Merge into [[List of Internet phenomena]]: This could easily be condensed into 2-3 sentences and added there, but then you'd lose a lot of the information that's encyclopedia-worthy here. I unfortunately can't check the sources due to the internet censorship here, but I know that at least the MTV one would be [[WP:RS]].

:*{{ping|Supernerd11}} Actually after a view of the one reliable source (the MTV one), it does not mention this song at all. '''[[User:STATicVapor|STATic]] <small>[[User talk:STATicVapor|<span style="vertical-align:super;">message me!</span>]]</small>''' 20:14, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::*[[User:STATicVapor|STATic]]: Alright, in that case, I'm changing my !vote to '''Merge''' as previously mentioned because of [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/throw-that-boy-pssy_n_5035214.html this source] and [http://www.thegailygrind.com/2014/03/19/gay-black-rapper-debuts-throw-boy-pussy-music-video/ this one].

*'''Keep'''. The [[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] sources are particularly strong. Those, plus all the gay coverage and the Huffington Post, push this one over the notability line for me. While it might or might not fail WP:NSONG, surely it passes WP:GNG? Anyways there's my 2¢. [[User:Perfect for you|Perfect for you]] ([[User talk:Perfect for you|talk]]) 16:46, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:* There is no BET source and Huffington Post is tabloidish in nature so it does not really add that much notability, but you are entitled to your opinion.

Here is the Ebony magazine write-up: http://www.ebony.com/news-views/the-weekly-read-throw-that-boyoh-my-042 [[User:Perfect for you|Perfect for you]] ([[User talk:Perfect for you|talk]]) 00:32, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

After reading [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/darnell-l-moore/tongues-untied-is-fly-you_1_b_5064751.html the Huffington Post source] more thoroughly, the assertion that the piece is "tabloidish" is hard to swallow. The HuffPo piece is a conversation between:
*Bryson Rose, a LGBTQIA youth activist
*[[Darnell L. Moore]], a writer and activist
*[[Wade Davis (American football)|Wade Davis]], a formerly closeted athlete, currently a gay activist
*Preston Mitchum, an LGBT policy analyst for [[Center for American Progress]]. To quote the CfAP website: "Preston has received a LL.M. in Law and Government from American University Washington College of Law. He also holds a J.D. from North Carolina Central University School of Law, and a B.A. in Political Science from Kent State University."

These are serious gay black voices, and that they got together to discuss whether this song is "revolutionary" is quite remarkable. Not lurid, not sensational, and certainly not "tabloidish". [[User:Perfect for you|Perfect for you]] ([[User talk:Perfect for you|talk]]) 01:49, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - [[WP:NSONGS]] appears to be a vague list of guidelines that helps establish credibility/notability for recordings belonging to more "traditional" artists. This poses an issue with the recent wave of independent, internet-based artists whose songs may not meet WP:NSONGS, but are nevertheless notable enough for their own pages. For instance, there is no denying the notability of Rebecca Black's infamous [[Friday (Rebecca Black song)|Friday]], yet it doesn't appear to meet WP:NSONGS. Regardless, [[Wikipedia:NSONGS#Recordings|an earlier section on WP:Notability (music)]] establishes that the NSONGS section isn't the final authority on the notability of a single song. I believe the references, especially BET and Huffpo, provide plenty notability for this song to warrant an article. It also might be a good idea to, as per what I mentioned earlier, reevaluate the posted criteria for musical notability.
