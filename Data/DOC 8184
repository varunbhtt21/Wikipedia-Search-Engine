No independent sources and no assertion of notability for what seems to be a [[WP:MILL|run-of-the-mill]] documentary. [[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 20:19, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' as per nom - TV programme with no indication of any notability. -[[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 20:36, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. I was going to suggest a redirect to [[List_of_BBC_children%27s_television_programmes#M]], but I'm not entirely sure that this would really merit an entry since it's a limited documentary series. Cute pups, though. [[User:Tokyogirl79|Tokyogirl79]][[user talk:Tokyogirl79|'''<span style='color: #19197;background-color: #FFFFFF;'>  (｡◕‿◕｡)</span>''']]  07:38, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
