:*[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] The article is new and long enough with an interesting hook. The latter is also sourced by inline references in the article. But I'm having two problems here. First of all: The image is very hard to identify at the small preview resolution. I suggest you replace it with a larger portrait, e.g. the [[:File:Heinrich Schutz by Rembrandt.jpg|one by Rembrandt]]. The next thing is a phrase in the hook. As with anything involving personal judgment and taste we shouldn't claim that it contains music of a certain quality. I'd be more happy if you wrote that the Cantiones sacrae have been described as happy, intense, etc. [[User:De728631|De728631]] ([[User talk:De728631|talk]]) 21:01, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::* The image: can't use Rembrandt, as it probably doesn't show Schütz, and a clause such as "possibly pictured but rather not" seems awkward. Better no image, or a crop, or this which shows the style of the period rather than the person's face (even looking closer you don't see much). I'll think about the hook, planning to expand the article, - I just didn't want to miss nominating. Approach:
::: '''ALT1''': ... that parts of '''''[[Cantiones sacrae (Schütz)|Cantiones sacrae]]''''', 40 choral pieces composed during the [[Thirty Years' War]] by [[Heinrich Schütz]] ''(pictured)'', have been described as intensely expressive, others as happy? --[[User:Gerda Arendt|Gerda Arendt]] ([[User talk:Gerda Arendt|talk]]) 22:07, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::::*Yes, that's it. [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] '''ALT1''' is good to go. [[User:De728631|De728631]] ([[User talk:De728631|talk]]) 23:25, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
