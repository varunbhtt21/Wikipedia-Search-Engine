Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was    '''no consensus'''. I see three options: delete, merge, or keep. Without any substantial discussion, I see no other outcome than 'no consensus'. A [[WP:MERGE|merge]] discussion can continue at the appropriate talk page. ([[Wikipedia:non-admin closure|non-admin closure]]) [[User:Mz7|Mz7]] ([[User talk:Mz7|talk]]) 18:47, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

Non-notable Band. I can find very little about them in reliable sources. Almost everything is primary promotional sources. Their main claim to notability seems to that they released a non-charting album on Epic, and they opened for a few notable acts. Their all music bio is mostly about their producer and other famous people he worked with. [[User:Ridernyc|Ridernyc]] ([[User talk:Ridernyc|talk]]) 20:27, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Orchestra Luna was a controversial and arguably influential entity in the pre-internet world, and it would be unfortunate if we allowed this content to be removed.  It's hard to produce on-line sources, but Allmusic has a substantial writeup for their one album [http://www.allmusic.com/album/orchestra-luna-mw0000758864] (I disagree with the nominator's characterization of this article); and here's a substantial (and critical) 1975 piece in the ''[[Village Voice]]''. [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=69NHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Q4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6038%2C2894929]  As recounted in a 1994 ''Voice'' article, [[Glenn Branca]] credited Orchestra Luna as the true inspiration for [[Talking Heads]].
