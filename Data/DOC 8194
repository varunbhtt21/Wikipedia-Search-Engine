same band as Orchestral Luna.

Non-notable Band. I can find very little about them in reliable sources. Almost everything is primary promotional sources. Their main claim to notability seems to that they released a non-charting album on Epic, and they opened for a few notable acts. Their all music bio is mostly about their producer and other famous people he worked with. [[User:Ridernyc|Ridernyc]] ([[User talk:Ridernyc|talk]]) 20:29, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
