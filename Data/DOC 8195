As a doctor, Navarro obtained his specialty in obstetrics and gynecology in 1980, rising through the ranks of the [[ISSSTE]] hospital system. Between 1981 and 1986, he was the director of the Aquiles Calles Ramírez General Hospital in Tepic, which is part of the ISSSTE system.{{r|sil}} Additionally, he was a professor at the [[Universidad Autónoma de Nayarit]] between 1982 and 1996, heading the Joaquín Herrera School of Nursing.{{r|sil}} Between 1986 and 1989, he represented the ISSSTE in Tepic, and he entered the state government proper in 1989, first as a director of medical services and finally, between 1996 and 1997, as the state secretariat of health.{{r|sil}}

===First legislative stint===
In 1997, Navarro was elected a federal deputy for the first time, beginning a twelve-year uninterrupted run in Congress.
