Too soon-from what I can tell has not started film either. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 20:30, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*I'm sorry, but a better reason for deleting this article would be nice. A fair amount of independent articles about this film, a couple even being cited here, do exist. The info should be included somewhere.

*'''Redirect''' to [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]. Have been reading stories about this film long since Bhansali made ''[[Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam]]'' in 1999.[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news-interviews/Bajirao-Mastani-Sanjay-Leela-Bhansali-may-start-his-dream-project-with-Deepika-and-Katrina/articleshow/19524652.cms ref] 14 years and i guess every actor must have been rumoured to have been cast in this film. Only constant has been Bhansali and given his style of work there is no guarantee it might happen even now. Although 14 years of news-making can flesh out a good length of article, that all would be trivial. If someone wishes, they might work on it in their own userspace. §§[[User:Dharmadhyaksha|<font color = "red" >Dharmadhyaksha</font>]]§§ {[[User talk:Dharmadhyaksha|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/Dharmadhyaksha|C]]} 18:57, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::Might be a good idea for a redirect then-its like how long tons of movies are in production-Benjamin Button was for a while. So was Tangled! [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 19:12, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Per [[WP:BEFORE]], existing [[WP:GNG|coverage speaking about production]] might have been a decent reason to do pro-active redirect rather than a deletion nomination. But now we look further for more coverage that could have this meet [[WP:NFF|WP:NFF (paragraph 3)]] and have it [[WP:FFCLARIFY|qualify]] for an article.
