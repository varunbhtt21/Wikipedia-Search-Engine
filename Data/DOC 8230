'''''Tulip Fever''''' is a 2017 [[List of historical period drama films and series|historical]] [[romantic drama]] film directed by [[Justin Chadwick]] and written by [[Deborah Moggach]] and [[Tom Stoppard]], adapted from Moggach's novel of the same name. It stars [[Alicia Vikander]], [[Dane DeHaan]], [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]], [[Holliday Grainger]], [[Tom Hollander]], [[Matthew Morrison]], [[Kevin McKidd]], [[Douglas Hodge]], [[Joanna Scanlan]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Judi Dench]], and [[Christoph Waltz]] . The plot follows a [[Tulip mania|17th-century]] painter in [[Amsterdam]] who falls in love with a married woman whose portrait he has been commissioned to paint.

Filmed in the summer of 2014, ''Tulip Fever'' was delayed numerous times before finally being released in the United States on September 1, 2017 by [[The Weinstein Company]]. It grossed $8 million worldwide against its $25 million budget.

==Plot==
Set in the Netherlands in the 17th century, during the period of the [[tulip mania]], Sophia, an orphan, is betrothed to the elderly Cornelis. In return for the marriage, her sisters are able to travel to New Amsterdam (New York) in the new world, where they have an aunt awaiting them.

Three years later, Sophia is unhappy in the marriage, since Cornelis seems to be concerned only with conceiving an heir, to no avail thus far. Cornelis believes this to have something to do with a mistake he made in the past, with his previous wife: she miscarried their first child and when Cornelis asked the doctor to save the second child over the wife, he feels that God punished him by taking both his wife and his child away.

Cornelis decides to hire a painter, so that he could at least be remembered as having had a beautiful young wife, should he have no heir to continue his legacy. Sophia agrees, but as soon as the young painter Jan arrives to paint the couple, he and Sophia fall in love. Jan sends a note to Sophia, asking her to send him a vase with tulips. She shows up at his door with the tulips, and they consummate their love.

Meanwhile, Sophia's friend, the housemaid Maria, is in a courtship  with the neighborhood fishmonger, Willem. Willem is speculating in the tulip market, and is doing quite well - expecting to be independently prosperous and able to marry Maria, he even sells his business to another fishmonger. One day, Sophia borrows Maria's cloak and heads to a rendezvous with Jan. Willem, seeing Sophia in the cloak, mistakes her for Maria, and follows her to her rendezvous. Crushed by what he thinks is Maria's unfaithfulness, he goes to a pub to drown his sorrows. There a prostitute robs him of the large sum of money he has built up on the tulip market. When he tries to retrieve the money, he is beaten up and forcibly inducted into the navy for causing a ruckus.

Jan plots to escape to the new world with Sophia, after having success of his own in the tulip speculation market. He hears that the nuns at St. Ursula (the convent Sophia came from) raise tulips in their gardens. Jan attempts to steal some of the bulbs, but is knocked out by the abbess of St. Ursula. When he regains consciousness, he apologises and the abbess gives him the bulbs Willem had bought before he was thrown into the navy.

Maria realizes that she is pregnant with Willem's child. With Willem gone, the baby will be born out of wedlock. Maria explains her condition to Sophia and threatens to reveal Sophia's affair to Cornelis, if Cornelis were to find out about her pregnancy. Sophia conspires with Maria and decides to pass off the pregnancy as her own. When the baby is born, Sophia will pretend to die in childbirth, so she can leave to be with Jan, and Maria will get to raise the child as her own with Cornelis.

After Maria gives birth to a daughter and Sophia pretends to die, Cornelis is griefstricken at the loss of his wife. Sophia, under her shroud, weeps as she realizes that she has deeply hurt Cornelis with her deceit, but eventually realizes that it is too late to undo what she has done. Ashamed of herself, Sophia runs away and Jan is unable to find her.

Willem, returning after his stint in the navy, goes to see Maria at Cornelis's house. Maria is furious at him at first, but they soon reconcile. Cornelis overhears their loud quarreling and the reveal of the conspiracy between Maria, Sophia, and Jan. Cornelis makes his peace with the truth, and departs for the Indies, where he finds love and makes a family, but only after first leaving the house to Maria, Willem, and the baby girl he loved as his own.

Eight years later, the abbess of St. Ursula visits Jan and views his artwork of Sophia. She praises him for his talent, and commissions him to paint a mural in the church. When Jan looks down from painting the mural, he sees Sophia, who has joined the convent, and they share tender smiles.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 10% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Tulip Fever'' is a lush, handsomely-mounted period piece undone by uninspired dialogue and excessive plotting."<ref>{{cite web|title=''Tulip Fever'' (2017)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tulip_fever|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized average rating to reviews, the film has an average score of 38 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |title=''Tulip Fever'' reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tulip-fever|work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=September 17, 2017}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying, "''Tulip Fever'', which was shot in 2014 but only hitting theaters now after years of recutting, retooling and release-date reshuffling, should have been allowed to die on the vine ... The film just sits there onscreen like a wilting flower with nothing to nourish it."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Travers |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Travers |date=September 1, 2017 |title='Tulip Fever' Review: This D.O.A.

In December 2018, it was released in several cinemas across the UK. It was reviewed by Adam White of [[The Daily Telegraph]], as "handsome yet cripplingly dull Tulip Fever is every bit a throwback to that age of Chocolat and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin," and it suffers from "clumsy post-production work".<ref>{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Adam |title=Tulip Fever review: covered in Harvey Weinstein's grubby fingerprints |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2018/12/07/tulip-fever-review-covered-harvey-weinsteins-grubby-fingerprints/ |accessdate=8 December 2018 |work=The Telegraph |date=7 December 2018}}</ref> It was also the penultimate film to be produced by The Weinstein Company, prior to its closure on 16 July 2018.<ref>{{cite news |title=Weinstein Company files for bankruptcy and frees staff from secrecy orders |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/20/weinstein-company-bankruptcy-releases-employees-ndas |accessdate=5 March 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=20 March 2018}}</ref>
