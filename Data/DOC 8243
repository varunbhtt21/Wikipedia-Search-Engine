|text=Please keep the '''evidence length template''' for your submission updated and correct. (Only arbitrators and clerks may update the template for anyone else's section.) If your section does not yet have an evidence length template, please copy the format from another user's section; the template documentation is [[User:HersfoldArbClerkBot/Length header|here]]. Thank you.}}
