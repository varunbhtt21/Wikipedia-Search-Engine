'''R. Durtnell & Sons''' was an English building company established in 1591 that had been continuously in the same family in [[Brasted]], in the English county of [[Kent]], until 2019 when the firm went out of business. The first building it constructed, [[Poundsbridge Manor]] (also called The Picture House), was completed in 1593, and it was the same firm that restored the house following bomb damage in the Second World War.

Starting in 1591, the firm that became R. Durtnell & Sons Limited had been handed down from father to son as a private company for thirteen generations.<ref name=rdhome>{{cite web|title=R Durtnell & Sons Limited|url=http://durtnell.co.uk/index.html|work=R Durtnell website|publisher=R Durtnell & Sons|accessdate=26 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213095334/http://www.durtnell.co.uk/index.html|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was claimed to be the oldest building firm in Britain.<ref name=bloom>{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Jonty|date=26 October 2012|title=How Britain's oldest builder survived the recession|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20084744|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605093537/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20084744|archivedate=5 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=kb>{{cite web|last=Price|first=Chris|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/oldest-builder-under-the-spotlight-11958/|title=Britain's oldest builder R Durtnell and Sons from Brasted, near Westerham, appears in BBC Four documentary Hidden Histories|work=KentOnline, Kent Business|publisher=KM Group|accessdate=26 April 2014|date=29 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427052232/http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/oldest-builder-under-the-spotlight-11958/|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to [[Dun & Bradstreet]], the business information provider, at the time it ceased trading it was "the third oldest company in the UK still in operation"&nbsp;– there were only two [[List of oldest companies|older companies]] in any sector in Britain with a continuous existence: [[Oxford University Press]] and [[Cambridge University Press]].<ref name=mccooey>{{cite news|last=McCooey|first=Christopher|title=A family business for 400 years|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/baeb5b70-1696-11da-8081-00000e2511c8.html#axzz302HeO5u7|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140426231304/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/baeb5b70-1696-11da-8081-00000e2511c8.html%23axzz302HeO5u7#axzz302HeO5u7|archivedate=26 April 2014|dead-url=yes|newspaper=Financial Times|date=27 August 2005|url-access=subscription}} "The builder, based in Brasted, Kent, is the third oldest company in the UK still in operation, according to Dun & Bradstreet, the business information provider.
