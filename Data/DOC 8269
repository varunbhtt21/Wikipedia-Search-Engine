'''Aghabullogue Bridge''' is a bridge in [[County Cork]], Ireland, situated {{convert|0.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Aghabullogue]] village, and {{convert|6.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Coachford]] village. A footstick over the Delehinagh River is depicted on the 1841 surveyed OS map, where the bridge now stands. It would appear to have been constructed by the beginning of the twentieth century, and is depicted on the 1901 surveyed OS map, but not named. The bridge is located at the meeting point of the [[townlands]] of [[Clonmoyle West]] and Dromatimore, within both the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] and catholic [[parish]] of [[Aghabullogue]].

Many surviving bridges in mid-Cork are originally constructed of stone, arched in shape, and late eighteenth or early nineteenth century in date, and often contain semi-circular arches and pointed breakwaters.<ref>{{cite book|work=compiled by Denis Power et al.|title=Archaeological inventory of county Cork, volume 3|year=1997|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|isbn=}}</ref> Aghabullogue Bridge, however, would appear to be of a later construction date.
