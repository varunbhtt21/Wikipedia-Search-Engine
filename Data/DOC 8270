}}'''''Aisle''''' is a 1999 [[interactive fiction]] [[video game]] whose major innovation is to allow only a single move and offer from it over a hundred possible outcomes. It is notable for introducing and popularizing the ''one move genre''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Montfort|first=Nick|title=Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction|year=2005|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262633185|page=217}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis |first=Jeremy |last=Douglass |title=Command Lines: Aesthetics and Technique in Interactive Fiction and New Media |publisher=The University of California, Santa Barbara |year=2007|pages=67-68}}</ref>

==Plot==
The main character is a man standing in the pasta aisle of a modern supermarket. The opening text states:

<blockquote>You've had a ''hard'' day and the last thing you need is this: shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and you're progressing rapidly.
<br><br>On to the next aisle.</blockquote>

The character's interest is piqued by the [[gnocchi]] he sees in the pasta aisle and a few other items are noted. Then the player is asked to choose how to proceed. Based on this input the game will reveal the character's story (and back story). Alec Meer describes how things may proceed from here:<ref>{{cite web|last=Meer|first=Alec|title=Groundhog Day: Aisle|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/07/25/groundhog-day-aisle/|work=Rock Paper Shotgun|publisher=Rock Paper Shotgun Ltd.|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

<blockquote>
So what do you do? Buy pasta, think about Gnocchi, try to talk to the woman, take your clothes off, start shouting… Some endings are moving, others tragic, others funny, others lurid, others mysterious. It rewards experimentation, logic, lateral thinking and craziness in equal measure.

Crucially, a number of the less eventful endings provide hints as to your character’s backstory, which in turn fill your mind with possibilities as to new actions you could attempt. Hence, Groundhog Day – each attempt you make at the game is informed by the events of the previous one(s). You revert to exactly the same situation every time, but though the world hasn’t changed, your knowledge has – and with that comes an uncanny sense of progress.</blockquote>

==Reception==
It was well received on release with players finding its approach fascinating.<ref>{{cite book|last=Montfort|first=Nick|title=Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction|year=2005|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262633185|page=217}}</ref>

On [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]], Adam Smith called ''Aisle'' "one of my favourite explorations of interactive storytelling, seemingly so simple yet capable of telling so many stories that are distorted and/or clarified by the nature of the medium" <ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=Storyseeking: Interactive Fiction Competition|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/10/05/storyseeking-interactive-fiction-competition/|work=Rock Paper Shotgun|publisher=Rock Paper Shotgun Ltd.|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> and Alec Meer said that it was a "fascinating, deeply affecting experiment".<ref>{{cite web|last=Meer|first=Alec|title=Groundhog Day: Aisle|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/07/25/groundhog-day-aisle/|work=Rock Paper Shotgun|publisher=Rock Paper Shotgun Ltd.|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> On Reviews from Trotting Kripps, Ben Parrish felt ''Aisle'' was "flawlessly implemented, wonderfully written, and intensely evocative".<ref>{{cite web|author=Ben|title=Aisle by Sam Barlow (1999)|url=http://www.joltcountry.com/trottingkrips/aisle.html|work=Reviews from Trotting Krips|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

Less impressed was Duncan Stevens, writing in SPAG Magazine. Whilst he observed it was "one of the most unusual works to hit the IF community in quite some time" he felt that "Its effectiveness depends on whether it makes an emotional impact, however, and without such an impact, it's a dreary experience at best."<ref>{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Stevens|title=Aisle Review|url=http://www.spagmag.org/archives/a.html#aisle|work=SPAG|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

On [[Destructoid]] Anthony Burch said Aisle is one of the three text games he has fallen in love with, describing it as "one of the shortest text adventures ever, and also one of the longest".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burch|first=Anthony|title=Indie Nation #48: Aisle|url=http://www.destructoid.com/indie-nation-48-aisle-118993.phtml|work=Destructoid|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

In his dissertation "Command Lines: Aesthetics and Technique in Interactive Fiction and New Media", Jeremy Douglass explored the themes and construction of  ''Aisle''  and concluded that it has a "deeper and fairly consistent morality: physical actions are easy, but social outcomes 
are hard, and the important thing is respect, honesty, appropriate listening, and the 
power and responsibility of negative and positive thinking."<ref>{{cite thesis |first=Jeremy |last=Douglass |title=Command Lines: Aesthetics and Technique in Interactive Fiction and New Media
