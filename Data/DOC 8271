The '''Bank of Commerce''' building is a historic commercial building at 200 North Washington Street in [[El Dorado, Arkansas]].  The Classical Revival two story brick building was constructed in 1919-20, and is one of the few buildings in El Dorado's downtown that retains its historical facade from that period.  The building was renovated in the 1940s and 1950s, actions that gutted its interior, but only covered over the main facade with a new layer of brick, and left the secondary southern facade intact.  In the early 1980s the building's exterior was restored to its 1920s appearance.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/UN0036.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Bank of Commerce|publisher=Arkansas Preservation|accessdate=2014-04-26}}</ref>
