If the only claim to fame for Roderick T. Sawyer is that he's an alderman of the 6th ward of Chicago, that surely doesn't confer notability! [[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 21:03, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*Is being a two-term alderman in Chicago enough? I don't know, but if it's not I think it would be reasonable to merge a couple sentences on this individual into his father's article. As the subject seems to be getting substantial coverage in reliable independent sources as [http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/November-2012/His-Father-Moved-Up-from-Chicago-Alderman-to-Mayor-Does-Rod-Sawyer-Want-to-Follow-in-His-Footsteps/ here] for example, I think I would leave it independent.

*'''Keep''' There are a few very large cities whose city council is of enough significance that the individual members of it are notable. The best US examples are NYC and Chicago. We have consistently kept such articles. There is always enogugh material to be added, even if it has not yet been added in this case.

The real problem here isn't that he's an alderman in Chicago — city councillors in fact ''are'' deemed to pass [[WP:POLITICIAN]] in certain metropolitan "world cities" in the millions population range, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto or London — but that the article's ''only'' cited reference is a [[WP:PRIMARYSOURCE|primary source]] (his "meet your alderman" biography on his own website), making this effectively an unsourced [[WP:BLP]]. Since he ''is'' notable enough for a Wikipedia article in principle, I will gladly rescind this comment ''if'' the article sees sourcing improvement by closure, but it cannot stay on Wikipedia in ''this'' form. <strike>'''Delete''' if sources don't start showing up, but '''no prejudice''' against recreation if somebody wants to start a new, properly sourced version at a later date.</strike> '''Keep''' due to Milowent's sourcing improvements, though the article does still need more sources and should remain tagged for {{tl|refimprove}}.

*'''Keep''':  Bearcat's concern was legitimate.  I added two sources, I think it can be kept.--'''[[User:Milowent|Milowent]]''' • <small><sup style="position:relative">[[Special:Contributions/Milowent|has]]<span style="position:relative;bottom:-2.0ex;left:-3.2ex;*left:-5.5ex;">[[User talk:Milowent|spoken]]</span></sup></small> 03:00, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
