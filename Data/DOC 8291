'''Barron Stadium''' is a 6,500-seat [[American football field|football field]] and [[track & field]] [[stadium]] in [[Rome, Georgia]]. It is home to the [[Shorter University Hawks]] and [[Rome High School]] Wolves [[American football|football]] teams. The facility hosted the [[NAIA Football National Championship]] from 2008-13 and the [[National Christian College Athletic Association|NCCAA]] [[Victory Bowl]] in 2013-14, as well as the NCCAA track championships from 2014-16.

Barron Stadium is owned by the Rome-[[Floyd County, Georgia|Floyd]] Parks and Recreation Authority (RFPRA), a city-county partnership, and has been operated by the [[Rome City School District]] since 2015. For usage, it cost Shorter University $7,500 in 2012 to host its home football games as part of a three-year, $321,000 contract that included football, track & field, other sports, events, and the school's commencement exercises. Rome High School paid $5,000 per game for its home football games at that time. The RFPRA provides staffing for athletic events and pays for facility maintenance.<ref name="finances">{{cite web|title=Shorter will pay RFPRA more to use Barron Stadium|publisher=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=September 22, 2012|accessdate=April 26, 2014|url=http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/shorter-will-pay-rfpra-more-to-use-barron-stadium/article_8f62dd70-c9e3-5602-b3ee-44da0ef10957.html}}</ref>

==History==
The athletic field is over 100 years old, originally known as '''Hamilton Field'''. Dating to 1924, the stadium was renamed Barron Stadium in 1925 for local businessman William F. Barron, who helped acquire the property.<ref name="athguide"/> (Barron's father founded the Rome [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant in 1901.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rome Coca Cola Bottling Co. breaks ground for new plant|author=|publisher=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=December 8, 1974|accessdate=April 26, 2014|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&dat=19741208&id=5AYvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RzMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4478,1350734}}</ref>) Lights were installed by 1937, and the school district turned over operation of the facility to the city recreation department in 1957.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rome City Schools receive textbooks from state, acquire athletic fields, launch band programs|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|date=August 6, 1976|accessdate=May 10, 2014|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0Xs1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RjMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5662%2C1152409}}</ref> Renovations occurred in 1967 and 2008, and a new press box was built in 2001.<ref name="athguide">{{cite book|title=2009 Shorter Hawks Football Media Guide|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/shor/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/09fbmg.pdf|page=60}}</ref> In 2010, Barron received $3.4 million in upgrades, paid for by a [[local option]] [[sales tax]], that included a new [[artificial turf]] field, an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]-certified track, and a new scoreboard, plus expanded locker room, press and seating facilities.<ref name="finances"/><ref name="salestax">{{cite web|title=Input sought on Barron Stadium track hours|author=Diane Wagner|publisher=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=September 24, 2011|url=http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/input-sought-on-barron-stadium-track-hours/article_8394d399-3c63-5337-b3ba-d0179aa4bb8f.html}}</ref>

In its early days, the field hosted local prep teams like the [[Rome High School|Rome Hilltoppers]] and [[Darlington School|Darlington Lakesiders]]. Barron hosted football state championship wins for local [[East Rome High School]] in 1977 and 1978, and for [[West Rome High School]] in 1983 and 1985. The last crosstown rivalry football game between the schools was played at Barron in 1991 before they were consolidated into one high school.  State football championship games were also held at Barron Stadium in 1953, 1954, 1969, 1971, 1972, and 1974. The stadium began hosting Shorter College football in 2005, the program's inaugural season.<ref name="memories">{{cite web|title=Lasting memories|author=Jeff Gable|publisher=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=November 13, 2005|accessdate=April 26, 2014|url=http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/lasting-memorie-sport/article_c8f81bca-84af-5da5-8747-a965514ba703.html}}</ref> Barron also hosted football games for [[Berry College]] in 2013-14 before the team began playing at its new on-campus stadium in 2015.

A proposed relocation of the facility in 2005 was scuttled after talks between local developers and the city broke down. Developers wanted to turn the 14-acre Barron Stadium area into a multi-use development with homes, offices, and retail. The athletic facilities would have been relocated to a new location adjacent to Rome's minor-league baseball park, [[State Mutual Stadium]], with the new complex consisting of a new football stadium, track, gymnastics center, aquatic center, and other buildings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stadium talks move forward|author=Alan Riquelmy|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|date=March 13, 2005|page=1A|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&dat=20050313&id=S5M0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6kQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4648,2712774}}</ref> Although an [[memorandum of understanding|initial agreement]] was entered into by the developers and the city, cost estimates and a short timeline for development eventually derailed the project.<ref>{{cite news|title=City of Rome ends West Third agreement|author=Alan Riqelmy|publisher=The Cedartown Standard|page=4B|date=January 12, 2006|accessdate=May 10, 2014|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XxtIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HT8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6878%2C244860}}</ref> Other problems during the project discussions included the timeline for [[government debt|debt retirement]] of bonds that would have been issued from a newly created [[tax-allocation district]] and reimbursements to [[Floyd County, Georgia|Floyd County]] under the proposed city/county agreement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Numbers holding up W. 3rd deal|author=Alan Riquelmy|publisher=Rome News-Tribune|date=December 4, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2014|url=http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/numbers-holding-up-w-rd-dea-local-new/article_073b50b3-6a5a-59fe-b5c8-64d3a1033c30.html}}</ref>

==Other sports==
The track at Barron Stadium is named the  '''John Maddox Track''' after a local track standout and [[1932 Summer Olympics]] hopeful who successfully lobbied the city for a better municipal track facility and helped found the [[Rome News-Tribune|Rome News]] Relays, a major local track & field event. In 1971, the track at Barron was named after Maddox following his sudden death the previous year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maddox ran to Olympic trials|author=Darrell Black|publisher=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=April 16, 1981|accessdate=April 26, 2014|page=1-B|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&dat=19810416&id=lPpMAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zTIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1565,2232346}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Maddox ran to Olympic trials|publisher=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=July 7, 1996|accessdate=April 26, 2014|page=28|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&dat=19960707&id=2aAjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fTMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3759,8054218}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=John Maddox, Sr.|publisher=Rome Floyd Parks and Recreation Authority|accessdate=April 26, 2014|url=http://www.rfpra.com/HOF%20John%20Maddox%20Sr.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010126/http://www.rfpra.com/HOF%20John%20Maddox%20Sr.html|archive-date=April 27, 2014|dead-url=yes}}</ref> Maddox was the grandson of local judge and [[U.S. Representative|U.S. Rep.]] [[John W.
