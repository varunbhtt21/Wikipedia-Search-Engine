Only has written 1 book so far which does not even have a page on here. Seems to be too early for this guy as of now if ever. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 02:57, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' per substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. The Hindu article is entirely about this author and his book. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 14:43, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-Was it a major book or something? Granted I'm not Hindu or Indian so I am not sure about that-so yeah was it? (I've seen odder ones get tagged from people nominated for an Oscar to even someone that might of been in the Olympics but was nowhere near getting a medal! Just being nominated in any category at the Oscars or being in the Olympics is good enough for a page IMO) [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 16:03, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::The book and author have received substantial coverage. In addition to the article in the Hindu and other articles already cited there'scoverage such as [http://www.bangaloremirror.com/columns/work/Vishwas-Mudagal-has-entrepreneurship-in-his-veins/articleshow/33919490.cms this]. I don't think Olympic athletes should automatically be notable and I think that's changing. Nominations for awards are not enough in and of themselves. I think substantial coverage in reliable independent sources is really the key. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 02:18, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
