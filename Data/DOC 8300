The '''El Dorado Apartments''' are a historic apartment house at 420 Wilson Place in [[El Dorado, Arkansas]].  The two story brick and limestone building was designed by [[Louisiana]] architect Cheshire Peyton, and built in 1926 in response to the discovery of oil in the area and the ensuing economic boom.  It houses 24 small efficiency units, designed for use by the transient but wealthier workers and managers of the oil-related economy.  The building has limestone window sills, and rows of brick-inlaid limestone squares between the windows.  The cornice of the flat roof is decorated with brick dentil moulding and modillions.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/UN0157.nr.pdf |title=NRHP nomination for El Dorado Apartments |publisher=Arkansas Preservation |accessdate=2014-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010850/http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/UN0157.nr.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}</ref>
