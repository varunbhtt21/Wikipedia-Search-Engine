== Pedal on Parliament ride ==

Each year, a ride has followed a route from [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows]] to the [[Scottish Parliament Building|Scottish Parliament]]. The main ride gathers at Middle Meadow Walk, and then goes via [[George IV Bridge]] and the [[Royal Mile]]. The ride down to the parliament is carried out at a leisurely pace as there are many children, some on [[Balance bicycle|balance bikes]], and also people walking alongside that are not able to cycle for whatever reason. It is policed mainly by Edinburgh-based Police on bikes, who also ride in with some of the local feeder rides, which can exceed 200 cyclists, and takes around 30 minutes for the end of the ride to leave The Meadows. During the ride, road in the area are closed to traffic.<ref name="BBC 25Apr2015" />

Participants in the main riders assemble at the parliament where speeches are then given by activists, politicians and others.

A minute's silence has been held at these rides, to remember those unfortunate cyclists who have been killed on the roads.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/thousands-take-part-in-pedal-on-parliament-in-edinburgh-168382 |title=Thousands take part in Pedal on Parliament in Edinburgh |first=Stuart |last=Clarke |work=[[Cycling Weekly]] |date=27 April 2015 |accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref> In contrast, ringing of bike bells has also been used to celebrate cycling, and to signal agreement with speakers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/14864852.Vonny_Moyes__Let_s_face_it___cycling_has_an_image_problem/ |title=Let's face it - cycling has an image problem |first=Vonny |last=Moyes |work=[[The National (Scotland)|The National]] |date=25 April 2016 |accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Feeder rides ===

A series of "feeder rides" are organised from various locations around Edinburgh and Scotland. These allow people to cycle to the event in a group, with the benefit of safety in numbers as well as being a sociable occasion. The feeder rides are often joined by people en route to the Meadows, either at pre-defined points, or ad-hoc. There was also a guided ride back to The Meadows along quiet streets after the event was over.

== History ==
