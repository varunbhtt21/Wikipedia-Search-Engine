'''SONCAS''' is a French acronym for ''Sécurité - Orgueil - Nouveauté - Confort - Argent - Sympathie''.

Well known in France, this system was invented to know what motivates a person to buy a product.  After the research of a French study it was found that most people are driven by one of these six topics ''Sécurité - Orgueil - Nouveauté - Confort - Argent - Sympathie''<ref>http://www.commerciaux.fr/profession/methode_soncas.php{{fr}}</ref> that could be translated to ''Security - Pride - Novelty/Technology - Comfort - Money - Sympathy''.

This technique is used by sellers to find what motivation a buyer requires to make then buy the product.<ref>http://harald-braha.fr/scurit-orgueil-nouveaut-confort-argent-sympathie/{{fr}}</ref><ref>http://www.definitions-marketing.com/Definition-SONCAS{{fr}}</ref>

Another way of using SONCAS is to use every single point to cover all six topics to be sure to make the customer like the product.<ref>http://www.ecompedia.net/index.php?title=SONCAS{{fr}}</ref>

SONCAS is also linked with the [[Enneagram of Personality]] and [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]].<ref>http://www.marketing-etudiant.fr/cours/m/methode-soncas-vente.php{{fr}}</ref>
