{{About|the Brazilian documentary film|the Musketeers novel|Twenty Years After}}
'''''Twenty Years Later''''' ({{lang-pt|Cabra Marcado para Morrer}}, "A Goat Marked for Death") is a 1984 Brazilian [[documentary film]] which has become one of the best-known films directed by [[Eduardo Coutinho]]. It originated in 1964 as a planned feature film about the life and death of João Pedro Teixeira, a leader of the [[Peasant leagues (Brazil)|Peasant leagues]] from [[Paraíba]] who was assassinated on the order of local landowners in 1962. But before it could be completed, production was interrupted by political developments, with some of the crew and cast arrested and their materials confiscated. In 1984, Coutinho returned to the material, shooting new footage of some of the actors and crew. The resulting critically acclaimed documentary gained a [[cult following]].

==Overview==
The original script told the story of João Pedro Teixeira, a [[Peasant leagues (Brazil)|peasant leader]] from [[Sapé, Paraíba]], who was assassinated in 1962 on the order of local landowners.{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=36}}<ref name=nytimes>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/arts/film-20-years-later.html | title=Film: '20 Years Later' | date=May 12, 1985 | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref>

In 1962, Coutinho, replacing a cameraman of [[Centro Popular de Cultura]] (CPC), filmed a protest over the death of Teixeira in Paraíba and met Elizabeth, Teixeira's widow, for the first time.{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=36}} On his return to Rio de Janeiro, he was offered the chance of directing a film for CPC.{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=36}} Initially he wanted to adapt [[João Cabral de Melo Neto]]'s poems "Cão sem plumas", "O rio" and "Vida e morte Severina" but the poet refused, so he decided to film the life of Texeira instead.{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=37}} In 1963, he went to Paraíba and [[Pernambuco]] and within three days he wrote a screenplay based on Mrs. Teixeira's accounts.{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=37}}

Coutinho started to shoot the film in 1964, and to be more authentic, he cast Mrs. Teixeira as herself, and other farmers in the other roles.<ref name=ebert>{{cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/broken-screens-eduardo-coutinho-19332014 | title=Broken Screens: Eduardo Coutinho, 1933–2014 | author=Villaça, Pablo | date=February 2, 2014 | publisher=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]] | accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> He wanted to film in Sapé but because of local conflicts he moved the filming location to [[Vitória de Santo Antão]], Pernambuco.{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=37}} After 35 days shooting,{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=37}} and with about 40 percent of the film complete, the [[Brazilian military dictatorship]] arrested some members of cast and crew and confiscated the script, stills and other materials.<ref name=nytimes/><ref name=ebert/> The government also tried to confiscate the footage, but most had already been sent for processing in Rio and survived.<ref name=ebert/>

Returning to the region where ''Twenty Years later'' was shot to produce other documentaries in 1979, Coutinho considered completing the film.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elpais.com/diario/1986/12/05/radiotv/534121202_850215.html | title='Cabra, marcado para morir', filme sobre el campesino brasileño | author=Berciano, Rosa Álvarez | date=December 5, 1986 | work=[[El País]] | accessdate=December 15, 2014 | language=Spanish}}</ref> He eventually concluded he needed to make a different kind of project, telling the story of the earlier filming and revisiting its cast and crew.{{Sfn|Lins|2004|p=38}} In 1984, he showed what he had filmed to Mrs. Teixeira and local people and documented their reactions to it and the changing times.<ref name=cannes>{{cite web | url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/045965.pdf | title=Cabra Marcado Para Morrer | publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]] | accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref>

By the time it was released in the English-speaking world it was also well received by its critics. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' "It became a historical document of the revolution from the losers' viewpoint. Cabra suggest the cinema's power to be an agent of its own creative process. It is a highly original documentary".<ref name=cannes/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as "a provocative, one-of-a-kind document" that "is anything but idyllic. However, Mr. Coutinho's commitment to his characters is all the more effective for being cool, controlled and unsentimental."<ref name=nytimes/> Johh King, in his book ''Magical Reels: A History of Cinema in Latin America'' called it "The most important Brazilian documentary of the period".<ref name=cannes/> Writing for [[RogerEbert.com]], Pablo Villaça praised its "fascinating narrative" and deemed it as "one of the most intriguing documentaries you could ever see".<ref name=ebert/>
