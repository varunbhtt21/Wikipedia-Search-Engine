The '''El Dorado Confederate Monument''' is located on the grounds of the [[Union County Courthouse (Arkansas)|Union County Courthouse]] in [[El Dorado, Arkansas]], near the corner of North Main and South Washington Streets.  It consists of a statue of a [[Confederate Army]] soldier in mid-stride, mounted on top of a temple-like structure supported by four cannon-shaped Ionic columns.  The columns support a lintel structure bearing inscriptions on three sides, above which is a tiered roof with cannonballs at the corners.  The temple structure is {{convert|15|ft|m}} high, and {{convert|10|ft|m}} square; the statue measures {{convert|76|in|m}} by {{convert|28|in|m}} by {{convert|28|in|m}}.  Both the statue and the temple are constructed of gray/blue striated marble.  Inside the temple structure is a water fountain that no longer works.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/UN0161S.nr.pdf |title=NRHP nomination for El Dorado Confederate Monument |publisher=Arkansas Preservation |accessdate=2014-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427015757/http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/!userfiles/UN0161S.nr.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-27 |df= }}</ref>

The monument was built in 1910 at a cost of over $2,800, and was paid for by the local chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].  It is believed to be the first fountain-style Confederate monument in the South.  The front (south) side of the monument is inscribed "CSA 1861 - 1865 / ERECTED BY THE HENRY G. BUNN CHAPTER / UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY / 1909".  The north side is inscribed "'TRUTH CRUSHED TO EARTH SHALL RISE AGAIN.' / 'EVEN DEATH CANNOT SEVER THE CORDS OF MEMORY.'"  The western lintel reads "'IN HONOR OF THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS / OF UNION COUNTY, ARK.'".  The eastern lintel has a pair of crossed swords on it.<ref name=NRHP/>
