'''Matteo da Gualdo''' or '''Matteo di Pietro di Ser Bernardo''' ([[Gualdo Tadino]], circa 1435-1440 - 1507) was an Italian painter, active in [[Gualdo Tadino]], [[Nocera Umbra]], and [[Assisi]]. 

==Biography==
He likely trained under the painter from Foligno, [[Bartolomeo di Tommaso]], and [[Girolamo di Giovanni di Camerino]]. He was influenced by [[Piero della Francesca]],  [[Andrea Mantegna]], and [[Niccol√≤ di Liberatore]]. In 1462, he painted the [[polyptych]] of ''Santa Margherita''; and in 1471, a tryptych: both now in the [[Rocca Flea]] Museo Civico. He painted an ''Encounter of a young St John the Baptist with St Anne'' now found at the Pinacoteca of Nocera Umbra. His son Girolamo and grandson also became painters. <ref>[http://www.roccaflea.com/main.php?pag=matteo_da_gualdo Rocca Flea Museo Civico], biography on Matteo da Gualdo.</ref><ref>[http://www.tadino.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=39&Itemid=76 Tadino Gualda commune] biography.</ref>
