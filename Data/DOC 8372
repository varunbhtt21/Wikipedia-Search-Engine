'''Clonmoyle House West''' is a dwelling in [[Clonmoyle West]] townland, {{convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}s south-east of [[Aghabullogue]] village, and {{convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}s north of [[Coachford]] village.

The Ordnance Survey name book (c. 1840) refers to Clonmoyle House as being within the townland of Clonmoyle West. On the 1841 surveyed OS map, it is depicted as Clonmoyle House. The mid-nineteenth century Primary Valuation of Ireland ([[Griffith's Valuation]]) records Rev. Denis Mahony as occupier of ''c''. 20 acres, consisting of a 'house, offices, and land', with the immediate lessor being Cross H. Fitzgibbon. The buildings were valued at ''c''. £8 and the lands ''c''. £14.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ask about Ireland, Griffith's Valuation|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/griffith-valuation/index.xml?action=doNameSearch&familyname=&firstname=&offset=20&countyname=&parishname=&parishname&unionname=&baronyname=&totalrows=46&PlaceID=1662657&wildcard=}}</ref> The property is also depicted on the 1901 surveyed OS map, but not named. On the early twentieth century [[French cartography#Cassini maps|Cassini]] 6-inch map, it is depicted as 'Parochial House'.

It remains a private residence, and is not accessible to the public.
