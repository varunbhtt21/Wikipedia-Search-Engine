'''Arahmaiani''' ('''Arahmayani Feisal''', born May 21, 1961) is an [[Indonesia]]n artist born in [[Bandung]] and based in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]. Arahmaiani is considered by many to be one of the most respected and iconic contemporary artists, specifically in pioneering [[performance art]] in Southeast Asia. Arahmaiani frequently uses art as a means of critical commentary on social, religion, and cultural issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa-a.org/events/arahmaiani-fertility-of-the-mind/|title=Arahmaiani: Fertility of the Mind|website=Asia Art Archive in America|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Arahmaiani was born in [[Bandung]], Indonesia on May 21, 1961. Her father was an Islamic scholar and her mother is of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist Extraction. Her name represents the syncretic mixture of two different cultures that she experienced in her upbringing. As she readily explains that "Arahma" goes back to the Arabic word meaning "loving“ while "iani/yani“ comes from a Hindi word meaning "human being“.<ref name=":1" />

As an art student she felt let down by the educational system in her country because it did not connect her with real life. So she decided to create her own art on the streets and discovered in an intuitive way what performance art was all about.<ref name=":2" />

Arahmaiani studied at the Faculty of Fine Art and Design, [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] and finished her study in 1992. She also went to the Academie voor Beeldende Kunst, [[Enschede]], the [[Netherlands]] in 1983 and Paddington Art School, [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trfineart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Arahmaiani-2016-Catalog-lr.pdf|title=Arahmaiani: Shadow of the Past|last=Feisal|first=Arahmaiani|date=|website=|publisher=www.trfineart.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref>

== Works ==
Though best known as a performance artist,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Kathryn|last2=Bessell|first2=Sharon|title=Women in Indonesia: Gender, Equity, and Development|url=https://www.questia.com/read/119242202/women-in-indonesia-gender-equity-and-development|year=2002|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies {{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}} |pages=120–121}}</ref> she also employs painting, drawing, sculpture, video, poetry, dance, and installation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arahmaiani|url=http://www.trfineart.com/artists/arahmaiani|publisher=Tyler Rollins Fine Art|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> The thematic material of Arahmaiani's work deals with certain issues related to the discrimination and violence against women, the oppression of women's bodies by men, religion in modern society, Western commercial [[imperialism]], and global [[Industrialisation|industrialization]].<ref name=":2">{{cite book|title=Indonesian Contemporary Art Now|last1=Bollansee|first1=Marc|last2=Supriyanto|first2=Enin|publisher=SNP Editions|year=2007|isbn=9789812481429|location=Singapore|pages=122–3}}</ref> Since the early 1980s, Arahmaiani's works have generated hostility on the part of Islamic community leaders and political authorities resulting in her short imprisonment in 1983.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/arahmaiani|title=Brooklyn Museum: Arahmaiani|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>

Her painting titled ''Lingga-Yoni 1993'' and her installation titled ''Etalase 1994'', bring together disparate symbols of Islam, Western culture, and sexuality. ''Etalase'' consisted of objects such as the [[Quran]], a [[Buddharupa|Buddha statue]], a mirror, a pack of condoms, a Coca-Cola bottle, a box of soil, a fan, a small [[rebana]] (traditional tambourine) and her photo placed in the same museum vitrine display case. Both of the works have generated a very strong reaction from members of a Muslim fundamentalist group during their first display in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1994. The works were immediately censored and Arahmaiani herself received death threats which then led her to leave the country to Australia temporarily.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/09/07/arahmaiani-stays-true-to-herself.html|title=Arahmaiani stays true to herself|last=Ulung|first=A.

Johnson Museum of Art in 2013.<ref name=":4" />

At one point in her life, Arahmaiani was working for one of the largest newspapers in Central Java. For four years, she worked as a columnist and often brought up critical issues about the practice of [[Islam]]ic culture before being fired for criticizing Islam. In a recent interview, Arahmaiani stated that coming from a mixed of [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Animism|Animist]] background, she wanted to make some sort of contribution to the conversation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mommybysilasandstathacos.com/2014/04/20/a-conversation-with-arahmaiani/|title=A conversation with Arahmaiani|last=Silas|first=Susan; Stathacos, Chrysanne|date=|website=MOMMY by Silas and Stathacos|publisher=|access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

Arahmaiani exhibited in the Indonesian pavilion at the 50th [[Venice Biennale]] in 2003, along with other prominent Indonesian artists, Dadang Christianto, Tisna Sanjaya and [[Made Wianta]].
