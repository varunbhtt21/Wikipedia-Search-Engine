Being the first person to vote in an election is not quite notable.  [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 21:47, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:Given the media coverage he has since received, I disagree. [[User:DragonflySixtyseven|DS]] ([[User talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk]]) 23:03, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::From the sound of the article it seemed like he has been someone who is basically saying to vote and in interviews-not sure if that counts to be a bio on here though. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:07, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Weak keep''' - coverage of Negi in reliable independent sources exists, and at least some of it deals not with his original first vote but with his much more recent get-out-the-vote efforts that went viral. So BLP1E does not apply. While ''more'' coverage and more content couldn't hurt, I'd say what we have suffices to justify an article. [[User:Huon|Huon]] ([[User talk:Huon|talk]]) 23:15, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''-I think the thing is the article made it sound like being the first voter of an election was why he was notable. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 23:16, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I think the subject of sufficient notability. He is reported by multiple news sources for the video message and being the first voter, in addition to those already cited, ex. [http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-26933761 BBC]. He is well covered by media yesterday also after casting his vote, which is reported more in the context of him being first voter. --<font size="2" face="Kokonor" color="green">Vigyani</font><sub>[[User talk:Vigyani|''talk'']]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Vigyani|ਯੋਗਦਾਨ]]</sup>  09:59, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Merge and redirect''' to [[Indian general election, 1951]]. Coverage in election-time news reports, but not exactly notable enough for a separate article. [[User:Utcursch|utcursch]] | [[User talk:Utcursch|talk]] 21:11, 8 May 2014 (UTC)
