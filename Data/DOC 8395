"'''Love on the Air'''" is a single by [[Pink Floyd]]'s guitarist, [[David Gilmour]]. The track was released as the second single from his second studio solo album ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]''. The single, with its B-side "Let's Get Metaphysical", failed to make any kind of commercial success.

The lyrics to the track were supplied by [[The Who]]'s main songwriter, [[Pete Townshend]], and the music was by [[David Gilmour]] himself, the lyrics for the track were written within a day, after Gilmour had asked for Townshend's help.<ref>Perna, Alan di (2012). Guitar Masters: Intimate Portraits. Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|9781480329706}}.</ref> Townshend had also supplied the lyrics to another track from ''About Face'', "All Lovers are Deranged".

The single was only released in the UK, but sales were poor, and the single was re-released in 1984 as a 7" Picture Disc, but sales were still poor.
