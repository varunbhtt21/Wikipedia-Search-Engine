==Life and work==
Sawada graduated in 1998 with a degree in Media Design, then later in 2000 with a degree in [[Photography]] from the [[Seian University of Art and Design]] in [[Otsu, Shiga]], Japan. Some of her works of art include ''ID-400'', ''OMIAI♡'', ''Costume'', ''Schoolgirls, Costume, Cover, Masquerade, Recruit, Mirrors, and Facial Signature''. Her work investigates human identity and especially gender roles and stereotypes in [[Japanese culture]].<ref>"Tomoko Sawada." Zabriskie Gallery. Zabriskie Gallery, 2014.

Sawada uses photography and techniques of performance art to explore ideas of identity, status, culture, individualism, and conformity through traditional and contemporary cultural methods of portraiture. Sawada's photographs are each part of a themed photo series in which she makes use of make-up and costume to dramatically alter her identity, such that each photograph appears to represent a different individual or group of individuals, when all subjects are Sawada herself. Sawada uses commercial photographers, photo booths, and her own studio environment with digital photo editing to represent hundreds of different identities.<ref>{{cite web|title=MEM: Artists {{ndash}} Tomoko Sawada|url=http://mem-inc.jp/artists/sawada_j|website=MEM, Inc.|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Clearly, her use of costume in her self-portraits draws from the work of [[Cindy Sherman]]. Her work also explores the way assumptions about personality are largely driven by Japanese cultural responses to gender, job occupation, and other socio-cultural stereotypes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zabriskie Gallery, Artists, Tomoko Sawada, Press Releases, School Girls|url=http://www.zabriskiegallery.com/artist.php?artist=8&page=12|website=Zabriskie Gallery|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
Sawada's earliest self-portrait photo series is ''Early Days'' from 1995-1996 made while Sawada was in her teens.<ref>{{cite web|title=MEM Gallery Early Days Exhibition|url=http://mem-inc.jp/2006/07/01/sawada_e/|website=MEM, Inc.|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Her next series, ID400, was created over the course of 4 years, from 1998-2001 using a public photo booth to take 400 different ID card style self-portraits while Sawada altered her appearance through costume, hair, and make-up changes along with altering her facial expression or even gaining/losing weight.<ref name=pingmag>{{cite web|last1=Verena|title=The Many Facets of Tomoko Sawada|url=http://pingmag.jp/2008/02/25/the-many-facets-of-tomoko-sawada/|website=Ping Mag|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref><ref name="March 7, 2015">{{cite web|title=Zabriskie Gallery Sawada Press Release Two Photographic Series|url=http://www.zabriskiegallery.com/artist.php?artist=8&page=86|website=Zabriskie Gallery}}</ref> Subsequent photo series continue to explore varying methods of altering Sawada's outward appearance then documenting these changes using single and group style photographic methods.

===''Early Days'', 1995-1996===
Sawada's earliest photo series.<ref>{{cite web|title=MEM Gallery Tomoko Sawada|url=http://mem-inc.jp/2006/07/01/sawada_e/|website=MEM Gallery|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>

===''ID400'', 1998-2001===
For this photo series, Sawada visited the same photo booth outside a train station in Kobe, Japan over the course of four years to create 400 different black and white ID card photos of herself.<ref name=pingmag/>

===''OMIAI♡'', 2001===
Sawada's OMIAI♡ series references the traditional photo book of a young woman used by her family members for an arranged marriage. Sawada was photographed in a professional photography studio. On each visit she dressed as a different type of woman, as the photographs are carefully produced with the intention of showing a woman's identity for the prospective young man and his family.<ref>{{cite web|title=MEM Tomoko Sawada|url=http://mem-inc.jp/artists/sawada_j|website=MEM Gallery|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>

===''Cover/Face'', 2002-2003===
Photographs in this series show Sawada attired based on trends of the Japanese youth culture and the influence of Western ideas of beauty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zabriskie Gallery Tomoko Sawada Schoolgirls|url=http://www.zabriskiegallery.com/artist.php?artist=8&page=12|website=Zabriskie Gallery|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> She dressed herself as a ganguro, described as a tan, California girl type idolizing the pop music star Namie Amuro.<ref name=pingmag/>

===''Costume'', 2003===
Sawada dresses in the uniforms and work clothes associated with various jobs. The idea for this series grew from her personal experiences working in different roles and learning how different people responded to her in these roles, "people’s attitude toward another person changes greatly according to their occupation."<ref>{{cite web|title=Zabriskie Gallery Tomoko Sawada Costume|url=http://www.zabriskiegallery.com/artist.php?artist=8&page=52|website=Zabriskie Gallery|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>

===''School Days'', 2004===
This series shows Sawada repeated within the same large group class portraits as both the students and their teacher wearing a school girl uniform and then dressed as the typical school matron. Sawada finds ways of altering her presentation wearing identical school uniforms through changes to her hair style, accessories, and facial expressions, then the images are digitally combined to create the class, including a background.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rösler|first1=Dirk|title=Tomoko Sawada's School Days|url=http://www.japanexposures.com/2008/11/28/tomoko-sawada-school-days/|website=Japan Exposures|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref>
