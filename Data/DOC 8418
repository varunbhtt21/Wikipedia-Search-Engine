:({{Find sources|Negative and positive atheism}})
The phrases "positive atheism" and "negative atheism" have been used from time to time in various sources, but - as the article admits - to mean different things. This is not a coherent topic that exists in high-quality independent sources, but a synthetic one, composed of original research and synthesis. It starts with an assertion unsupported by its source, and an irrelevant (original) diagram, and does not improve. As this is not a real, notable, topic the article should be deleted.

*'''Keep and improve''' It's a meaningful distinction in works like those written by Flew and Martin and plenty of others. The diagnosis given in the nomination is applicable to a wide variety of philosophical topics: take something like [[nominalism]] or [[naturalism]] and you could easily say that it isn't a "coherent topic", because philosophical language is often an infuriating exercise in polysemy. The terminology and the definitions used don't matter so much as the concept and the distinctions drawn: the concept is discussed in a number of philosophically-informed works on atheism from both a theistic and atheistic perspective. The fact that the concept of negative and positive atheism is not universally adhered to is not really a problem: we should include any reliable sources that object to 'negative/positive' formulation. The idea that the article ought to not exist because it is covered in [[Atheism]] doesn't convince me much either: the fact that the distinction is discussed and disputed (for instance, by John Shook in ''The God Debates'', and a number of other places) can easily be tucked into the article. —[[User:Tom Morris|Tom Morris]] ([[User talk:Tom Morris|talk]]) 13:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per Tom Morris.  The topic is notable, even if the usage of the terminology is ambiguous and "slippery."  There is too much material present (and too much potential for expansion) for the topic to exist merely as a section of the atheism main article. [[User:Xoloz|Xoloz]] ([[User talk:Xoloz|talk]]) 18:20, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
**But "it" is not notable because there is no source which defines what "it" is well. Which is why off-topic sources are being bent into service.

*'''Delete'''; I agree with Alexbrn's concerns about it being a synthetic topic, and much of the detailed content is bordering on synthesis too. If one source distinguishes between about positive/negative atheism, another source distinguishes between strong/weak atheism, and a third implicit/explicit atheism, then the best thing to do would be to handle them in the [[Atheism]] article rather than labelling them all "negative and positive atheism".

*'''Keep & Improve''' per {{u|Xoloz}} - Definitely something that should be kept IMO. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 21:18, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' I like this sort of AFD because I can wonder whatever was going on in the nominator's mind. Anyway, the topic is notable because it is discussed in depth in multiple independent reliable secondary sources (or whatever I am supposed to say).

**The problem is, ''it isn't'' - which is why the article is scraping around for sources and trying to make it seem like they apply ("Positive and negative atheism are distinct from the philosopher George H. Smith's less-well-known categories of implicit and explicit atheism" - unsourced). This is original research / synthesis.
