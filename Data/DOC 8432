'''''Fist Full Of Bees''''' is the tenth album by the band [[Bride (band)|Bride]]. It is the band's attempt to make an album within the [[nu metal]] genre of the early 2000s. It was the first and last album with [[Absolute Records]], as the singer [[Dale Thompson]] stated in an interview in 2003: "Nothing happened and that was the problem. The record company was not answering questions, not moving and had no real plan for the record, so it died. I got us out of the contract by discussing my personal beliefs and philosophies with the head of the label. He and I did not see eye to eye, so he released us."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libertynjustice.net/gettoknow_dale.php |title=Liberty n' Justice - LNJ get to know Dale Thompson |publisher=Libertynjustice.net |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623132234/http://www.libertynjustice.net/gettoknow_dale.php |archivedate=2013-06-23 |df= }}</ref> The album was heavily criticized by both Bride fans and reviewers who did not know what to make of the album.{{cn|date=February 2015}} The album mixed in rap-core metal which was uniquely different from their entire musical catalog.
