'''''Choreutis porphyratma''''' is a [[moth]] in the family [[Choreutidae]]. It was described by [[Edward Meyrick|Meyrick]] in 1930. It is found in [[New Guinea]].<ref>[http://choreutidae.lifedesks.org/pages/426 choreutidae.lifedesks.org]</ref>

The [[wingspan]] is about 14&nbsp;mm. The forewings are bright chestnut-brown, the basal area orange-ochreous sprinkled with white and there are two rather irregular fasciae of white irroration, the first attenuated and forming a small white spot on the costa, the second bisected towards the costa by a line of groundcolour and forming two such spots, both in the disc suffused purplish and thinly sprinkled dark fuscous, the first antemedian, slightly excurved, preceded on the costa by a small dark purple-fuscous spot, the second from two-thirds of the costa to before the tornus, more excurved, the inner edge contorted in the disc, between these some purplish and dark fuscous suffusion in the disc. There is a subterminal shade of white irroration on the costal half. The hindwings are dark fuscous with an elongate-triangular orange discal patch extending from the base to two-thirds, separated by a brownish-orange transverse blotch with two spots of dark fuscous suffusion from a narrow orange terminal fascia attenuated to the apex. A broader light orange fascia mixed grey irroration and suffusion is found along the dorsum.<ref>[http://www.bhl-europe.eu/static/a070rxzv/a070rxzv_full_ocr.txt Exotic Microlep. 4: 5]</ref>
