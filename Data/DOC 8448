Title : Abstinence (conscription)
Text : The '''Abstinence''' ({{lang-he|הִסתַגְפוּת}}, [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi pronunciation]]: ''Histagfus'') tactic of [[draft evasion]] was a type of [[hunger strike]] (or other forms of self-harm, such as [[sleep deprivation]], tending to cause [[tachycardia]], or [[self-inflicted wound]]), employed by young men in the Russian Empire's Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] (and in neighboring Austria-Hungary's [[History of the Jews in Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galician community]]), in order to be found unfit for military service by the Imperial authorities.

==Russian Empire==
The "Abstension" resistance by self-harm was most extreme in the Russian Empire under the [[Cantonist]] system implemented for Jews from 1827 - 1856,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dubnow|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Dubnow|title=History of the Jews in Russia and Poland.

An 1835 secret report by the chief of the [[Special Corps of Gendarmes]] in [[Vilnius]] expressed the government's difficulty in preventing self-mutilations.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=ChaeRan Y.|editor-last=Freeze|editor2-first=Jay M.|editor2-last=Harris|title=Everyday Jewish Life in Imperial Russia: Select Documents, 1772-1914|chapter=Self-Mutilation to Avoid Military Service|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3QiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA520|date=2013|publisher=Brandies University Press|pages=520–521}}</ref>

The phenomenon was covered in the Russian Hebrew press, and ''[[Ha-Melitz]]'' warned against the practice as [[Damages (Jewish law)#Self-Injury and Self-Endangerment|violating Jewish law]] as well as Russian law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Penslar|first=Derek|title=Jews and the Military: A History|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=31, 48–49}}</ref>  The phenomenon of self-induced [[hernia]] received attention in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Medical Items: Hernia Among Russian Army Recruits|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=18 April 1891|page=560|doi=10.1001/jama.1891.02410680018007|volume=XVI}}</ref>

Just before World War I, the Jewish author and folklorist [[S. Ansky]] conducted an ethnographic survey of Russian Empire regions of [[Volhynia]] and [[Podolia]], devoting a section of his large questionnaire to conscription-related cultural practices.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nathaniel|last=Deutsch|authorlink=Nathaniel Deutsch|title=The Jewish Dark Continent: Life and Death in the Russian Pale of Settlement|chapter=O.

==Austro-Hungarian Empire==
Concription among Jews in Galicia was introduced by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1788.
