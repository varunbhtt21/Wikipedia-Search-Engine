Siedle was described as "a man large in frame, stooped, with a big cigar drooping from the corner of his mouth... He looked a bit like the Winston Churchill of today." <ref>"Life with the Met", by Helen Klaffky Noble, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1954. pg 7.</ref> He was rarely seen without a black fedora hat and a cigar in his mouth.<ref>"Twenty Thousand Distinct Objects in the Opera's Property Room", The Sun, Feb 25, 1912, pg 16</ref> His office was described as "cluttered with books, papers, boxes, wigs, and full of a truly startling and heterogeneous collection of furniture, hangings, materials, and odds and ends."<ref>"Life with the Met", by Helen Klaffky Noble, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1954. pg 8.</ref>

Siedle was a member of St. Cecile Lodge 568, F. & A. M.<ref name=obituary /> He had four dogs of various breeds which he frequently brought to his office.<ref name=noble12>"Life with the Met", by Helen Klaffky Noble, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1954. pg 12.</ref>

==Career==
Siedle began his career helping out the visiting property men at a theatre in his home town of Dulwich, where he received his first permanent job as "props" at the age of 17, receiving 2 shillings a week. After one season, a visiting showman brought him to London to be a regular props man at a small theatre.<ref name=obituary /> He began working at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] with [[James Henry Mapleson]].<ref name=tannhauser>"Behind the Curtain with "Tannhauser' At the Metropolitan", Sylvester Rawling, The Evening World, March 2, 1912, Final Edition, Page 6</ref> While there, one of his teachers was Bradwell (first name unknown), a famed property man and theatre mechanic.<ref name=obituary />

Siedle first came to the US on one of the opera tours of Mapleson. [[John Lester Wallack|Lester Wallack]] brought him to the US in the 1870s, where he remained. He toured with a company for two seasons at $7 a week. After the tour, he settled in New York City and became the technical director for the [[Wallack's Theatre|Star Theatre]].<ref name=obituary /> He began working at the Metropolitan Opera around 1891<ref name=obituary /><ref>"Back Stage at the Metropolitan, It is Caruso the Man Who Will Be Missed", New York Tribune, August 2, 1921, pg 2</ref> and became property master within the next decade.<ref>"Magic: Stage Illusions and Scientific Diversions, Including Trick Photography", compiled and edited by Albert A. Hopkins, Munn & Company, 1901, pg 251.</ref>

Around 1900, he built a life-size elephant for ''[[Wang (musical)|Wang]]'', where [[De Wolf Hopper]] sang "The Man With an Elephant on His Hands." It was such an achievement in the property business that it gained him fame and publicity.<ref name=obituary /> A play titled "Cupid Outwits Adam" at the [[Bijou Theatre (Manhattan)|Bijou Theatre]] in 1900 actually advertised a "mechanical effect by Edward Siedle" to help draw in audiences.<ref>"Cupid Outwits Adam", New York Times, September 11, 1900</ref> A 1909 news article called Siedle "[t]he greatest master of properties in America",<ref name=wizard>"The Wizard of Wiseland", Rock Island Argus, September 1, 1909, Page 6.</ref> while a 1911 news article described him as "responsible for so many of the fine scenic effects at the opera house".<ref>"The Metropolitan Season", The Sun, New York, October 2, 1911, Page 7</ref>

Siedle became the technical director at the Met before 1909.<ref>"Metropolitan Plans Great Opera Season", New York Times, September 13, 1909.</ref> As technical director, Siedle was one of only two department heads (the other being Toscanini, the first conductor) to report directly to Gatti.<ref name=business>"The Business Side of Opera", by Pierre V.R. Key, The Saturday Evening Post, vol 184, issue 7, March 30, 1912, pg 20</ref> The 1909 season had twenty new productions, including premieres or complete restagings. The scenery for the various operas was built and painted in Milan, Germany or Paris, as well as in New York by the Metropolitan's scenic artist, James Fox. In 1909, the estimated cost of the costumes and scenery for the season was over $100,000 (equivalent to $2.6 million in 2012).<ref name=early>"Early Preparations for the Season at the Metropolitan", The New York Times, September 26, 1909.</ref> The cost of the scenery and properties for a single opera under Siedle's management ranged from $10,000 to $50,000.<ref name=business />

He was credited as the technical director in the playbill for the world premiere of ''La fanciulla del west'' at the Metropolitan Opera (the first world premiere in the Met's history) on December 10, 1910.<ref>"The Complete Operas of Puccini: A Critical Guide" by Charles Osborne, Da Capo Press, 1983, pg 179. 9780306802003.</ref> The decision to place the production of scenery, properties, costumes and effects in the hands of Edward Siedle was reached at a conference in Paris held by Gatti-Casazza, Puccini, Tito Ricordi, and his New York representative, Mr. Maxwell.<ref>"Musical News and Notes", The New York Times, July 24, 1910</ref>

As technical director, Siedle was in charge of fifty stage carpenters, twenty property men, thirty electricians, five engineers, sixty wardrobe women. He oversaw the Met's seven storehouses <ref>"Life with the Met", by Helen Klaffky Noble, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1954. pg 89.</ref> (their locations included 40th St, between 7th and 8th Avenues; 41st St near 8th Avenue; 36th St near 11th Avenue; 50th Street near 11th Ave; 44th St near 11th Ave; and 41st St near 1st Ave).<ref name=after>"After the Opera is Over at the Metropolitan", New York Times, January 29, 1911</ref> The storehouses of the Met held about one hundred complete productions, representing a total investment of $3,000,000<ref name=business /> and employed an additional 12 workers.<ref>"The Business Side of Opera", by Pierre V.R. Key, The Saturday Evening Post, vol 184, issue 7, March 30, 1912, pg 18</ref>

Under Siedle's reign, the technical department at the Met built up one of the finest musical and theatrical libraries in the US at the time.<ref name=obituary /> Siedle had a suite of rooms on the second floor of the building for his offices. They contained books on different kinds of architecture and costumes. He also kept many of the scenic models on display, whether the opera was performed at the Met, or whether the show had never made it to the stage.<ref name=early />

==Legacy==
Upon his death, the New York Times wrote that Siedle was "often called 'the invisible autocrat of the opera'," in reference to how he ruled over everything on the technical side, and no opera could proceed without his permission and approval.<ref name=obituary />
