:* ''Reviewed'': not a self-nom
<small>Moved to mainspace by [[User:CWH|CWH]] ([[User talk:CWH|talk]]). Nominated by [[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) at 22:26, 26 April 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] This newly created article passes the DYK criteria of newness and length. The hook fact is cited but other facts in the sentence concerned are not present in the source. [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 09:12, 30 April 2014 (UTC) 
::* Could you please be more specific? What facts are not in the source? -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 19:09, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
:::*The sentence in the article that states "In 1897, to facilitate faculty and students getting to and from the school, he built a road in the Shanghai French Concession with his own money which was later named Route Ferguson." [[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]] ([[User talk:Cwmhiraeth|talk]]) 10:59, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

::::*[[File:Symbol possible vote.svg|16px]] [[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]], it's been over two weeks with no further action. Please respond. Many thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 21:44, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::*Thanks for the reminder. I've added a reference for the rest of the sentence. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 23:54, 18 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::*[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]], the references/notes could use some work. In particular, there are two Harvard-style notes that don't point to any reference at all, but this may be only part of the issue. I think the intent is to reference a couple of Ferguson's "Major works" from the section before, but that isn't valid referencing; the books have to be listed separately as references. I've cleaned up a couple of other footnotes that appeared to include external links, but more needs to be done. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 03:26, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::::* I fixed all the reference problems I could find, including the ones you mentioned above. Please let me know if there's anything else. -[[User:Zanhe|Zanhe]] ([[User talk:Zanhe|talk]]) 05:55, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::::*[[User:Cwmhiraeth|Cwmhiraeth]], have your issues been settled, and are the reference section issues now in order? [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 03:35, 23 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol voting keep.svg|16px]] The other part of the sentence to which I referred has now been referenced. As this is to a Chinese language source, I am unable to verify the information and therefore accept it in good faith. I think this nomination is now good to go.
