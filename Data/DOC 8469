The '''World Federation of Teachers Unions''' known by its French initials FISE (Federation Internationale Syndicale de L'Enseignement) is an international trade union of educators affiliated with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

== History ==

The FISE was founded in Paris in July 1946 as a merger of the [[International Professional Secretariat of Education]] and ''[[l’Internationale des Travailleurs de l’Enseignement]]'' (ITE), with the participation of the [[American Education Association]].<ref>''[https://archive.org/details/dudeman5685_yahoo_WFTU The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985. ]'' Prague; Published by the WTFU in cooperation with PRACE Czechoslovak Trade Unions 1985 p.152</ref>  In 1951 a group of unions split off and founded the [[International Federation of Free Teachers Unions]].<ref>[[A. Percy Coldrick|Coldrick, A. Percy]] and [[Philip James Jones|Jones, Philip]]. ''The international directory of the trade union movement'' New York : Facts on File, [1978] p.198</ref>

 During the 1980s it cooperated with the [[International Federation of Teachers Unions]] (then affiliated with the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]]), the [[World Federation of Educators]] (affiliated with the [[World Confederation of Labour]]) and the [[World Federation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession]].<ref>''The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985'' p.152</ref>

FISE is [[Consultative Status|an organization with consultative status]] with [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).<ref>[http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100045205 UNESCO profile]</ref> It has had its position within UNESCO since at least 1985.<ref>''The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985'' p.152</ref>

== Action ==

FISE takes actively part in the Worker’s Group of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), as well as in conferences of all of the above international organisations.
During the previous period it actively participated in most activities of the WFTU and took initiatives which strengthened the renown and the strength of the organisation.
In 2013 it organized an international conference in Brussels on “the role of teachers today, today’s school, public education, democracy in education” and  published a book with the proceedings.
It held meetings with trade unionists teachers from different countries and unions: Cuba, Germany, Egypt, Palestine, Greece, Italy, Mexico, etc.
FISE publishes every year announcements and posters useful for every trade union, concerning the International Workers’ May Day (May 1), the International Teachers Day, the International Women's Day (March 8), the Day of the Anti-fascist Victory of Peoples (May 9), the day against violence towards women, against child labour, for the refugees, the xenophobia and racism, and other relevant topics or subjects of commemoration. 
It particularly focuses on the expression of concrete solidarity.
It denounced the killings and police attacks against the Mexican teachers. 
One of the most important actions that FISE undertook in Greece was the solidarity campaign for the children of Palestine, entitled "a notebook for GAZA".  Many students, parents, parents' associations, cultural associations, women's associations,  responded to the invitation of FISE and gathered materials. They organized theatrical performances in which the ticket was two notebooks or other school supplies. Discussions have been held by teachers to students on the situation in Palestine. Painting exhibitions on the Palestinian matter were organised, as well as other initiatives, too.

== Organization ==

The organizations highest organ is the Statutory Conference, formerly called the World Conference of Teachers. Originally annual events, they were held at irregular intervals in the 1950s and now are constitutionally mandated to be held every four years.<ref>''Facts about international Communist front organisations'' pp. 57-8</ref><ref>[http://wftufise.org/constitution/ Constitution]</ref> Between meetings of this conference the organization is headed by an Administrative Committee which meets at least once a year.<ref>''Facts about international Communist front organisations'' p. 56</ref><ref>[http://wftufise.org/constitution/ Constitution]</ref> Day to operations are directed by a Bureau which consists of the General Secretary, President, Vice-President and Secretariat, who are ex-officio members of the Administrative Committee.<ref>[http://wftufise.org/constitution/ Constitution]</ref>

FISE was originally headquartered in Paris but was expelled in 1952 for "[[fifth column]] activities". It then moved to the Soviet sector of [[Vienna]], but was expelled, again, in February 1956. The location of the headquarters immediately after the expulsion from Vienna is unclear, though FISEs' journal ''Teachers of the World'' was published from 10 [[Rue de Solférino]], Paris [[7ème arrondissement, Paris|7ème]].<ref>''Facts about international Communist front organisations'' p. 55</ref> In 1978 its headquarters is reported at [[Wilhelm Wolff Strasse]] 21, [[East Berlin]] 111.<ref>Coldrick and Jones p.199</ref> It was at the same address in 1985.<ref>''The World Federation of Trade Unions, 1945-1985'' p.152</ref> Its current headquarters is at 6/6 Kalicharan Ghosh Road, 700 050, [[Kolkata]], [[India]].<ref>[http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100045205 UNESCO profile]</ref> After the 18th Congress of FISE is currently located in Mexico.<ref>Fraccionamiento Riviera 1, código postal 58195, Colonia Ana María Gallaga, calle circuito Insurgentes núm. 199 Ciudad de Morelia, Michoacán de Ocampo, México, Estados Unidos Mexicanos.
