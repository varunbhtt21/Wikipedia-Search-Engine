'''Emmanuel Renaut''' (born 26 January 1968) is a [[France|French]] [[chef]], three [[Guide Michelin|Michelin stars]] and [[Meilleur Ouvrier de France]] in 2004. A former sous-chef of [[Marc Veyrat]], he then founded his own restaurant ''Flocons de sel'' at [[Mégève]].

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Soisy-sous-Montmorency]] in the department of [[Val d'Oise]], Emmanuel Renaut grew up in the department of [[Aisne]]. During his childhood, he got interested in mountain and [[skiing]] during trips at [[Les Houches]] in [[Haute-Savoie]]. He made his [[military service]] at [[Chambéry]] with the [[Chasseurs Alpins]].

He joined the CFA of [[Laon]] in 1984, training in [[Étouvelles]] and then in [[Paris]]. He joined the team of the Hôtel Le Lotti and then worked for [[Christian Constant]] at the [[Hôtel de Crillon]] as a first cooking assistant. He was then hired temporarily by [[Marc Veyrat]], head chef of the ''Auberge de l'Eridan'' in [[Veyrier-du-Lac]], and became a sous-chef for four years. He then worked with the cooking and pastry chef [[Yves Thuriès]] and later in [[London]] where he was for one year the head chef of ''[[Claridge's]]''.

In 1998, Emmanuel Renaut established himself in [[Mégève]] in [[Haute-Savoie]] and founded his own restaurant ''Flocons de sel''. He received his first Michelin star in 2003, the second one in 2006, and his third in 2012. In 2007, he published ''La Montagne et le cuisinier'' with Isabelle Hintzy and Catherine de Montalembert.

In 2012, Emmanuel Renaut was named "Cooking Chef of the Year", succeeding to [[Jean-François Piège]] (2011), [[Gilles Goujon]] (2010), [[Éric Fréchon]] (2009), [[Yannick Alléno]] (2008) and [[Anne-Sophie Pic]] (2007).

== Cooking style ==
For the [[food critic]] [[Gilles Pudlowski]], Emmanuel Renaut belongs to a "new generation of chef who re-invent the local products with malice", which brings him closer from chef [[Alain Passard]]. [[François Simon (food critic)|François Simon]] estimates his cooking style "very close from the [[savoie|Savoyard]] local products". The chief redactor of the [[Guide Michelin]] Juliane Caspar qualifies his style of "very subtle" and find his compositions very "surprising and harmonious".

== Personal life ==
The family of Emmanuel Renaut is from [[Picardy]]. His mother Bernadette Clément owns a [[gîte]] in [[Coucy-lès-Eppes]], [[Aisne]]. He met his wife Kristine during his trip in London. She works at the secretary of the ''[[Claridge's]]''. They have three children.
