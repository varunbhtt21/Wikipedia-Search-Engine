==Plot==
{{long plot|date=May 2019}}<!--"Too long" means over 400 words per MOS:TVPLOT. Therefore do NOT remove tag until episode is under 400 words.-->
===In Meereen===
Daenerys receives a citizen who wants to be sold back into slavery because he feels his life as a high-ranking slave was better than as a freedman. An astonished Daenerys reluctantly grants his request. The next citizen in line brings her the charred remains of his daughter, who was killed by Drogon, one of her dragons. While Drogon has not returned, she tearfully chains her two other dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, away in the catacombs as a precaution.

===Beyond the Wall===
Jon meets with Mance Rayder, ostensibly to discuss an end to their conflict, although Jon actually plans to assassinate him. Though Mance eventually sees through Jon's ruse and nearly kills him, their negotiations are cut short when a massive cavalry charge led by Stannis and Davos overruns the wildling encampment. Mance surrenders, and though Stannis thinks to kill him, Jon suggests taking him captive instead, as Mance once showed him similar mercy. After holding a funeral for the deceased brothers, Jon burns Ygritte's remains north of the Wall, following Tormund's request.

Further north, Bran and his companions reach their destination: the large Heart Tree seen in Jojen's vision. Upon approaching the tree, they are set upon by a group of wights. Though Jojen is killed in the attack, Bran, Hodor, and Meera are saved by a Child of the Forest. The Child takes the group into the cave under the Heart Tree to meet an old man sitting amongst tree roots, who tells Bran that while he will never be able to walk again, he will be able to fly.

===In King's Landing===
The Mountain lies dying from Oberyn's poisoned spear. Qyburn believes that he can save Clegane, so Cersei ousts a protesting Grand Maester Pycelle from his laboratory and gives Clegane's care over to Qyburn. Qyburn cautions Cersei that, while he may be able to save Clegane, the procedure may "change" him. He assures her, however, that his procedure will not weaken him.

Afterwards, Cersei tells Tywin that, if forced to marry Loras, she will admit her incestuous relationship with Jaime, and that her children are the issue of such. She leaves an outraged Tywin to meet Jaime in the Kingsguard's quarters, where she professes her love for him, and the two rekindle their relationship.

In the dungeons, Tyrion awaits his execution, but Jaime appears and helps him escape. They say their farewells in an underground tunnel, but Tyrion instead uses a small hidden passage to sneak into the Tower of the Hand. He finds Shae in his father Tywin's bed. Shae, who had [[The Laws of Gods and Men|falsely testified against Tyrion]] at his trial, initially thinks this is Tywin and addresses him as "my lion", as she had previously done for Tyrion. Realising who he is, she attacks him with a knife, but Tyrion manages to strangle her to death.

Tyrion then readies Joffrey's crossbow and confronts Tywin on the privy and confesses that he had loved Shae. Tywin does not believe that Tyrion would actually shoot him. He tries to negotiate, but twice dismisses Shae as a whore, despite Tyrion's warning the first time. After the second time, Tyrion kills him with Joffrey's crossbow.

Tyrion then escapes on a ship bound for Essos with help from Varys. After hearing the bells in the castle raising the alarm, Varys decides to board the ship as well.
===In the Vale===
Brienne and Podrick happen across Arya and the Hound. After Podrick recognises the Hound, Brienne deduces Arya's identity and tells her of her oath to Catelyn. The Hound is unconvinced of her loyalties, pointing out her Lannister sword, and the matter quickly comes to blows. After a brutal brawl, Brienne knocks the Hound off a cliff, and unsuccessfully searches for Arya. After they leave, Arya emerges from hiding and finds the Hound grievously injured. Though he begs her for death, she instead takes his money and leaves him, presumably to die. Travelling by horse to a harbor, she attempts to buy passage north, only to be told the ship is bound for Essos. Upon hearing that the captain is travelling home to Braavos, she chooses to travel there, showing him [[Valar Morghulis|the coin Jaqen H'ghar gave her]].
