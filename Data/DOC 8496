The '''Al-Zahra College for Women''' is a private college in [[Oman]]. It was founded in the academic year 1999/2000 and is located in Airport Heights [[Muscat, Oman]].

==History==
The Al-Zahra College for Women (ZCW) began the academic year 1999/2000 with 50 students. The college has from its foundation been associated with the [[Al-Ahliyya Amman University]] in Jordan, and is under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Oman)|Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) of the Sultanate of Oman]]. When the college first opened it offered two-year diploma courses in computer science, accounting, business administration, finance & banking, English philology and literature. On 13 April 2003, the MoHE allowed the continuation of the diploma courses as undergraduate courses. A year later, in February 2004, the College asked the MoHE for permission to begin awarding its own bachelor's degrees; this was granted. That year the college also set up a Department of Graphic Design. For quality assurance and strategic planning a "Planning & Quality Assurance Department" was established on 1 September 2005.

On 27 May 2012 BankDhofar sponsored an open day at the Al Zahra College for Women which was part of an entire week of activities including exhibitions and a showcase of Omani food, traditional handicrafts and Omani fashion. The Open Day was very well attended by students and staff of the college.<ref name="jaz">{{cite web|url=http://www.smartoman.com/finance-a-economy/banking/6742-bankdhofar-sponsors-open-day-at-al-zahra-college-for-women |title=BANKDHOFAR SPONSORS OPEN DAY AT AL ZAHRA COLLEGE FOR WOMEN |publisher=SmartOman.com |place=Qatar |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2014-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427205322/http://www.smartoman.com/finance-a-economy/banking/6742-bankdhofar-sponsors-open-day-at-al-zahra-college-for-women |archivedate=2014-04-27 }}</ref>
