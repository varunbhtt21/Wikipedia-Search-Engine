This article has superficial referenciness, but the references are not actually about the subject, they are about her half-brother [[Bobby Fischer]]; there's not even much coverage from sources on her husband [[Russell Targ]], the [[remote viewing|goat-staring]] proponent. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 22:43, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. I agree with the nominator's comments about superficial references about her brother, and have been working to add more references that are primarily about Targ's own work on computer literacy. As well as a local-newspaper obituary that probably doesn't do much for notability (but at least sources her death) I added several book and contemporary magazine sources that cover her directly, not in the context of her more notable relatives. However, I may have too much of a COI to express a keep-or-delete opinion in this AfD, as I went to high school with her sons, was friends at that time with others who had gone through her programs, and was personally acquainted with her although I did not go through those programs myself (they were at the middle school that I would have attended had I moved there earlier than I did). —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 20:44, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*<s>I would '''merge''' a couple sentences into her husband's article. I don't see substantial coverage in reliable independent sources to justify an independent articles on this individual.</s> [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
**If a merge, why her husband as merge target? We have better sourcing for the connection between her and her brother. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 00:50, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Well, a Google Book search does turn up some discussion of her career. And since there is not a single merge target (her brother is very famous and her husband also has a separate article), perhaps it's best to leave it as a stand alone article. Not super notable, but there's enough for a short article. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 01:15, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' The article focuses too much on the organic farming stuff and not enough on her activities as an educator, but as an educator she was truly notable. Even I had heard about her brilliant idea, in the early 1980s, of employing high school students to teach computer basics to elementary school teachers. (I added that to the article.) Her notability is quite distinct from that of either her brother or her husband. I see that the article has been considerably improved since being nominated. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 19:51, 16 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''week keep''' the IS [http://books.google.com/books?id=Dwvc24nC0IQC&pg=PA219&dq=%22Joan+Targ%22+computer&hl=en&sa=X&ei=as13U8__K86myATjiILoBQ&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Joan%20Targ%22%20computer&f=false] and her peer tutoring programs seem to have gotten a bit of press back in the day and she is named pretty widely as an advocate. And while it is focused on her brother, there is the ability to build a pretty detailed biography of her early life.-- [[User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|<span style="color:red;;;">TRPoD <small>aka The Red Pen of Doom</small></span>]] 21:31, 17 May 2014 (UTC)
