==The White Book==
In 1939, Molkte was made the editor of ''The White Book'', a collection of German diplomatic documents intended to prove the "war guilt" of Poland, where Molkte selectively edited the documents such as exercising his warning to Berlin in a cable he sent in March 1939 warning that Poland would go to war if the ''Reich'' sought to alter the status of the Free City of Danzig.<ref>Weinberg, Gehard ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany'', New York: Enigma, 2010 pages 656-657.</ref>  
For his work in German foreign policy after the outbreak of war, the German Historical Institute has republished a press photo from 1939:<br> 
: '' "Alleged War Guilt: The former German Ambassador to Poland, Hans-Adolf von Moltke, demonstrated foreign press representatives archive material from Warsaw as  proof "for the debt of Poland at the outbreak of war (Fall 1939). The photo shows the former German Ambassador to Poland, Hans-Adolf von Moltke, at the screening of archive material from Warsaw before foreign press representatives, to "prove" the war guilt of Poland."'
