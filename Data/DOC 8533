This template is virtually unused and implies violations of [[WP:FRINGE]] and [[WP:SYN]]. It is redundant to the much more widely used {{tl|Infobox alternative medicine}} and {{tl|Alternative medicine}}.

The three articles in which it is currently used, are only loosely associated. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 20:25, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
