'''Sea Serpent''' is a [[steel roller coaster]] at [[Morey's Piers]] in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]]. Opened in 1984, it was built by [[Vekoma]], and was the first [[Vekoma Boomerang|boomerang-style coaster]] to be built in the US.<ref name="RCDB Vekoma shuttles">{{cite RCDB|coaster_name= List of Vekoma shuttle roller coasters in the USA, sorted by date|location= |rcdb_number= |accessdate= April 26, 2014 |url=http://rcdb.com/r.htm?order=-10&ot=2&nm=na&pl=59&ca=115&co=6836&page=2 }}</ref> The coaster's installation was part of a redevelopment of the Marine Pier into a new Mariner's Landing area in 1984.<ref name="Hunt's Pier">{{cite book |last1=Ascough |first1=Rob |last2=Alven |first2=Al |date=2011 |title=Hunt's Pier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riEMrzESQyQC |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page= |isbn=0738573094 |accessdate=April 26, 2014 }}</ref> The Sea Serpent currently sits in the middle of Mariners Landing and serves as the icon for the pier.

Riders board yellow, orange and green [[Train (roller coaster)|trains]] to go with the theme. The train begins its backwards climb up the first of the ride's two 116 foot lift hills, both of which are placed diagonally towards each other. The train continues to slowly rise for thirty seconds before dropping at forty-seven miles per hour right through the station and through the coaster's first inversion, a [[Cobra Roll]], exerting as many as 5.2 g's on riders throughout the two elements. The train then goes through a [[Loop (roller coaster)|Loop]] before ending up on the second lift section. The second lift pulls riders upwards for a few seconds, then releases, sending riders backwards. The train encounters the loop first this time, only to then go through the cobra roll once again which leads riders back through the station and partially up the first lift section again. The train then slowly lowers back down into the station, having sent riders through 935 feet of three inversions in total, both forwards and backwards.<ref> Coaster-net [http://www.coaster-net.com/sea-serpent.html] </ref>

==Incidents==

In June 1998 the coaster suffered its first ever accident, injuring 14 of the 23 riders on board, some of whom were stranded upside down. According to Will Morey, chief executive officer of the Morey Organization, the accident was thought to have been due to a wheel coming off a rear axle, causing the coaster train to jerk to a stop midway through the ride, as it was looping backwards.<ref name="Philly.com">{{cite news |last=Urgo |first=Jacqueline L. |date=June 30, 1998 |title=Investigators Seek Cause Of Ride Mishap It Was The Wildwood Attraction's First Accident.
