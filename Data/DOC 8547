'''Leonard Birman''' (born September 28, 1932) is a Canadian actor, who began his career in Montreal. In his 45 years on stage, screen and radio, he has portrayed a wide variety of characters, including some choice roles in classical and contemporary theatre.

== Early life and career ==
Birman was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada, the second son of Maurice Lieb Birman, who was a millinery designer, and Anna Birman, a marriage that lasted 70 years.  He graduated from [[Baron Byng High School]] in 1949 as class president, and within months he was captivated by the stage and the discovery of being naturally at home on it.  He had been a good student and now had no interest at all in continuing on to college.

His earliest influences came by way of the STAGE series, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s radio productions of original plays and international classics beginning in the early 1940s.  As a long time fan, he was honored and humbled to be joining the remaining members of the troupe when he moved to Toronto in 1962. He soon became a mainstay, playing dozens of pivotal roles.

Coincidental with his first appearances in community theatre (1955), CBC/Radio Canada announced plans for their first live English and French television series to be produced in Montreal.  Called ''Dateline'' on the English language channel and ''Je Me Souviens'' on the French language channel, it aired on alternate Friday nights with the same cast. His audition won him his first TV role.

Birman's film experience began almost simultaneously with the arrival of The [[National Film Board of Canada]] to new headquarters and studios in Montreal. That, together with CBC's new television activity, presented the possibility of acting as a vocation. Until then, radio drama was the only ongoing paid professional work, and Birman was to be married in September 1956.

By that time, Birman, together with George Bloomfield, director, and M. Charles Cohen, playwright, created [[Domino Productions]], a stage ensemble for which Birman produced, played leading roles and exercised his innate talent for art by designing the sets, posters and programs. As a youngster, he had thought he would study art in Paris but his inclination toward theatre proved more persuasive.  He had already contributed skits to various annual Variety shows, including [[McGill University]]'s ''Red And White Revue'', [[YMHA]]′s ''Variety Gang'' and [[B'nai B'rith]]'s ''Notes To You''.  Birman spearheaded the founding of [[Cafe Andre]]'s ''Up Tempo'', a highly successful satirical revue, which was the first of its kind in Canada and ran well into the 1960s.

Busy with Domino, he also made TV appearances in minor roles on CBC's Dorchester Theatre, Explorations, Theatre Populaire, Shoestring Theatre, Les Plouffes, A Midsummer Theatre, and in 44 episodes of CBC's first filmed series, ''The Adventures of Radisson'', which was known as ''Tomahawk'' on American television.
At this time, (1955–57), he appeared in three films for the NFB's ''Perspective'' series, and performed his first leading role in a teleplay called ''Etc...'', which grew out of Domino and was written by Cohen and directed by Bloomfield for Guest Stage.

In 1957, Domino's rehearsal schedule of ''A View From The Bridge'' came to a sudden end when it was learned that the American touring company of the same play, starring Luther Adler, was due for a limited run at Her Majesty's Theater and that casting of  the minor roles would be done locally. Birman was cast as Mike and later in the tour played Rodolpho, the role he was earlier slated to play with Domino.

The following year, he rejoined the company of ''A View From The Bridge'' for the pre-Broadway tour of what was to be the first presentation of the extended version of Arthur Miller's one act play. Sadly, it closed in Washington. That summer Birman went off to Nantucket to play the role of Macbeth.

Later that year he was invited to join New York's Institute for Advanced Study In Theatre Arts under the tutelage of Jacques Charron of Comedie Francaise, Paris, Yuri Zavadsky of Moscow Art Theatre, and Willie Schmidt of Schiller Theatre, Berlin.

On television in New York (1958-1963), he appeared on Armstrong Circle Theatre, Robert Herridge Theatre, All Family Classics, Dupont Show of the Month, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Actors TV Theatre, The Witness. Among these were roles in ''Cyrano de Bergerac'', ''The Three Musketeers'', ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'', and ''The Prisoner of Zenda''. Birman's first U.S. screen credit was for a role on ''Naked City''.

Birman has also instructed advanced acting students and coached professional actors. He served as guest lecturer and/or instructor at the [[National Theatre School of Canada]], [[Manitoba School of Theatre and Allied Arts]], [[The Okanagan Summer Arts Festival]] and [[The Hub of Hollywood]].
