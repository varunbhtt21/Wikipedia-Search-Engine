Frank was a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].

==Artist==
Frank's father, the Rev. Prof. [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] was artistic, as was Frank's mother, Henrietta Grace Smyth, and her mother, [[Eliza Anne "Annarella" Warington|Annarella Warington]] and Henrietta's father, [[William Henry Smyth]]; and so, too, were some of Frank's siblings, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert]] in particular. But Frank was the only one of this artistically-talented family to make a living from his brush.<ref>The Story of Baden-Powell 'The Wolf That Never Sleeps' by Harold Begbie https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3847208438
