==Career==

===Times Newspapers===
Peter began his career while still a post-graduate student at Oxford writing a dissertation on Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. An undergraduate friend was writing theatre reviews for ''[[The Times]]'', and after his friend left the university Peter applied to ''The Times''. He was interviewed and asked to submit a few short reviews of university productions.<ref name=stefanova20>Stefanova, Kalina. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nd9kAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 ''Who Keeps the Score on the London Stages?'']. [[Routledge]], 2013. pp. 20–21.</ref>

He applied and was accepted as a reporter and editorial assistant for the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' from 1964 to 1967. This was a three-year apprenticeship, during which he saw a lot of London theatre and became a freelance theatre critic, submitting reviews more and more frequently to ''The Times''.<ref name=debretts /><ref name=stefanova20 />

From 1967 to 1979, Peter was on ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' editorial staff, contributing theatre reviews regularly.<ref name=debretts /><ref name=chief /> He became the newspaper's assistant arts editor in 1979.<ref name=debretts /><ref name=stefanova20 /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LWtRAAAAYAAJ&q=%22JOHN+PETER+is+assistant+arts+editor+of+the+Sunday+Times%22 ''Drama'']. [[British Theatre Association]], 1984. p. 37.</ref>

In September 1984 Peter became chief drama critic of ''The Sunday Times''.<ref name=chief>"John Peter". ''[[Sunday Times]]''. 9 September 1984. p. 40.</ref> He continued in this position through 2003, following which he was the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' contributing drama critic through to 2010.<ref name=debretts /><ref>Peter, John. [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stairway-to-success-vc3jnrh3hz6 "Stairway to success"]. ''[[Sunday Times]]''. 20 June 2010.</ref>

In February 2003, ''[[Really Useful Group#Really Useful Magazines|Theatregoer]]'' magazine listed and interviewed him as one of 11 critics called the "most powerful people in theatre".<ref>Carmichael, Nicole. [http://malcolmrock.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/londoncritic_theatregoer.pdf "The most powerful people in theatre?"] ''[[Really Useful Group#Really Useful Magazines|Theatregoer Magazine]]''. February 2003. pp.&nbsp;26–30.</ref>

===Ian Charleson Award===
Peter saw and reviewed [[Ian Charleson]]'s extraordinary ''Hamlet'' at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in late 1989.<ref>Peter, John. "A Hamlet who would be king at Elsimore". ''[[Sunday Times]]''. 12 November 1989.</ref> Unbeknownst to the audience, Charleson performed it during the last weeks of his life while he was seriously ill with AIDS, and died in January 1990 at the age of 40 eight weeks after his final performance. In November 1990, in memory of Charleson's fine performance, Peter established the annual [[Ian Charleson Award]], to recognise and reward the best classical stage performance by an actor under age 30.<ref name=princes>Peter, John. "A prize fit for princes". ''[[Sunday Times]]''. 11 November 1990.</ref><ref name=rosenthal>Rosenthal, Daniel. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BA3DAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP587 ''The National Theatre Story'']. [[Oberon Books]], 2013. p. 446.</ref> The awards are jointly sponsored by ''The Sunday Times'' and the National Theatre, where they are held.<ref name=rosenthal/> Recipients receive a cash prize, as do runners-up and third-place winners.

Upon founding the awards, he noted:

{{quote|Classical work is the solid bedrock of all acting. It is classical acting, with its twin demands of psychological perception and formal excellence, which truly tests and proves the actor's ability and stamina, both physical and mental.<ref name=princes />}}

The first annual Ian Charleson Award was presented in January 1991.<ref>"Timely tributes for a new generation of actors". ''[[Sunday Times]]''. 13 January 1991.</ref> The awards defined a classic play as one written prior to 1900;<ref name=princes /> this cut-off was eventually extended to 1918. The awards are presented at a friendly, low-key private luncheon at one of the restaurants at the National Theatre. There is no filming and no outside press, and there are no acceptance speeches; the awards are attended however by Britain's theatre royalty, who take great interest in preserving the foundations of their profession. Prize recipients and shortlist nominees receive a plaque signed by the judges, who usually number four and until 2017 always included Peter.

As the founding judge of the Ian Charleson Awards, Peter was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2019 Birthday Honours]] for services to theatre.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=62666|supp=y|page=B20|date=8 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=MBE>[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/807390/Birthday-Honours-2019_-the-Prime-Ministers-List__1_.pdf#page=133 "Birthday Honours 2019: The Prime Minister's List"].
