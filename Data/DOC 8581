Title : Tip link
Text : [[File:The Tailchaser mutation does not affect formation of interstereocilial links.png|thumb|250px|Pictures G-N show the tip links connecting the stereocilia.]]

'''Tip links''' are extracellular filaments that connect [[stereocilia]] to each other or to the [[kinocilium]] in the hair cells of the [[inner ear]].<ref name="Picklesetal1984">Pickles JO, Comis SD, Osborne MP. 1984.Cross-links between stereocilia in the guinea pig organ of Corti, and their possible relation to sensory transduction.

When the hair cells are deflected toward the kinocilium, depolarization occurs; when deflection is away from the kinocilium, hyperpolarization occurs. The tip link is made of two different [[cadherin]] molecules, [[protocadherin 15]] and [[CDH23|cadherin 23]].<ref name="Lewin">Lewin GR, Moshourab R. 2004. Mechanosensation and pain. Journal of Neurobiology 61:30-44</ref> It has been found that the tip links are relatively stiff, so it is thought that there has to be something else in the hair cells that is stretchy which allows the stereocilia to move back and forth.<ref name="Corey">Corey, D.

It is hypothesized that the tip link is attached to the myosin motor which moves along [[actin]] filaments.<ref name="Howard">{{Cite journal
