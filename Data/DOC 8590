Title : Gordon Logan (psychologist)
Text : '''Gordon Logan''' is the Centennial Professor of Psychology at [[Vanderbilt University]].  A cognitive and mathematical psychologist, Logan is well known for his work on cognitive control and inhibition of cognitive and motor activity, divided attention and the nature of the human brain’s processing limitations, and the fundamental characterization of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD.  He has also done extensive research on the hierarchical control of skilled copytyping, which he views as a useful model for hierarchically organized complex human skills in general.  He collaborates on research that applies mathematical models to neural and behavioral data.

Logan received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Master of Science|MSc]] from the [[University of Alberta]] in 1969 and 1972, and received his [[PhD]] from [[McGill University]] in 1975. He was on the faculty of [[Queen's University]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[University of Toronto]], [[University of British Columbia]], [[Purdue University]], and the [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]] prior to joining the faculty at Vanderbilt.

According to Google Scholar, Logan’s work has been cited more than 33,000 times and he has an h index of 86 (as of 2017).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R1FaAhMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao | title=Gordon Logan | work=[[Google Scholar]] | accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref> He has been the recipient of many grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.

He is known for development of the  Stop Signal paradigm which is generally cited as the standard method of studying cognitive inhibition in cognitive psychology and human cognitive neuroscience.<ref>Adam R.
