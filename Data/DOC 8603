'''Stefano Pittaluga''' (2 February 1887 – 26 April 1932) was an Italian [[film producer]], one of several figures who helped revive [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film production]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Originally a [[Genoa]]-based owner of [[movie theatre|cinemas]], Pittaluga began to expand his business after 1924. He gained enormous power in the [[film distribution|distribution]] sector by securing the rights to release the films of the [[Hollywood]] companies [[Warner Brothers]], [[Universal Pictures]] and [[First National Pictures|First National]]. Pittaluga also moved into the film production business around the same time, acquiring studios in [[Turin]]. Pittaluga was able to re-invest the profits he made from releasing foreign films into domestic production. He produced a series of films featuring pulp [[Strongman (strength athlete)|Strongman]] characters including [[Sansone (character)|Sansone]] and [[Saetta]] and particularly [[Maciste]]. The films led to him being the most commercially successful Italian producer of the era.<ref>Ricci p.61</ref>

Pittaluga's power grew in 1926 when he acquired the traditional leading production outfit [[Cines]] from the conglomerate [[Unione Cinematografica Italiana]]. Following on the heels of the development of [[sound film]] in America, Britain and Germany, Pittaluga had the [[Cines Studios]] in [[Rome]] fitted for sound production. Cines produced the first Italian sound film ''[[The Song of Love (1930 film)|The Song of Love]]'' (1930), although another of the company's films ''[[Resurrection (1931 Italian film)|Resurrection]]'' (1931) was actually made earlier but released later. Cines became the dominant force of the early sound era.<ref>Moliterno p.84</ref>

Under Pittaluga the company specialised in releasing musicals and comedies. Much of the companies' output, often remakes of German or Hungarian films, were later branded "[[White Telephone]]" films. After Pittaluga's sudden death in 1932 the company continued to release the same kind of populist films, and were only overtaken when the [[Fascist]] government of [[Benito Mussolini]] invested large sums of money in production and constructed the vast [[Cinecittà]] complex in Rome.
