I've been looking around using several search engines to try to figure out where the connection between the term "Hujk" and "Nintendo" exists, and I'm not finding it. However, I have found several search-based sites that have "Hujk" redirect to "Nintendo", like it does here, but that is most likely because it was done on Wikipedia first. Since this redirect has existed since 2007, this seems like a case of other web sites thinking "since it was done on Wikipedia, it MUST be right." Well, I say it's time to help all websites of the such, and '''delete''' this redirect.

'''Delete''' The text of the target article (which is up for deletion itself) mentions no controversy. It's a huge BLP problem to try to trap a search for such a controversy. Even if the target article survives or is merged into another article, there is no reason for us to give the slightest suggestion of such a controversy unless there is some very solid citation of such a controversy. [[User:Mangoe|Mangoe]] ([[User talk:Mangoe|talk]]) 18:43, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*I would say keep, since his history of substance abuse was the source of political controversy, albeit minor. It appears this was discussed somewhat in the article prior to its pruning. However, I think the target article will be deleted, as it should be, and in this case the redirect can be put to rest as a G8. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 21:28, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Noting the article is quite likely to be deleted, and there is no source for this being a named "controversy" in any reliable sources.

::*{{ping|Steel1943}} I disagree.  This is not a plausible search term, and the page views come from its links, which should be disambiguated.

:::*{{Ping|NYKevin}} Here's a scenario. Person "A" is only aware of one album named "David Bowie": [[David Bowie (1967 album)]], but has no idea when it was made. Person "B" is only aware of the existence of the other album named "David Bowie": [[David Bowie (1969 album)]], but no idea of when it was made Now, let's say that both of these people are somehow familiar with Wikipedia naming conventions, specifically [[WP:DABSONG]]. In this scenario, if both person "A" and "B" are aware of [[WP:DABSONG]], they will both search for {{No redirect|David Bowie (album)}} prior to even thinking about using a year in the disambiguator. If they both tried to look up that term, but the term was deleted, neither of the people would really know which title they are looking for, and might have to take a guess in the dark.
::::Yes, I understand that at first, adding a hatnote on both articles might seem like a possible solution, as well as deleting the redirect. But then, these people may completely overlook the hatnotes and just take whatever article they see first as the correct one. A good way to prevent this would be to take these people to a disambiguation page to allow them to try their best to decide what they are looking for prior to being distracted by the wrong article, especially if there is no [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary topic]] for their term "David Bowie (album)".

*'''Keep''' Alternative names don't ''have'' to be mentioned in an article. Can you imagine if we tried to catalog all nicknames for [[Cannabis (drug)]]? In serious contexts, "Vitamin G" seems to always refer to riboflavin, even if it's an outdated term (see, for example [http://www.thepaindiet.com/patient-resources/nutrition-tips/vitamin-g-deficiency-symptoms/] and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/vitamin%20g]).

::To clarify: you confused me. (I am not sure if it is good form to add a new comment when the discussion has been relisted, so excuse me if I am out of order but seems the best place to add the comment.). ''Vitamin F'' is listed at [[Essential fatty acid]], but ''Vitamin G'' is not mentioned there at all.

*'''Comment'''. It could be marked as {{tlx|R from alternate name}} but it isn't right now. However, Riboflavin is Vitamin B2 so I am not sure it is helpful to call it Vitamin G. It is mentioned in [[Vitamin#Naming]] as being renamed such, so it might be best to '''retarget''' as an {{tlx|R to section}} to there?

::I know what you mean &ndash; it's usually a cosmetic company marketing things and sailing very close to the wind with what is allowed under a particular jurisdiction's advertising/naming rules. For your edification and entertainment, I checked:
::* [[Vitamin A]] is an article.
::* [[Vitamin B]] is a redirect to [[B vitamins]].
::* [[Vitamin C]] is an article, hatnoted for {{tlx|otheruses}} for [[ascorbic acid]] and [[Vitamin C (disambiguation)]].
::* [[Vitamin D]] is an article, with {{tlc|otheruses}} at [[Vitamin D (disambiguation)]].
::* [[Vitamin E]] is an article.
::* [[Vitamin F]] redirects to [[Essential fatty acid]], third and last para of the lead says it was classified thus 1923&ndash;1929 but then redesignated, and gives a ref saying so.
::* Vitamin G is what we are discussing.
::* [[Vitamin H]] redirects to [[Biotin]], and is in the first sentence of the lede
::* [[Vitamin I]] redirects to [[B vitamins]], but is not mentioned there.
::* [[Vitamin J]] redirects to [[Choline]], but is not mentioned there.
::* [[Vitamin K]] is an article on the chemical.
::* [[Vitamin L]] is a song by the pop-rock band [[B.E. Taylor Group]].
::* [[Vitamin M]] redirects to [[Folic acid]] and is named as such in the lede.
::* [[Vitamin N]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin O]] is an article, a commercial name for a dietary supplement marketed by [[Rose Creek Health Products]]. In the UK it probably wouldn't be allowed to be called that (I have no idea of rules in other parts of the world) but the article says in the lede it was up before the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for making false claims &ndash; so the article itself I am guessing is perfectly [[WP:NPOV]].
::* [[Vitamin P]] is a DAB, and says at first entry [[Flavonoids]], referred to as Vitamin P from the mid-1930s to early 1950s: the lede of the article in second sentence also says so.
::* [[Vitamin Q]] redirects to [[Coenzyme Q10]] and second para of lede says it is "Vitamin-like" but does not specifically say why it is ''only'' vitamin-like and not a vitamin.
::* [[Vitamin R]] is a DAB with two links, first to [[Methylphenidate]] also known as [[Ritalin]] or Vitamin R, second to a song. Methlphenidate does not mention Vitamin R (but does mention Ritalin and other trade names).
::* [[Vitamin S]] is an article for a New Zealand improv group, hatnoted with [[Vitamin S (disambiguation)]] that lists that at first, [[salycylic acid]] at second, and third and last "a slang term relating to [[steroid]]s", "steroid" doesn't mention it as such although 1927 and 1928 Nobel Prizes for Chemistry both include in the title "sterols and their relations to vitamins" and are included in the History section: could probably be found online, I don't know what the copyright is for papers submitted for the Nobel Prize but it is beyond 70 years of publication, but the authors might still be alive or not long dead (people tend to win Nobel prizes quite young). As for [[salycylic acid]], there are two references to [[New Scientist]] articles saying it is vitamin-like and that (quotes in article) "in the future we might even call it Vitamin S".
::* [[Vitamin T]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin U]] redirects to [[S-Methylmethionine]] and is bolded as the first words in the second para of the lede.
::* [[Vitamin V]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin W]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin X]] is an article on a hardcore band from [[Amsterdam]] with that name.
::* [[Vitamin Y]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin Z]] is an article on a 1980s English pop group.
::* [[Vitamin 0]] (zero) is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin 1]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin 2]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin 3]] is a redlink.
::* [[Vitamin 4]] is a redlink.

'''Deletion.''' Cleaning up and organizing redirects into the target article, I ran into these redirects from incorrect capitalizations which happen to duplicate other redirects of exactly the same term in proper capitalization ([[Virtual SIM]], [[SIM number]], [[Micro SIM]]). Some are even left-overs from page-moves. As the search box is case-insensitive, the correct redirects will automatically "take over" once the faulty redirects are deleted. There are no incoming links, they have no page history, and therefore can be deleted safely without any negative side-effects. Actually, keeping them harms, as editors might accidently link to them in other articles (thereby introducing unnecessary capitalization errors into other articles) rather than just using the correct redirects. Considering this a normal house-keeping action only, I nominated them for speedy deletion per G6, but user Xoloz asked me to nominate them here instead. --[[User:Matthiaspaul|Matthiaspaul]] ([[User talk:Matthiaspaul|talk]]) 13:00, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' for all the reasons Matthiauspaul stated. While alternate titles are sometimes useful, {{tlx|R from alternate capitalisation}} is less so these days than it ws in the past, and these are not even marked as such (and the last is not marked {{tlx|R to section}} either). If it breaks incoming links, so be it, people end up at the search page. I notice that from my search (with google.hu) the terms "[[Micro-SIM]]" with the hyphen and "[[Nano SIM]]" are also used and have redirects at English Wikipedia in the same manner and to sections of the same target; [[Micro&ndash;SIM]] with an en dash does not exist. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 14:47, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep all''' as useful search terms. In addition, looking through the history of [[Virtual sim]], I found that it was later renamed [[Virtual SIM]], then finally [[Subscriber identity module]], the target of these redirects. Terms that help describe a topic at one point or another should remain, such is the case with these redirects.

*'''Keep all''' per Steel1943. Not all methods of searching or browsing Wikipedia are case insensitive, and links from anywhere other than current revisions of pages on the English Wikipedia are not shown by whatlinkshere. This, along with other reasons like discouraging the (accidental) creation of duplicate articles, is why keeping redirects from alternative capitalisations is a Good Thing. Tag them as {{temp|R from incorrect capitalisation}} and they can be easily checked to and links to them fixed. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[User talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 21:36, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

::Can you give an example of "virtual sim" meaning simulation? I would have thought simulation by definition was virtual. [[Virtual simulation]] redirects to [[simulation]] (and should probably be changed to redirect to the section [[simulation#Common user interaction systems for virtual simulations]]) but it would seem somewhat of a tautology to me. Google brings up for me a few companies called [http://www.virtualsimulation.com Virtual Simulation] and [http://virtualsimulationsystems.com Virtual Simulation Systems] and [http://www.virtasim.com/ Virtual Simulations, Inc.] the last of which at least says that they use [[Virtual Reality]] in their simulations: but those are just company names. The only way I could think these were "virtual" (and declaration of interest: I worked on military simulation systems for a number of years) is in apposition to a "real" simulator, i.e. that it was entirely computer-based or at least used no element of the real system they were simulating, rather than using elements of the real hardware or mock-ups of that, which is done to simulate the physical layout of the military hardware for training squaddies etc to get the physical job of loading and unloading missiles etc right, fault-finding on the hardware and so on, rather than the mental job of accurate aiming of weapons systems and so on. But it does not seem to be used in any sense like that. [[User:SimonTrew|Si Trew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 11:03, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

<s>'''Defer to user's decision'''.</s> Why would you want to delete a redirect from user space? Admittedly, the user (who seems to do a lot of work on storm, judging by the main user page) could just add a link to mainspace, but that's up to them, isn't it. What's the policy on redirects from user space for the user's own use (as opposed to those in the other direction from main space to drafts etc in user space, which are obviously bad)? It is a vestige of the user creating the article in user space in the first place, then moving it to aricle space. Ultimately I think we should leave the decision to the user.
