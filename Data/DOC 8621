==Personal life==
Shirley Fenton was born to a doctor, John Zeigler Huie, MB ChM, and Frances Georgina MacCormick at [[Peak Hill, New South Wales]] on 9 August 1924.  A younger brother born in 1930, John Zeigler Huie, was the fourth to bear that name.<ref name="think.io">{{cite web|url=https://think.io/pub/Mirror/www.futureweb.com.au/johnhuie/tree.htm|title=The Huie Family Tree|work=think.io|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> Her early education was at the local school but her results were good enough to win her a place at the Presbyterian Ladies College, Pymble in Sydney.  She undertook her initial studies of French and German at this school.  Her further education at the [[University of Sydney]] was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]] and her decision to join the [[Women's Royal Australian Naval Service]] as a Wireless Telegraphist.  Her knowledge of two foreign languages proved an advantage in this work.<ref name="think.io1">{{cite web|url=https://think.io/pub/Mirror/www.futureweb.com.au/johnhuie/shirlhuie.htm|title=pic|work=think.io|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>

In civilian live she met and married a former member of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], [[Russell Kerr]]. They moved to England in 1948 to live and had two children, Ceilidh Meribel  and Thomas Finlay Whiston (later an osteopath<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpra.gov.au/Registration/Registers-of-Practitioners.aspx?q=OST0001340465&t=FbYYsOQWdiuA7VTLf6KB|title=Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency - Register of practitioners|work=ahpra.gov.au|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>). After their marriage dissolved and Shirley returned to Australia in 1954 with the two children, her former husband because a British Labour Party member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].   In [[Sydney]] she met Edward Fenton, an American helicopter pilot who had served in [[Korean War]], but who was working as an advertising executive. The family moved to a farm on [[Russell Island (Moreton Bay)]], where they grew bananas. Their daughter Gina was born during this time. Ed next accepted a contract to fly for helicopters in [[Colombia]], [[South America]]. Later they moved to [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]] in [[Central America]] to work for the [[United Fruit Company]] spraying bananas. Their son Hereward Huie Atitlan Fenton (now the owner of the Truth News Web publication<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truthnews.com.au/|title=Truth News Australia: going beyond the spin, deception and propaganda of mainstream media|first=Truth News|last=Australia|work=truthnews.com.au|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>) was born in Central America. These years enabled Shirley to develop an excellent grasp of Spanish and to work as a translator. When the contracts ran out, the family moved to [[New Zealand]].

When Ed obtained a contract to fly in Indonesia, Shirley returned to Australia where she opened an art gallery above her brother's wine bar in [[The Rocks, Sydney]]. With her two younger children she joined Ed in [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]] at the town of and then [[Semarang]], [[Java]]. After Ed was killed while flying in 1979, Shirley moved the family to [[Bali]] where she established the Legian Pub, serving tourists. However, in 1980 she needed to return to Australia to care for her elderly mother. During this time she wrote her first book, the text for a photographic essay by Bill Robinson called "Queensland's Sunshine Coast : then and now, 1882-1982".<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3623374?lookfor=author:(shirley%20fenton%20huie)&offset=1&max=13|title=Queensland's Sunshine Coast : then and now, 1882-1982 / photography: Bill Robinson ; Shirley Fenton, editing and text|first1=Bill|last1=Robinson|first2=Shirley Fenton|last2=Huie|date=1 March 1982|publisher=Fenton Masche Robinson Publications|accessdate=3 July 2016|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>  After Frances Georgina died in 1984,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com.au/genealogy/records/frances-georgina-maccormick_81472114|title=Frances Georgina Maccormick 1895-1984 - Ancestry.com.au|work=ancestry.com.au|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> Shirley met Dennis Pile, a marketing and public relations consultant.
