Cox (1927-2013) of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], the founder of the  Hill Crest Memorial Funeral Home and Cemeteries and Hill Crest Florist in [[Haughton, Louisiana|Haughton]] in Bossier Parish.

==Judicial career==

Cox was elected without opposition as a district judge in November 2004, 2008, and 2014. Prior to his judgeship, Cox specialized as a practicing attorney in wills, successions, estate planning, and elder care matters. He is a former assistant district attorney for the 26th Judicial District, headed since 2003 by DA Schuyler Marvin of Minden. He formerly served on the board of Volunteers for Youth Justice and the Caddo Council on Aging in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]]. He was active in the Pro Bono Project of the Shreveport Bar Association. He is the former Bossier district chairman for the Norwella Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Judge Cox is an instructor at the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Training Academy in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] in northern Bossier Parish. He instructs the [[notary]] preparation course at [[Bossier Parish Community College]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.26jdc.com/# |title=Judge Jeff Cox |publisher=26jdc.com |accessdate=April 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517001256/http://26jdc.com/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

In 2011, Judge Cox presided over the capital murder trial of Robert McCoy, in which the defendant was convicted and sentenced to death after his lawyer was allowed to concede the defendant's guilt over the defendant's objection.  Judge Cox denied requests by the defendant and the defendant's parents for a different defense lawyer.  The case is now on appeal before the United States Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/death-penalty-supreme-court-attorney.html?&moduleDetail=section-news-2&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&version=WhatsNext&contentID=WhatsNext&pgtype=article|title=Facing the Death Penalty with a Disloyal Lawyer |publisher=[[The Times (New York)|The New York Times]]|date=October 9, 2017|author=Adam Liptak|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}</ref>
In 2014, Judge Cox denied the request of Richard Matthew Smith (born May 1984), a No Party candidate for [[mayor]] of [[Springhill, Louisiana|Springhill]] in northern Webster Parish, that Smith be returned to the ballot after he was ruled ineligible on residency grounds. Smith sought to oppose Mayor Carroll Breaux, an [[Independent (politics)|Independent]]. A former resident of [[Shongaloo, Louisiana|Shongaloo]], Smith was ruled ineligible to run because he had not resided in Springhill for the one year required preceding the election. The circuit court on which Judge Cox would later sit, concurred in the initial ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2014/09/08/appeal-denied-springhill-mayor-hopeful/15312241/|title=Appeal denied for Springhill mayor hopeful|newspaper=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]|date=September 8, 2014|author=Vickie Welborn|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref>

Cox's court colleagues include Judges [[Jeff R. Thompson]], [[Charles Jacobs (Louisiana judge)|Charles Jacobs]], Mike Nerren, Parker Self, and [[Michael Craig (Louisiana judge)|Michael O. Craig]].<ref name=bio/> Cox, Nerren, Self, and Craig were all unopposed in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on November 4, 2014. Thompson also ran unopposed to succeed Judge Ford E. Stinson, Jr.; Jacobs, from [[Springhill, Louisiana|Springhill]], to replace the retiring John M. Robinson.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2014/08/20/desoto-da-minden-mayor-candidates-qualify/14331543/|title=Final day of qualifying in DeSoto, Webster|author=Vickie Welborn|newspaper=The Shreveport Times|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}</ref>

On November 8, 2016, Cox unseated the two-term Circuit Judge James Jay Caraway (born June 1953), a Democrat-turned-Republican for the Division C position on the appeals court. Cox received 58,874 votes (57 percent) to Caraway's 44,604 (43 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://voterportal.sos.la.gov/Graphical|title=Election Returns|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=December 10, 2016}}</ref> Caraway first won the position in a [[special election]] held in March 1996, when he defeated then fellow Democrat Johnny Evans.<ref>''Minden Press-Herald'', March 13, 1996, p. 1</ref>

Upon election, Cox had vowed to continue basing his decisions on the [[U. S. Constitution]], faith and family, fair treatment of [[plaintiff]]s and [[defendant]]s, [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights, and strict interpretation of the law. In addition to Bossier and Webster, the appeal court district encompasses [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana|Bienville]], [[Caldwell Parish, Louisiana|Caldwell]], [[Claiborne Parish, Louisiana|Claiborne]], [[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson]], [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln]], [[Union Parish, Louisiana|Union]], and [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn]] parishes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://press-herald.com/17689-2/|title=District Judge Jeff Cox announces candidacy|author=Bruce Franklin|newspaper=Minden Press-Herald|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, after Cox had left the 26th Judicial District Court, [[plaintiff]]s James Wheat and Danny Brinson, after their arrests in Bossier City for violating a state statute forbidding [[Begging|panhandling]], filled a [[class action]] lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana]] against Bossier Parish Sheriff Julian Curtis Whittington and all judges of the 26th Judicial District Court, including Chief Judge Parker Self and Judge Cox. Wheat and Brinson allege that Bossier Parish unjustly jails defendants who cannot pay for [[bail]] or the required $40 fee to the office of the [[public defender]]. Nor does Bossier Parish permit defendants to seek a lowering of the bail amount, which is instead automatically set by the court. The suit claims that the parish has for years violated a "bedrock principle of our legal system that a person cannot be detained or imprisoned solely for their inability to pay a fee. Such an [[incarceration]] violates the [[substantive due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] clauses of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2017/03/21/lawsuit-claims-violation-constitutional-rights-impoverished/99467604/|title=Lawsuit: Bossier Parish routinely violates rights of poor|newspaper=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Shreveport Times]]|author=Sarah Crawford|date=March 21, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ksla.images.worldnow.com/library/4fcc84a0-2727-4274-9bd8-a676452413e8.pdf|title=''James M.

Two Republican attorneys from Bossier City, Cynthia Carroll-Bridges and Lane L. Pittard, sought to fill the remainder of Cox's term on the district court in the [[special election]] held on October 14, 2017. Pittard defeated Carroll-Bridges.<ref name=pittard>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/election/2017/07/12/qualifying-begins-oct-14-election/469477001/|title=5 qualify to fill  District 12 Caddo Commission seat|author=Michele Marcote|date=July 12, 2017|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}</ref> Pittard (born c. 1956) is a [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] native who graduated from [[Minden High School (Minden, Louisiana)|Minden High School]] and [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]].
