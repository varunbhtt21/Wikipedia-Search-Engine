Title : Barbara Dilley
Text : '''Barbara Dilley (Lloyd)''' (born 1938) is an American [[dancer]], [[performance artist]], [[improvisor]], [[choreographer]] and educator, best known for her work as a prominent member of the [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]] (1963-1968), and then with the groundbreaking dance and performance ensemble [[Grand Union (dance group)|The Grand Union]], from 1969 to 1976. She has taught movement and dance at [[Naropa University]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], since 1974, developing a pedagogy that emphasizes what she calls “embodied awareness,” an approach that combines dance and movement studies with meditation, “mind training” and improvisational composition. She served as the president of Naropa University from 1985 to 1993.

==Early life and education==

Barbara Dilley was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1938. She began dancing early in childhood and by the age of ten was studying with Audrée Estey, who was the founder of the [[American Repertory Ballet]] and Princeton Ballet Academy. After high school, Dilley attended classes at the [[Jacob’s Pillow]] dance festival before enrolling at [[Mt. Holyoke College]] in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1956. She received a BA from Mt. Holyoke in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Dilley papers|url=http://archives.nypl.org/dan/18444|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

==Professional career==

Dilley first came into contact with [[Merce Cunningham]] in 1960, while participating in the [[Connecticut College]] School of Dance's annual workshop, where the renowned choreographer was in residence with his company.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Carolyn|title=Chance and Circumstance: Twenty Years with Cage and Cunningham|year=2009|publisher=Random House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UIryMy2hzwC&lpg=PT857&ots=FkG5T-8FKp&dq=merce%20cunningham%20connecticut%20college&pg=PT857#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Cunningham asked Dilley to join his company in 1962, but due to a pregnancy she was not actually to join the company until 1963.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Dilley papers|url=http://archives.nypl.org/dan/18444|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>  Dilley was a key member of the Cunningham Dance Company during a very important period for Cunningham, and an exciting time for American dance. While in New York, Dilley was also active with the [[Judson Dance Theater]], and participated in a number of performances, including [[Steve Paxton]]’s ''Afternoon (a forest concert)'', performed in the October of 1963 in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, in a wooded location near the home of [[Billy Klüver]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Banes|first=Sally|title=Democracy's Body: Judson Dance Theater, 1962-1964|year=1983|publisher=Duke University Press|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeJm6G8-T3cC&lpg=PA50&ots=cMJb4I_iT7&dq=judson%20dance%20barbara%20dilley&pg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

In 1964, Dilley took part in the Cunningham Dance Company's first world tour, with stops in Venice, Paris, London, several cities in India, Bangkok and Tokyo, among other places.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ikegami|first=Hiroko|title=The Great Migrator: Robert Rauschenberg and the Global Rise of American Art|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-cQcAqkFP0C&lpg=PA7&ots=8Gz0kUOAvG&dq=cunningham%20dance%20company%20tour%201964%20bangkok&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>   Cunningham’s 1964 tour featured music by [[John Cage]] and [[David Tudor]], sets and costumes by [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and a large number of Judson dancers, including Dilley, Paxton [[William Davis (dancer)|William Davis]], [[Deborah Hay]], Sandra Neels, and Albert Reid, as well as Alex Hay, who was hired to assist Rauschenberg with set and costume design. Their temporary exodus from New York was one among a number of factors that led to the decline and dissolution of the Judson Dance Theater.<ref>{{cite book|last=Banes|first=Sally|title=Democracy's Body: Judson Dance Theater, 1962-1964|year=1983|publisher=Duke University Press|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeJm6G8-T3cC&lpg=PA50&ots=cMJb4I_iT7&dq=judson%20dance%20barbara%20dilley&pg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

In 1968 Dilley danced in the Cunningham company’s tour of Latin America,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lloyd|first=Benjamin|title=Adieu Merce|url=http://showmanshaman.wordpress.com/2011/12/31/adieu-merce/|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>  which included performances in Mexico City, Caracas, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires.

In 1969, Dilley performed as a member of the “Rainer Dance Group” in [[Yvonne Rainer]]’s groundbreaking, improvisational ''Continuous Project - Altered Daily'' alongside Rainer, Paxton, Becky Arnold, [[Douglas Dunn (choreographer)|Douglas Dunn]] and [[David Gordon (choreographer)|David Gordon]]. This group of dancers formed the core of an ensemble of improvising dancers that came to be known as [[Grand Union (dance group)|The Grand Union]], a group that also came to include [[Trisha Brown]]. The Grand Union toured extensively in the early 1970s; while in the group Dilley performed pieces by other members as well as her own works, including “The Sapsuckersummer Dance” series at Cornell Summer Dance Group in 1970, “Wonder Dances” (1975) and “To the Golden Gate Bridge” from her dance series “Coast” (1968-1971).<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Dilley papers|url=http://archives.nypl.org/dan/18444|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

In 1972, Dilley founded her own improvisational dance company, an all woman group called The Natural History of The American Dancer including Carmen Beauchat, Cynthia Hedstrom, Judy Padow, Mary Overlie, Rachel Lew and Suzanne Harris.  They performed at the Whitney Museum on April 29, 1972 as well as at Bennington College, Oberlin College and other venues.  That same year, Dilley participated in the first public performance of Contact Improvisation at the Weber Gallery with Steve Paxton.  In 1974, Dilley cofounded [[Danspace Project]] at [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]] with [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poet [[Larry Fagin]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SpxbAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT353&ots=Wpzuhq6kOd&dq=barbara%20dilley%201938&pg=PT353#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  and choreographer Mary Overlie.<ref>{{cite web|title=Danspace Project records|url=http://archives.nypl.org/dan/18443|publisher=New York Public Library Archives and Manuscripts|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>   Also in 1974, Tom Hast, who had seen the Whitney performance and danced with Dilley in the Weber Gallery performance, invited her to teach at the first summer session of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, at the conclusion of which she was put in charge of designing a dance and movement program for the institute. She has remained involved with Naropa as director of the dance department (1974-1985), and president (1985-1993) since that time,<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Dilley|url=http://oralhistory.boulderlibrary.org/interview/oh1335/|publisher=Maria Rogers Oral History Program, Boulder Library|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>  and has maintained a busy schedule teaching and performing throughout the US and Europe. She is currently a professor of Contemporary Performance in Naropa University’s School of the Arts department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Dilley: Naropa faculty page|url=http://naropa.edu/faculty/barbara-dilley.php|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>
