==History==

The 7th Regiment was founded in 2003 largely through the efforts of members of the Surfers Alumni Association of the defunct  New London Surfers Drum and Bugle Corps. The corps was named in commemoration of the 7th Regiment, one of the last units to leave for the [[American Civil War]] from [[Fort Trumbull]] in the corps' hometown of New London, CT.

The corps made its debut in the 2004 St. Patrick's Day Parade in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]]. That summer, the 36 member corps made five appearances in DCI competitions in Massachusetts and New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web |website =corpsreps.com |publisher=Maher Associates, Inc./corpsreps.com |title=History for 7th Regiment |url=http://www.corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=1403&corpstype=Junior |accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref>

7th Regiment made its DCI Division II/III World Championships debut at [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton, MA]] in 2005, finishing 17th of 20 Division III corps.

The corps traveled to DCI in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison, WI]] in 2006, where they placed 15th of 17 Div. III corps.

The corps stayed close to home in 2007, passing on attending DCI championships in Pasadena, California.

In 2008, the corps attended DCI Open Class Championships in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City, IN]], advancing to semifinals and placing 17th of 23 corps.

7th Regiment rose to new highs in 2009, placing 12th of 19 Open Class corps at Michigan City, advancing to semifinals in [[Indianapolis]], and finishing in 11th place in the Open Class finals.

2010 saw further improvement, with the corps winning its first shows, defeating five other Open Class corps at [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton, CT]] and [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton, VA]]. The 7th finished 7th of 16 corps in Open Class quarterfinals at Michigan City, then placed 8th in semifinals and 7th in finals at Indianapolis.

With preliminaries rained out, 7th Regiment advanced directly to 2011's Open Class finals in Michigan City, repeating the previous year's 7th-place finish. The corps then advanced to World Class prelims in Indianapolis, finishing 31st of 41 corps.

2012 saw the corps win three shows before moving up to 5th place in Open Class at Michigan City and then finishing 28th of 35 corps in World Class prelims in Indianapolis.

In 2013, 7th Regiment won two early season shows, placed 7th of 14 Open Class corps in Michigan City, and finished 30th of 36 corps in World Class prelims.

For 2014, the 7th marched its largest corps ever, with 96 members. The corps' tour took them to performances in ten [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] states. They placed 5th in Open Class and advanced to the World Class semifinals, earning 25th place and full membership in DCI.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=DCX: The Drum Corps Xperience|title=7th Regiment |url=http://www.dcxmuseum.org/index.cfm?view=corpslist&corpsid=1403&tab=3 |accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref>
