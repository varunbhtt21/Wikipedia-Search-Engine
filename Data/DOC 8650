'''Francesco Pasinetti''' (1911â€“1949) was an Italian [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]] known largely for his [[documentaries]]. He also directed the 1934 realist feature film ''[[The Canal of the Angels]]'' set in [[Venice]].<ref>Brunetta p.100</ref> His brother was the writer [[P. M. Pasinetti|Pier Maria Pasinetti]].

A native of Venice, Pasinetti attempted in the final days of the [[Second World War]] to persuade the Allies to support making Venice the capital of the post-war Italian film industry (Venice had emerged as the centre of filmmaking in the Fascist [[Italian Social Republic]]). However, this attempt failed and production largely returned to the capital in [[Rome]].<ref>Brunetta p.107</ref>
