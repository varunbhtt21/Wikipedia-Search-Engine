:({{Find sources|Amoudah is Burning}})
As far as I can tell from the one English source, this is a script that was never made into a movie, not a published book. [[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 00:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Weak Delete''', I haven't been able to find anything much about the script/movie/book/whatever with this title that would qualify as a [[WP:RS|reliable source]].  However, such sources might exist in Kurdish or Arabic, that I can't find.  [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] <sup>([[User talk:Lankiveil|speak to me]])</sup> 01:13, 27 April 2014 (UTC).
*'''Merge''' into [[Amoudah Cinema fire]]. The book is not very notable but the fire should be. --[[User:Why should I have a User Name?|Why should I have a User Name?]] ([[User talk:Why should I have a User Name?|talk]]) 10:12, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
