This article is basically a [[WP:COATRACK]] off the back of [[WP:BLP1E]]. The subject is a creationist, admittedly a rare breed in the United Kingdom. The sole claim to actual notability is nothing to do with the majority of the article, but is a minor award given to the group he leads. The cited source discussing this, namechecks him in the final sentence. His principal claim to fame is being a director of [[Truth in Science|"Truth" in Science]], a fringe and very very minor creationist group which his institution firmly repudiates, and he is the only one of the people listed in the article on that group for whom we have an article. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 00:34, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. He certainly isn't famous for [[WP:PROF]] standards that I can see. The argument that he is notable for his peculiar religious claims may be stronger, but I don't think such an argument is particularly compelling per [[WP:BLPFRINGE]].

*'''Weak Delete'''.  I am more hesitant than usual to !vote this way, as he appears to have gained some attention from the news media.  However, I don't think this coverage passes the [[WP:PROF]] criteria, and is not extensive enough to get him past [[WP:GNG]].  If McIntosh receives further news coverage in future years, I can see him passing the notability threshold, but not now.  —[[User:Theodore!|Theodore!]] ([[User talk:Theodore!|talk]]) ([[Special:Contribs/Theodore!|contribs]]) 03:03, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I think, under [[:WP:PROF]] Criterion 5 - a professor in the UK is pretty much automatically notable. Also, creationists in this sort of position in the UK are so rare that that on its own is probably good enough. [[User:Eustachiusz|Eustachiusz]] ([[User talk:Eustachiusz|talk]]) 13:39, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': does not meet [[WP:PROF]] criterion 5 as his professorship is not significant or notable. It is certainly not true that any UK professor is notable. Religious minorities are not per se notable. The one important thing, the award his team received, is not specific to him and not a scholarly prize, but from Times Higher Education. Thus he fails [[WP:BLP1E]] as well. [[User:BethNaught|BethNaught]] ([[User talk:BethNaught|talk]]) 21:25, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Seems to get plenty of coverage for his views from the [http://www.bcseweb.org.uk/index.php/Main/AndyMcIntosh British Centre for Science Education], [http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/27/post845 Dawkins], the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/ni/2007/01/the_thermodynamics_of_andy_mci.html BBC], &c.  [[user:Andrew Davidson|Andrew]] ([[user talk:Andrew Davidson|talk]]) 23:00, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': The fact that he is English, and there are not many English creationists, is hardly a claim to fame. I find that argument absurd. On a global scale, he is a fourth or fifth tier creationist, very far from a leading figure in the movement, except perhaps on a limited local scale, which would be all the more insignificant as creationism is a tiny movement in England. Not enough in the way of substantial feature coverage for his activities as a creationist in reliable independent secondary sources. As far as his career as a professor goes, it looks solid, but rather run of the mill. Rather unspectacular, in fact, with minimal coverage in news sources, largely limited to a single rather unspectacular award from a non-scientific body, of which he was not the sole recipient. Therefore fails both [[WP:PROF]] and [[WP:BLP1E]]. I find the argument that "a professor in the UK is pretty much automatically notable" absurd as well. That is not in accordance with [[WP:PROF]] or any other guidelines. Nothing worth saving here or merging elsewhere.

*'''Keep'''. Passes [[WP:PROF#C1]] with an h-index of at least 20 (searching for "AC McIntosh" and manually removing the papers that are not his). The article should probably be reworded to focus more on his mainstream engineering work. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.56.15|101.117.56.15]] ([[User talk:101.117.56.15|talk]]) 02:20, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. Those editors saying "a professor in the UK is pretty much automatically notable" are appealing to [[WP:PROF#C5]]. In the UK, an ordinary "professor" is called a "lecturer" or "senior lecturer," and the "Professor" title is reserved for what in the US would be called "Distinguished Professor" or "Head of Department." Therefore, they are suggesting, [[WP:PROF#C5]] apples. -- [[Special:Contributions/101.117.56.15|101.117.56.15]] ([[User talk:101.117.56.15|talk]]) 02:20, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. He is a top-tier leader of the creationist movement, as you can see from [http://www.answersingenesis.org/search/?q=Andy+McIntosh&search=Go Answers in Genesis]. He has six mentions in the [http://www.highbeam.com/Search?searchTerm=Andrew+McIntosh+professor+of+thermodynamics Highbeam news archive] and 19 on GBooks. He is "the leading scientific proponent of IDT in the UK," according to ''[http://books.google.com.tw/books?id=5QwRIZOiHRQC&pg=PA57&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false Science vs. Religion]'' by Steven Fuller.

*'''Keep'''. A [[web of science]] [[h-index]] of at least 17 just gives a pass of [[WP:Prof#C1]] in the relatively low cited field of combustion science. His religious activities pass [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 01:39, 29 April 2014 (UTC).
*'''Keep''' per Xxanthippe ''et al.'' [[User:StAnselm|<b>St</b>]][[Special:Contributions/StAnselm|Anselm]] ([[User talk:StAnselm|talk]]) 11:34, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*''''Keep''' Sufficiently notable to just pass WP:PROF without the creationism. It's debatable whether a genuine orthodox scientist in his own field being a creationist makes them more notable, but it might. '''[[User:DGG| DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG| talk ]]) 19:53, 4 May 2014 (UTC)
