Being a successful specialist "with over 30 publications and 10 book chapters" doesn't make this doctor notable. The article reads like self-promotion. [[User:Slashme|Slashme]] ([[User talk:Slashme|talk]]) 00:38, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:Agree, doesn't really say anything that distinguishes him from similar doctors. Seems like an employee page, doesn't really fit on wikipedia. <font color="orange">[[User:Esoxid|Esox]]</font><font color="green">[[User:Esoxid|id]]</font><sup>[[User talk:Esoxid|talk]]•[[Special:contributions/Esoxid|contribs]]</sup> 01:42, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. A worthy physician but doesn't make [[WP:Prof]] yet. [[User:Xxanthippe|Xxanthippe]] ([[User talk:Xxanthippe|talk]]) 06:20, 30 April 2014 (UTC).
*This is a hard one, but I'll '''lean delete'''.  I don't see what he's done is anything special any doctor would do to lend a helping hand to his patients. If kept, it would have to be re-written completely. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 21:46, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
