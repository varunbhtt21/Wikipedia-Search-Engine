== Which covalent bonds are broken in DNA cleavage by nucleases? ==

When DNA is cleaved by restriction endonucleases, meganucleases, engineered zinc finger nucleases/TALENs or Cas9 which covalent bonds are broken? Are they different for each type and if so, does that affect the repair mechanisms? --[[Special:Contributions/78.148.106.196|78.148.106.196]] ([[User talk:78.148.106.196|talk]]) 00:47, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:I suggest you read the first sentence in [[nuclease]], and our article on [[DNA]]. There is only one bond to be cleaved in DNA. [[User:Fgf10|Fgf10]] ([[User talk:Fgf10|talk]]) 07:08, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
::I think I can see five potential bonds that could be cleaved. What makes you so sure that all enzymes cleave cleanly at that point? --[[Special:Contributions/78.148.106.196|78.148.106.196]] ([[User talk:78.148.106.196|talk]]) 10:58, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Only likely (from a chemical standpoint) possibilities, given we are talking about the [[phosphodiester bond]]s of the backbone linkage, are the two P–O (those O being the 3' and 5' on the adjacent deoxyribose parts of the two DNA residues). The two O–C are comparatively harder to break. And the C<sup>5'</sup>–C<sup>4'</sup> is not at all fragile. The question of "which P–O" is a reasonable one. Assuming the phosphate remains attached to one of the two DNA residues, does it stay with 3' (breaking off the next one's 5') or vice versa? [[User:DMacks|DMacks]] ([[User talk:DMacks|talk]]) 14:56, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::::I think it's going to be a while before I can answer my own question. I know that some of the enzymes form covalent bonds with the DNA which are then broken. Also, since the restriction endonucleases, Cas9 and the business ends of ZFNs and TALENs all derive from an evolutionary need to protect bacteria from invading phage and plasmids, I think it stands to reason that the DNA might be cleaved in such a way that it couldn't easily be ligated back together. I don't know nearly as much as I'd like to about DNA repair. Some day... [[Special:Contributions/78.148.106.196|78.148.106.196]] ([[User talk:78.148.106.196|talk]]) 19:46, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::::For "which side", the answer depends on the nuclease. For example, there's [[Deoxyribonuclease I]] which cleaves such that it leaves a 5'-phosphate, and [[Deoxyribonuclease II]], which cleaves such that it leaves a 3'-phosphate. For [[Restriction_enzyme#Types|most restriction endonucleases]] (and things like zinc finger nucleases, which have their catalytic domain derived from restriction endonucleases like [[FokI]]), they typically cleave the bond so as to leave a 5'-phosphate. (For example, [[Meganuclease I-SceI]] notes that it leaves a 3' hydroxyl.) This leaves things set up such that [[DNA ligase]] can repair the break by joining the 5'-phosphate with a 3' hydroxyl. (Note that leaving a 3' hydroxyl is important if you need to continue the chain via polymerases, which use the 3' hydroxyl to displace the pyrophosphate on the NTP.) -- [[Special:Contributions/160.129.138.186|160.129.138.186]] ([[User talk:160.129.138.186|talk]]) 23:28, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

== Rotary cannon and super capacitors ==

The [[M61 Vulcan]] compared to the [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23]] has a slower rate of fire and has a slower "spin up" time. The article says this is due to the GSh-6-23 using a gas operating system instead of an electrical system to cycle the weapon. I was wondering if a rotary cannon were powered by super capacitors, would they have more power, and therefore spin up faster and have a rate of fire comparable to the gas operating rotary cannon? Also on a related note, would super capacitors grant electric cars greater acceleration? [[User:ScienceApe|ScienceApe]] ([[User talk:ScienceApe|talk]]) 00:59, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:My guess is that you are not on the right track. The reason the electrical system would be "slower" I doubt is because of the power delivery, which is probably from the vehicle. It seem far more likely to me that it is a synchronization or motor speed issue, there’s also heat dissipation and many other factors to consider. These guns are designed with many specifications in mind, including weight, cost and serviceability, not just “rate of fire”. No doubt you COULD make a faster firing, electrically powered rotary cannon, could you do it with super capacitors? I don’t really see why you’d bother, there are perfectly serviceable high speed motors, I don’t think power delivery is the limiting factor there. As for cars, power delivery ‘’might’’ be a factor, but no doubt weight and cost are also, and I don’t think electric cars have a problem with acceleration, the major problem for electric cars is range, so weight plays a more important factor. [[User:Vespine|Vespine]] ([[User talk:Vespine|talk]]) 02:17, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
::Have a read of the applications section of the [[Supercapacitor]] article, if you haven't already. You'll get a good idea of the kinds of situations supercapacitors are being used in, they generally supplement systems where batteries are already used or only small amounts of power are required. They might be used in electric cars, but it would be more to save the batteries from spikes in current drain which could reduce their (usually expensive) life, rather then to "supercharge" the acceleration or anything like that.  [[User:Vespine|Vespine]] ([[User talk:Vespine|talk]]) 02:24, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Right, as for electric cars, I would guess that the acceleration is actually limited by the computer to act more like a traditional gas-powered car. In a conventional internal combustion engine, torque increases with engine RPM and will eventually decrease at even higher RPMs (see [[Power band]]), hence the need for transmissions with multiple gear ratios. This isn't the case with electric motors. Electric motors can produce maximum torque instantly. So the actual acceleration is probably limited to keep people from doing a burnout every time they tap the accelerator. Though they certainly can if you want, the Tesla Model S has a 0-60 time of ~4 seconds, comparable to a Corvette. And then there's the EV-converted [http://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/worlds-fastest-electric-car-is-a-1972-datsun-can-do-0-60-in-1-8-seconds-1416865/ 1972 Datsun] that can do it under 2 seconds, comparable to an F1 car. 
:::Another benefit to using supercapacitors in vehicles though is their short charge time. They can be fully charged in minutes rather than hours. So for vehicles that stop a lot at predictable locations for short periods of time [[Capa vehicle|like buses]], you can build electric vehicles that can run all day without needing continuous overhead wires like a [[trolleybus]]. <span style="font-family:Broadway">[[User:Mr.Z-man|Mr.]][[User talk:Mr.Z-man|'''''Z-'''man'']]</span> 03:34, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
::Why does the gas operated rotary canon fire faster/faster spin up time? Isn't it because the propellant produces more power? [[User:ScienceApe|ScienceApe]] ([[User talk:ScienceApe|talk]]) 01:49, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:To touch the gun part of the question, there are newer Vulcan cannon which have both an increased ROF and shorter spin-up interval; they achieve that through decreased spun mass rather than better motors (or a Tim Taylor-esque "more power" approach). Other guns (including the [[XM301]], no image though) feature a truncated-conic (rather than cylindric) barrel array, where the muzzles are at the narrow end. This does not only (slightly) decrease spun mass, but it limits the energy taken to spin the array, because a lower linear velocity will translate to the same angular velocity. The fact that the muzzle velocity vector and the axis are no longer parallel is accounted for easily.
:During live-fire exercises, many guns are used at a low speed setting (usually half or two thirds of battle speed), and fed training rounds, which are not only cheaper than fully combat-effective rounds, but also easier on the barrels{{cn}}. - '''''¡Ouch!''''' (<sup>[[User_talk:One.Ouch.Zero|hurt me]]</sup> / <sub>[[Special:Contributions/One.Ouch.Zero|more pain]]</sub>) 06:59, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:Most modern [[gatling gun|gatling guns]] operate using a DC motor to cycle the rounds (chambering, ejecting, etc.)  A typical time frame for the gatling gun to reach full fire rate is about 0.4 seconds (see [[GAU-19]]).  So the super capacitor idea is kind of a moot point. [[User:Justin15w|Justin15w]] ([[User talk:Justin15w|talk]]) 15:30, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:[http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/GSh-6-30.htm This page] states about the Soviet [[GSh-6-30]] that 
::''The charging and spin-up of the barrel group before firing was achieved with the use of a pneumatic system which included, among other things, a pair of compressed air storage tanks and a "pneumostarter".''
:[http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/modern_fighter_gun_effectiveness.htm From the same author], we get spin-up times of about 0.4s for both the older M61 Vulcan and its bigger cousin the [[GAU-12]], while the GSh times are merely given as "far less". The newer M61A2 is stated to have an improved spin-up of 0.25 seconds.
:Currently, rotary cannon seem to come in roughly five sizes.
:*5.56mm, based on the [[5.56mm NATO]] round, the [[5.45mm Soviet]], or the [[.22 Long Rifle]]. These are of ''very'' limited use due to their short range.
:*7.62mm (NATO or Soviet). These are heavy machineguns in terms of raw firepower but not WRT range. However, the sheer volume of fire does help achieve kills at ranges which wouldn't be called "effective" for single-barrel machineguns{{cn}}.
:*12.7mm MG (again, NATO or Soviet). These are the true heavy machineguns, usually found on the heavier vehicles, or as small guns on ships or attack helicopters.
:*20 to 23mm. Most of these cannon are mounted on fighter planes or air defense platforms. The CIWS role is notable, too. Spin-up is critical in the dogfighting role, and only there. In the CIWS role, the ROF is usually stepped down on purpose, because the full volume of shells would not outweigh the lower accuracy, except at very close range.
:*25mm and more. Old high-caliber guns are usually in the 30+ range, while most newer guns use 25mm shells with little to no loss of effectiveness. Roles are the same as the 20mm class, but better suited to overcome the low hit probabilities on maneuvering targets with a more damaging round. As noted above, the spin-up time is comparable to older 20mm weapons, but the GAUs are probably still behind the Soviet GShs. - '''''¡Ouch!''''' (<sup>[[User_talk:One.Ouch.Zero|hurt me]]</sup> / <sub>[[Special:Contributions/One.Ouch.Zero|more pain]]</sub>) 07:58, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

:::According to the article, the Vigilante "had a 192-round drum magazine, which in the 3,000 rpm mode would have equated to approximately 5 seconds of fire", which indicates a really long spin-up (~2 seconds){{OR}}. - '''''¡Ouch!'''''

Dear refence desk

please supply the reference for two specific Sumerian units which are given with precision

first the cubit (kus) of 497 mm  

second the mass of the pound (ma-na) of 497.7 grams

Thank you

:[[Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Science/2014 January 21#Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|You already asked here three months ago]] for support for the cubit being 497mm, which I'm aware that you need to be true in order to support your theory (that I won't link to) that the Sumerians basically invented the metric system 5000 years before the French proposed it.  The information you were given last time, that in historical reality the cubit wasn't a precise consistent length but rather varied a bit depending on the precise time and location you're talking about, is still true.  [[User:Red Act|Red Act]] ([[User talk:Red Act|talk]]) 05:43, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::It's also important to understand (and accept) that the levels of precision you're expecting did not exist in those days, even in places and timeframes where the units employed were consistent. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 12:27, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::: Bah!  This theory has '''''bogus''''' written all over it!
:::# The meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000th the distance from the pole to the equator - there is no way the Mesopotamians knew the size of the earth to any kind of precision - so it can only be coincidence that their definition of the cubit is remotely close to a half meter.
:::# As we've already pointed out, there are countless different standards for the "cubit".  Finding one specific place where it just happens to come out within a percent or two of a half meter isn't a great way to come up with a theory.  What about all of the other places where it WASN'T close to a half meter?
:::# If they had intentionally defined the pound in terms of the cubit in the same manner that the kilogram is defined in terms of the meter (1 kg = the mass of 1 liter of distilled water at 4 degC = 1/1000th of a cubic meter of water at 4 degC), they'd have had to choose a temperature at which to make that definition.  The only way for your theory to make sense would be if they (like the French) chose the temperature of 4 degrees Centigrade to measure the density of water.  Since Mesopotamia is a fairly hot region of the world, with very few mountains high enough to reach those low temperatures, it seems highly unlikely that they'd have happened to pick the exact same temperature as the French at which to define their system.  It's stretching the bounds of plausibility to breaking point to imagine that they'd have done that.
:::# If you'd picked a HALF meter as your standard unit of length, then the natural unit of mass would be 1/1000th of a cubic cubit of water.  That 'natural' measure would be EIGHT times less than the kilogram - not half a kilogram as you claim they used for their pound.  A cubic volume of water weighing 1 meospotamian pound would be some very odd size in mesopotamian cubits...actually, an irrational number.
::: For all of these reasons, your ideas are very, very busted.  The relationships you think you've found are nothing more than a coincidence.

== Hunger hormones VS Appetite hormones ==

As I know, it is now clear for scientists that Hunger and Appetite are 2 different things - Hunger will always bring appetite but appetite won't necessarily bring hunger.

My question is: Are there any documented Neurochemicals that deals specifically with hunger and others that specifically with appetite? Thanks [[User:Ben-Natan|Ben-Natan]] ([[User talk:Ben-Natan|talk]]) 04:08, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

:I don't think your distinction between Hunger and Appetite is standard in the literature, but if you are using "Appetite" to mean the act of eating, then yes, there are biological distinctions.  It isn't true, though, that hunger always causes eating.  Unfortunately we don't yet have a very deep understanding of either the neurochemistry of hunger or the mechanisms that drive eating.  Our article on [[hunger (motivational state)]] gives a rather sketchy overview of what is currently known.  The hormones [[leptin]] and [[ghrelin]] seem to be pretty directly related to the sensation of hunger. [[User:Looie496|Looie496]] ([[User talk:Looie496|talk]]) 14:02, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

== Buoancy ==

If no water is displaced when an object is put in it, then how do objects like leaves float when they do not displace water and thus the water does not have buoyancy force?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/122.150.66.107|122.150.66.107]] ([[User talk:122.150.66.107|talk]]) 04:52, 22 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Anything that floats on water displaces water. See [[Archimedes principle]]. Leaves don't displace very much, because they don't weigh very much. --[[Special:Contributions/50.100.193.30|50.100.193.30]] ([[User talk:50.100.193.30|talk]]) 05:43, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

::Perhaps [[surface tension]] has something to do with it. [[User:Richard Avery|Richard Avery]] ([[User talk:Richard Avery|talk]]) 05:59, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Yes, surface tension has two effects: firstly, for an unwetted leaf, it moves the displacement of water away from the leaf (but the same amount of water is still displaced, it's just not as obvious); secondly, at the boundary of the container, it allows displaced water to form a [[meniscus]] above the edge of the container, preventing overflow.  Thus the displacement of a small mass of water is not clearly observable.  The displacement will be more clearly visible if you use heavier leaves and add a [[surfactant]] (e.g. detergent) to the water next time you try the experiment.

== Giant bumblebee ==

Here in Central California this spring, there seem to be quite a few GIGANTIC black bumblebees (I'd say at least 1.5-2 inches in length, and about the same in wingspan), which I hadn't noticed in previous years.  Are these native to California, or are they an invasive species?  Are they any more dangerous than ordinary bumblebees (more aggressive/more toxic/etc.)?  Thanks in advance!

:Black bees tend to be [[Carpenter bees]], and there are many species of them.  Some can get quite large: see [http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2006/12/31/the-tame-carpenter-bee.html].  If I had to guess, you have seen some kind of carpenter bee, but more specific than that, it would be hard to say.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 12:40, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

:There's also the [[black-chinned hummingbird]] there.  The ones in our article don't look all that black, but here's one that does: [http://www.laspilitas.com/California_birds/Hummingbirds/archilochus/archilochus-alexandri.htm], which can be mistaken for a giant bee, as it makes a similar sound and also hovers as it goes from flower to flower.

:Without pics it's hard to ID conclusively, but [[Xylocopa_varipuncta]] is the largest bee native to California. Females are metallic black, males are gold and fluffy. They can reach over an inch long, and can easily ''seem'' to reach 2" while on the wing. In general, actual bumble bees ([[bombus]]) are ''not'' very aggressive. Carpenter bees can be aggressive, but mostly to ''other bees.'' This in part comes from different social structures. Most carpenter bees are solitary, and each male will defend an area from other males, while hoping to attract mates. People often ''think'' they are a threat, as they will aggregate around e.g. wooden picnic shelters that they have prepared nesting sites in. The bees will then fly at incoming animals to investigate. So, you might ''feel'' threatened if one of these comes flying at your head, it actually poses no threat, it just wants to make sure you're not a rival bee. Males can't sting, and you can swat them away with impunity. For fun, you can wad up a bit of paper or aluminum foil and chuck in the direction of such an aggregation. The bee will quickly track that object, and follow it away from you. Since they don't live together in a large colony, they do not cooperatively defend anything, so it is almost impossible to get a swarm of them chasing you (unlike certain [[wasp]]s, [[africanized honeybee]]s, etc.) Anyway, just wanted to give you the general info that carpenter bees are nothing to be afraid of.

::Looks like [[Xylocopa californica]] to me, because it was ''not'' shiny, although the one I saw up close ''was'' at least 1.5 inches long.  Anyway, from what I gather, they ARE native to California, and the best way to deal with them is to just leave them alone, right?

:::Right! The only "problem" they cause if if a whole bunch of them decide to try to nest in the eaves of your house or garage. Even then, mostly just an annoyance, but enough small holes can structurally damage over time (see e.g. here [http://carpenterbeemovers.com/wp-content/images/carpenterbeedamage.jpg]) If you are getting "buzzed" by them often, just ignore, swatting at them may trigger aggression.

*Well, first of all, it has been proven that bumblebees can't fly, so you needn't worry these are bumblebees.  On the East Coast, I always notice the carpenter bees come out first, then the bumblebees, then the honeybees.  Control is easy when necessary, they sell specifically designed insecticide cans with long straight spray streams with which you can easily reach their nests at a distance.

:::That's correct, but the "Out of Africa" event occurred over 50,000 years ago.  Since then there has been limited genetic mixing between sub-Saharan populations and non-African populations, so the question actually does make some sense at that level.  The bigger problem is that there is really no such thing as a "Jewish race", or anything like it, at a biological level.  Modern-day Jews derive from a pretty diverse mixture of backgrounds.  In any case, as a group, it's extremely unlikely that they have higher levels of sub-Saharan-derived DNA than other people from the same parts of Europe or Asia.

By African/Black I mean someone the same racial ethnicity as (and this probably sounds offensive but) Flavor Flav. I know about the "Out of Africa" event and that all people are descended from people from the entire continent of Africa. But there are a lot of different types of African-nationality individuals, from [[:File:Obasanjo_with_Bush.jpg|this]] to [[:File:Mohammed_VI_of_Morocco_(Denoised_).jpg|this]] to [[White_South_African|this]]. But the hair texture of 100% Black people is unique to people of specifically Negro ethnicity (which is maybe what I should have written instead of African). Take the afro or the flat-top for example. Those specific TEXTURES are examples of natural Black hair and no one else on Earth has hair that grows that way, not even if they want it to, unless they have some Negro ancestry I would think. So I would like to get this question answered if you'll give it another try. Looie469, are there any charts or graphs or studies that could prove your view or mine?

== Why are "double red cell" blood donations by females subject to a higher weight requirement? ==

While looking at the Red Cross blood donation elgibility rules for something else, I noticed [http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements here] that double red cell donations by females are subject to a higher weight and height requirement than those by males. Why is this the case? I initially thought that this was a mistake, but after some more searching, this doesn't seem to be the case. To me it doesn't make much sense, since one would think that quite a sizeable number of females wouldn't be heavy or tall enough, and given that men are generally taller/heavier. (While perhaps there are many "average" Americans who might fit the requirements, it for instance seems clear to me that from personal experience, this might disqualify a lot of Asian American women.)

== [[Direct current]] from stored [[torsion]] (e.g. wind-up battery/battery charger) ==

Hi, I'm interested in the general physics and engineering at play here, but I'll put the two specific questions up front:

1. Are there any devices on the market that let you turn a crank to store energy in a spring, and then release that energy slowly to power a small electronic device (or charge a battery)? I'm aware of crank-powered flashlights and and chargers, e.g. [http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/wind-up-cell-phone-chargers1.htm], but those don't store mechanical power; they seem to universally require high speed, low-resistance turning for long periods of time, even to power a small radio. 

2. Assuming negative to the above, are there any physical problems with the idea, or is it more a matter of engineering/materials/market limitations? 

Elaboration on the idea: wouldn't it be more convenient to turn a crank with much more resistance, over a shorter period of time, with less dependence on rotation speed? E.g. if I wanted to charge a flashlight with a one-hour charge while camping, I'd rather work to wind a very stiff spring for  a minute or so, than spin those little cranks quickly for about 10 minutes, perhaps repeatedly.

I'd think that a [[torsion spring]] could be rigged up to drive a small [[dynamo]], and the resulting current could either run a device directly, or charge its battery, or perhaps even both, depending on needs. But then I get a little lost through all the details. Surely there's a lot of linkages, gearing, and other mechanics to worry about. We have to consider current/voltage demands, the [[spring constant]]s of the material, the size of lever arms and rotors, etc. In summary, is it foolish to think that a device could do this? If not, could something like this be cobbled together from mostly of-the-shelf components? Weight, size and conversion efficiency don't matter much for the last bit, but of course they would for a hypothetical product.

Each fieldphone had a local battery to power the talk circuit (carbon mic in the handset, battery transformer like old country wall phones). The crank indeed provided the ringing voltage. Phone company phone systems switched to having a battery only at the central station in the early-mid 20th century. The field phones might also work with a central battery. I just know they worked with other field phones with only a copper pair connecting them and that each had a battery.  [[User:Edison|Edison]] ([[User talk:Edison|talk]]) 20:38, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

::Yes.  Search for images of the old Freeplay flashlight.  I was given one a long time ago, perhaps in the early 1990s, which had a clear plastic case so you could see the mechanism.  The handle wound a very wide, substantial spring from one spool to another, taking about 20-30 seconds. When switched on, the spring wound back over a period of about 3 minutes, either operating the light or charging a small NiCd battery.  I don't have the bandwidth for any images, but the Freeplay site does have a small support page for their discontinued Freeplay 2020 flashlight, which includes the warning, "''The spring is powerful and dangerous.  Do not remove any covers unless you are an experienced engineer.''", so that sounds like the mechanism I remember.

:I don't understand the advantages here.  I understand that you'd like to apply more torque for a shorter period of time - but that's just a matter of gearing.  The only real questions are:

:# Is there some efficiency difference between storing energy in a spring versus a battery?
:# Is there some cost benefit in one mechanism versus the other?

:My gut feel is that the spring doesn't discharge energy at all uniformly. Very high quality mechanical clocks go to a lot of trouble to even out the energy produced by the spring over time.  All of that extra 'stuff' seems unnecessary if you use a battery to store the energy instead.  Assuming the thing you're driving needs a uniform energy input, I think batteries will do a better job.  NiCd and NiMH's have a fairly uniform voltage over most of the discharge cycle.
:Cost is harder to estimate - but in our modern age, moving parts are generally avoided in favor of solid state stuff - so eliminating the spring seems like it would save money.

::Steve, I agree with most of what you say. I don't think this would be objectively better, or more efficient than batteries. Moving parts do wear down, etc. I thought maybe with some clever circuitry it wouldn't matter if the spring output was uneven. Shouldn't a system of RLC circuitry be able to [[buffer]] the mechanical input, so that the electrical output is more even? E.g. a [[moving average]]. Don't conventional battery chargers already do a bunch of "smart" controlling of the charging process to deliver current and voltage at different rates?  To clarify, my interest is for things like camping, hiking, biking, etc. As for storage, I guess a large capacitor with high-resistance gearing might make the spring a worthless complexity.  So maybe I should think about how to get bigger capacitors and higher gearing onto one of those cell phone chargers I linked above?

[[User:Nimur|Nimur]] ([[User talk:Nimur|talk]]) 04:55, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

:::: Well, how about this: There is an extremely comprehensive source for Seiko watches [http://forums.watchuseek.com/attachments/f365/202805d1245703327-seiko-quartz-caliber-power-consumption-battery-technical-guide-seiko-quartz-caliber-power-consumption-battery-guide.pdf HERE],  From a quick look at that document, the analog quartz watches mostly used between 0.8 and 2.0 microAmps for the movement and 0.3 to 0.8 microAmps for the "circuit block"...although there are lots of outliers in some of their models.  So we're talking between one and three microAmps for a typical quartz/Analog watch.  This delivers a battery life between one and five years.   Surprisingly, the digital watches seem to use a lot more power - around 1.0 to 10 microAmps for the "movement" (presumably that's watchmakerspeak for "display") and between 0.8 and 3.0 microAmps for the "circuit block" - so maybe 2x to 5x more power consumption than analog watches.  But with a similar battery life quoted for each...so probably there are more/bigger batteries in the digital models.  A watch battery holds around 250 milliamp-hours of charge - and at 1.2 volts, that's 200 milliWatt hours or 720 Joules of energy.

:::: I'm not sure that helps to illuminate '''this''' question though! As I explained above, our OP's problem lies mostly with the gearing on the crank rather than the technology used to store the energy...and perhaps we can use this example to illustrate the problem:

:::: I recently bought a rather nice antique grandfather clock.  It has chimes that go off every 15 minutes, a second hand and a moon-phase dial - and it runs for about a week using the gravitational potential energy of three (roughly 1kg) weights lifted through about a meter.  This is a better way to store and retrieve energy than a spring because the force exerted by the falling weights is exactly constant over the entire week...but obviously it's a lot less convenient for portable devices!

:::: Anyway, I can wind the three weights up to the top of the clock using the hand crank provided in about 5 seconds per weight.  It takes quite a bit of force to turn the crank - but it's a reasonably comfortable rate to crank at - and a longer crank arm would probably allow you to crank at this rate for a considerable amount of time.  Now, we know that for gravitational energy, E=mgh, so when I'm winding it up, I'm providing about 30 Joules of energy over 15 seconds of work - so I'm providing about 2 Joules/second or 2 Watts while I'm cranking it.  When fully wound, my clock stores about 30 Joules of gravitational potential energy - about 24 times less than that 720 Joule watch battery!   Which means that this gigantic clock could hypothetically run for 24 weeks - close to 6 months - on a battery that will power a quartz watch for two years.   So this gigantic mechanical monster from the 1800's is only 4 times less efficient than a beautifully engineered modern watch - and it ticks loudly enough to be heard in the next room, chimes every quarter hour loud enough that I can hear it from anywhere in the house and keeps a gigantic pendulum swinging backwards and forwards against all of the friction generated by 100 year old bearings and gears!

:::: I find that rather impressive - (or to put it another way, those fancy watches are surprisingly inefficient devices!).

:::::Fascinating work Steve!  I'm feeling nitpicky today, though!  You claimed an ''exact'' property: "the force exerted by the falling weights is exactly constant over the entire week..." but that assumes the little ''g'' [[gravity of Earth|gravitational constant]] is ''exactly'' the same.  In fact it changes slightly with respect to the height of the weight above the Earth's surface.  (Not to mention the gravitational attraction of objects other than Earth!)  I'll readily admit that the effect is negligible, but because you use the phrase ''exactly'', I had no choice but to nitpick!

::::::: ...or more mundanely, the gradually increasing uncoiled length of the cables suspending the weights slightly increases the pull that they exert on the clock mechanism.  That effect might even be measurable.  So, OK, if you're being super-nit-picky, I shouldn't have said "exact" - but the sense of what I was trying to convey matters here.  The amount of power produced by a coiled spring as it unwinds is hugely variable compared to the ''almost'' constant amount of power produced by a falling weight.

::::::: The analogy with a car engine is useful here.  An internal combustion engine has wild variations in the efficiency with which it converts gasoline into useful work depending on the RPM that it's turning at.  Hybrid vehicles get the good mileage that they (mostly) do because they can run the engine at its optimum RPM all the time and use it to charge a battery that can provide spurts of high power when needed.

::::::: A similar thing happens with human-powered machines.  We can only turn a crank at some limited ranges of speed, torque and duration - and to drive something directly from that input shares the same problem as a car engine.  So using the crank to charge a battery is a good way to optimize the energy usage.  Springs can be used (like a battery) to store energy - but they lack the ability to release that energy in a uniformly controlled manner without resorting to more complexity with mechanisms like a [[fusee]].   The falling weights in a grandfather clock are an elegant way to release stored mechanical energy in an ''almost'' uniform way - but clearly that's inconvenient in general.  We have a six foot tall cabinet in our hallway - effectively doing the job that a wristwatch can do almost as well.

:::::::  Finding a compact, lightweight and cheap way to store and release mechanical energy is therefore a difficult problem. Skirting it by converting the mechanical crank turning into electicity to charge a battery is a reasonable way to handle the problem.  Springs are probably the second most convenient way - although they do suffer from this lack of uniformity of energy output over time.   A flywheel is another possibility - but they tend to be either very heavy or they have to spin at such high speeds that they are in perpetual danger of flying apart and doing enormous damage in the process.
