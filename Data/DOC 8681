==Death and discovery==
In June 1944, the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Infantry Division]] landed on Saipan as part of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] effort to take the [[Mariana Islands]].  On July 7, Carneal's 105th Infantry Regiment took a heavy attack from the Japanese defending Saipan. The 105th Infantry Regiment took over 900 [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] including Carneal.  However, his body was not found and he was declared [[missing in action]].<ref name="Rob Canning">{{cite news|last=Canning|first=Rob|title=Paducah Funeral Held for World War II Soldier 69 Years After Missing In Action|url=http://wkms.org/post/paducah-funeral-held-world-war-ii-soldier-69-years-after-missing-action|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=WKMS|date=25 April 2014}}</ref>

Carlton Carneal, William Carneal's nephew, told ''[[NPR]]'' that his uncle had a pact with three friends, so that if anything happened to one of them, the remaining friends would tell the families of the others what had happened.  Because of this, the Carneal family knew what had happened to William Carneal.  According to Carlton Carneal, while William Carneal was firing his gun at attacking Japanese soldiers, a Japanese soldier jumped into his [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] from behind and detonated a [[hand grenade]] killing both of them.<ref name=NPR/><ref name=morris>{{cite news|last=Morris|title=World War II soldier's remains coming home|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/article/20140420/NEWS01/304200010/World-War-II-soldier-s-remains-coming-home|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=jacksonsun.com|date=19 April 2014}}</ref>

In March 2013, Kuentai, a Japanese nonprofit organization that searches for bodies of Japanese soldiers found his remains under more than {{convert|3|ft}} of clay along with the remains of four other American soldiers.<ref name=NPR/><ref name="Rob Canning"/><ref name=FoxNews>{{cite news|title=Family gets belongings found with remains of American WWII soldier|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/27/family-gets-world-war-ii-casualty-belongings/|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=27 February 2014}}</ref> The group also found his [[dog tag]]s, belt buckle, poncho, a pocket watch, loose change, and his 1939 [[class ring]].<ref name=FoxNews/><ref name="Senator McConnell">{{cite news|last=Senator McConnell|first=Mitch|title=Remembering Pfc William T.

==Honored 70 years later==
Memorial services were held on April 25, 2014 on what would have been his 94th birthday.  Representatives from [[Japan]] including members of the organization that found his remains attended the memorial services as well as representatives of Kentucky Governor [[Steve Beshear]] and Senator [[Mitch McConnell]]'s offices.  Governor Steve Beshear ordered that flags should be lowered to [[Half-mast|half-staff]] from sunrise to sunset in Kentucky on April 25, 2014, in honor of [[Private first class|PFC]] William T. Carneal. He was laid to rest in Paducah, Kentucky, rather than [[Arlington National Cemetery]], because his surviving family wanted to have him buried next to the sister who raised him after his parents died.<ref name="Rob Canning"/><ref name="Bill Hughs">{{cite news|last=Hughs|first=Bill|title=WWII Soldier Honored, Laid to Rest 69 Years Later|url=http://www.westkentuckystar.com/News/Local-Regional/McCracken-County/WWII-Soldier-Honored-Laid-to-Rest-69-Years-Later.aspx|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=WestKentuckyStar.com|date=25 April 2013}}</ref> Carneal was remembered in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=REMEMBERING PFC WILLIAM T.
