;<u>Comments:</u>

This user is having a COI and trying to add irrelevant offtopic text into article.

This has been proven from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mufaddal_Saifuddin#Reply_of_Summichum_allegations] that both of the above editors are die hard followers of the dawoodi bohra religion and Mufaddal, Khuzaima are the two rival leaders of the religion and they are not letting another non aligned editors like [[User:Anupmehra]] , admin [[User:Crisco 1492]] and other users like [[User:Ftutocdg]] to make neutral changes as per the available  media reports of the people involved.

I had edited as per [[User:Anupmehra]] as he is also the one without any conflict of interest , the other two editors have clearly shown their conflict of interest as they have proclaimed that they are followers of Mufaddal Saifuddin whereas I am not even born into that community but when I saw the initial versions I was suprised how people were pushing their POV without any evidence on such a famous issue of succession controversy which is now appearing almost daily in many Indian media. I had MADE the edit request after modifications requested by Anup Mehra .

;<u>Comments:</u>
This is a bit of a mess: it looks as if an article on a building has been nominated for speedy deletion A-7, erroneously and repeatedly, and in fact deleted. A-7 doesn't apply to buildings. The (new, school-project) editor who created the article repeatedly removed the tag (though probably without understanding that it was in fact incorrectly applied, or they might have pointed it out). Mistakes all round: one editor repeatedly incorrectly speedying a building; one new editor repeatedly removing that tag; one admin erroneously deleting. Ouch.

*{{AN3|declined}} A few reversions over several days is not enough edit warring to justify a block. I've put a note on the user's page to engage in constructive discussion. Meanwhile, you could start this discussion on the talk page yourself, no need to wait for another editor to start one. Leavingtherain, as you note, is a newbie and might not yet know much of the way we do things. I see that you have not tried to engage the user on their own talk page either.

This user is incredibly disruptive, continuously warned about their edits, has had 10 warning altogether over the past months and blocked twice, once in October 2013 and the other in December 2013 for 1 Month for disruptive editing.

I request Admin to better look to the edit pattern of user Summichum and his history. He is assuming ownership of the above mentioned article. and other related articles. his POV is clear. and refering to Notice board, good faith editors has become his habit.he is assuming bad faith of other editors. his sole purpose in joining is to promote his POV and reverts any other good faith edits.

Please Refer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:53rd_Syedna_succession_controversy_%28Dawoodi_Bohra%29#Quote_from_pritish_Nandi]

Summichum kept on inserting Pritish Nandy qoute even after reasoning with him about its  [[Wikipedia:BLPGOSSIP|WP:BLPGOSSIP]] violation as same was removed from another article Diff:[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=603696863&oldid=603695137] by Admin [[user:Mr. Stradivarius|Mr. Stradivarius]]
==== The qoute by Summichum showing his POV====
‘The much cited ghadir khum incident was not a succession deed (Nass) but rather to resolve misunderstandings between a  group who complained about Ali to the prophet , and the prophet said "Whoever takes me as his patron , should also take Ali as his patron" and this was said in ghadir and not in the final Haj. If there had to be a succession then it should have been made at a place where all people gathered and not ghadir khumm. In short the prophet did not say that after me some person like Abu Bakr, Ali etc would be  the caliph\Imam.  The fatimid bohras like dawoodi bohras are a minority group who have invented their own religion and mainstream Islam does not recognize them as Muslims’...

::may please see discussion at[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:53rd_Syedna_succession_controversy_%28Dawoodi_Bohra%29#Quote_from_pritish_Nandi], [[User:Summichum|Summichum]] has accepted that he is from one of Ismaili shia group, and started behaving somewhat in cordial manner, but his tone is still too much offencive. Nizari are Ismailies but they follow [[Fatimid]], have their Imam and almost no competition with any Bohra group. Alavi group Mazoon came to Mufaddal for condolences, and they principally have no differences. Now left out are Suleimani and progressive one. Sulaymani are also accepted the facts and happy with their group. This fellow claims that he is not born in Dawoodi Bohra, let us believe him and there is full possibility that  he is from young progressive group , born after seventies, after separation from DB. This group don't have their Dai or any leader. They are feeling isolated, frustrated and very zealous of their fellow DB. They also want to get attached with Khuzaima to have something of their own and eager to form Qutbi Bohra. Khuzaima group is clever, he don't want to have separate name and want to get hold property of mass DB group and wanted to call themselves DB, but only few hundred real DB are with him.

Being disciplined follower of Wiki, and being DB also, we want to honour WIki regulations, but some how  doing attempt to bring the real truth to public. We are not against having well published matter, although not a fact to have NPOV here at Wiki, but this fellow is adamant and somehow not able to sustain anything just written not in his favour. He has gone too far blaming Shia faith itself, to prove him right although claiming himself a Ismaili shia follower of [[Ali]]. 

This fellow seems to be learned man, and trying to get cordial with us. We also don't want any personal harassment to anybody, as well principled by Wiki. We request him to not to take matter up to community level involving complete [[Shia]] community just for blaming DB. He may be having opinion difference, his opinion is his choice , we honour his freedom, but not this way please. Hope it is still time he respect Wiki principles above all. We are soldiers of Wiki and as being DB also we will further try to keep wiki above all and restrain us to the extent possible. Conduct of accusing complete community  above is beyond any limit, and we all hope that situation to have edit restriction on DB topics is not good, not reflecting the principle of tolerance DB community have towards other faith. Hope we all including me will further restrain so to abide wiki rules completely. You Sumichum, searching our old accounts and finding our mistakes. Our intentions were never bad. I was just helping my nephew to open his wiki account with full of his agreement, when I was on visit to his place. He never continued further and I was trapped, which I have openly accepted.

Mr. Sumichum , please cooperate. You are blocked twice recently. No one wants there name on notice board. You put your claim on talk page with proper citation( for the god sake don't bring Azad or Bohra Youth forum news which are purely written to propogate hate propaganda), we will definitely cooperate. We have quoted from 'BM' theinternational DB magazine, published by private publication. It's authencity was questioned ,so we have put up the case in 'reliable source NB' and never reinstated the material. Shiv Sena has it's controlled news paper, having vide accepted circulation in Mumbai, whether Wiki will object to it's news inclusion, if not then BM case is similar and to be discussed comparing that. We will never oppose any matter if it is as per wiki rules even though not true. Let Ajay Mehra be our umpire till your aggression calm down, as he is having  in depth knowledge of wiki guidelines and a true third party editor.--[[User:Md iet|Md iet]] ([[User talk:Md iet|talk]]) 12:34, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

Yet, he runs around and deletes other people's references, calling them "unreliable", "fake", or "self-publish".
* Removes references to content he hates, then later removes the content altogether because "it's unsourced" or "unreliable source"
* Total disregard for other people's contributions, and forces that his version be used only, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Massacre_at_Hu%E1%BA%BF&diff=605832904&oldid=605832529 even if it meant deleting improvements and new content]
* MiGVN doesn't truly understand what are reliable sources and what's not. He has made the declaration that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Massacre_at_Hu%E1%BA%BF#Hopelessly_biased "In wikipedia's law, and we agreed History.net and xxx.edu are the reliable sources"]. An online criminal can create a malware site using the .edu domain, or any fake "educational" institution can create an .edu website, and those will still be considered "reliable sources"?
* Tried to falsely, deceptively frame opposing editors ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Eyesnore#March_2014 myself] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Hmains#Hue_Massacre Andreas Philopater]) as "vandals", in order to get unsuspecting, unaware users to delete content that I and Andreas have contributed that MiG dislikes. MiG wants other users to delete content for him, so that way he's not on the hook for edit-warring.
* Engaged in extensive copyvios, by copy-and-pasting whole swaths of text into the [[Massacre at Huế#Dispute and denial]] section. Esp. his English is poor, yet how does he manage to "write in flawless English" in his article contribs??? Evidence of poor grasp of English: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Massacre_at_Hu%E1%BA%BF#Hopelessly_biased Here and all his responses in sections below] When TheTimesAreAChanging paraphrased and summarized his content, MIGVN [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Massacre_at_Hu%E1%BA%BF&diff=605541750&oldid=605480471 insists that the original copy-paste version be used].

<u>Comments:</u> I was originally hesitant to bring this to the noticeboard, because today's revert violated 24 hour rule by only 1 hour, but a review of the article's edit history showed *four* violations of the 1RR rule, by this user, in just the past 4 days.  User repeatedly reverts and/or deletes contributions of other editors, instead of consensus building on talk page. History of disruptive editing on this page by this user. <br />

<u>Comments:</u> <br />
Five different users have attempted to list [[Tito Vilanova]]'s death in the 2014 article, but Derby has reverted each time.  To their credit Derby started a [[Talk:2014#Tito_Vilanova|relevant thread on the talk page]], but reverting five different editors in 18 hours is the definition of edit warring.  I am not involved in the dispute on the page but did warn Derby after four reverts.  They replied to me that their actions "overrides 3RR" [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADerbyCountyinNZ&diff=605860804&oldid=605859368] '''[[User:Calidum|<span style="font-family: symbol;"><span style="color:#0d254c">Calidum</span></span>]]''' 19:31, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
<br>As an addendum, it also appears Derby is engaged in a separate edit war  with {{IPuser|210.56.86.197}} on the [[Arturo Licata]] article.

'''Users being reported:'''

'''Articles in dispute:'''
*{{pagelinks|Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
*{{pagelinks|History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi}}

'''Report:'''
* First, LibDutch is removing material from WP on the basis of the [[Wikipedia:Citation needed]] tag (a user has complained about it on my talk page, believing it to be unconstructive, I concurred). I've been proven to him that [[Wikipedia:Citation needed]] and [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]] don't condon mass removal of chunks because they lack sources (especially when large chunks of that article lacks sources).. For instance, in the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi]] LibDutch seeks to remove a large chunk of information on the opposition (albeit unreferenced) from the article, even if I proved to him that it was true.
* Second, I and Michaelwuzthere are now currently waged in an edit war because he's opposing the consensus.. The edit war is simple; he wants to have Communism and Marxism-Leninism in the infobox, the consensus is only Marxism-Leninism. The reason? They are superfluous if both are in the same infobox since they mean exactly the same thing. To make it clear, I'm refering only to the infobox. Communism is mentioned throughout, but in a bid to make the infobox as clear as possible the consensus seems to be to only have one ideology in place (or more concret, the specific ideology and not the ideology in general and the more specific ideological orientation in communism)
::There was never consensus over your edit which removed communism from the ideology. No, communism and Marxism-Leninism do '''not''' "mean exactly the same thing" and if you believe that then you frankly have no business editing the CPSU article. You may be under the delusion that consensus was ever reached, but there is no trace of consensus other than it not being reverted sooner by your own admission. An edit reversion taking a month on a low-traffic article does not equal consensus. Your edit is obviously controversial otherwise it wouldn't have been reverted by multiple editors. You need to take it to the talk if you want your edit to be restored, and if your argument is that Marxism-Leninism and communism mean the same thing, then your edit is not going to be restored because it is blatantly false. --[[User:Michaelwuzthere|Michaelwuzthere]] ([[User talk:Michaelwuzthere|talk]]) 18:21, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Its been reverted by you (and the only reason why LibDutch is joined in is because of the edit war at the libya page).. Just you, in other words.. Are communism and Marxism-Leninism the same thing? No, but in the Communist PArty of the Soviet Union they were the same thing; Marxism-Leninism was theory in which the Soviet policy based its policy, it was Marxism-Leninism which was used to reach [[pure communism]]. Marxism-Leninism was the only official ideology of the CPSU from 1927ish(?); Marxism (or more correctly, Marxism as interpreted by Lenin) being the sole before that... '''''When regarding the CPSU they are one and the same thing'''''.--[[User:Trust Is All You Need|TIAYN]] ([[User talk:Trust Is All You Need|talk]]) 18:34, 26 April 2014 (UTC) --[[User:Trust Is All You Need|TIAYN]] ([[User talk:Trust Is All You Need|talk]]) 18:34, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*Third, I agree, the edit war between me and Michaelwuzthere is stupid (and we both deserve to be blocked for it), but LibDutch is actually breaching Wp policy and is on a manhunt to remove all information he deems false (he doesn't remove all unreferenced material, only the one he doesn't like...) --[[User:Trust Is All You Need|TIAYN]] ([[User talk:Trust Is All You Need|talk]]) 18:08, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::If you believe it is true then you can just add the source to the article instead of reverting my removal of text that lacked a source for 2 years. And you removed the word communism first, as you did to other articles like the '[[Communist Party of Vietnam]]'. --[[User:LibDutch|LibDutch]] ([[User talk:LibDutch|talk]]) 18:11, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:::In has stood like that on the Communist Party of Vietnam article for over a year now, if thats not consensus I don't know what is...  '''''If you believe it is true'''''? What, I showed you a source from Cornell University Press; this is not a discussion of what is reliable or not, it is reliable according to WP policy, and you're edit-waring doesn't making anyless so. Stop being so abstract, and follow WP policy. --[[User:Trust Is All You Need|TIAYN]] ([[User talk:Trust Is All You Need|talk]]) 18:36, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

:There is a huge violation of [[WP:3RR]] at [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi]] by both LibDutch and TIAYN. It looks to be seven reverts apiece on April 26. In my opinion both parties should be blocked. Removal of unsourced material is sometimes justified but you can't edit war while doing so. There's also a three-way edit war among the named parties to this report at [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Can any of you explain why you shouldn't be blocked?

The above editor is trying his best to game the system. He has edited much of the black mamba article. and is trying to rewrite (snakebite article, venomous snake article) and erase the scientific consensus on snake venom toxicity in order to support his personal view. it has been elaborated in detail using authoritative sources why he is wrong. he knows he is wrong but he is very invested in his favorite snake[[Special:Contributions/79.176.152.55|79.176.152.55]] ([[User talk:79.176.152.55|talk]]) 04:39, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

* Isambard Kingdom Brunel: Have not edited more than 3 times within a 3 week period and have engaged the talk page seeking consensus. 
* Dominic Cooper: Cited several sources for edit, which have been ignored and reverted but realised it was becoming edit war and have since stopped.
* European Union: Definately no edit warring. Posted propose edit change for over a week, no response despite sending messages on interested users talk page asking for input. Set up a talk page to discuss the proposed edit. No response so implemented my edit. Week later 1 editor disagreed and 1 agreed, so a discussion started. Each one revising one anothers edits without a single complaint of edit warring. A third editor joined, reverted my edit, and claimed my undoing of his/her revert (once) was me editing warring.

I am not a vandal, and have left explanations for my edits and have tried to provide sources to support it my edits. Although not responding on my talk page, have engaged in discussions on editors talk pages and the talk page of the wiki page in question. Some 'frustrated' editors have resort to reporting people before open up a talk page or exhausting other channels of communication.

<u>Comments:</u> <br />

This is the editor's second go-'round at this edit war. The first time several weeks ago he seemingly acquiesced when a clear consensus was demonstrated that these edits were inappropriate.  Since resuming the crusade a few days ago, his only response on the subject has been to assert that the previous discussion ''did not happen''; it's unclear whether he believes this or is just trying to pretend it ... either one is cause for concern. (The earlier incident also include an instance in which he claimed something that was easily disproven by WP edit history.) -[[User:JasonAQuest|Jason A. Quest]] ([[User talk:JasonAQuest|talk]]) 19:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:This is a slow running edit war with Hoops gza being reverted by at least 4 editors and no one supporting him. At [[Talk:August Landmesser]] he is facing 4 editors who disagree with him, with no support there either.

<u>Comments:</u> <br />
I understand that some of these edits are covered by BLP; and I have no doubt that all are in good faith. Still, I think Collect is being more combative than necessary here. Since the last of these edits was not a clear-cut BLP case, Collect should have made a compromise-seeking edit instead. In general, I think that this user is too quick to reach for the revert button, and too quick to justify those actions by spouting policy, without considering whether another action would have served.
—[[User:Homunq|Homunq]] ([[User talk:Homunq|࿓]]) 19:42, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::If "some of these edits are covered by BLP" then they should not have been listed here.[[User:Anythingyouwant|Anythingyouwant]] ([[User talk:Anythingyouwant|talk]]) 19:49, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

:::Yup. These edits are clearly reverts of unambiguous WP:BLP violations, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Grimm_%28politician%29&diff=prev&oldid=605840708][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Grimm_%28politician%29&diff=prev&oldid=606191140], <s>while this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Grimm_%28politician%29&diff=prev&oldid=606169503] looks to me to be a revert of vandalism, or of a very confused contributor. </s>[[User:AndyTheGrump|AndyTheGrump]] ([[User talk:AndyTheGrump|talk]]) 19:57, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Actually, checking further, Collect may possibly have been wrong to revert this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Grimm_%28politician%29&diff=prev&oldid=606169503] - it seems to relate to the renumbering of congressional districts. It is far from clear though, and I can understand why it looked like vandalism. [[User:AndyTheGrump|AndyTheGrump]] ([[User talk:AndyTheGrump|talk]]) 20:05, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::These aren't Collect's only edits on the article in this time period. The others were, generally speaking, editing in "the same direction" as the reverts; but since they involve actually writing new versions, rather than mere reversion, I didn't list them above. Still, you could probably begin to argue a case that one or more of them constitute reversions as well. Collect certainly knows the rules here, and is riding right up to the edge of them. All in all, I think that a slap on the wrist is in order. [[User:Homunq|Homunq]] ([[User talk:Homunq|࿓]]) 20:12, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::I agree with Andy but would add that I also think the last listed revert is justified by BLP.  It removed this: "A former NYPD officer working as a bouncer at the time said that Grimm remarked about the husband, 'I’ll fucking make him disappear where nobody will find him.'"  The reporter is apparently not willing to give the Grimm quote as factual, and instead attributes to a single anonymous third party of unknown credibility.  Grimm denies having said it.  BLP policy was designed to keep crap like this out of BLPs.[[User:Anythingyouwant|Anythingyouwant]] ([[User talk:Anythingyouwant|talk]]) 20:29, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Number three is indeed a BLP violation and wouldn't count toward 3RR even if it weren't. It's a different edit entirely. [[User:Capitalismojo|Capitalismojo]] ([[User talk:Capitalismojo|talk]]) 20:34, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Number four isn't edit warring either. Reverting what looked like vandalism (random date changes) to me as well. Although Andy seems correct in that it ultimately was not. [[User:Capitalismojo|Capitalismojo]] ([[User talk:Capitalismojo|talk]]) 20:37, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Numbers 5 and 6 have been discussed at BLP/N there was broad agreement that the marraige and annullment stuff was a BLP violation, therefore subject to removal. I suggest that this EW case is not made. [[User:Capitalismojo|Capitalismojo]] ([[User talk:Capitalismojo|talk]]) 20:41, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*I've been involved in editing this article, so I won't be the one to close it, but that this easily becomes a coatrack on which to hang a bunch of quotes with bad words in them is easily seen--and that stuff simply has no encyclopedic value. Even if some of the additions aren't BLP violations, adding up all the "fucking" quotes amounts to UNDUE. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 21:32, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

If anyone inserts another damn FUCKING quote into that BLP after all the discussions at BLP/N, with an admin protecting the BLP as a result of the FUCKING quotes being added and re-added by the same perps, I shall feel affronted.   The edit that I reverted at 02:32 was with regard to a '''totally unsourced contentious claim''', which [[WP:BLP]] is clear may be removed on sight.  The one I reverted at at   12:15 was for an edit which ''''conflates district numbers and insisted Grimm was ''replaced by'' Charles Rangel''' - again unsourced, and, as far as I can tell, wrong to the nth degree.  I fear this EW report is ill-framed and designed to harass me at this point,  because I did not agree with the OP on adding material to a page where he has a vested interest in adding a topic which was found to be "not notable" at AfD.  Using ANEW to "get even with someone" is a waste of this page entirely.  Cheers. [[User:Collect|Collect]] ([[User talk:Collect|talk]]) 23:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC) (Note 1, 2 and 3 were ''several days ago'', and 4 and 5 were fully unsourced in the first place ... I get the odd feeling that such an ill-formed complaint is harmful to this noticeboard). [[User:Collect|Collect]] ([[User talk:Collect|talk]]) 23:41, 28 April 2014 (UTC) 

*{{AN3|nv}}  The majority of those reverts are indeed not only covered under BLP, but were a ''necessity'' under that same policy.

Diff of attempt to resolve dispute on article talk page: [diff]

<u>Comments:</u> <br />I never got the chance to discuss this on the talk page.  A user was blocked for edit warring, after which a discussion took place regarding the Dispute and Denial section.  After discussion and agreement, I removed several sections there were agreed to be unreliable sources.

I started several new sections in talk, discussing suggested changes, content that I wanted to add, grammatical and sentence structure changes that I felt needed to be made, and cites that needed to be cleaned up or clarified.

Now this guy has added back everything that we had agreed to remove, without discussing it first, without notifying anyone that he intended to do so.  I'm convinced it's the same guy that was blocked previously.  His username was MiG29VC.  I'd bet, if you check his IP, it's the same one as this new IP account.

After he made the changes, he added a section to talk, which I have responded to, explaining why the cites are not reliable and should not be included.  I have also asked him to please discuss these issues before making any changes, but after reading what he wrote, I'm convinced it's MiG29VC.  The grammer and syntax is the same, and he is arguing over the exact same issues that he had edit warred on before.

This user, after being banned for 24 hours, still continues reverting the same article (2014 latakia offensive) by adding a Non-NPOV source. Some people already reverted it back to normal and warned him, but he still continues. By using WhatsMyIpAddress, you can see that its still the same location. While it's only 1 revert within 24 hours, I'm sure that he'll still continue.

<u>Comments:</u> <br />
Not reporting a 3RR violation, rather, long-term edit warring. User has previously been blocked for disruptive editing at [[Drishyam]]. User continues to revert box office gross to "37 crore", which has some meaning in Bollywood. (Crore means 10,000,000). User has been invited to discuss numerous times, but fails to participate. The current 51 crore box office gross is reasonably sourced. Not sure what Anjaan's problem is, but his edits have been disruptive, and he seems to be trying to achieve consensus through edit warring, instead of by discussion.

'''User being reported:''' {{userlinks| Summichum }}
Please refer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mufaddal_Saifuddin#Revert_explanation.21],  there is case of vandalism this user is reinstating material  of his POV without any proper citation  with intention of maligning a community , which he claims to be a non-member.


Discussion of talk page is reproduced here for ready reference:

"* 'Raudat Tahera statement' is undid as citation medical report discuss about June 4, incident only. Self formulated POV inserted, and the same should not be re-instated without discussion. --[[User:Md iet|Md iet]] ([[User talk:Md iet|talk]]) 04:26, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
::The statement : ‘And that the succession ceremony in Raudat Tahera was staged using the debilitated stroke ridden body of Burhanuddin as a prop.’  is reinstated by Mr. Sumichum , inspite of warning  given above. 

'There is no mention of 'Raudat Tahera'  or ‘prop’ word used any where in citation  and medical reports only refers to 'june 4' incident  only,

"The Syedna suffered the stroke on June 1, 2011, and according to two of the reviews, he could not have possibly spoken coherently on June 4, when he allegedly 'loudly' pronounced his son, Mufaddal, as successor, after which sherbet was consumed by everyone."
'
"It would have been impossible for His Holiness to have drunk sherbet the night of June 4... "

This fellow has not only reinstate his self generated POV , but removed material on his important visit abroad ,which was properly discussed giving 'edit request'  above and further diverted as suggested by editor Anup.

Mr. Sumichum is requested to be getting restrained at earliest please.--[[User:Md iet|Md iet]] ([[User talk:Md iet|talk]]) 06:27, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
Mr Sumichum has reinstated the material again in spite of my specific explanation and second warning given. This editor is removing all the well discussed well sited  NPOV material added, on his wrong plea of having statement of his choice and his POV.

He has deliberately added allegation of 'staged' and presumed location of 'Raudat Tahera', which is no where mentioned in citation. He has deliberately remarked late Syedna as a 'prop' on his own without any proof or citation in the reputed Wiki, presuming that it is his right to do whatever he wants on Wiki, playing with sentiments of whole community, not being of that community.

I request admin to immediately inter fare with this type of vandalism done by a single element against a whole community. This is a pure vandalism and I don't want to break 3RR rule, although I am supposed to be allowed in this case.--[[User:Md iet|Md iet]] ([[User talk:Md iet|talk]]) 07:21, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

I request Anup to immediatey remove this as he is closely watching this and further request admin to take strong action on this.--[[User:Md iet|Md iet]] ([[User talk:Md iet|talk]]) 07:21, 29 April 2014 (UTC)"

*I'll gladly take some action, but where to start. First of all, this report is malformed. Diffs are missing. Why you would copy the talk page is not clear to me; it's just confusing. Then, the history shows such edits as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=next&oldid=606295017 this], where you apparently revert yourself, calling yourself a vandal after you had reverted yourself (no kidding).<p>The real problem here isn't just the edit warring, it's the completely unencyclopedic way of editing--in poor English, with a bunch of text added to an image caption, with talk page discussions where editors seem to be talking right through each others' comments, etc. In short, it's a mess, and I can't tell who to block. For example, "poor English": "I request Anup to immediatey remove this"--what is "this"? I think I'm just going to fully protect this trainwreck of an article and hope that any edit requests on the talk page can be handled by a knowledgeable admin of good will. [[User:Drmies|Drmies]] ([[User talk:Drmies|talk]]) 02:29, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
*:: [[User:Drmies|Drmies]], Sorry for being part of 'a mess' and a culprit for ‘poor English’. My intention was to remove "this"-- the statement : ‘And that the succession ceremony in Raudat Tahera was staged using the debilitated stroke ridden body of Burhanuddin as a prop.’".  I also apologise for not putting notice in standard format as I am not used to do complains and was in hurry to get rid of statement "this", not having patience to understand the correct method.

The act “[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=next&oldid=606295017 this], where you apparently revert yourself, calling yourself a vandal after you had reverted yourself (no kidding)." was a foolish act done by me to save my self unnecessarily from 3RR, but  not of intention to creat a vandal then allege other for the same, never. I was not kidding, nor  trying to fabricate case, as I know that I am here working on Wiki, for which I care. Please have the time to read my explanation below, as I am not able to sustain the  things, you have described.
#[[User: Summichum]] was insisting to insert false non reported statement : "succession ceremony in Raudat Tahera was staged using the debilitated stroke ridden body of Burhanuddin as a prop." [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606208142&oldid=606207559 ][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606287385&oldid=606284181 .] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606290478&oldid=606290241] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606338017&oldid=606318963].
# I have clearly warned him that the citation mentioned by him do not refer to any ‘ceremony  staging’ and medical reports are related with some other instance, ‘Raudat Tahera’  ‘prop’ words no where used,  no ceremony described and 'medical reports’ refered are related with altogether different London incident and not for ‘ceremony’.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606280982&oldid=606170868.] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606289984&oldid=606281754] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606292616&oldid=606289984]. While doing insertion of his ‘statement’ , this fellow was reverting my other information ‘on foreign minister/ tour’ etc. intensely.
# I wanted to reinstate my information on ‘tour’, but didn’t want to remove his insertion as he was adamant in inserting his material and I didn’t wanted to got traped in for 3RR. So I did addition of my information, but not removed  Sumichum false statement  at : 07.34 Hrs:[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606294796&oldid=606293862].
# Then I thought that this fellow may trap me for putting my ‘tour’ information also back , as I was also reinstating  my ‘tour’ information back and back. Although nobody was objecting to it, but Sumichum was removing my material also in the name of adding his false statement on ‘ceremony’. Hence on fear of 3RR for my ‘tour’ material, I removed my true material just after 3 minutes. At : 07.37 Hrs: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606295017&oldid=606294796].
# But again after my lunch, I examined  Sumichum revised statement, he inserted last. It was different, but still on ‘ceremony’ and same medical reports  which was nowhere related with ceremony not covered in citation, hence  I boldly removed his false statement, without fearing any 3RR, and  simultaneously added my material on ‘tour’, at 09.56 hrs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mufaddal_Saifuddin&diff=606306477&oldid=606295017].

This was the case and was very much upset by [[user:Summichum]] actions of vandalism of adding false self fabricated,complet OR statement  again and again, trying to malalign complete community feelings. Hence wanted strong action, as he is using Wiki platform for promoting his personnel POV, since Feb 14, after succession issue of [[Dawoodi Bohra]]. He has joined intentionally for creating propaganda. He claims that he is not from this community, still comments rigorously on minor points.  Only like to have, research, and add fabricated matters favourable to one claimaint. Remove material on other caimaint  ruthlessly  and trying to make false baseless allegation on [[Bohra]] community as whole( self innovated religion, not accepted by main stream etc. etc.). Wiki keeps individuals above the wiki harassment, but this fellow harassing complete community. I request thorough observation for this user and strict action accordingly.--[[User:Md iet|Md iet]] ([[User talk:Md iet|talk]]) 05:15, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

<u>Comments:</u> <br />
After I reported her on 22 April 2014 (see [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RRArchive242#User:Bmwz3hm reported by User:AussieLegend (Result: 24 hours)|this report]]) {{u|Bmwz3hm}} was blocked for 24 hours for edit-warring at [[Heleen Mees]]. She was subsequently blocked for another 48 hours when she resumed edit-warring after release from her block. After the expiry of the second block she did not return to the article but engaged in meat and sockpuppetry in an effort to restore her edits and an SPI case was opened. (see [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Bmwz3hm]]) I requested pending changes protection be applied to the page and this was done by {{u|Bjelleklang}}. All was then quiet for more than 12 hours before IPs started unsuccessfully changing the article. I left a warning at [[User talk:122.248.140.29]] explaining the situation with the article,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A122.248.140.29&diff=606134378&oldid=606134195] and there was quiet for nearly 9 hours before Bmwz3hm finally returned, no doubt because it was now the only way she could get the article edited. In the short space of 28 minutes she breached 3RR again. Unfortunately, before the article could be restored to the version that only Bmwz3hm& and her puppets don't like, {{u|Fluffernutter}} fully protected the article with Bmwz3hm's vandalism in place. {{u|Bilby}} has attempted to get Bmwz3hm to rationally dscuss her edits but her response was "I'm not willing to leave the article as promoted by Theobald Tiger as is".[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABmwz3hm&diff=606175957&oldid=606174975] Given Bmwz3hm has now breached 3RR three times, has a COI issue with the article, has engaged in meat and sockpuppetry and has indicated she is unwilling to leave the article as is while discussing it, I believe a significant increase in the block time is warranted. When she is blocked, the full block should be lifted so those trying to improve the article can continue to do so. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 13:52, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:Since I was pinged to this report, let me just give some short thoughts: Bmwz3hm has certainly violated 3RR here, and they definitely don't seem to be understanding how Wikipedia works on issues like this. However, they also appear to be arguing for conservative treatment of a BLP, and discussion on the talk page seems to mostly be of the "nope, I'm right, reverting" type from both sides of the dispute. Given that, I decided that forcing the users to discuss (by making them unable to revert each other) was worth a try before dropping any more blocks (which haven't worked thus far). As long as the article is protected, there's very little point blocking any of the warriors, especially given that blocking just seems to bring out sockpuppets/meatpuppets. [[User:Fluffernutter|A fluffernutter is a sandwich!]] ([[User talk:Fluffernutter|talk]]) 14:09, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::Actually, what happened was that Bmwz3hm made a series of edits, without any explanation on the talk page or in edit summaries. Many of these were self serving and contentious in themselves. Another editor then went through the article, cleaning it up, explaining what he was doing in each edit summary. However, Bmwz3hm reverted the edits without explanation,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heleen_Mees&diff=604674217&oldid=604650648] insisting on her version of the article. Both of those editors received warnings for the subsequent edit-war. I decided to independently review the article, which had been a mess since two IPs had started edit-warring before this. When I reviewed it I came to the conclusion that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heleen_Mees&oldid=605242738 this version] was the most reasonable version, although I did make one minor change. However, Bmwz3hm is demonstrating [[WP:OWN|ownership]] over the article, as the most recent revert demonstrates, allowing only her preferred version of the article. Bmwz3hm didn't even want to discuss the edits. Since release from her last 3RR block two days ago, Bmwz3hm has made no attempt to discuss anything on the talk page. Even after breaching 3RR again she has made no attempt to discuss. There have been numerous requests on her talk page to discuss but she refuses to discuss. Numerous editors have now become involved in the article and the only opposition to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heleen_Mees&oldid=606173877 this version] has been from Bmwz3hm and her sock and meatpuppets. There haven't really been any "nope, I'm right, reverting" comments. I believe Fluffernutter made the wrong call. Instead of protecting the article, he should have blocked Bmwz3hm for the obvious 3RR breach. While her edits are the protected version of the article, there's even less chance that she's going to discuss. --[[User:AussieLegend|'''<span style="color:green;">Aussie</span><span style="color:gold;">Legend</span>''']] ([[User talk:AussieLegend#top|<big>✉</big>]]) 15:12, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

<u>Comments:</u>No actual 3RR violation (yet) but certainly an ongoing edit warring problem over the past couple of weeks with this editor who is perpetually added unsourced material to the article with regards to its box office performance. At first another editor correctly removed an "adjusted for inflation gross" figure from the infobox and [[User:Ring Cinema]] reverted it. We do not use "adjusted grosses" for film article infoboxes as an adjusted gross is simply a hypothethical figure that loosely estimates what an old film might have made in today's market. [[WP:MOSFILM]] clearly states that we should only be using the gross, not the adjusted gross, and this was even discussed on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Film#box_office_gross_.2B_infobox MOSFILM talk page]. [[User:Ring Cinema]] then persistently put up another figure which was unsourced. Neither myself or two other editors can find a valid reliable source for it anywhere. The only reliably sourced figures for this film's gross we can find are for the domestic gross (i.e. North America) only. In lieu of finding figures for a worldwide gross that pass [[WP:RS]], we have used only the domestic gross, but Ring Cinema keeps reverting it. Discussions on [[User:Ring Cinema]]'s talk page have had no effect and s/he has also refused to discuss the matter on the article's talk page. It also appears that this user has a vast history of edit warring and has been blocked on several occasions in the past for similar offences. I feel a longer block may be warranted to prevent further repetitions. [[User:LazloFeelo|L@zloFeelo]]<sup>[[User talk:LazloFeelo|t@lk]]</sup> 20:18, 26 April 2014 (UTC)<br />

:There is no edit warring, except perhaps by LazloFeelo. The consensus on the content of the infobox extends back to 2009 and he is not respecting it. Instead, he substitutes a box office figure that is outside of the guidelines because it is a domestic box office number where an international box number is called for. Of course I am open to updating the number if one is available. In the meantime, the current consensus obtains and that is what I am restoring. I have added a call for a citation on the current number. I have participated in discussion and quoted the relevant guideline. Perhaps LF is not aware that, according to wp:consensus, a new consensus is required to make a change like this. It would be helpful if he would provide an international box office figure that satisfies him, but he has not. --[[User:Ring Cinema|Ring Cinema]] ([[User talk:Ring Cinema|talk]]) 20:40, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::As has already been pointed out to you on more than on occasion, you cannot add unsourced material to Wikipedia articles. It is up to you to find a source for a figure that you want to include as per [[WP:BURDEN]], and any source that you do add has to pass [[WP:RS]]. If you can't do this, the figure cannot be added. Please provide a link to the alleged discussion in 2009 where a consensus to do this was supposedly reached.

:::This idea of "consensus" merely because something has not changed for some time gives thought to just what is it that is being done. When an addition has been made to an article and no other changes are forthcoming for some time, maybe even years, is not consensus; it may be a matter that no one cares to change about the article. How many articles are there that are not viewed by someone that if they wanted to change it could and do not? Something may be found to be wanting merely because someone has brought attention to that article and then others get involved. So, to say "X" years "consensus" is the justification is just plain irrelevant. Too, many times has this "consensus" justification been thrown into the mix to basically bully others. It does not matter how long something has been in an article because things change. Especially when it comes to movies since they are a major entertainment of people today, this and that list comes out based on whatever criteria and is included in the article only to be found irrelevant for the new current time because a new list has come out yet the citation is not amended and sometimes people attempt to jumble both facts only to create something that makes sense only to that person. Too many times has it been that what someone has championed based only on their own perception is to be found out wrong. How many contractions are presently in articles that do not belong? Their continued existence is a consensus and deserves to remain? And the idea that a consensus is ALWAYS needed to change something again irrelevant when some articles are changed w/o any talk page activity because no one could care less. When there is a disagreement about what has been changed then there is need for a consensus but that consensus really should not be based on longevity because it could be wrong. No one cares about a change if they do not get involved and if they get involved the longevity of its existence is not a credible criteria for it to remain. For how many years has the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel been interpreted by these renowned art historians based on how it looked before restoration. Looking at it today, it's a Technicolor extravaganza right out of the movie studios. What was said before about technique, coloring etc remains valid? Not every film receives the same attention in all its aspects so to put a policy of excluding something because everything that in the past about that portion is not available is just a plain waste of time and effort. Qualify what you have and then move on.

How many times will it be that only a portion of a subject can be cited according to policy  <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:LimeyCinema1960|LimeyCinema1960]] ([[User talk:LimeyCinema1960|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/LimeyCinema1960|contribs]]) 17:47, 27 April 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

[[User:Ring Cinema|Ring Cinema]] has just done it again on the same article, despite this report being made: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Godfather_Part_II&diff=606068777&oldid=605934705]. Furthermore, he is trying to claim that his preferred version of the article has been in place for 5 years, but this is not true. The material that was originally changed a couple of weeks ago was the adjusted-for-inflation gross, which we do not use on Wikipedia articles. I then tried to find a worldwide gross but couldn't find one with a reliable source, so I then inserted the domestic gross instead because that is well sourced. Ring Cinema then kept reverting to the adjusted gross, purely because it looks more impressive (as stated above, the adjusted gross is just a hypothetical estimate, not a real figure). After a couple of reverts, he then added a completely different figure as a "worldwide gross", but did not add a source. So claiming this is how the article has been for 5 years is utter nonsense and there is no consensus as he claims because I have been through the article's talk page history to check. He just likes edit warring, something for which he has been blocked for seven times in the past couple of years.

*Comment: Edit warring at this and other movie articles Ring Cinema edits and protects is not new.  Frankly, he has ownership issues.  He uses excuses to revert changes introduced by those not in his circle that usually involve "Doesn't improve the article" or "Goes against consensus".  Doesn't matter that consensus was reached years ago or may have never been reached.  Ring's reasoning regarding consensus on content never being reached is along the lines of "It's been this way for a long time and that's the same as consensus".  That reasoning behind his rationalization of edit warring behavior and article ownership is now being expressed in his edit summaries: "returning to the status quo".  He's been playing this game for a few years now.  He's been brought to this noticeboard and AN/I for this very thing (as well as civility issues) time and again.  I've brought him here and AN/I for it and learned, sadly, that he seems to be one of the teflon untouchables: someone who gets a way with a lot because he never gets called on his negative, unproductive behavior.  Getting away with a lot produces editors who engage in article ownership, more incivility, and edit warring.  All definitely unproductive and uncooperative behavior that should be, in my estimation, prevented.  What will be done about it?  Anything or nothing (again)? -- <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #0099FF, -4px -4px 15px #99FF00;">[[User:Winkelvi|Winkelvi]]</span> ● <span style="text-shadow: 4px 4px 15px #FF9900, -4px -4px 15px #FF0099;">[[User_talk:Winkelvi|✉]] [[Special:Contributions/Winkelvi|✓]]</span>  22:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:Well, here we go again.......Yes, it is true that a review of Ring Cinema's record with article development seems to end in some level of disruption that this person alone seems to sustain and reuse every time that conflict emerges. And this seems to be with film related articles only. It has clearly been set out by Ring Cinema that the opinion and views of others is irrelevant. It would seem that Ring Cinema believes that this type of conflict is absolutely necessary in every single article development. Having seen many other articles developed why is it that those articles involving Ring Cinema come to this level of conflict and disregard for the views of others. From a quick think back to three articles there was relentless unnecessary and uncivil actions. First if something does not agree with Ring Cinema, Ring Cinema will amend it on the criteria that it is wrong and if Ring Cinema believes that something should remain then it is kept based on having been there since Adam copulated Eve. The movie No Old Man Country? a vent was the entire united from pump to wall outlet. Remembering train trips in the English countryside where people's windows had circular vents cut in the glazing for the inside moist air to escape; how can a satchel or anything of bulk fit in that thin area of space. That somehow a satchel had to be hidden in the motel room vent, not the air duct. Motel room vent? Then what is a vent in a coat or jacket. How can a satchel, a bulky item fit into such an opening? No it had to be "vent" and there was no change of the mind even when there was an article on vents and duct work in WP. Other people has to provide actual proof whereas all that Ring Cinema had to do was change it without opposition. Then there was large land parcels in China Town described as tracts of orange grooves; yet absolutely not one mention of that land to be irrigated was described as such. Then in The English Patient, there terms long in the article at the time Ring Cinema became involved that were paramount to remain until it was found in a dialogue transcript that they words had never been said.
:It seems to be the emphasis of Ring Cinema that EVERT SINGLE CHANGE in EVERY SINGLE ARTICLE  H A S  to be changed after TALK PAGE discussion. If that were the case WP would be little more than what it was years ago. Again, a change does not require a consensus if no one cares about. The number of articles and the number of changes shows that. So don't go off with tisk tisk tisk because it is not true. If it were true then every RALK PAGE would be longer than every article. Then  there is the Ring Cinema move to in the course of article development for what has been put down in the article by that person so that if there I any change then it changes what Ring Cinema has contributed rather than the group. So as the article gets developed it the work of Ring Cinema so if you back o change anything there is absolutely NOTHING that remains without Ring Cinema sanctioning. That is just part of the strategy. I would not be surprised that the SOCK PUPPET accusations soon are issued. Ring Cinema seems to have a propensity of raising the sock puppet accusation SO MANY TIMES to cloud and attempt to thwart others. I cannot remember the article but put forth the accusation of sock puppetry occurring with a number of "similar" styles as if every single person in the world writes and speaks differently that there MUST be some type of collusion. Then have the audacity to say that the accused is the one that brought it up sock puppetry. Well, for what other reason would Ring Cinema attempt to cause such a commotion? All this energy and time over what? An article that if electricity were to disappear from the face of the earth there would be absolutely NOTHING left of WP as long as it was never downloaded on to paper sheets or metal plates. At least the ancients had clay tablets, vellum and papyrus.
:This reminds me of an aunt's parrot that when it was sunny and dry outside it's cage was put either under the lemon tree or on the patio. That fat last aunt from wherever she was on the property she commanded someone to get something for her and would rather yell out for my cousin to tend the bird rather than go to see and say hello to it. Instead, you would know when the bird wanted attention or needed something because in the absolute same pattern the bird to speak-up, "Gilbert! GILBERT!! GGILLBERTTT!!!!"
:Now will this be viewed as a personal attack just because it has mention a pattern? God save us. If you do not want your personal patterns to be the topic of conversation then change your strategies. All I know is that there are people in this world that just do not work well in groups. Some people are so certain of their perception that they are totally unable to reason with verifying their facts and instead insist on something that is not correct and potentially look the fool. If all that can be verified at this time is one subset who exactly is championing that when the full spectrum of the facts are known then they should not be included? No one has and what changes that occur later can then become part of the article. Someone has to learn to move on.

::::Well, not every change in WP article history has been made through consensus because it may be just a stub. Also, What are we all to be wired up to every article so that instantaneously we will be made aware of any changes as a group, only? I believe that is rather cumbersum and unlikely to occur. Not all changes have been made through consensus because not every one is on the back of each article as if they were about to give birth.
:::RC continues, ''' " For five years the current draft has been verifiable." ''''
::::Well, aparently there has been a review in order to determine if what was there was verifiable and it was not. That only a partial result was and thus according toi the WP policy that which is citable warrents inclusion in the article. That seems simple enough to understand but

::::Does this mean that this is an expression from some unknown WP policy that states that every update of this article HAS to be posted by RC?

And as the verifyable subset has been identified they why not have it appear until that time when the desired information comes to light.

;<u>Comments:</u>

This user was warned on 15 March 2014 to stop edit warring on hockey player bios. As suggested, the issue was taken to the WikiProject Ice Hockey talk page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Ice_Hockey/Archive60#Player_height_and_weights]. There was no consensus on changing European players heights and weights to metric. The user waited a few weeks then began making changes again. I have warned him, and despite this he continued reverting without giving edit summaries. [[User:Permafrost46|Permafrost46]] ([[User talk:Permafrost46|talk]]) 18:25, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

::There is an ongoing dispute over if all hockey players in all countries should be measured in united states customary units. Even though all other Swedish Olympic athletes, persons and the Swedish hockey league uses metric and the international ice hockey federation use metric. This is the way the wikipedia manual of style recommends that we write on wikipedia and the way all other sports handle the issue. Even though there dispute hasn't been resolved people have changed back the Swedish player's statistics to united states customary units. I have been editing the pages so that they look the way they did when the dispute started. Other users are changing every ice hockey related article to be united states customary units first even though the player has never been in north america and calling it editwarring to revert them back to their proper format.[[User:Talteori|Talteori]] ([[User talk:Talteori|talk]]) 11:47, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

But that means North Americans in Europe use metric. Not that the entire world of hockey uses united states customary units.

;<u>Comments:</u>

Chealer has clearly violated the 3RR rule, adding a "dubious" tag back into the article after we were in the middle of a discussion about why that part of the article is not dubious. He refuses to listen to logic or repeated explanation of the situation from multiple authors. This type of edit warring behavior has occurred before. Previously, he also edit warred over a tag about LastPass both on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heartbleed&diff=606122030&oldid=606120606 the Heartbleed page] and on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LastPass&diff=606078074&oldid=606077025 the LastPass page]. This editor does not understand the concept of tagging, engages in serial drive-by tagging, and then edit wars when people explain to him why the tag is not needed. This is especially egregious when he claims he is the "de facto maintainer" of the article. &ndash; [[User:FenixFeather|<font color="SlateBlue">'''''FenixFeather'''''</font>]] <sup>[[User_talk:FenixFeather|<font color="SlateBlue">(talk)]]</font></sup><sup>[[Special:Contributions/FenixFeather|<font color="SlateBlue">(Contribs)]]</font></sup> 13:35, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

I can't pretend to understand this fully myself, but I'll do my best to help.

If what's reproached is the number of reverts, I am guilty. Although I don't remember resorting to rollbacks much, I did have to revert many changes. If what's reproached is the frequency of reverts, I am also guilty. Although I've only been maintaining the article for 2 weeks, the topic is hot (currently top 100). I recognize that a certain contributor has gotten adversarial in the last days, and we've seen lots of reverts (often pedantic). In fact, for the last week, a few editors have been editing pretty "boldly", to say the least.

If what is reproached is a 3RR violation, I could also be considered guilty, as it is not technically incorrect to view edit sequences 1-4 or 2-5 as violations, if 3 is interpreted as a revert, and if metacontent changes are taken into account. I acknowledge I did brutally solve an edit conflict in edit 3 (''{{diff2|606059695|12:23, 27 April 2014}} "reword LibreOffice to show affected versions rather than fixed versions"; Note that in this one, he hid his revert behind a seemingly innocuous edit summary.'') I did not salvage the lost changes (mere tag removals) later.

I can't say what "point" and what "lost" edit war FeatherFenix refers to.

FenixFeather has a problem assuming good faith and a strong tendency towards personal attacks, but nothing unprecedented. He is certainly guilty of edit warring, but sanctions may not be needed yet. He was already warned about his 3RR violations. These might have been his first. I also explained to him that reversions need to be justified.

*'''Result:''' No action. Though [[User:Chealer]] has been less than 100% cooperative there is not enough reason to issue a block. If there are more disputes about single issues, I suggest that someone open a [[WP:Request for comment]]. Chealer avoided the DRN by refusing to participate, but if an RfC reaches a consensus and somebody reverts against it, they are edit warring and admins can respond.

** Thank you Ed. I agree with your verdict, but would like to reiterate that I did not "[avoid] the DRN by refusing to participate", I simply ''did not participate'' until the content discussion ceased to make progress, at which point the DRN had already been closed. Had the issue not been solved and had the DRN remained open, I suppose I would have cooperated.

:Are you saying that ''The Economic Times'', ''The Hindustan Times'', ''The Hindu Business Line'' and the multiple other third-party sources that say the same thing about Mr.Menon's exit from Bharti Airtel are not reliable sources? The source you repeatedly replace them all with, to support your whitewashing, the only source I have found that supports that view, is a short interview with Mr.Menon himself, without editorial comment, and thus a primary source.

:*'''Result:''' Article protected one week. Please use this time to discuss the matter on the article talk page. Menon's departure from Bharti Airtel happened in December 2013. Only anonymous sources say there was any problem with his departure, even though reputable newspapers did print what they said. Is there really nobody who will go on the record about Menon? Have there been any charges or lawsuits filed? Menon was known in the business world outside India. Did any publications outside India comment? If not then it seems that [[WP:UNDUE]] should limit the prominence of these reports in our article. Consider asking for advice at [[WP:BLPN]] if agreement can't be reached. [[User:EdJohnston|EdJohnston]] ([[User talk:EdJohnston|talk]]) 15:09, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::{{ping|EdJohnston}} It seems to be a slightly odd case. I've looked everywhere but haven't found anything about charges or lawsuits, and Menon seems to have kept a '''very''' low profile, even though every major business paper and business site in India carried the same story, saying that Menon was sacked for violating Bharti Airtel's code of conduct by giving profitable contracts to companies that he had a personal interest in. And the only comment from Bharti Airtel has been a short note about Menon having "exited" the company. Because of [[WP:UNDUE]] I have reverted edits that said that Menon had been fired, but given the wide coverage in reliable sources I have felt that Menon's hasty exit from Bharti, and the story surrounding it, was worth mentioning. Providing of course that the WP article didn't say more than a multitude of reliable sources did. Unlike Suryasingh31 who has repeatedly tried to remove every mention of it.

This IP is rather insistent on material which, in some cases, does not remotely supports the claims made, or is not cited by others. Edit summaries like '''TRY TO DELETE THIS ARTHUR RUBIN. THAT'S SEVEN REFERENCES. AND THERE WILL BE MORE.)''' seem a tad clueless as to why [[WP:EW]] exists and what it covers. "''Deal with it bro"'' in any post also appears uncollegial.

(The IP had 6 reverts in that time period, under a number of previous IPs.)  And, it's also true that few attempts, either by me or by Collect, have been made on the '''article''' talk page.

United States again[edit]
A floating IP is adding the United States to the list of plutocracies, quoting a probably unreliable source, even though linked. It's claimed to be forthcoming in Perspectives on Politics, a "peer-reviewed journal". We need to wait for it to appear, and then we could note that it is not a majority opinion, so it shouldn't be in the summary. Per WP:FRINGE, we should report the mainstream journals which do not assert that the United States is a plutocracy. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Arthur Rubin (talk • contribs) 01:32, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
It is completely corroborated by the peer reviewed charts at [7]. After several days of asking at other higher volume article talk pages, nobody has produced any sources to the contrary of the Princeton study's conclusions. EllenCT (talk) 03:29, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
It is not required to "prove" any study to be false - the onus is on those who wish to include a study to show that it is widely cited and accepted in the area of study. Collect (talk) 14:36, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
My apologies for not knowing how to use the talk page. If the United States does not belong in examples then why is half of the plutocracy page dedicated to talking about the United States? Do you want to delete half of the entire article as well? — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296:F4F6 (talk) 15:00, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
Nope -- what is needed is material which directly relates to the topic and is found in WP:RS reliable sources, and has wide acceptance in the area concerned. Cheers. Collect (talk) 15:03, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
You wanted references? I got your references. The string of numbers is longer than the four words added. Deal with it bro. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296:F4F6 (talk) 16:07, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
"Deal with it bro" is scarcely a convincing argument that the sources are widely cited and relevant. Perhaps you misapprehended the statement? Collect (talk) 16:11, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
Well at least I have an argument and references. Whoever deletes this, please state why all seven references are invalid instead of bashing talk page humor. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296:F4F6 (talk) 16:21, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
Give cites that your refs are widely cited by others, that they make specific claims that the US is a "plutocracy" and that they are not WP:FRINGE views. Cheers. Collect (talk) 16:24, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
For what other page or statement is it required that one has references for their references? You want an article to prove another article is an article? You would need to delete 99% of Wikipedia based on that requirement. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296:F4F6 (talk) 16:28, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
I also must point out that not a single one of the other governments named in that list have a single reference, and you are not going about deleting them.2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296:F4F6 (talk) 16:34, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
United States 3[edit]
The United States section consists of (IMO, excessive) quotes, without adequate context to verify that they are relating to what we call "plutocracy". Furthermore, they are form a minority, if not WP:FRINGE, opinion, and should be balanced by reliable opinions which deny the claim that the US forms a plutocracy. — Arthur Rubin (talk) 16:39, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
Is New York Times a fringe source? Feel free to add sources stating a counter-argument.2605:A000:F2C0:A400:CD9:4B89:6296:F4F6 (talk) 16:43, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

<u>Comments:</u> <br />

OPTIONAL: I have added the United States to the list of examples of Plutocracy.  It seems reasonable given that the majority of the page indeed talks about problems with the United States.  Collect and Arthur Ruben continue to delete my edits.  I have attempted to make the changes they wanted.  I have added sources and more sources.  They continue to delete it stating that I need sources stating that my sources are good.  I know of no other place on Wikipedia where one needs sources for sources.  Collect has reported me despite making no logical arguments on the talk page.  I feel that the person making the deletions should also have an argument for why they can delete contributions.  By his logic one would need to delete 99% of Wikipedia.  I would also like to point out that he is not actively deleting things in the same paragraph that clearly have no references associated.

::: I appreciate that SSHamilton has raised this, but it should be noted that the passage which Jmorrison230582 is so desperate to distort was added by me to both articles.  It is my only contribution to these articles.  The passage is a simple factual report about an important exchange of letters which are part of the public record and properly cited.  Jmorrison230582 apparently wishes to control (own?) the article and insist on reframing the passage to remove items of obvious significance, the effect being to disguise the actual content of the letters, and the position held by the Christine McKelvie.  Jmorrison230582 has also been distorting the chronology, showing speculative comments from political commentators, made before the definitive letter was written, in a way that (to a casual reader) modifies the meaning of the Reding letter.  Such blatant political spin as is being practiced by Jmorrison230582 is surely not compliant with WP policies?

::::: [[User:Jmorrison230582|Jmorrison230582]] displays a great tendency to make assumptions.  There is nothing in my user name to indicate gender, yet Jmorrison230582 refers to me as a male, why would this be?  For the record, I am a woman.  We are not such unusual creatures, after all, both of the parties in the exchange of letters which form the subject of ElectricTattiebogle's post are also women.  Then there is Jmorrison230582's crazy assertion that ElectricTattiebogle is my sock puppet - why?  The history shows that the passage which Jmorrison230582 is so intent on hiding or distorting was added by ElectricTattiebogle - my role in this is just an attempt to prevent such manipulation.  ElectricTattiebogle and I were at the same meeting here in the US (he has, I think, now returned to Scotland) and were discussing the very low level of the Scottish independence debate and the way that it is reported.  He used Jmorrison230582's attempt to suppress his posting of some facts as a typical tactic, I responded by reverting Jmorrison230582 myself.  Jmorrison230582 needs to stand back and assess their own behavior in this.  How much other misrepresentation and bias has been introduced into these articles by partisan editors?  Unfortunately I do not have the time to investigate further. [[User:SSHamilton|SSHamilton]] ([[User talk:SSHamilton|talk]]) 16:18, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

I've started multiple discussions on his talk page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:AbelM7] and he have removed many more, last week we seemed to finally have reached an agreement regarding how the outcomes should be, but two days ago he broke it and started to remove information again.

<u>Comments:</u> <br />
Every other editor except [[User:Billbowler2]] has been able to engage in this disagreement, editing on the main pages of [[Iraq War]] and [[Casualties of the Iraq War]] and discussing on the talk pages, without going over the 3RR bright line. Bill is clearly editing against consensus at [[Iraq War]], and while only he and I are disagreeing at [[Casualties of the Iraq War]], in both cases he insists on breaking 3RR despite my repeated warnings. After my first warning he logged out and edited as an IP, violating 3RR at [[Casualties of the Iraq War]], so I reported him as a sock. When he stated that he'd logged out accidentally, I took him at his word, but he refused to self-revert and instead broke 3RR again, this time at [[Iraq War]].

The disagreement in both cases is over the nature of body counts versus survey estimates of violent deaths due to conflict. Bill is adamant that the distinction is an arbitrary one pushing a POV. -[[User:Darouet|Darouet]] ([[User talk:Darouet|talk]]) 01:19, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

::{{AN3|b|24 hours}}. Billbowler2 has clearly shown a [[WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT]] mentality about consensus drawn at [[Talk:Iraq War]], with a similar dispute at [[Casualties of the Iraq War]] resulting in another 3RR violation. The edit war has persisted for over three days, so a brief block has been placed on Billbower2's account. {{u|Darouet}}, I should point out that the editing history at [[Casualties of the Iraq War]] suggests you have also violated the three-revert rule. I realize that dispute is similar in nature to the other backed by consensus, but it's best to wait for preventive measures to be put in place and [[WP:ROWN|revert only when necessary]].

Diff of attempt to resolve dispute on article talk page: Several times [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HMWD&diff=604696278&oldid=604683283] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HMWD&diff=604703837&oldid=604703568] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AbelM7&diff=604951861&oldid=604948900] (this is was when we agreed on the outcome)

<u>Comments:</u> HMWD has been edit warring in the [[Border War (1910–19)]] aricle ever since he started editing and particularly only seems to have created his account specifically for the [[Border War (1910–19)]] article and other articles that includes the Border War such as [[List of wars involving the United States]], [[List of wars involving Mexico]] and [[Battle of Parral]] and seems to be a single-purpose account. He has been edit warring with me through several articles [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Border_War_(1910%E2%80%9319)&action=history] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States&action=history] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Mexico] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Parral&action=history] and won't stop. He seems to have a personal issue with the way the Border War turned out. The Battle of Parral has had United States (or American) victory since it was created [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Parral&oldid=449085005] and he changed it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Parral&diff=587167242&oldid=574437578] and reverts every time I restore it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Parral&diff=605534891&oldid=604944162] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Parral&diff=606425213&oldid=606177744] He removes information that have been there before he started editing that we doesn't want [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Border_War_(1910%E2%80%9319)&diff=586286148&oldid=586284160] claiming for it to be "original research". Last week, we agreed on the outcome of the Border War but then he started to add more information which we didn't agree on. I didn't paid too much attention since I was just relived we had come to a conlusion and I took a break from Wikipedia. After returning and seeing the changes he had done, including the amount of results he had added, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Border_War_(1910%E2%80%9319)&diff=605105728&oldid=605105519] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Border_War_(1910%E2%80%9319)&diff=605533535&oldid=605105728] (including removing a sentence that has long been there since the article was created), I later restored [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Border_War_(1910%E2%80%9319)&diff=606178136&oldid=605533535] and removed the extra information [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Border_War_(1910%E2%80%9319)&diff=606178526&oldid=606178136] but then he added them again. The amount of results that he added is ridiculously too much for a minor early 20th century war like this one. Not even the [[Seven Years' War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], which were much bigger wars, have that many results listed. We agreed on the outcome and he goes on adding more results and giving the outcome a ridiculously long term "Mexican Carransista/American Victory on Villista rebels" [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_wars_involving_Mexico&diff=605106017&oldid=605105472] (it would be the equivalent of having "Allied Victory on the Axis Powers" for every country that participated in World War II "list of wars" aricles) He has been blocked for edit warring and breaking the 3 revert rule before [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:HMWD&diff=604715938&oldid=604706604] and continues to edit war. I've tried talking and reasoning with him but he won't stop. He even said he "won't go away". Something must be done with HMWD.

:<small>(<span style="color:#555;">Non-administrator observation</span>)</small> I think this is too old.

Anyway, I think it's subsided. Blocks should be [[WP:BLOCK#PREVENTATIVE|preventative]], not punitive, and I think this edit war has already ended.
