== Circumcision ==

What is the real reason the Jewish people adopted the practice of circumcision of male baies? Was it to prevent the boys from obtaining easy sexual gratificatin in accordance with old biblical laws?--[[Special:Contributions/31.55.123.188|31.55.123.188]] ([[User talk:31.55.123.188|talk]]) 00:03, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:Have you read [[circumcision]]? [[User:Evanh2008|Evan]]&nbsp;<sup>([[User talk:Evanh2008|talk]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/Evanh2008|contribs]])</sup> 00:06, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

::There's [[Bris#Reasons_for_circumcision|our coverage on the Jewish reasons for circumcision]]. 00:13, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:Are there Biblical laws against sexual gratification? Does circumcision prevent sexual gratification? (You will find that the answers to both are "no" but you may not have thought to ask.) [[User:Adam Bishop|Adam Bishop]] ([[User talk:Adam Bishop|talk]]) 02:08, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

:The reason I'd always heard was a visual way to distinguish themselves from non-Jews. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 04:58, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
::That's a somewhat anachronistic way of looking at it, popularized by Christians a bit more than by Jews. [[Justin Martyr]] was fond of the idea that God had ordained circumcision (c. 1200 BCE, or so the story goes) as a sign to make the persecution of Jews following the [[Bar Kochba revolt]] (135 CE) easier. [http://www.bombaxo.com/trypho.html "...that you and only you might suffer the afflictions that are now justly yours; that only your land be desolate, and your cities ruined by fire; that the fruits of your land be eaten by strangers before your very eyes; that not one of you be permitted to enter your city of Jerusalem."]
::That said, circumcision is called a "sign" in the Torah, but so is the rainbow. The idea seems to be that it served as a visual reminder (for Jews? for God? for both?) of the covenant God originally made with Abraham. ''Lest ye forget...'' and all that.
::Circumcision has historically been one of those things that makes Jews ''weird'' compared to the general population. During the [[Hellenistic period]], it made it particularly difficult to visit the [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] without getting dirty looks, and some Jews took to primitive (and, I have to imagine, incredibly unpleasant) forms of [[foreskin restoration]] surgery. This culminated in the 160s BCE when [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] outlawed circumcision (among some of those other weird things Jews do), which made [[Maccabees|some people]] rather [[Maccabean Revolt|upset]]. [[User:Evanh2008|Evan]]&nbsp;<sup>([[User talk:Evanh2008|talk]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/Evanh2008|contribs]])</sup> 06:36, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:::According to [http://www.foreskin.gc.bz/other_historical.php this page], it wasn't always surgery but a leather thong called a ''[[kynodesme]]'' which looks more inconvenient than painful. The same page also discusses other stretching methods used in classical times. According to [http://www.cirp.org/library/history/ this page], in "about 140 C.E., the Jewish authorities modified circumcision procedure to make it impossible for a Jew to appear to be an uncircumcised Greek. A radical new procedure called ''[[Brit milah#Uncovering, priah|peri'ah]]'' was introduced by the priests and rabbis". [[User:Alansplodge|Alansplodge]] ([[User talk:Alansplodge|talk]]) 15:13, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
::::That second source is truly horrible, not least because the [[Hellenic period]] never occurred outside Greece (and the [[Hellenistic period]], which I assume is what the author meant, ended about 220 years before the given date of 140 CE). Priests weren't calling the shots in 140, anyway. [[User:Evanh2008|Evan]]&nbsp;<sup>([[User talk:Evanh2008|talk]]&#124;[[Special:Contributions/Evanh2008|contribs]])</sup> 22:06, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Well maybe, but the same information is in our article [[Brit milah#Uncovering, priah]]: "[[David Gollaher]] has written that the rabbis added the procedure of ''priah'' to discourage men from trying to restore their foreskins". The source quoted is David Gollaher (2000), ''[http://www.amazon.com/Circumcision-History-Worlds-Controversial-Surgery/dp/0465026532 Circumcision: A History of The World’s Most Controversial Surgery]'', Basic Books (p. 17).

:Preventing sexual gratification (e.g. masturbation) was the reason that the '''Americans''' and '''British''' started circumcising boys in large numbers, according to our article, with citations therein -

::::Is that your opinion, or the opinion of the babies who are too young to consent?

:::::The genitals are still completely functional after, the only stress the kids encounter by the time they can remember anything is bigots telling them they've been mutilated.  At the worst, it is a cosmetic procedure, and if you actually read our article on [[circumcision]], you'll see plenty of medical benefits from the procedure (including reduced risk of STDs and UTIs).  I've seen parents get their kids ears pierced before they were too young to make the decision for themselves, because that was part of their parents' culture.  Would you tell their kids that their ears were mutilated?  [[User:Ian.thomson|Ian.thomson]] ([[User talk:Ian.thomson|talk]]) 21:09, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::: Yes, I would (well, not to the kids' faces).  But calling people bigots for preferring to have their bodies left the way they were made seems somewhat POV.  On that basis, how about we routinely remove kids' appendices to preempt appendicitis, peritonitis etc, which have killed many people.  It's not as if the appendix has any known function.  --  [[User:JackofOz|<font face="Papyrus">Jack of Oz</font>]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|<span style="font-size:85%"><font face="Verdana" ><sup>[pleasantries]</sup></font></span>]] 21:17, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
::::It helps to not use loaded terms like "mutilation". Scientifically, we can all agree that circumcision of male infants involves the irreversible removal of genital tissue. In most jurisdictions, infants cannot legally consent. So we have a non-consensual and irreversible removal of genital tissue going on. Whether or not anyone thinks that's ok is not a matter for the science reference desk. [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 21:25, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:::::Perhaps an unfortunate choice of words, as I had no intention whatsoever of starting a debate, but yes, preforming an completely unnecessary medical procure on a non-consenting infant is obviously mutilation. This is why it has been the subject of [[Circumcision_and_law#Modern_Law|numerous court cases and legislative debates]] in many countries worldwide, so far the adoption of prohibitive legislation has only been stopped by the religious lobbies. Calling caring and 21st century parents bigots is ridiculous and insulting. [[User:Fgf10|Fgf10]] ([[User talk:Fgf10|talk]]) 21:32, 21 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{ec}}
:{{od}}If removing the appendix didn't involve invasive surgery, why not remove it? Jack, you're citing POV in this discussion, like it's an article? Like this isn't inherently a matter of POV? Don't want to get circumcised? Fine. But don't tell people who are that they're mutilated, because, when it's done as a baby, they don't have a problem with it except bigots who tell them they're mutilated. It's not like circumcised people are crawling into people's house at night to steal foreskins, so it is bigoted to react to circumcised people not having a problem with having been circumcised by saying they've been mutilated.

== Need help finding a short story ==

I'm trying to find a short story I read a long time ago. The details in my mind are really hazy, but as best as I can remember it's about two boys who spend their time shoplifting and spraying graffiti. By the end of the story the boy who is the main character sort of "sees the light" and starts taking an interest in learning. The story starts out with the two boys going out to spray graffiti (the name the other boy signs is "weezul"), then there's a flashback to where they were both in a store shoplifting, and the narrator recalls the other boy telling him "don't look at him" (the store owner) before they went in. In the last scene the boy is reciting all these things he's read about to his teacher just out of eagerness to share them with someone else. Those are the only details I remember.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/41.254.5.219|41.254.5.219]] ([[User talk:41.254.5.219|talk]]) 09:13, 21 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

== Where does confiscated money go? ==

You sometimes here in news after some police raids, that reasonable amount of money as result from illegal business has been confiscated. My question is, where does the police send the money then after investigations were concluded? I always wondered.

Thanks to the transparency of the Bitcoin block chain, you can actually see what happens to the FBI Bit-seizure of coin from Silk Road accounts.[http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/10/04/fbi-silk-road-bitcoin-seizure/#./?&_suid=139820736178805622858418257681] [[User:JustAnotherUploader|JustAnotherUploader]] ([[User talk:JustAnotherUploader|talk]]) 23:01, 22 April 2014 (UTC)

The FBI said loosely, 'we've nothing against Bitcoins generally; we're just seizing them because they're criminal proceeds from the Silk Road the same way we'd seize cars, freeze bank accounts and so on.'  Leicester Police, UK just flog them on ebay [https://www.leics.police.uk/advice-and-information/information-zone/ebay-store] - so would a lot of people.  You have something you don't need, you know it's worth something, but don't know how much.  Ebay, auction only no reserve.  Some police services donate to charity [https://www.google.com/search?q=police+criminal+proceeds+charity&safe=active], but the biggest laughing stock is the Jewish chief priests in the Bible, Matthew 27:7.  
They made trumped up charges of blasphemy/incitement to tax evasion/treason against Jesus and bribed Judas Iscariot '30 pieces of silver' (approximately a slave's price) to identify who to arrest.  Afterwards, Judas was apologetic and tried to hand back the bribe.  In v4, they told him that was his own problem.  After he threw the coins into the Temple (?) and took his own life, the priests then decided that although it was OK to bribe, where it had already been meant it couldn't go back into the Temple's account.  Astonishing. --[[Special:Contributions/81.145.165.2|81.145.165.2]] ([[User talk:81.145.165.2|talk]]) 11:17, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
