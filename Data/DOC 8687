The '''John L. Thompson House''' is a historic house in [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. John L. Thompson, an [[Oregon Trail|American emigrant]] and successful [[blacksmith]], built his [[house]] in 1889 in a simple, one-story [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] style. Subsequently, in 1897, the house underwent a significant expansion to become a prominent [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] residence. The house represents the evolution of [[architecture]] in frontier towns, and is one of The Dalles' outstanding examples of the Queen Anne style. It was converted to professional offices in 1979.<ref name="ThomNom">{{Citation | last = Bailey | first = Barbara | date = March 20, 1980 | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory — Nomination Form: Thompson, John L.
