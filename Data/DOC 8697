Title : Franz Alexander von Kleist
Text : '''Franz Alexander von Kleist''' (24 December 1769 – 8 August 1797) was a [[Germans|German]] poet of the late 18th century.

== Life ==
Franz Alexander was a member of the noble [[Pomerania]]n [[von Kleist]] family. He was born in [[Potsdam]], son of General [[Franz Kasimir von Kleist]] (1736–1808) and his wife Caroline Luise Eleonore Johanne (also née von Kleist, but of the Zützen branch of the family; 1747–1780). General [[Friedrich Ludwig Heinrich von Kleist]] was his younger brother.

In 1784 Franz Alexander entered the [[Prussia]]n Infantry Regiment of the Duke of Brunswick ("Herzog von Braunschweig"). His regiment was stationed in [[Halberstadt]], where he came into close contact with [[Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim]], who because of his earlier friendship with [[Ewald Christian von Kleist]], who fell in battle in 1759, had a particular inclination towards him. Franz Alexander is reckoned as a member of the Halberstadt Poetry Circle ("Halberstädter Dichterkreis"). He wrote several texts while he was in Halberstadt. After he left the town until his early death he kept up a correspondence with Gleim.

He took part in the campaign of 1789, then left the army and went to Berlin. Under Minister [[Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg]] he became an attaché in 1791. In January 1792 he married Albertine von Jungk (1774-1855) and left government service in the following year.

He bought the estate of his deceased father-in-law, [[Falkenhagen]] near [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], sold it again and settled at [[Ringenwalde]] near [[Neudamm]] in the [[Neumark]], where he died before he was 28. His widow married in 1800 Captain Ferdinand von Waldow of Dannenwalde in [[Gransee]].

== Works ==
During his short life Franz Alexander published a great deal. He was much read in his lifetime and immediately after his death, and then almost entirely forgotten. His literary legacy is preserved in the [[Kleist Museum]] in Frankfurt (Oder).

== Children ==
By his wife Albertine he had the following children:
* Ferdinand (died young)
* Karl (died young)
* Adelaide (21 October 1794 – 16 August 1854); married Major General Ludwig Georg Adam von Wurmb (2 May 1788 – 28 February 1855).
