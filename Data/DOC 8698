*'''Delete''' - The same user has created a draft article in the more appropriate place, [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/AstapovLawyer]], so this is not needed.  This is a brand new user who likely doesn't understand about MfD, so the deletion should be explained nicely.  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 02:00, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
