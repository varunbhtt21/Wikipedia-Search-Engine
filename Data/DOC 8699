'''Anthony Buck Creeke Jr.''' (25 September 1860 – 25 July 1932) was an English solicitor and early [[philatelist]] who edited ''[[Stamp Collector's Fortnightly]]'' and ''[[The British Philatelist]]''. In 1903, he was sentenced to six months in jail for trafficking illegally in British official stamps that should not have been available to the public in unused condition. He was removed from the roll of solicitors but reinstated in 1913.

==Early life==
Anthony Buck Creeke Junior was born in [[Habergham Eaves]], Burnley, Lancashire, on 25 September 1860, to Anthony Buck Creeke, an attorney, and his wife Catharine Elizabeth Creeke. The family were wealthy and in 1871 employed six servants.<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KDX7-9YV Anthony Buck Creeke England and Wales Census, 1871.] Family Search. Retrieved 23 December 2017.</ref> By 1881, Creeke senior was described as a solicitor and town clerk of Burnley.<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q275-6DR1 Anthony B Creeke England and Wales Census, 1881.] Family Search. Retrieved 23 December 2017.</ref>

==Family==
Creeke married Miriam Agnes Collick in London in 1891. In the 1911 census they are recorded as having two sons and five daughters.<ref name=1911cens/>

==Philately==
He was an early philatelist who edited ''Stamp Collector's Fortnightly'' and ''The British Philatelist''. His close friend and collaborator in philatelic matters was [[H. E. Wright|Hastings E. Wright]] (died 1897).

===Official stamps case===
In 1903, Creeke was sentenced to six months in jail for trafficking illegally in British Office of Works stamps that should not have been available to the public in unused condition.<ref>"The Government Official Stamp Case", ''The London Philatelist'', Vol. XII, No. 141 (September 1903), pp. 215-218.</ref> The case caused him to be removed from the roll of solicitors, though he was reinstated in 1913,<ref name=londonphil260>"Mr. A. B. Creeke, Junior." ''The London Philatelist'', Vol. XXII, No. 260 (August 1913), p. 187.</ref> and may be the reason why he never signed the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]], despite the selector's original intention that he should. King George V was the first signatory.

===''The Creeke Index''===
Creeke prepared an index to 800 philatelic journals in English from 1862 to about 1928 along with ''[[Le Timbre-Poste]]''.<ref name=abps>[http://www.abps.org.uk/Home/Who_Was_Who/index.xalter#A Who Was Who in British Philately], [[Association of British Philatelic Societies]], 2014. Retrieved 10 April 2014. [https://www.webcitation.org/5zDx9UBpl Archived here.]</ref> The index, which is now known as ''The Creeke Index'', was sold to the Royal Philatelic Society London in 1936 by Creeke's widow who had been unable to find a publisher for it. [[Charles Nissen]] facilitated the sale. The ''London Philatelist'' noted its receipt and hoped it would be of great assistance to researchers but also commented on the fact that the costs of production would render publication impossible.<ref>"The Creeke Philatelic Library Index" in ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. 45, No. 540, December 1936, p. 290.</ref> In fact, the index, which was in manuscript and typescript form and hard to understand, was placed in a basement storage room and largely forgotten until the 21st century when it was restructured by Brian Birch of the Royal Philatelic Society London.<ref>"The Creeke Index - Biographical references" by Brian J. Birch, ''The London Philatelist'', Vol. 121, No. 1398 (September 2012), pp. 279-284.</ref>

==Career==
Creeke qualified as a solicitor but was removed from the roll following his imprisonment in 1903. At the time of the 1911 census he was recorded as working as a journalist.<ref name=1911cens>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XW4N-RVB Anthony Buck Creeke Junr England and Wales Census, 1911.] Family Search. Retrieved 23 December 2017.</ref> He was reinstated as a solicitor in 1913.<ref name=londonphil260/>

==Death==

He left an estate of £824.<ref>[https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar/GetImgSrc?filePath=%2F1932%2FC%2F000835_creasy_1932.Png 1932 Probate Calendar.] Retrieved 23 December 2017.</ref>
