"'''Run of the Mill'''" is a ballad by British [[rock music|rock]] [[rock band|band]] [[Judas Priest]] from their debut album ''[[Rocka Rolla]]''. The song was the first written by guitarist [[K. K. Downing]], soon after vocalist [[Rob Halford]] joined the band.<ref name=Jugulator1>{{cite web|title=The Judas Priest History|url=http://www.jugulator.net/judas_priest_history.htm|publisher=The Jugulator|accessdate=27 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530233111/http://www.jugulator.net/judas_priest_history.htm|archive-date=30 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Popoff|first=Martin|title=Black Sabbath FAQ|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEXhxPrdWS4C&pg=PA169}}</ref> Downing wrote it, in part, to display Halford's unique vocal range.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The track was first recorded as a demo circa 1973, along with another early Priest song, "Whiskey Woman". This track would later surface in altered form on Priest's [[Sad Wings of Destiny|second album]] as "[[Victim of Changes]]".<ref name=Jugulator1/> Priest's manager at the time, Dave Corke, brought the demo to [[Gull (record label)|Gull Records]], who would later sign Priest after their president, David Howells, attended a performance of the band, with [[Budgie (band)|Budgie]] at London's Marquee Club on 11 February 1974. The song was later recorded properly for their debut, ''Rocka Rolla'', in the summer of 1974.

The song's lyrics are about a poor old man, whose "prospects" for a good life "vanished", now embattled and confused by today's society. Following the first two verses is a long guitar jam with [[Glenn Tipton]] and Downing. At the end of the song, the music gets heavier as Halford shows off his vocal range by wailing the end lines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Jeff|title=Mean Deviation|pages=16–17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwZcZ2X5ToC&pg=PA16}}</ref>

"Run of the Mill" was Priest's longest recorded track until "Cathedral Spires", a track from their 1997 album, [[Jugulator]]. It was also the longest track co-written by Rob Halford, Glenn Tipton, and K. K. Downing prior to "Lochness", a track from their 2005 album, [[Angel of Retribution]].

Although Priest has not performed the song since the mid-1970s, many fans and critics consider it to be one of the highlights of the album and a classic early Priest track.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
