Page doesn't really serve a purpose. Combination of an incomplete list and a reiteration that we need to verify the things we write.

*'''Delete''' per nom. The page seems not to be useful and may not be used for future references. [[User:EuroCarGT|<font color="cyan">'''///Euro'''</font><font color="grey">'''Car'''</font>]][[User talk:EuroCarGT|<font color="orange">'''GT'''</font>]] 04:37, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Userfy''' I wrote it, and I plan to develop it more fully. So why don't I move it to my user space? --[[User:Ed Poor|Uncle Ed]] ([[User talk:Ed Poor|talk]]) 12:36, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
**I have moved it to your userspace (as [[User:Ed Poor/Superlatives]]), and will '''Withdraw''' the MfD.
