Non-notable company. References are not from independent reliable sources, and smell like press releases. I found nothing substantial in a search. The company was founded in 2012; this article was written in 2013 by an SPA who immediately recreated it after speedy deletion of an earlier version.

*'''Comment''': The article was contributed by a [[:WP:SPA]] account [[User:Aritulla]]; the company co-founder is one Ari Tulla; I am adding a [[:WP:COI]] notice. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 06:24, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
:::Good catch; I missed that. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 17:29, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': I am finding nothing beyond the kind of product announcements coverage which is the basic requirement for any start-up of this kind. Lacks [[:WP:RS|evidence]] of [[:WP:CORPDEPTH|attained notability]]. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 06:31, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as lacking independent coverage and/or [[WP:TOOSOON]]. [[User:Stuartyeates|Stuartyeates]] ([[User talk:Stuartyeates|talk]]) 03:08, 9 May 2014 (UTC)
