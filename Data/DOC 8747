==Why can't this page get published. ==
Hello, I am wondering what type of sources is needed to get a page published on the website. the name is IPC Systems Inc. can you tell me what sources can work to get it published. I have been trying to get this published over a year and it still will not be published. 
[[User:DS132|DS132]] ([[User talk:DS132|talk]]) 15:42, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:Hello {{u|DS132}}, and thanks for your question. Please read the Wikipedia guidelines on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] to see what sort of references you will need. You can always create a draft of your article in your [[WP:SANDBOX|sandox]], and, providing that it is not [[WP:PROMO|blatant advertising or promotion]] or otherwise breaks Wikipedia guidelines, no one will delete it. You can then ask someone to take a look at it before you submit it to [[WP:AFC|articles for creation]]. Good luck, [[User:Philg88|<span style="color:#3a23e2; font-weight:bold; text-shadow:grey 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em;">&nbsp;Philg88&nbsp;</span>]]<sup>♦[[User_talk:Philg88|talk]]</sup> 16:10, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
::You are talking about the article [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/IPC Systems]]. The problem is the references. To establish that the company is "notable", that is already well known, you need sources that are not only independent of the company but are independent of the company's press releases. The WatersTechnology piece seems to be independent, but is very short. Are there other industry publications that would have analyzed IPC systems and its products?

==using Wiki programming language in the edit window==
I'm sure I could do better on the Wiki if only I could get someone to explain the programming language ''viz'': rowspan, border, margin, padding, style, cellspacing, cellpadding  etc. I learned once how to use Pascal but that was some time ago. Someone please help, then I might be better equipped to make some more edits. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:jodosma|<font style="color:black;background:pink;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Jodosma&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small>[[User talk:Jodosma| (talk)]] 20:35, 22 April 2014 (UTC)
:Hi Jodosma, this is called ''mark up'' or ''wiki-markup'' - in this case most of it is borrowed from (or is) [[HTML]].  
:* <code>rowspan</code> for example is used in a table to go across multiple rows (<code>colspan</code> is the same for columns)>

::Most editors just ignore all this rowspan etc nonsense, and when we want a table, we use the existing one, or we copy a similar one from somewhere else, or we ask someone like Rich Fambrough to make one for us. After all, we're not planning to make fancy tables in our own style, we only want encyclopedic-style tables the same as what other similar articles have. Most of us, anyway. --[[User:Demiurge1000|Demiurge1000]] ([[User_talk:Demiurge1000|talk]]) 20:05, 23 April 2014 (UTC)

==Disputing a long unedited article.==
Hi! So I am interested in working on changing the language for an article titled [[Spanish Golden Age]].  In regard to art historical research and practice it reveals a certain mindset about imperialism that was popular with scholars about a generation ago.  Granted these scholars are still working but there has been a shift away from politically charged terms such as Golden Age.  The article itself seems to have difficulty with the term, it refers to the a previous "Golden Age" in Spain disambiguated as Al-Andalus.  It would be better to refer to this topic as Baroque Spain or Early Modern Spain.  The talk page lists 2008 as the last edit.  I hesitate to make the edit because it would change the title of the article. Any advice on how I can prepare to make such major change? Thanks. [[User:Hafabe|Hafabe]] ([[User talk:Hafabe|talk]]) 01:12, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:Greetings! The move and edits you describe sound major, but not all that controversial. I would just be [[WP:BOLD|bold]] and make the [[WP:MOVE|move]] and edits, and if someone takes issue there is no edit that cannot be undone.

:A little comment here, we decide article names by [[WP:COMMONNAME|what is the most common name]].  If there are scholarly reasons to use a "better name" in the article, that can be done, with a suitable explanation.  The reference to Al-Andalus was added in 2007 by a problem editor - see [[WP:Jagged 85 cleanup]] for details.

==Speedy deletion==
I have tried to make articles but they have been contested for Speedy deletion. And it deletes the page. So i have seen articles that i dont know why have been made. How do you make a speedy deletion. Just what is the process of how to do it. [[User:Tylkrby767|Tylkrby767]] ([[User talk:Tylkrby767|talk]]) 02:26, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:Hi Tylkrby767. It's nice to see you back at the Teahouse. Are you planning to find articles to delete because your articles were deleted? You should get more experience with writing on Wikipedia and understanding what encyclopedia articles should be like.

::::Excellent point, {{U|Vchimpanzee}}. Good faith editors who search out articles that truly don't belong on this encyclopedia and take steps to delete them are doing an excellent service for this project. I have supported deletion of hundreds of bad articles, and supported keeping hundreds of otherwise weak articles about notable topics. But sometimes, an editor who wrote a non-compliant article on a non-notable topic that got deleted will go on a personal campaign to delete articles about similar "borderline notable" topics just to make some sort of a point, and then say, "I told you so! I was wronged!". What such editors don't often realize is that a quick review of their edit history reveals their motive quite clearly. It is my hope that this is not the motivation of {{U|Tylkrby}}.

== Deleted Wiki page still shows up == 
Hi,

I created a wiki page which was nominated for speedy deletion (website, no referencing, not notable) and has been removed by admin. The problem is that the page still shows up on Google search and other search engine. Is this permanent? I mean deleted page can create confusions in the minds of customers who search for website (Wikipedia page) and see a warning instead of content. Cheers :)[[User:SR Ampak 110|SR Ampak 110]] ([[User talk:SR Ampak 110|talk]]) 10:35, 24 April 2014 (UTC)SR Ampak 110.

:No, it's not permanent - but it's not something we have any control over, either. Google will continue to show the deleted page until its crawlers pick up the deletion, which can take up to a week. Once that happens, it will vanish from the search results.

:This applies to the wikipedia.org version of the article. If an external website has copied it to their own domain before it was deleted then it may remain there, but would probably be much lower in Google search results. In your case the article was only live for three hours so it probably wasn't copied. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] ([[User talk:PrimeHunter|talk]]) 11:19, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

:::At the end of the day, this man was acquitted of murder.

::::What wording are you talking about specifically? That certainly wasn't my intention.

::::::The wording that jumps right out at me is "Blood stain patterns on Camm's clothing were interpreted as evidence of his guilt, and he was convicted of the murders." in the lead, and it is quite a few sentences later that it is finally mentioned that highly qualified experts disputed that evidence. Instead, we learn in the next sentence about marital infidelity. Why does that belong in the lead of an article about a man ''acquitted'' of murder? I don't have any idea myself who did the killing. But [[WP:BLP]] imposes a major burden on us to be scrupulously fair to people acquitted of criminal charges, {{U|Bali88}}.

The first thing to do is to stop reverting and discuss the issue on the article's [[Talk:RadiumOne|talk page]], laying out the reasons for your concerns based on Wikipedia guidelines for [[WP:PROMOTION|non-promotion of companies]] and [[WP:RS|sourcing]]. As the page is now the subject of a [[WP:AfD|deletion discussion]], you may wish to hang fire on using the talk page and and instead comment on that.

==Replacing a Redirect page with a Disambiguation page?==
Greetings, wise inhabitants of the Teahouse.  I am confused again, and I hope you can point me in the right direction. I am updating the page for [[Macquarie_University_Sport_and_Aquatic_Centre]].  This is commonly known by its initials "MUSAC", and I would like to ensure that somebody looking for those initials can navigate to this article.

However, there is already an article [[MUSAC]], which is about the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León. So I cannot see how I can point readers to the article I am editing without messing up the existing one.  I am sure this situation must have come up and been solved many times before, so would somebody please be kind enough to explain the preferred approach, or point me to it?  [[User:Gronk Oz|Gronk Oz]] ([[User talk:Gronk Oz|talk]]) 08:10, 23 April 2014 (UTC)
:Welcome back to the Teahouse {{u|Gronk Oz}}! As the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León would in all likelihood be considered the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary topic]] for MUSAC, it does not warrant replacement by a two entry [[WP:Disambiguation|disambiguation page]]. My suggestion is to put a {{tl|for}} or {{tl|distinguish}} hatnote on both articles explaining the two acronymns.

But the sources I've read take a more nuanced stance although I haven't done a more in-depth study. It is not my personal favored style of music, but there is a reason that the company was so successful for so long. Let's be sure that our coverage of the topic is neutral, rather than reflecting our own individual musical preferences, which have no encyclopedic relevance at all.

I doubt that somebody looking for those initials would accidentally get to the company - if anything, it could go the other way.

{{Outdent}}Even though it is irrelevant, I want to point out that the company once called Muzak produces many different kinds of music, and the style associated with them, which I like a lot, is one some sources claim they don't distribute any more.

==Lots of content from one source: how to cite?==
In the article [[Flipnote Studio 3D]] I am editing, there are fairly large sections of text under "Flipnote creation" and "Online services" that are backed up by just one source. Do I add a citation after every single sentence? Every paragraph? The end of the section?
-[[User:Sfz95|Sforzando]] ([[User talk:Sfz95|talk]]) 23:40, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
:You can cite at the end of each paragraph.  Even this is overkill, but on WP things get moved around, so it's not a bad idea.  If you label your citations then you don't need to re do the whole thing.
:e.g. <nowiki><ref name="mvlc"> my very long citation.... </ref> and then when you want to reuse it <ref name="mvlc" />  (note the space-slash " /" at the end)</nowiki>.

==Worldwide View?==
Some articles are tagged with the phrase "The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject". Could anyone provide some tips as to how one could obtain a worldwide view and/or concensus on a topic? What practical steps would be needed? [[User:MargRouk|MargRouk]] ([[User talk:MargRouk|talk]]) 08:15, 25 April 2014 (UTC)
:Hey [[User:MargRouk|MargRouk]] - great question. I assume you're talking about [[Template:Globalize]]. As outlined at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias]], an issue that sometimes occurs in articles is that editors tend to edit with a bias just by falling under certain demographics. This can result in articles that don't give a truly global view of certain topics. For example, some parts of our [[Basketball]] article tend to focus on US-aspects of the sport while ignoring the rest of the world. Naturally, this is a result of many editors being from the United States. If an article is focused on one country, try to find resources that provide information on the topic in regards to other countries. It certainly helps to have a bit of knowledge of the subject beforehand. The key is to give [[WP:UNDUE|proper weight]] for each viewpoint; the amount of focus and coverage a viewpoint should have is determined by their prevalence in reliable sources. For a more specific list of things you can do, check out [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering Systemic Bias#Tasks]]. Hope this helps, <b>~<i><font color="#07517C">[[User:SuperHamster|Super]]</font></i><font color="#6FA23B">[[User:SuperHamster|Hamster]]</font></b> <small>[[User talk:SuperHamster|Talk]] [[Special:Contributions/SuperHamster|Contribs]]</small> 08:34, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

:Actually I didn't know about the Globalize template. Thanks so much for the advice and clarifications, especially the points on proper weight and reliable sources make perfect sense.  [[User:MargRouk|MargRouk]] ([[User talk:MargRouk|talk]]) 09:16, 25 April 2014 (UTC)

IPC Systems, Inc is a provider of trading floor communication systems and network services to financial entities[1] including investment banks, hedge funds and investment managers. [2] The company’s written aim is to deliver “unified solutions that support collaborative voice trading, real-time electronic trading and market data connectivity” [2] via a proprietary managed private IP network [3] to financial market participants, globally. [4] IPC provides and services voice communication systems that facilitate operations within the financial industry. The firm is known for creating and updating trading turrets – specialized, multi-line, multi-speaker communications devices used by traders. Turrets can have access to hundreds of lines and allow traders to monitor multiple connections simultaneously to maintain communication with counterparties, liquidity providers, intermediaries and exchanges.[5] IPC’s communication systems aim to consolidate voice functionality, traditional phone lines, broker lines, intercom, teleconferencing, TV sound and PC sound-into a single unit.

History[edit]
Headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey, IPC employs approximately 1,000 employees throughout the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. [2] IPC was founded as Interconnect Planning Corporation as a consulting company in 1973. This changed when Republic National Bank approached IPC founder Stephen Nichols with a request to improve upon the bank’s trading hardware. [7] Consequently, IPC introduced its Series I turret in 1974. The product cost approximately $75,000 to develop. The Series I used momentary contact buttons to send a signal to the backroom relays to switch calls, rather than relying on rods and levers and switching at the turret itself like other equipment of the day. [7]

IPC was the first to use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) on the trading floor to reduce communication costs and increase productivity.[3] The company introduced the first VoIP-based turret in 2001 and its second generation VoIP based turret, the IQ/MAX, in 2006. [8] Clients of IPC’s VoIP solutions include Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America [1] and Merrill Lynch. [9]

:Hi {{U|DS132}}. You can use [[WP:Wikilinks|wikilinks]] to create a hyperlink to any page on Wikipedia, you don't need to copy-and-paste the entire page's content in order to discuss it elsewhere. For example here I have used the code <code><nowiki>[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/IPC Systems]]</nowiki></code> to create this link to your draft: [[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/IPC Systems]]. --[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]<sup> [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]</sup> 23:32, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*Hi {{U|DS132}}. No one is doubting the truth of what you have written, this is a question of ''notability''.
:Wikipedia does not aim to have a page on every business that has every existed (you wouldn't expect to see one about the burger shop down my street), and we do not simply wish to [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE|catalogue all information]]. Unlike our pages on well-known entities such as [[HSBC]], [[McDonalds]] or [[Ford Motors]], no general-purpose encylopedia in history has every had a page on "IPC Systems". So, therefore, before a page on "IPC Systems" can exist an ''Articles for Creation'' reviewer need to be convinced that the company is "notable" enough to devote a page in the encylopedia to it.
:We have [[WP:NCORP|specific guidelines for the notability of companies]]. As a rule of thumb [[WP:42|Articles generally require significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the topic]].  Generally this is to be proved by the references used in the draft, we need to see evidence that major publications consider the company important enough to talk about. This does not include press releases *(which are not ''independent''), and mainstream media carries a lot more weight on the ''significant coverage'' criterion than niche industry magazines etc. In this specific instance, the main problem identified by the AfC reviewer is that the references are all from "niche" publications within the industry.
:By design of these strict criteria, most companies will not be considered "notable". If that is the case [[WP:AKON|no amount of editing of a draft can change this]]. Also if you are an employee of this company, please read our [[WP:COI|conflict-of-interest]] guidelines before proceeding.
:Specifically looking at this draft, references 1 and 4 are press releases, while 3, 6 and 7 do not seem to open for me, which is a problem. I think this is a borderline case, and one or two examples of media attention from the mainstream press (rather than publications targeted at the industry) would probably push it into the "notable" zone.

==New article to introduce an idea and feedback request from wikipedia / mediawiki developers==
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Curiosum%C3%A9

Any suggestions about who or where to share this information are appreciated.

It outlines a draft of an '''open Internet protocol''' that utilizes Wikipedia entries as an ontology for personal data matching.  

Prototype software is being developed, providing the features described in this article.  

Feedback and involvement from Wikipedia and Mediawiki would be helpful at this point in further developing the ideas described here.

'''Excerpt:'''

An open protocol extending the conventional [[résumé]] / [[Curriculum Vitae|CV]] as a means for describing one’s interests, skills, abilities, and intent with respect to [[semantic web]] [[URI|resources]] and other metadata (such as spatiotemporal location).  

The word is a portmanteau of the words [[Curiosity|curiosity]] (representing desired skills, which can be learned) and [[résumé]] (representing acquired skills, which can be taught).

Resources defined by Wikipedia cover most conceivable topics and offer multilingual translations.  [[Taxonomy (general)|Hierarchical categorization]] and [[Associative memory|heterarchical associations]] (wikilinks) between topics allows for partial relevancy comparisons.

== Hello, I am new. ==

I am starting to get the hang of things I think.  I made some edits to the article [[Percy Burn Viaduct]] some time ago and when I returned today to the article I was quite angry to see that they had disappeared.  People shouldn't remove information from articles if it is helpful.  The closure of the track was very topical and a point of contention in my community and since a lot of overseas tourists use the track it is in their interests to know that the bridge is closed.  So then I found out I hadn't provided a reference.  I think I have done it properly now.  Can someone advise?  Thank you

:Hello, anonymous person (please sign posts on talk pages with four tildes <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>, so we know who they are from. Since you are editing without an account, this will just show your IP address, but that still helps in showing whether we are talking to the same person).  I'm sorry you found this frustrating: the fact is that Wikipedia is a big and complicated animal, and it does take some work to get your contributions to stick. The problem here is that (by design) ''anybody'' can go in and add anything to any article, and if they don't include any references, we have no way to know if they are correct, mistaken, out of date, or just having a joke. So {{U|PeeJay2K3}} was within their rights to remove the unreferenced information you added. I see that there has more activity on the page from yourself (I think) and others, so I'm not sure whether any more work is needed.
:On one point: please notice that it is explicitly not part of Wikipedia's purpose to provide news, how-tos, or tourist information: what is in Wikipedia should be ''only'' information that has already been reported in reliable sources, and is encyclopaedic in nature. "Helpful" to people who might want to use or visit a subject is not a criterion. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 09:35, 26 April 2014 (UTC)

==How to change the titles of articles you created==
Hi everybody! I just created a new page on Wikipedia, but realized that I made a mistake in the capitalization of the title of the article. How do I correct this? [[User:Twyfan714|Twyfan714]] ([[User talk:Twyfan714|talk]]) 01:08, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:Welcome to the Teahouse, {{U|Twyfan714}}. We call a title change a "move". Go to the page in question. Just to the left of the search box at the top right is a little triangle. Click on that for a menu and select "move". Fill in the boxes carefully and give a reason such as "capitalization error" and complete the move. Follow the instructions for cleaning up, and you are done.

==How does an author edit an already established Wikipedia entry about her book?==
I discovered a Wikipedia page about a book I wrote.  The page was established and edited by several people.  How can I correct and expand the entry?  Should I make it known that I am the author or should I establish an account and make the corrections anonymously?  Can I add informative quotations from reviews in highly regarded publications?

:Hello [[User:OAlexander|OAlexander]]!  The reason you are getting a "blocked" message is probably due to the link being blacklisted.  See [[WP:BLACKLIST]].

::I personally consider this link as being quite important to the article as the target is one of the few sites that offer more information on the subject matter.

==How do I attach an article I've already written in PDF format?==
I have written a manuscript "Counting Pythagorean Triples" in pdf format.  I would like to upload it as an article to Wikipedia.  How do I do that?  Thank you [[User:Joeraab|Joeraab]] ([[User talk:Joeraab|talk]]) 23:15, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
:{{ping|Joeraab}} Welcome to the Teahouse. We don't actually upload articles, we create them by adding text in the edit interface. To make your new article (since it doesn't exist), click on [[Counting Pythagorean Triples]] and start typing in the text field, then click 'save page' when you're done. There are, however, some rules about what can go into an article. Generally article topics must be the topic of multiple reliable sources (books, newspapers, government websites, etc.) and can't contain any previously unpublished information (that doesn't mean you should copy things from other sources - just write what the other sources say in your own words). Finally, it's important to cite all you sources. [[User:Yunshui/References for beginners]] is a good tutorial for beginners to learn about this; I suggest you read it. Happy editing. --[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]]) (Please comment on [[WP:Editor review/Jakec|my editor review]].) 23:28, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
::Before going too far down the path of creating a new article, it would be worth reviewing the existing article at [[Pythagorean_triple]] carefully.  Then consider whether the best approach might be to integrate the information from your manuscript into that article.  In particular, look at the section "Distribution of triples" and see whether that is a suitable place for your material. That article has a very active Talk page, which would be an excellent place to discuss how your contributions can best be used. --[[User:Gronk Oz|Gronk Oz]] ([[User talk:Gronk Oz|talk]]) 04:08, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:<small><small><small>@[[:User:Joeraab|Joeraab]]:</small></small></small> Hi Joe. There is one thing to take into consideration. We don't allow [[WP:NOR|original research]] on Wikipedia – information must be able to be [[WP:V|verified]] by looking at published [[WP:IRS|reliable sources]]. It's possible that the addition you intend comports with this requirement, but from what you've said it's also possible this it's an unpublished text of your own devising, and as such would be unsuitable for inclusion here. This is not a reflection on how good the material may be, but on the fact that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a [[tertiary source]], and as such, is not the place to explore new things that have not already been the subject of publication in the world.--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 06:33, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

:Welcome to the Teahouse, {{U|Jayakumar JG}}. Our article should use the title most commonly used by most of the reliable English language sources discussing the topic in detail. Right now, the article has lots of unreferenced material, much of it about the religious mythology of the area. So, I suggest you work to improve the referencing. Remove dead links and low quality sources. Add higher quality sources with a preference toward those in English, though those in other languages are fine as well. Check out [[WP:REFBEGIN|Referencing for beginners]]. Once you are conversant with the sources, you can make the decision about "hills" or "mountains".

:Hi Krokuss, welcome to the Teahouse. I guess you mean the Description field at [[:File:Abgehfaktor cover.jpg#Summary]]. The summary section currently uses {{tl|Non-free use rationale album cover}} which automatically adds text at the start of the Description field. You cannot override it completely but you can affect it by using some of the parameters shown at [[Template:Non-free use rationale album cover#Syntax]]. You can click "Show preview" to see the effect of parameter changes without saving. If you click the "Edit" or "View source" tab on the template page then you can see the template code and maybe guess how the parameters affect the Description field.

:Hello, thanks for your question! I took a look at [[The Wonder Years]] article, and it seems like you took the right mode of action by bringing up the issue on the talk page, great job with that! You outlined most of what needs cleanup, the article doesn't get a lot of visits like you said, and it isn't protected or anything, so what's holding you back from [[WP:BOLD|being bold and going for it yourself]]? As for getting the attention of other wikipedians, I would personally recommend the Project Talk Page, but it seems like you've done that too. '''[[WP:RB|Reward board]]''' also works, and if you really want the dedicated attention of a skilled editor, try '''submitting to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Guild of Copy Editors|Guild of Copy Editors]]'''. If you pursue all those routes along with cleanups here and there to the article, it should get plenty of good attention.
