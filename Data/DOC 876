The '''Holloman High Speed Test Track''' (HHSTT) is a United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]/[[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[aerospace]] ground test facility located at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in south-central [[New Mexico]].  It is adjacent to the [[White Sands Missile Range]] and is operated by the [[46th Test Group#Components|846th Test Squadron]] of the [[96th Test Group]] of the [[96th Test Wing]] at [[Eglin Air Force Base]].  

The Test Track provides its services to a wide variety of American defense and [[Federal government of the United States|government]]al agencies such as the Air Force, [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], and the [[Missile Defense Agency]], as well as America's allies.<ref name="Cap Book">Holloman High Speed Test Track: Facilities and Capabilities.

==Mission==
The HHSTT’s mission is to provide a cost-effective, realistic, dynamic test environment for the entire acquisition community, including the DoD, other government agencies, contractors,<ref name="Streeter">Streeter, Lulynne. “Holloman Test Group offers high-tech services to private sector – Holloman Air Force Base.” New Mexico Business Journal (January 1990)</ref> and foreign governments.

Archived at: http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893155-1,00.html</ref>  The track was lengthened to 5,000&nbsp;ft (1,524m) in 1956, followed by another extension to 35,000&nbsp;ft (10,668 m) in 1957.  

The next major track extension occurred in 1974 when the rails from the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] test track were shipped to Holloman and added to the existing tracks to give a new total length of 50,771&nbsp;ft (15,475 m).  During this upgrade, a third rail, approximately 15,000&nbsp;ft (4,572 m), was added for high-speed, narrow-gauge sleds.  In 2000, pulldown extensions of 149&nbsp;ft (46.4 m) were added to the north end of each rail, bringing the two primary rails to 50,917 feet (15,536 m).  The last major upgrade to the primary rail system occurred in 2002, when the narrow-gauge track was lengthened to 20,379&nbsp;ft (6,212 m).   The HHSTT currently holds the [[Land speed record for rail vehicles#Rocket sleds|world land speed record for rocket sleds]] set in April 2003, at [[Mach number|Mach]] 8.6, or 9,465 feet per second (2,885 meters per second), or 6,453.409 miles per hour (10,385.755 kilometres per hour).<ref name="Lennick">The Land of Space And Time.

==Capabilities==
As of April 2014, over 12,400 sled tests have been performed at the HHSTT.  The first sled tests were performed in 1950; the facility has been in continuous operation since.  The HHSTT is unusual within the DoD Test and Evaluation community because it has organic management, engineering, fabrication, and test-operation capabilities in one location.  This ability to provide a “one-stop-shop” reduces test costs and schedule issues associated with geographically-separated project functions.

A wide variety of tests have been performed at the HHSTT,<ref name="Design Manual">Holloman High Speed Test Track: Design Manual. Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Air Force Material Command, Air Armament Center, March 2005</ref> including [[Escape crew capsule|aircraft crew-escape systems]],<ref name="Philpott">Philpott, Bryan. Eject! Eject!

St. Paul: MBI Publishing Company, 2002.</ref> rain and particle [[erosion]] tests, [[Bunker buster|impact testing]], weapons dispense testing, [[electronic warfare]], [[guidance system]] testing, and a wide array of [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] tests.

Because of the HHSTT's location on a [[Military base|military reservation]] in a sparsely populated area, tests may be performed in a secure environment.  These large areas of open space may also be used to test items that are [[Explosive material|explosive]], [[Ballistics|ballistic]], or otherwise [[hazard]]ous.

==Facilities==
[[File:F-22 Forebody on MASE sled.jpg|thumb|right|F-22 forebody on a MASE sled at [[Holloman Air Force Base]].]]
The most prominent feature of the facility is the [[Track (rail transport)|rail]] system (similar in appearance to railroad tracks) used to launch [[rocket]]-powered test vehicles known as "[[Rocket sled|sleds]]". The rail system is located just east of the [[White Sands National Monument]], and consists of a concrete foundation known as the girder that supports the two primary rails and a single tertiary rail.  The western-most rail is known as "A rail", followed by the adjacent "B rail" and "C rail." The alignment of the rails is nearly north-south.  All three rails are fabricated from heavy-duty crane rail (171&nbsp;lbs/yard or 84.9&nbsp;kg/meter) and are maintained to an alignment of no more than 0.025 inches (0.635 mm) deviation from a nominal reference line between rail tiedowns.

A and B rails constitute the primary rails and are 50,917 feet (15,536 m) long.  C rail, located at the north end of the track facility, is 20,379 feet (6,212 m) long.  A and B rails are spaced 84 inches (213&nbsp;cm), center to center, while C rail is spaced 26.3 inches (66.8&nbsp;cm) to the east of B rail. Despite the simple appearance of the setup, the tracks constitute the straightest system of track ever laid.  Rails A, B, and C are continuously [[Welding|welded]] and pre-[[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]ed to be under [[Tension (physics)|tension]] at temperatures below 140&nbsp;°F (60&nbsp;°C).

Within the HHSTT infrastructure, there is a 6,000-foot (1,829 m) rainfield that is used to study the erosive effects caused by the impact of raindrops on material samples or components of weapon systems carried on rocket sleds.  The rainfield system has been characterized for droplet size distribution and can simulate various combinations of rain environments from light rain to heavy rain, and produce flight conditions ranging from [[Aerodynamics#Incompressible aerodynamics|subsonic]] to [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic]].  This capability is used both for material development (usually involving systematic testing of material samples) and for qualifying flight hardware.

A separate system is currently under construction to support [[magnetic levitation]], or Maglev, sled development.  The reason for this system is to produce flight-like [[vibration]] environments that can not be achieved on the main steel rail track.   This system performed its first test in 2012 and continues to be operational. <!--This set a speed record; get details and add later-->

Other facilities at the HHSTT include fabrication shops, project management and engineering buildings, [[munitions]] storage buildings, and heavy equipment staging areas.

==Data collection==
Electronic data, which include test timing, vehicle position, [[velocity]], and [[acceleration]], are routinely collected at the HHSTT.  These data are captured by various means, including [[Doppler radar]], optical beam interrupter blades, breakwire installations and [[magnet]]ic sensors, and a wide variety of component sensors to collect specialized data such as acceleration forces, strain, temperature, etc.

The data are collected with a variety of onboard [[data acquisition]] systems or [[Telemetry|telemetered]] for post-test analysis.  Additionally, world-class technical imagery, including high-speed digital images, is available for customers to examine the status of their payloads.  Track personnel use the same imagery to determine the status of the sled vehicle during tests.   All data can be post-processed and merged using a common time reference to verify the accuracy of the data, and to produce a unified data product.

Optical imagery is captured with high-speed digital cameras.

Local meteorological data (e.g., temperature and barometric pressure) are also collected for each test for the calculation of [[Mach number]] or [[Knot (unit)|Knots]] Equivalent [[Airspeed|Air Speed]] as desired by the test customer.
