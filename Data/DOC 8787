The '''''Shizi''''' is an eclectic [[Chinese classic]] written by Shi Jiao 尸佼 (c. 390–330 BCE), and the earliest text from Chinese philosophical school of ''Zajia'' 雜家 "[[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretism]]", which combined ideas from the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], including [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], [[Mohism]], and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. The ''Shizi'' text was written c. 330 BCE in twenty sections, and was well-known from the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) when all copies were lost. Scholars during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644–1911) dynasties reconstructed the ''Shizi'' from quotes in numerous sources, yet only about 15 percent of the original text was recovered and now extant. Western [[sinology]] has largely ignored the ''Shizi'' and it was one of the last Chinese classics to be translated into English (Fischer 2012).

==Authorship==
[[File:Statue of Shang Yang.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Modern statue of [[Shang Yang]]]]
Little is known about Shi Jiao or Shizi "Master Shi" except for references to his eponymous text. He was probably from the [[Warring States period]] state of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] (modern [[Shanxi]]), and employed by the Legalist statesman [[Shang Yang]] (390–338 BCE), the chief minister of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] (modern Shanxi) for [[Duke Xiao of Qin|Duke Xiao]]. When Duke Xiao died in 338 BCE, his successor [[King Huiwen of Qin|King Huiwen]] ordered Shang Yang to be executed by [[dismemberment]] and his entire family to be [[nine familial exterminations|exterminated]]. Shi Jiao fled to the state of [[Shu (state)|Shu]] (modern [[Sichuan]]), where he wrote the ''Shizi'' in 20 sections totaling over 60,000 [[Chinese characters]], and subsequently died.

The [[Chinese surname]] Shi is [[List of common Chinese surnames|commonly]] written 石 "stone", 史 "history", 師 "teacher", 時 "time", or 士 "scholar" – but hardly ever written ''shi'' {{linktext|尸}} "corpse; ceremonial '[[Shi (personator)|personator]]' of a dead person". Besides Shi Jiao, there are few examples other than Shi Cong 尸聰 and Shi Bo 尸帛, who served [[Yongle Emperor]] (r. 1402–1424) (''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' 1984:964). The [[given name]] Jiao or Xiao {{linktext|佼|}} can be pronounced ''jiǎo'' "handsome; beautiful; excellent", ''jiāo'' "associate; have intercourse with", or ''xiáo'' "imitate; false". Although Tang dynasty scholar [[Sima Zhen]] first noted the ''jiǎo'' 佼 in Shi Jiao was pronounced like ''jiǎo'' 絞 "twisted" (Fischer 2012:3380), some sources (e.g., Makeham 1994:263) misspell his name as "Shi Xiao".

==Textual history==
The ''Shizi'' has had a long and dynamic history. The twenty-chapter text was written around 330 BCE, became a famous classic of philosophical Eclecticism, had sections repeatedly lost and recovered from political and military destruction, until only one original chapter existed around 1060 CE, and later scholars partially reconstructed the text from quotes in over seventy [[Chinese classics]]. For example, the Syncretist ''Huainanzi'' quotes the ''Shizi'' 27 times (Le Blanc 1985:83). The Chinese Imperial Library catalogs in the standard [[Twenty-Four Histories]] inventory the ''Shizi'' text in twenty sections from the Han through Tang dynasties, and then only one section in the Song dynasty.
The most complete reconstruction was done in 1812, but even it only recovered about 15 percent of the original text (about 10,000 of 60,000 characters). Technically speaking, Paul Fischer (2012:417) describes the ''Shizi'' text as "simultaneously lost and extant".

The oldest surviving reference to Shizi is found in the (91 BCE) ''[[Shiji]]'' "Scribal Record" biography of [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] (c. 312–230 BCE). 
<blockquote>And (in addition to Xun Zi, the state of) Zhao also had Gongsun Long, who made arguments about the similarity and difference of hardness and whiteness, and the sayings of Ju Zi; (the state of) Wei had Li Kui (with his) teaching on fully using the powers of the land; (the state of) Chu had Shizi, Chang Lu, and Yu Zi from A in it. Following from Meng Zi down until Yu Zi, the world has their writings in abundance; therefore (I) will not discuss their biographies. (tr. Fischer 2012:794–797) </blockquote>

The (8 BCE) ''Bielu'' 別錄 "Separate Records" was a detailed bibliography of holdings in the Imperial Library, including the ''Shizi''. It was begun by the imperial librarian [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]], and after his death, was completed by his son [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]]. Although this early [[library catalog]] is no longer extant, there are two surviving ''Bielu'' fragments that mention the ''Shizi''. First, Liu Xiang's own ''Sun Qing shulu'' 孫卿書錄 "Sun Qing Record" says (tr. Fischer 2012:808–812): "The state of Chu had Shizi, Chang Lu Zi, and Yu Zi, and all wrote texts, but (these) were not of the model of former kings, and none followed the methods of Kong Zi. Only Meng Zi and Xun Qing were able to respect Kong Zi." Second, the ''Shiji'' commentary of Pei Yin 裴駰 (fl. 438) more fully quotes it:
<blockquote>Liu Xiang’s ''Bie lu'' says: "(The ''Shi ji'' says :) 'Chu had Shizi ...' (but I) suspect (it should have) said he (lived) in Shu (not Chu). Now, according to the ''Shizi'' text, he was from Jin, (with the) given name Jiao, and was a retainer of Qin chief minister Wei Yang. (When) Wei Yang, the Shang Lord, planned things and designed strategies, and established laws to regulate the people, (he) always devised them with Jiao. (When) the Shang Lord was punished, Jiao feared (that he) also would be killed, and thereupon fled and ran away to Shu. (There he) himself created this text in twenty sections, (with) altogether more than sixty thousand words. (When he) died, (he was) accordingly buried in Shu." (tr. Fischer 2012:801–806) </blockquote>
Liu Xin abridged the ''Bielu'' catalog into the (6 BCE) ''Qilue'' 七略 "Seven Summaries", and the historian [[Ban Gu]] used both catalogs to compile the ''[[Yiwenzhi]]'' “Literature Record” chapter of his (92 CE) ''[[Hanshu]]'' "Han History". It lists the ''Shizi'' as one of twenty texts in the Syncretist section (tr. Fischer 2012:773–778): "''Shizi'' in twenty sections. (His) given name was Jiao, and (he was) from Lu; the Qin chief minister, the Shang Lord, took him as a teacher, (and when Shang) Yang died, Jiao fled to Shu."

These earliest (91 BCE to 92 CE) references generally agree except for Shizi's home state. Was he from Chu (''Shiji''), Shu (''Bielu'' author's suspicion), Jin (''Bielu'' author's text), or Lu (''Hanshu'')? Fischer (2012:832–834) concludes he was from Jin, primarily because the testimony of the ''Shizi'' itself, as specifically cited by Liu Xiang".

The Tang historian [[Wei Zheng]]'s (656) ''[[Suishu]]'' "Sui History" first described ''Shizi'' chapters being lost (tr. Fischer 2012:855–858): "The ''Shizi'' in twenty sections, table of contents in one section. In the Liang (502–557) there were (only) nineteen sections. Authored by Shi Jiao, chief retainer of Qin chief minister Wei Yang. Nine of its sections were lost, and in the Wei (220–265) “Yellow Beginning” (reign era; 220–227), (it was) continued." Wei Zheng says that during the reign of Wei Emperor [[Cao Pi]] the nine lost chapters were "continued" (''xu'' 續), which Fischer (2012:897–898) interprets to mean replacing an incomplete ''Shizi'' copy in the imperial collection with a complete copy from a private library.

The (445) ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' "Later Han History" only mentions the ''Shizi'' once in a quotation, but Tang dynasty crown prince [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xian]]'s (677) ''Hou Hanshu'' commentary is informative.
<blockquote>Shizi was from Jin, had the given name of "Jiao," and was the retainer of Qin chief minister Wei Yang. (When Wei) Yang planned strategies (he) always devised them with Jiao. (When) the Shang Lord was punished, (Shizi) feared (that he) also would be killed, and therefore fled and ran away to Shu, (where he) made a text in twenty sections: nineteen sections elaborate the threads of the Way, virtue, goodness, and propriety, and one section speaks of the nine regions, strategic passes, and the places where river springs originate. (tr. Fischer 2012:906–909) </blockquote>

The ''Shizi'' text was largely lost sometime between the writing of the 1060 ''[[Xin Tangshu|New Tang History]]'' and 1345 ''[[History of Song]]''. The (1739) Ming and (1927) Qing dynasty imperial catalogs do not list the ''Shizi''. One private catalog, Chen Kui's (1174) ''Zhongxing Guange shumu'' 中興館閣書目 lists the text with only one section written on two bundles of bamboo strips (''pian'' 篇) (Fischer 2012:931). Examining Chinese history between 1060 and 1174 when all full copies of the ''Shizi'' text were lost, Fischer (2012:950–951) suggests the [[Jingkang Incident]] when the invading [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] soldiers of the [[Jin Dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin Dynasty]] [[siege|besieged]] and sacked [[Kaifeng]], the [[Northern Song dynasty]] capital.

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Chinese scholars worked on reconstructing the ''Shizi'' text from quotations. The (c. 1691) ''Qianqingtang shumu'' 千頃堂書目 "Thousand Acre Hall Bibliography", written by Huang Yuji 黄虞稷, lists a ''Shizi'' in two sections that was reconstructed by Xu Yuantai 徐元太 around 1565 (Fischer 2012:953). Although it was lost, six other ''Shizi'' reconstructions are still extant; Chen Zhengxue (1640), Hui Dong (1730), Ren Zhaolin (1788), Zhang Zongyuan (1796), Sun Xingyan (1806), and Wang Jipei (1812). The version of Wang Jipei 汪繼培 is considered the most authoritative.

The sources for these reconstructions were based on over seventy texts that quoted the ''Shizi''. Those containing the most quotes are: [[Ouyang Xun]]'s 604 ''[[Yiwen Leiju|Typological Collections from the Classics and Other Literature]]'', [[Yu Shinan]]'s c. 615 ''[[Beitang Shuchao|Copied Writings from the North Hall]]", Wei Zheng's 631 ''[[Qunshu Zhiyao|Essentials of Government from Many Books]]'', Li Shan's 658 ''[[Wen Xuan|Notes on the Anthology of Literature]]'', and [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]]'s 983 ''[[Taiping Imperial Reader]]''. The ''Qun shu zhiyao'' 群書治要 abridgement, comprising over 5,000 characters (out of the original 60,000), quotes 13 of the original 20 chapters, and represents almost half of the reconstructed ''Shizi'' text.

Fischer (2012:1159–1163) summarizes the ''Shizi'' as "both unique and paradigmatic for being the first Syncretist text from a time when eclectic authorship—in both content and form—was the norm. We are fortunate that several Ming and Qing scholars made the effort to reconstruct it, that so much of it was quoted by Wei Zheng in the Tang dynasty, and that Wei’s work was preserved in Japan even while it was lost in China."

==Contents==
The reconstructed ''Shizi'' contains 15 of the original 20 sections or chapters, the first 13 of which primarily derive from Wei Zheng's ''Qun shu zhiyao''. The contents of are shown below, citing the Fischer's (2012) translations.

In addition to these 15 titled chapters, the reconstructed ''Shizi'' comprises 194 ''yiwen'' 佚文 "fragments" from source texts that quote the ''Shizi'' without specifying the chapter. Nineteen of these fragments have doubtful authenticity because they are only attested in sources later than 1127 CE when the text was probably lost.

The ''Shizi'' includes some humorous teachings, such as this anecdote about the importance of naming.
<blockquote>(The state of) Qi had a person named Tian Guo who named his dog "Riches" and his son "Happiness." (Once) when (he) was about to perform a sacrifice, the dog entered the house. Guo yelled at it saying: "Riches, get out!" A shamaness (heard this and) said: "(That) was not auspicious." (Later,) Guo experienced misfortune: (his) eldest son died. Weeping over him, (he) cried: "Happiness!" and (he thus) did not seem to be sad (to those who heard him). (tr. Fischer 2012:746–751) </blockquote>

==Key concepts==
According to Fischer (2012:398–402), Shizi's message is based upon four key ideas: self-cultivation, timeliness, humility, and objectivity. "With the single exception of self-cultivation (修身 or 治身), none of these ideals appear as technical terms in the text. Unlike the more usual advice to be good (仁), proper (義), or virtuous (德), even generalized terms for timeliness, humility, and objectivity are not used; rather, the advice must be inferred from the narrative."

'''Self-cultivation'''. The beginning of Chapter 1 recommends self-cultivation through broad learning.
<blockquote>To learn without tiring is that by which one cultivates the self; to teach without becoming bored is that by which one cultivates the people. (If) a cocoon is abandoned and not cultivated, then it will rot away and be discarded. (But if) a female artisan extracts the silk, then this can be used to make beautiful brocade, (fit even for) a great ruler to wear to court. (Your) person is (like) a cocoon: (if) it is abandoned and not cultivated, then (your capacity to) think and act will rot away. (tr. Fischer 2012:1221–1224) </blockquote>
One ''Shizi'' fragment (188, tr. Fischer 2012:3103), "Imitate the conch and oyster and close the door", is apparently related to self-cultivation through [[Daoist meditation]]

'''Timeliness'''. Acting in a timely manner is a recurring textual theme, frequently phrased in terms of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' "spirit; god, deity; spiritual, supernatural" translated as "[[wikt:spiritous|spiritous]]". Chapter 2 says:
<blockquote>Misfortunes, at the beginning, are easily dispelled. As for those which cannot be dispelled, avoid them. (Because when) they are fully manifested, (you might) desire to dispel them (but will) be unable, and (you might) desire to avoid them (but will) be unable. Those who deal with (problems) while (still) spiritous: their activities are few but (their) merit is great. ... (When) a house burns and someone saves it, then (we) know their virtue. (But) the elderly who daub chimney cracks to guard (against fire), thereby living their whole lives without the misfortune of stray flames (causing a fire): (their) virtue (remains) unknown! ... Misfortunes also have "chimneys," and (if) worthies were to travel the world to aid in "daubing" them, then the world would have no military suffering, yet none would know their virtue. Therefore it is said: "Sagely people rectify (things) when (they) are yet spiritous [i.e., inchoate]; stupid people contend with (things) after (they) have become obvious." (tr. Fischer 2012:1376–1390) </blockquote>
The following context clarifies the semantics of "spiritous" (tr. Fischer 2012:1407), "This 'spiritousness' is the beginning of the myriad things, the leading thread of the myriad affairs."

'''Humility'''. The Shizi teaches that rulers should have humility when seeking good ministers, as well as have eminence when effectively ruling. For instance, this dialogue between Confucius and his disciple [[Zixia#Bu Shang .28Zixia.29|Zixia]], 
<blockquote>"Kong Zi said: 'Zixia, do you know how rulers function as rulers?' Zixia replied: '(If) fish lose the water (they are in), then (they) will die, (but) if water loses the fish (in it, it) is still water.' Kong Zi said: 'You know it!'." An effective ruler needs both to practice humility and to pursue self-cultivation through study. (tr. Fischer 2012:2149–2151) </blockquote>

'''Objectivity'''. The text recommends that rulers objectively hire, fire, promote, and demote officials based upon the verifiable results of performance, rather than upon the traditional criteria of nepotism and hereditary rank. 
<blockquote>The stupid and wise (decisions) of the many ministers are daily presented before (you): choose those whom are knowledgeable about affairs and order their plans (to be carried out). Those whom the many ministers promote are daily presented before (you): choose those whom are knowledgeable about people and order their promotions (to be carried out). The orderly and disorderly (effects) of the many ministers are daily presented before (you): choose those whom are competent in undertaking tasks and order their governance (to be carried out). ... (If you) use the worthy and employ the competent, (then you) will govern without exertion. (If you) rectify names and examine reality, (then you) will be revered without (having to) punish. (If you) arrive at the facts and see (them) purely, then truth and fallacy will not be obscured. (tr. Fischer 2012:1596–1618) </blockquote>
While many Masters texts discussed the importance of employing worthies and rectifying names, the ''Shizi'' exceptionally argued for detached objectivity through "examining reality" (覈實) and "seeing purely" (見素).

==Syncretism==
The ''Shizi'' is the oldest extant text from the ''Zajia'' 雜家 [[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretism]] School, which is described as the "eclectic, discriminating, selective, and consolidating trend in philosophical literature" (Sellmann 2012:2).  Shizi's writings were popular for centuries before the comprehensive Syncretist collections (c. 239 BCE) ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' and (c. 139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]''. The Han scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179–104 BCE) used the Syncretic method to combine early Confucianism with Naturalist and Legalist thought, and to promote Confucianism into the new official ideology of Imperial China. Ultimately, Fischer (2012:262) describes Master Shi as "a man of his times. His syncretism made explicit the eclecticism of other authors of his day and demonstrated that many of their ideas were not necessarily incompatible." Consider this statement that six ''Zi'' "Masters" had substantially similar doctrines: 
<blockquote>Mo Zi valued impartiality; Kong Zi valued public-mindedness, Huang Zi valued centeredness, Tian Zi valued equanimity, Lie Zi valued emptiness, and Liao Zi valued dispelling closed-mindedness. Their schools mutually denied each other, stopping (only) after several generations: but all were trapped in selfishness. Heaven, thearch, sovereign, monarch, governor, lord: all are (words for) "ruler." Immense, wide open, vast, wide, broad, large, spacious, encompassing, supreme, eminent, big: all are (words for) "great." More than ten names but the actuality is one. If (you) make impartiality, public-mindedness, emptiness, equanimity, centeredness, peace, and dispelling closed-mindedness one actuality, then there will be no mutual negating. (tr. Fischer 2012:1898–1912)</blockquote>
This passage is unusual because pre-Qin masters texts typically refer to other masters with disparagement or differentiation. The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (33, tr. Mair 1994:337–338), for instance, describes the early schools of Mohism whose, "divergent distortions were so different that they called each other "aberrant Mohists." They reviled each other with their disputations over "hard" and "white" and over "sameness" and "difference," as well as with their rejoinders to each other over the disparity between "odd" and "even"." The Chinese lexicographers Yong and Peng (2008:64) identify this ''Shizi'' passage, with six synonyms meaning ''jun'' 君 "ruler" and 11 synonyms meaning ''da'' 大 "great; big", as the source for the (c. 3rd century BCE) ''[[Erya]]'' dictionary (1.2–1.3) definitions that list 10 synonyms meaning ''jun'' 君 and 39 meaning ''da'' 大.

The ''zhuzi'' 諸子 "The Masters/Philosophers" category of the ''[[Yiwenzhi]]'' "Treatise on Literature" in the ''[[Hanshu]]'' subdivided philosophical books into ten schools: Confucianism (儒家), Daoism (道家), School of Yin-Yang (陰陽家), Legalism (法家), School of Names or Designatism (名家), Mohism (墨家), Diplomatic (縱橫家), Syncretism (雜家), Agriculturalism (農家), and Miscellaneous (小說). It summarized Syncretism (tr. Fischer 2012: 3155–3161): "Syncretists probably emerged from the Councilor office. (They) combine Ruism and Mohism, unite Designatism and Legalism, know that (proper) state formation has (all) these, and see that (proper) kingly government is entirely interconnected: these are its strengths. (But if) the dissolute practice it, then (they) become dissipated and have no foundation to (which they can) return." The reconstructed ''Shizi'' text refers to most of these schools of thought.

'''[[Confucianism]]''' or '''Ruism''' was centered upon the teachings and principles of [[Kongzi]] or Confucius. The ''Shizi'' upholds several Confucianist concepts, including ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'' "goodness; humaneness", ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]]'' "propriety; righteousness", ''[[Li (Confucianism)|li]]'' "ritual; courtesy", and ''[[zhengming]]'' "rectification of names".  The text cites Confucius 17 times, more than any other person, and several quotes are not recorded elsewhere. For instance, this story about [[Zichan]] when he was prime minister for Duke Jian簡公 (r. 564– 530 BCE) of [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]].
<blockquote>Zheng Duke Jian said to Zichan: "Joyless drinking and unsounded bells and drums are my responsibilities (to repair). A misruled state, a disordered court, and not attaining (our) aims in dealing with the state sovereigns are your responsibilities (to repair). (If) you do not meddle in my pleasure, I will not meddle in your court." From then on, Zichan governed Zheng and the city gates did not close, the state had no robbers or criminals, and (its) roads had no hungry people (on them). Kong Zi said: "Even with Zheng Duke Jian’s love of pleasure, still, even if (he) had held court while hugging a bell, it would have been acceptable." (tr. Fischer 2012:1818–1823) </blockquote>

[[File:Scaling ladder in ancient China.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Ancient Chinese siege scaling ladder, replica in [[Xi'an]]]]
'''[[Mohism]]''' emphasized universal love and [[meritocracy]], in which rulers employ worthy ministers regardless of their social class. The ''Shizi'' likewise stressed meritocracy, for instance,
<blockquote>In ancient times, enlightened kings in pursuit of worthies did not avoid those far or near, nor discuss (their) status or lack thereof, (but rather they) denigrated (their own) positions in order to yield to the worthy, and diminished (their own) persons in order to put the (worthy) official first. Thus, Yao followed Shun into the midst of the fields, faced north to look at him, and did not fuss about a show of ritual. This is why former kings were able to rectify heaven and earth and is the reason why (they could) benefit the myriad things. (tr. Fischer 2012:1475–1479) </blockquote>
Mohism repudiated warfare, and Chapter 14 "Stopping the Chu Army" tells a legend about how [[Mozi]] convinced the king of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] not to use [[Lu Ban]]'s newly invented "meets-with-heaven" mobile scaling ladder to attack the weaker state of [[Song (state)|Song]] (tr. Fischer 2012:2034–2036). When Mozi asked the king what sort of person would refuse his own sumptuous, decorated carriage and want to steal his neighbor's dilapidated cart, the king replied, "He definitely has a stealing sickness". Mozi responded, "Chu territory is two thousand kilometers square, (while) Song territory is (only) two hundred kilometers square: these are like the decorated carriage and the dilapidated cart!", which convinced the king to cancel the attack.

'''[[School of Names]]''' or '''Logicians''' focused upon the relationship between words and reality. The ''Shizi'' links the Logician doctrine of ''fen'' 分 "separation; distribution; allocation" with the Confucian rectification of names. [[Joseph Needham]] (1954:17) says the primary meaning of ''fen'' is "separation", but the ''Shizi'' uses it to mean "the allotment of duties to persons by the ruler or lord", comparable with Greek ''[[Moirai|Moira]]'' "portion of the whole". Chapter 5 "Allocation" favors explicitly allocating tasks and responsibilities to specific ministers, through the "rectification" of ministerial titles and "allocation" of the duties that accompany any given position.
<blockquote>Heaven and earth produce the myriad things and sages categorize them. (They) categorize things by means of establishing allocations, and facilitate (human) affairs by means of instituting (political) offices. Ruler and minister, father and son, superior and inferior, elder and youth, honored and despised, close and distant all fulfilling their allocations is called order. Concern that fulfills (its) allocation is called good; giving that fulfills (its) allocation is called proper; contemplation that fulfills (its) allocation is called wise; action that fulfills (its) allocation is called appropriate; words that fulfill (their) allocation are called faithful. After (you) have fulfilled all (these) allocations, (you) will become a complete person. (tr. Fischer 2012:1531–1537) </blockquote>

'''[[School of Yin Yang]]''' or '''Naturalists''' believed heaven and earth were composed of ''[[qi]]'', constantly transforming through ''[[yin-yang]]'' and ''[[Wu Xing|wuxing]]''. The ''Shizi'' describes this school's correlative cosmology idea that the universe responds to the ruler's morality.
<blockquote>Goodness, propriety, sageliness, and wisdom are joined with heaven and earth. If heaven did not canopy (them), (then) how could the people depend upon (it) and gaze into (it)? If the earth did not support (them), (then ) how could the people live (from it) and move (on it)? If sages did not order (them), (then) how could the people be guided and led (by them)? This is why heaven canopies them, the earth supports them, and sages order them. The person of the sage is like the sun. The sun (is only) one foot (in diameter), (but its) brightness fills heaven and earth. The person of the sage is (also) small, but it illuminates places that are distant. Sages rectify themselves and the four quadrants are (thereby) ordered. (tr. Fischer 2012:2000–2005) </blockquote>

'''[[Daoism]]''' was based upon the universal ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' 道 "Way" and advocated ''[[Wu wei|wuwei]]'' "effortlessnesss", ''[[ziran]]'' "naturalness", and simplicity. The ''Shizi'' (tr. Fischer 2012: 2659) mentions the Daoist paradigm of a mysterious cosmic Way. "Guard the Way firmly, (even in) extremity, then (you may) make light of kingship or dukedom." It also (tr. Fischer 2012:1911) refers to three [[Daoist]] masters, Tianzi (Tian Pian 田駢), [[Lie Yukou|Liezi]], and Lao Laizi (sometimes identified as [[Laozi]]): "Tian Zi valued equanimity, Lie Zi valued emptiness, Liao Zi valued dispelling closed-mindedness".

'''[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]''' was based upon the idea of rule by law, through rewards and punishments. Even though Shizi was a retainer of the famous Legalist Shang Yang, his reconstructed writings rarely refer to Legalism. Two examples (tr. Fischer 2012:1548–1549 and 2921–2922): "(If) rewards and punishments follow names (then) the people will all be respectful.", "(When) the vehicle is light and the road is short, then the whip and the goad are not needed. That for which the whip and goad are needed is a long road or a heavy load. Punishments and laws are the whip and goad for the people."

'''[[Agriculturalism]]''' advocated for rulers to participate in farming activities, following the example of their culture hero [[Shennong]] "Divine Farmer", who invented agriculture. The ''Shizi'' does not directly refer to Agriculturalism but mentions Shennong five times. For instance, (tr. Fischer 2012:2218–2220): "Shun personally had (some) southside acres (of farmland), (while his) wife had fields of mulberry trees; Shen Nong likewise tilled and ruled. (This) is how (they) encouraged tilling."
