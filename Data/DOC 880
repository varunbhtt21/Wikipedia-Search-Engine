== Problem with timeline of musical events, list of years in music; 1982 article ==

Hello, I am doing research about the order in which albums were released. Every year since the early 60's has every album released, according to month and day. Under "albums released" it starts with January and continues, showing every date an album was known to be released. Every year has this since the early 60's. Then one day, all of a sudden, the section for "albums released" in 1982 disappeared and was replaced with a totally inefficient new one, which list album titles by name (with no name of the artist) and that is it. It is impossible to find out the order in which albums were released, unless you click on every one and write down the day released, which would take forever, especially since it does not list the artist either. Every other year is fine, and still has the same normal list I've always used. What happened? Why did it disappear, and is it ever coming back? Thanks, J.T.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/24.130.253.147|24.130.253.147]] ([[User talk:24.130.253.147|talk]]) 03:58, 17 April 2014 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
:A user called [[User:Tuzapicabit|Tuzapicabit]] did this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1982_in_music&diff=603815796&oldid=599971918 diff].  Seems like a daft edit to me; you can revert it if you wish. --[[User:Viennese Waltz|Viennese Waltz]] 04:49, 17 April 2014 (UTC)

::In response to JT above, the reason why I removed the information is because it was a completely random list. Given that about 10,000 albums are released every year, this list contained about 400 - so pretty far off ''every'' album as you claim (so I'm not sure how useful this list could be to your research). Unless some criteria is established for inclusion (top 10 albums, No.1 albums, top-selling, million-selling?) the list could take the article beyond breaking point or would just remain as hopelessly incomplete. I tested the waters by taking the list out of one year to see if there was any reaction rather than doing the same for all, so if consensus agrees the list can easily be returned. I've linked it to list of albums, but yes, perhaps a list of some sort could be put there, but I think there would need to be guidelines (in this and all the others) as to what qualifies inclusion. This would also necessitate references which I can only think is a good thing. Either way, I'm happy to bow to consensus.[[User:Tuzapicabit|Tuzapicabit]] ([[User talk:Tuzapicabit|talk]]) 07:49, 17 April 2014 (UTC)

== Dual basketball/football player ==

I have a picture of an American person taken in the 1960s with an unclear caption.  Could you help me identify him?  The caption says "{name}, American Basketball and Football Conference."  The first name is Joseph, and the last name could be Ball or Bell or Bael or something like that.  It's not [[Joseph H. Ball]] or anyone else at [[Joseph Ball]].

:Can you upload a scan of that picture so that we could take a look at it? I'm not aware of anything called "American Basketball and Football Conference", but maybe the picture would ring a bell, so to speak. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] <sup>''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''</sup> [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 00:22, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
:[[:Category:Defunct college sports conferences in the United States]] may be a good place to start looking.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 01:13, 18 April 2014 (UTC)
