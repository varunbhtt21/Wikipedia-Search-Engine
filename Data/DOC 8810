Title : List of nuclear test sites
Text : {{GeoGroup|article=List of nuclear test sites}}

This article contains a '''list of nuclear weapon test sites''' used across the world.  It includes nuclear test sites, nuclear combat sites, launch sites for rockets forming part of a nuclear test, and peaceful nuclear test (PNE) sites.  There are a few non-nuclear test sites included, such as the [[Degelen Omega]] chemical blast sites, which are intimately involved with nuclear testing.  Listed with each is an approximate location and coordinate link for viewing through GeoHack, and each site is linked to a Wikipedia page on the locality or the nuclear event(s) that occurred there.
