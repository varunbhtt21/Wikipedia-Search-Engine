I've listed this article for peer review because I'm planning to nominate this article for GA status and would appreciate feedback on what to improve in regards to prose, expansion and etc.

Thanks, [[User:Acalycine|<font color="DarkSlateCyan">'''''Acalycine'''''</font>]]<sup>([[User_talk:Acalycine|<font color="DarkSlateCyan">'''''talk'''''</font>]]/[[Special:Contributions/Acalycine|<font color="DarkSlateCyan">'''''contribs'''''</font>]])</sup> 02:33, 27 April 2014 (UTC)


Review from Peripitus. I've not looked at this article since it was the Australian Collaboration of the Fortnight back in 2008, and it hasn't changed much since then. I suggest reading Zelman Cowan and Max Gordon's biographies; the latter is a dry book but fairly comprehensive. A few points stand out
*Lady Daisy should be Lady <lastname> and the sentence needs a reference
*paragraph's 3 and 5 of "working life" are unreferenced.
*The honors section needs more. Who proposed the suburb be named after him + needs a reference. Paragraph 1 of this section needs a reference. There is a position at Monash University named after him.
*There is a [citation needed] tag that needs sorting
*Were there any reviews of his published work ?
*Given he spent so long on the high court bench there should be a section covering his time there, the important cases he sat on, and his impact on law in Australia
*In what way was he a difficult person ? This is in reference to him being pushed out of politics to the high court. 
*Why is the Cowan biography repeated ? Is this just two editions ? I think that there is a further Biography missed.
*"He died in February 1948" - it's usual to note where, if he was ill before, was there a (state) funeral and have this all referenced.
*ref 18 is missing a page number
*Should be more on his personality - especially as it had such an effect on his parliamentary career, the poor regard by some of his political peers, the good regard from his legal peers, and the significant conflict between his views on Zionism as they came at a similar time to the Holocaust and were poorly regarded by some/many in the Jewish community. 
*There should be more on his time in government. The Aust Biography site shows that there is more that could be covered.
*The lead consequently needs expanding. at the moment it summaries very little of the article
