unreferenced and little information. fails WP:GNG. created by an editor who has gone on a recent spree of creating unreferenced bilaterals. [[User:LibStar|LibStar]] ([[User talk:LibStar|talk]]) 03:27, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - the only possible justification for a bilateral article is that the relationship is in itself notable, which this one certainly is not. Indeed, if the uncited [[WP:OR]] were to be removed, there'd be nothing left. [[User:Chiswick Chap|Chiswick Chap]] ([[User talk:Chiswick Chap|talk]]) 10:19, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. No indication that this relationship is really notable, and at the moment there is definitely nothing in this article worth keeping. "Both the countries share the same Indian Ocean" is not a credible notability claim. '''''[[User:Moswento|Moswento]]''''' <sup>[[User talk:Moswento|talky]]</sup> 10:32, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Speedy Delete''' Fails [[WP:GNG]], a google search does not lead to any reliable sources. --[[User:Fauzan|<font color="2F4F4F">  Fauzan</font>]]<sup style="margin-left:+0.5ex">[[User talk:Fauzan#top|<font color="BDB76B">✆ talk</font>]]</sup> <sub style="margin-left:-5.35ex">[[Special:EmailUser/Fauzan|<font color="BDB76B">✉ email</font>]]</sub> 14:17, 24 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' They probably ''do'' have relations, but creating an unref'd stub should equate to a speedy deletion in my book.  No problem if it's recreated with references to show that it is indeed notable of inclusion.
