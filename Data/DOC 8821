The result was    '''Withdrawn'''.

:({{Find sources|Unicity Mall}})
Doesn't meet [[WP:GNG]]. Only sources are: an article that mentions only in super-extreme passing; a [[WP:PRIMARY]] source on the mall's architect; an unreliable looking tourism website; and a [[WP:ROUTINE]] coverage of a crime at the mall. None of these meet the usual acceptable coverage for shopping malls. Last AFD closed as "no consensus" after two relists. <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 02:37, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''&nbsp; There are several links of interest on the Google Books [http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q=%22Unicity+Mall%22 page].&nbsp; Unicity Mall is listed in the 1996 List of Major Malls.&nbsp; The 1975 Canadian Geographical Journal shows that this was a "regional mall" with 480,000 sq ft, which establishes that this was a "larger" mall, where WP:OUTCOMES says that larger malls are normally kept.&nbsp; The mall was torn down, but notability is not temporary.&nbsp; In the article, I don't see a source for the list of stores in the mall, but that number of stores is consistent with a larger mall.&nbsp; Like so many articles, this topic would benefit with someone with access to local newspapers.&nbsp; [[User:Unscintillating|Unscintillating]] ([[User talk:Unscintillating|talk]]) 01:05, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
:*{{ping|Unscintillating}} So you think the sources are just gonna appear by themselves? The Source Fairy is gonna suddenly make someone randomly have access to local news? Base it on what we ''can'' find, not what we might possibly maybe could find. <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 23:13, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
::*I've shown, using verifiable evidence, that the former mall has a presumption of wp:notability.&nbsp; If you are saying that the article's WP:V source insufficiency reaches to the level of [[WP:Deletion policy]], then you may have a point, but I don't know.&nbsp; However, as per [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Verifiability&oldid=556502288#Should_closers_of_AfD_discussions_use_the_incubator_for_articles_that_pass_WP:N_but_fail_WP:V.3F], admins seem predisposed to avoid deletions or even incubation for articles on wp:notable topics that fail WP:V.&nbsp; [[User:Unscintillating|Unscintillating]] ([[User talk:Unscintillating|talk]]) 00:11, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::*{{ping|Unscintillating}} So we ''can'' build articles out of ghost sources? You know what, I ''think'' the local paper wrote a bunch of stuff on my mom back in the day. Clearly she is notable. There's no way to prove it, but ha ha, no way you can't, either. Also, major [[WP:TLDR]] in the discussion you linked. <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 05:56, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*You've been here from before 2008, and WP:N changed in late 2007 so that it is no longer a content guideline that requires sources sufficient to write an article.&nbsp; What it requires is evidence.&nbsp; To answer your question, "We want readers to be able to [[WP:V]] verify that Wikipedia articles are not just made up."&nbsp; As for the long link into WT:V, the point remains that the lack of community support for WP:V does not revert WP:N to the days when it was a content guideline.&nbsp; WP:V itself is a core content policy that requires that article content be verifiable.&nbsp; [[User:Unscintillating|Unscintillating]] ([[User talk:Unscintillating|talk]]) 10:02, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::*{{ping|Unscintillating}} So where are the sources that you're so dead set exist? <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 10:48, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - per [[WP:NTEMP]]. [[User:VMS Mosaic|VMS Mosaic]] ([[User talk:VMS Mosaic|talk]]) 06:01, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:*{{ping|VMS Mosaic}} Sources. Where are they? <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 06:08, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::*If it once met [[WP:OUTCOMES]] for malls, then it will always meet [[WP:OUTCOMES]] for malls. [[User:VMS Mosaic|VMS Mosaic]] ([[User talk:VMS Mosaic|talk]])
:::*{{ping|VMS Mosaic}} That doesn't answer my question. Sources. Now. <span style="color:green">'''Ten Pound Hammer'''</span> • <sup>([[User talk:TenPoundHammer|What did I screw up now?]])</sup> 06:35, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::::*Uh. Now!!! You mean right now? This very instant right now? How about tomorrow? Maybe the week after next? Next decade maybe? Right. [[User:VMS Mosaic|VMS Mosaic]] ([[User talk:VMS Mosaic|talk]]) 06:45, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' Per VMS Mosaic and Unscintillating. This was a regional shopping center per the definition [http://www.allbusiness.com/glossaries/regional-shopping-center/4965203-1.html here]. [[WP:OUTCOMES]] applies. Notability is not temporary. [[User:Me5000|Me5000]] ([[User talk:Me5000|talk]]) 18:10, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
