On 6 August 1977, during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], a [[Woolworths (South Africa)|Woolworths]] store in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Rhodesia]] (today Harare, Zimbabwe) was bombed by [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA).{{sfn|Abbott|Botham|1986|p=12}}{{sfn|Chung|2006|p=238}}{{sfn|Cilliers|1984|p=43}} Eleven civilians were killed and 76 were injured. Of those killed, eight were black Rhodesians, including two pregnant women and a young boy, and three were whites, members of a single family, Gillian and Donald Mayor and their mother. Mr Mayor and another daughter, Wendy, were seated in a car outside when the bomb went off. <ref name=bryantimes>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&dat=19770806&id=46tTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FYgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4525,2891465 ''The Bryan Times'' newspaper report on the attack, 8 August 1977] accessed 7 September 2014</ref> 

The bomb, comprising about {{convert|75|lb}} of high explosives, was planted in an area where customers checked packages in before shopping on the upper floor of the two-storey building. It detonated shortly before the crowded store was to close at noon that Saturday.<ref name=ledger>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19770807&id=cllNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BfsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5532,1315185 ''Lakeland Ledger'' newspaper report on the attack, 7 August 1977] accessed 7 September 2014</ref> The perpetrators, two teachers, afterwards escaped to Mozambique.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=81}}

[[Ian Smith]], the Rhodesian Prime Minister, expressed horror at the bombing. "Those who have perpetrated this barbarous outrage can hardly be described as human," he said.<ref name=ledger/> Rhodesian black nationalist leaders Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] and the Reverend [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] also condemned the attack.<ref name=bryantimes/>
