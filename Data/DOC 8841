I'm not seeing notability for this subject, a one-location store that was in business for only 17 years. The article claims notability as the first Asian food store in the area, but I could not find any evidence that this was a significant first. The only references given are local obituaries for the founder. In a search, the only things I found about the store itself were Wikipedia mirrors.

*'''Keep''' Per [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Clyde Boats]], which article I'm glad still exists.  This article is equally charming and I am unabashedly invoking [[WP:ILIKEIT]], fully expecting to be overruled, and no doubt rightly so, by my more serious-minded colleagues who will see immediately that it satisfies no known notability guideline.&mdash; [[User:Alf.laylah.wa.laylah|alf laylah wa laylah]] ([[User_talk:Alf.laylah.wa.laylah|talk]]) 04:53, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
:::What a refreshing "vote"! --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 03:11, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. ive tried twice to find refs for this, and what we have is all there is. I strongly suggest that the article creator (who is the shop owners son, a distinguished local judge) save a copy, or request a copy if its deleted, and contact the local historical society to give to them. his personal recollections should be entered into the history books. it IS fascinating and an important part of the history of the city and of the Chinese community there, but i dont see it rising to notability based on what we can find.[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 17:37, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::Hmmph, looks like the distinguished local judge also wrote an article about himself. It's reasonably neutral/encyclopedic so I guess it's OK. [[User:Mercurywoodrose]], do you also know of any way of contacting the judge? He didn't list his email at his userpage, and he hasn't edited here (at least not logged in) since 2008. --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 02:43, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::Actually it looks as if his recollections are already on the record.[http://www.aiisf.org/stories-by-author/591-gee-stanley] --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 02:45, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::::Great, thanks for finding that. I dont know if it increases this articles notability, but it definitely helps if we want to add info on the Canton to his article, thus allowing for a '''Merge and Redirect''' as an option i support. I can also see it being kept now. i dont have a way to contact the judge, though i appear in ala cty court regularly (not as a defendent, im not that much trouble:))[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 17:01, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' I would add the name '''Stanley Gee''' to the opening, but as a combined article about him and his business I think it passes muster per the substantial coverage in reliable independent sources. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 21:13, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
::That's a reasonable idea.  I found a few sources that talk about him and mention the store.&mdash; [[User:Alf.laylah.wa.laylah|alf laylah wa laylah]] ([[User_talk:Alf.laylah.wa.laylah|talk]]) 21:33, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
:::What sources are you all basing your "keep" votes on"? The two obituaries (only one of which is from a significant source) plus the judge's recollection speech (a primary source)? Do those really pass [[WP:GNG]]? --[[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 03:06, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
::::Yes, rhe obituaries which clearly state that the Gees and their business was influential and pioneering. [[User:Candleabracadabra|Candleabracadabra]] ([[User talk:Candleabracadabra|talk]]) 09:43, 3 May 2014 (UTC)
