==Show/Hide option==

How do I add a show/hide option for something? I plan to add a large table to a page and I want it to be hidden to start with, with a show/hide link at the top. Something like that is done on the Google Chrome page and I've looked at the source, but I can't figure out what controls it. Can anyone help? [[User:Kookiethebird|Kookiethebird]] ([[User talk:Kookiethebird|talk]]) 00:31, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:See {{tl|collapse}}. An alternative is {{tl|collapse top}} and {{tl|collapse bottom}}. '''[[User:Spinningspark|<font style="background:#fafad2;color:#C08000">Spinning</font>]][[User talk:Spinningspark|<font style="color:#4840a0">Spark</font>]]''' 01:25, 20 April 2014 (UTC)

== Can't find a useful source ==

I thought about asking this on the resource exchange board, but that seems to be more for getting behind paywalls than tracking down sources. Anyway, I've been searching for the Act 167 Stormwater Management Plans, which seem like they would be useful on writing articles on streams. I've managed to locate [http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=18&objID=439672&mode=2 this list] of streams with Stormwater Management plans, but I can't find any list of the plans themselves. It would be great if someone here could figure out where I can find these. Thanks. --[[User:Jakec|Jakob]] ([[user talk:Jakec|talk]]) (Please comment on [[WP:Editor review/Jakec|my editor review]].) 01:16, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:I would think that [[WP:REX]] was the ideal place to track these down.  I suspect that there is not one central depository and the plans are held by the individual local authorities.  For instance, I found [http://www.dauphincd.org/swm/ACT%20167%20PLAN-FINAL/Dauphin%20County%20Phase%20II%20Plan.pdf the Dauphin County Plan] on [http://www.dauphincd.org/swm/act167.html this page] of the Dauphin county website.  Googling it seems to show up several more likely links.

== Screen shots ==

Dear editors:  At times when helping to debug new scripts it would be handy to provide a screen shot to the script developers.  What is the usual way to do this?  I know how to take a screen shot and save it as a JPEG file, but where should I post it?  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 02:42, 20 April 2014 (UTC)
:It depends what sort of scripts these are.  If you are talking about template code, then either the template talk page or the author's talk page.  If you are talking about a [[WP:Wikimedia Labs|Wikimedia Labs]] application then contact the application developers (I thought I'd seen a table with this information somewhere on Wikimedia but I can't find it right now, someone on {{irc|wikimedia-labs}} chat channel should be able to help you with that information if you need it).  If you are talking about scripts that are part of the Wikimedia software then [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/ Bugzilla] might be the right place.

::I'm sorry; I think I didn't frame my question clearly.  I should have asked, where should I upload it? If I understand your reply correctly, I should upload it at Commons, after making sure that no copyright logos are present.  I guess the file can always be deleted after it's not needed any more.

== Socialism-definition ==

{{hat|Unintelligible tirade with no discernible question  [[User:Rojomoke|Rojomoke]] ([[User talk:Rojomoke|talk]]) 10:21, 20 April 2014 (UTC)}}
It is 3:00am in the morning and I do not know why I am remarking but for a memory of the definition of socialism as I know it was a threat to democracy.  As I had seen in some documentary many years hath, aural truths heard with thine ears spaken anguished words of babies being studied by the true pervayors of socialism and methodologies deplyed its value experimentations upon the mind of children to build the perfect subserviant citizen
through understandings of stimulus and response mechanisms deployed from that knowledge of reactions to vile experiments performed often on orphaned children particvularily of those from warfare torn areas, subjected to isolations and segregations and torture and varieties of drugs, the knowlege of how to cultivate psoture of subservience commenced and the word the very word itself from the aural utterance of developing baby to child age of maturity was so sho as all children say this when experiencing there first independance of movement without assistance the documentary said, perhaps 1960s, when they are feeling there way and determining facination of things whilst learning to walk playfully and becaoming social as it was written down so sho, social, became the word because of the i a l had something to do with the nervous system and induced conditions of susceptibility increased to suggestions if such and such were inhibited or excited neuroganglia components at the time when in the last century the term was created unlike the false historical anachronisms written today as would it be a lengthy philosophy, nay just a casuistry of terms of experimentations upon Mankind which was completely illegal, during and before the ww1 and 2, and the united nations adherent then to the slavery laws which included usury experimentations for which evolved to the term socialism.  The inclusion which drew me to write this to you was in fact the comments highlighted in your text from each to another according to ability and to each another accordingly to need was the non conspiratorial sections of the UN first agreement of trade without monetary passings of any kind, and certainly protected from monopoly and military and political gain called graft.  Not anything to do with the utterances of some  brenev comments he repeeatledy said qoting th spirit of the agreement to the West primarily british ones whom hoarded trade to inure them from the wealth of resource in the East of Poland and now terms Ukraine areas of the 1960s.  Those odd features of misuse of the UN agreement are typically the obversive defiance of british sources that predominate the internet communications propaganda, as the UK is the worlds largest defyer of UN law and agreements since the signing of them, 1942 and beyond, still poisoning the world with chemicals and experiments apparatus mechanisms of warfare masked as medicine, british socialism is the type of socialism that characterizes other nations asn equated democracy with it socialism, freedom and democracy are not anything to do with social ism so whatever your site says is rubbish completely.  As far as communal orphans of torture were the learning grounds for perpetrators of socialism and building of military totalitarian complaints and instruments of easily influenced to surrender to subjections of another Canadians are like that cooperative towards appending of freedoms and allowing changes to slavery accommodating use of apparatus particularly medically of the masses, like british fawns of sheep forever lost in the dialectical semantics of depravity upon and degradation upon the will gifted to men under God.  Sure sounds pathetic and this writing may seem pathos but the loss to the right of mind underpins socialism and was the methodological structure of its design.  So from each to another and accrding to the truth to each one another the truth of the dangers of socialism would be refreshing since their are now upon america at least 100 thousand social workers trained in educations contrary to the the laws that used to exist because of the propaganda convincing others to the benefit of another managing their lives.  Life just is not hat way.  bye for now.  By the way it has now become acceptable to give antidepressants to babies enfants these days is not that too much, and that is a result of accomodations to socialism.  So stand up and correct correct the text protect the infants that they may live a free life tommorrow with out torrmenting stimulas tweaking their life along the way to sidetrack them into and out of jobs along the way, holy european union of UK eh, would you lie a treaty with a little sugar on top and a fairy tale with that.  And do not forget america is evil and the queen is good, want a pumkin pie with your coffee?  And excuse me I must go beat someone over their on a hanging ple while you are entertained in the night look the other way it is just ghosts, it is nothing at all, tea anybody with a little coal tar, todfay that is called benzodiazepine its for anxiexy enforced by plice socialism part of the arsenal...
It is a crying shame,...truly.  from each to another british versioning with incredible insult as roosevelt wrote that to include non conspiracy laws and hoarding greedy for profit was included inside the UN first agreement and still is their if you have ever read it as I have read it in old encyclopedia when I was a child.
