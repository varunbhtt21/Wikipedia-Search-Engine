Note:  If you are seeing this page as a result of an attempt to re-nominate an article for deletion, you must manually edit the AfD nomination links to create a new discussion page using the name format of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PAGENAME (2nd nomination)]].  When you create the new discussion page, please provide a link to this old discussion in your nomination. -->

The result was  '''Speedy delete, redirect, and fully protect.''' The present form of the article actually has less content than the version discussed at the last AfD, and the reasons given there for deletion apply every bit as much to this version as to the old one. [[WP:CSD#g4| CSD G4]] exists to prevent us from having to waste time going through the same arguments again, when a page has already been discussed and consensus reached. It is difficult to imagine a case where such a reason for summary deletion to avoid time-wasting discussion would apply more so than in this case. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> "[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 08:19, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

'''Delete''' and '''redirect''' to [[List of VeggieTales characters#Larry the Cucumber]] per the 2008 AfD and for the reasons expressed in that AfD. Additionally, '''permanent full protection''' to prevent recreation. [[User:Safiel|Safiel]] ([[User talk:Safiel|talk]]) 03:20, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
