Von Gumpach was born in [[Fedderwarden]] nearby [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 7 May 1814 as Johannes Grumbrecht. By 1841 he was recorded as living in the parish of St James, [[Clerkenwell]], in London. In England he adopted the first name Theodor, and in October 1842 he married Jane Willbraham Edwards in Cheltenham, Gloucester, England. While in the employ of the bank [[Frederick Huth & Co|Huth & Co]] he was arrested for embezzlement and sentenced to seven years' exile. He and his wife arrived in [[Nuremberg]] on 5 September 1844 using the assumed name "Baron" Johannes von Gumpach. In 1860 he was living in Munich, and afterwards he appeared to live in Guernsey. He published scientific writings as a "private scholar".<ref name="Auswanderer">[http://www.auswanderer-oldenburg.de/getperson.php?personID=I93541&tree=Auswanderer Emigrants from the Grand Duchy of Oldenberg]</ref>

He was hired by the [[Tongwen Guan]] (School of Combined Learning) of the Chinese imperial government, the first modern institution of higher education in China. His dismissal by [[Sir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet|Robert Hart]] led him to sue Hart in the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] for defamation. In 1873, the case ultimately went to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]  [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKPC/1873/1873_9.html Hart v Gumpach] which upheld Hart's right to make the decision.<ref>Fairbank et al, comment pp. 14-15 and several of his contemporary letters to Campbell</ref>

In his career, he had written a number of books about the social and economical issues of China.

Von Gumpach died in July 1875 at the General Hospital in [[Shanghai]].
