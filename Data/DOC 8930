'''Farley''' is a former rural village in the [[City of Maitland]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Early settler Captain Emanuel Hungerford arrived in New South Wales in 1828 before purchasing an established {{convert|2000|acre|abbr=on}} property named Lochdon. Here he built a homestead he called Farley House, from which Farley takes its name, after his ancestral home of [[Farleigh Hungerford]], [[Somerset]]. Farley is currently being redeveloped into a residential suburb of Maitland, with many new estates planned and land available from 400sqm. This is a continuation of nearby Rutherford and is across the wetlands from Gillieston Heights,places which are similar new western suburbs of Maitland<ref>http://116.240.203.224/UserFiles/File/European%20Cultural%20Heritage.pdf</ref> Farley is bordered to the north by the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North]] railway line, and a [[Farley railway station|station]] served the surrounding area from 1860 until 1975<ref> [http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Farley Farley station], NSWrail.net, accessed 26 April 2014.</ref> The Farley Wastewater Treatment Works is located in a rural area south of the village.
