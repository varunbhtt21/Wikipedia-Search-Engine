The '''Monument to the Liberator Soldier''' ({{lang-uk|Пам'ятник Воїну-визволителю}}, {{lang-ru|Памятник Воину-освободителю}}), commonly called "'''Pavlusha'''" ({{lang-uk|Павлуша}}, {{lang-ru|Павлуша}})<ref name=KLU>{{cite web |url=http://kharkiv.travel/en/what-how/to-look/mon-ts/liberator |title=Monument to the Soldier Liberator |work=Kharkiv Loves You |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> is a large monument in [[Kharkiv]] to the Soviet troops who [[Belgorod-Khar'kov Offensive Operation|liberated the city]] from German occupation in 1943.

The monument is located across from the [[23 Serpnia (Kharkiv Metro)|August 23 metro station]]. It was dedicated in 1981. The sculptors were Y. I. Ryk and I. P. Yastryebov, and the architects were A. A. Maksimenko, E. A. Svyatchenko, and E. Y. Cherkasov.<ref name=RU>{{cite web |url=http://www.pomnite-nas.ru/mshow.php?s_OID=1932 |title=Описание памятника  |trans-title=Description of the Monument |work=Remember Us! |accessdate=April 26, 2014}} {{link language|ru}}</ref> The centerpiece is a large statue of a Red Army soldier with a [[carbine]] raised high in his right hand. The statue is flanked by two artillery pieces and walls with replicas of the [[Order of Victory]] and the [[Order of the Patriotic War]].<ref name=RU/>

By 2009, the monument was in need of repair and maintenance. Previously, this had been the responsibility of the Green Areas Trust, but this body was now defunct, and so the monument had not been maintained for a decade, and required attention including testing for structural integrity, cleaning, and refacing of the pedestal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaport.ua/news/city/66885/Кто_был_прежним_хозяином_памятника_Воину-освободителю_на_23_Августа |title=Кто был прежним хозяином памятника Воину-освободителю на 23 Августа |trans-title=Who Owned the Monument to the Liberator Soldier of August 23? |author=Valery Kolesnik |date=October 15, 2009 |work=MediaPort |accessdate=April 26, 2014}} {{link language|ru}}</ref>

The repair was paid for by extrabudgetary funds. Money was raised by local and regional party leaders. Repair and cleaning of the pedestal alone cost more than 60,000 [[hryvnia]]. The project was completed within six months, in time for [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day (May 9)]] of 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url= |title="Солдата" на улице 23 Августа отремонтировали |trans-title="Soldier" on August 23 Street Repaired |author=Marina Achkasova |date=May 6, 2010 |work=MediPort }} {{link language|ru}}</ref> Further cleaning and restoration was done in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.kharkov.ua/ru/news/pam-yatnik-voyinu-vizvolitelyu-privodyat-do-ladu-14724.html |title=Памятник Воину-освободителю приводят в порядок |trans-title=Monument to the Liberator Soldier is Put In Order |date=July 3, 2012 |work=Kharkiv |publisher=City of Kharkiv |accessdate=April 26, 2014}} {{link language|ru}}</ref>

Kharkivites call the monument "Pavlusha" (by way of analogy with the Bulgarian monument "[[Alyosha Monument, Plovdiv|Alyosha]]" in [[Plovdiv]]), or simply "The Soldier". It is a popular meeting place<ref name=KLU/> and background for photographs.

In 2013, the [[National Bank of Ukraine]] issued a commemorative coin "Liberation of Kharkiv from the Fascist Invaders" as part of the series ''Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945'', showing the statue on the [[obverse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bank.gov.ua/control/en/currentmoney/cmcoin/details?coin_id=600 |title=Commemorative Coins of Ukraine: Liberation of Kharkiv from the Fascist Invaders |publisher=National Bank of Ukraine |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref>
