*'''Delete''' Not notable: run of the mill bus route. Wondering if it's eligible for a speedy under [[WP:A1]] no context, since it doesn't actually explain where in the world we are. --[[User:Colapeninsula|Colapeninsula]] ([[User talk:Colapeninsula|talk]]) 09:22, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - No context, no source .... No nothing really. [[User:Davey2010|<font color="blue">'''''→Davey'''''</font><font color="blue">'''''2010→'''''</font>]][[User talk:Davey2010|<font color="orange">'''''→Talk to me!→'''''</font>]] 13:15, 28 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' As a Singaporean, I note that even among the bus routes in Singapore, this is nothing special. --[[User:Hildanknight|Hildanknight]] ([[User talk:Hildanknight|talk]]) 03:44, 29 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Bus routes, with very few exceptions, are almost always not notable. Unfortunately, this is not one of those exceptions.

*'''Comment''' - Is there any article by the lines of "List of bus routes in Singapore"? Because I'm open for a redirect to such an article, although if this were to be redirected, the redirect should probably be something like "Service 75 (Singapore)".
