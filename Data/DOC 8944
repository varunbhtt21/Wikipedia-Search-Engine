Armed [[Taliban]] militants performed a major attack on a popular lakefront resort on [[Lake Qargha]] near [[Kabul]]. The attack happened just before midnight. The [[Taliban]] militants shot several guards and took over 50 hostages and held them at gunpoint and armed with explosives. A wedding party of some 300 guests hid in the lake for several hours until the situation was dealt with by a combined force of [[Afghan National Army|ANA]] and [[ISAF]] troops as well as air support. Some 12 hours later the death toll stood at 21, including 17 civilians inside the resort hotel in addition to a policeman and several security guards. [[Norway|Norwegian]] soldiers from the [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] mentoring ANA was heavily involved in dealing with the situation and rescue of guests. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/9348360/Afghan-troops-end-12-hour-siege-after-Taliban-militants-launch-suicide-attack-on-popular-restaurant.html|title=Afghan troops end 12-hour siege after Taliban militants launch suicide attack on popular restaurant|first=Ben|last=Farmer|date=22 June 2012|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/norge-i-krig/her-stormer-norske-spesialstyrker-gissel-restauranten/a/10066143/|title=Her stormer norske spesialstyrker gissel-restauranten|date=22 June 2012|language=Norwegian|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/taliban-insurgents-attack-kabul-hotel/2012/06/22/gJQAUVrWuV_story.html|title=Taliban insurgents attack popular Kabul resort; at least 20 killed|first=Joshua|last=Partlow|date=22 June 2012|website=Washington Post}}</ref>
