|Article = William T. Carneal
|Purpose = for visual identification of the person in question, at the top of his/her biographical article
|Replaceability = The person in question has been dead for 70 years and this is the only known photo of William T. Carneal in military uniform.  It was provided by the United States Army.
|Minimality = It will only be used to identify William T. Carneal in the military info box in the article.

The photo may actually be in the public domain, but I can't establish that conclusively at this point.  It is over 70 years old and it appears in other articles on William T. Carneal where credit is given to the United States Army.
