The '''Desert Hawks Brigade''' ({{lang-ar|لواء صقور الصحراء}}, ''liwāʾ suqūr aṣ-ṣaḥrāʾ'', '''Liwa Suqur al-Sahara''') was an armed private militia branch affiliated with the [[Syrian Arab Army]] which fought on the side of the [[Syrian government]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. It was primarily composed of former military officers and veterans as well as volunteers from other pro-government groups, with an age range of 25 to 40 years. The brigade has been described as an "elite"<ref name="eliteforce"/> group trained in [[ambush]] tactics, and has been employed in special assignments on several fronts. The group is equipped with light and medium arms, and is given artillery support from the regular Syrian Army when needed.<ref name="nashra-1april">{{cite news|url=http://www.elnashra.com/news/show/730174/صقور-الصحرا-تظهر-كسب-نصب-كمائن-ومهمات-خاصة-صعبة|title="صقور الصحراء" تظهر في كسب: نصب كمائن ومهمات خاصة صعبة!|date=1 April 2014|publisher=El Nashra|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

==History==
According to some sources, the group was formed in [[Homs Governorate]] and operated in the desert regions bordering [[Iraq]] and [[Jordan]] to cut routes used by anti-government rebel groups to smuggle fighters and supplies in and out of Syria.<ref name="nashra-1april"/> However, other sources state that the group was formed in early 2013 due to a near general collapse of 
the Syrian Army supply system where by mid-2012 the Army soldiers lacked not only fuel and ammunition but also basic necessities such as food.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/27/syrian-army-brink-of-collapse|title=Syrian army supply crisis has regime on brink of collapse, say defectors|first=Luke|last=Harding|date=27 July 2012|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}</ref> In an environment of an internationally imposed embargo the Syrian government reached out to wealthy and well connected individuals (often of highly controversial background) such as Mohamed Jaber and Ayman Jaber in order to provide the necessary resources.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/syria-oil-idUKL5N0J041G20131223|title=EXCLUSIVE-Assad's secret oil lifeline: Iraqi crude from Egypt|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="warontherocks.com">{{cite web|url=https://warontherocks.com/2016/08/the-decay-of-the-syrian-regime-is-much-worse-than-you-think/|title=The Decay of the Syrian Regime is Much Worse Than You Think|date=31 August 2016|publisher=}}</ref> In addition, the Syrian government allowed such individuals to form private militia units, such as Desert Hawks, whose members were better equipped than regular army soldiers due to connections and financial resources available to the Jaber brothers.<ref name="almasdarnews.com1">{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-desert-hawks/|title=Who are the Syrian Desert Hawks?|date=4 June 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/11/30/assad-regime-militias-and-shiite-jihadis-in-the-syrian-civil-war/|title=Assad Regime Militias and Shi’ite Jihadis in the Syrian Civil War - bellingcat|date=30 November 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Some sources also state that "paramilitary recruitment has been far more successful than army conscription, as it tends to occur through local, informal networks and family or community ties... it’s also easier to join a paramilitary group and then leave it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carnegie-mec.org/2016/03/14/strength-in-weakness-syrian-army-s-accidental-resilience-pub-62968|title=Strength in Weakness: The Syrian Army’s Accidental Resilience|first=Kheder|last=Khaddour|website=Carnegie Middle East Center}}</ref>

Although funded and formed by the Jaber brothers the unit was operationally lead by Staff Colonel Mohsen Said Hussein, a Republican Guard officer and paratrooper.<ref name="smallwarsjournal.com">{{cite web|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/syria%E2%80%99s-desert-hawks-and-the-loyalist-response-to-isis|title=Syria’s Desert Hawks and the Loyalist Response to ISIS - Small Wars Journal|website=smallwarsjournal.com}}</ref>

One of the units tasks was to protect the oil and gas fields on Syrian territory and serve as a rapid response force.<ref name="smallwarsjournal.com"/>

==Service history==
It participated in the June 2013 capture of the town of [[al-Qaryatayn]], where it lost one of its commanders in the fighting.<ref name="eliteforce"/> After rebels [[2014 Latakia offensive|launched an offensive]] in northern [[Latakia Governorate]] and seized control of the majority-[[Armenians|Armenian]] town of [[Kessab]], Suqur al-Sahra was transferred to that front, where its members helped lead the capture of the strategic height of Tower 45,<ref name="nashra-1april"/> losing at least three members in combat.<ref name="eliteforce">{{cite web|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/desert-falcons-elite-pro-assad-force/|title=The Desert Falcons: An Elite Pro-Assad Force|last=al-Tamimi|first=Aymenn Jawad|date=8 April 2014|publisher=Syria Comment|access-date=27 April 2014}}</ref>

On November 2014 during the battle for Shaer gas filed the units (operational) commander Mohsen Hussein was killed while attempting to expel ISIL terrorists from the facility.<ref name="smallwarsjournal.com"/>

In December 2015 the unit participated in operation which rescued a downed Russian co-pilot after his plane was shot down by a Turkish F-16 fighter jet (the pilot was killed by anti-government armed forces while descending to the ground).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyUwArh9_Y4|title="Suqur al-Sahara" - "Desert Eagles" unit - Saving Russian pilot[News]|first=|last=furby raffa|date=24 April 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201511291030944510-syrian-special-forces-russia-award-su-24/|title=Russia Awards Syrian Special Forces for Saving Su-24 Co-Pilot|first=|last=Sputnik|website=sputniknews.com}}</ref>  
 
In course of the [[2015–16 Latakia offensive]], the brigade developed a close connection to the Shia militant group [[Liwa Assad Allah al-Ghalib fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham|LAAG]], which began to provide advisors to Suqur al-Sahara.<ref name="hussein" />

The unit participated in both Palmyra liberation campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/desert-hawks-redeploy-west-palmyra-lead-new-offensice/|title=Desert Hawks redeploy to west Palmyra to lead new offensice|date=7 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://southfront.org/syrian-military-deploys-elite-forces-for-palmyra-offensive/|title=Syrian Military Deploys Elite Forces For Palmyra Offensive|date=7 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref> However, during the first liberation campaign, in March 2016, it was involved in a friendly fire incident with the SAA Tiger Forces members which left 9 Desert Hawk members dead and several dozen injured. The incident badly strained the relationship/cooperation between the two most successful Syrian pro-government units<ref name="warontherocks.com"/> which had successfully cooperated just one month prior, in East Aleppo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/tiger-forces-complete-the-east-aleppo-encirclement-800-isis-fighters-trapped/|title=Tiger Forces complete the east Aleppo encirclement: 800+ ISIS fighters trapped|date=20 February 2016|publisher=}}</ref>

Desert Hawks participated in the Aleppo liberation campaign which was successfully concluded in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://southfront.org/desert-hakws-brigade-infographics/|title=Desert Hawks Brigade in Battle for Aleppo (Infographics)|date=2 November 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/12/array-of-pro-syrian-government-forces-advance-in-aleppo.php|title=Array of pro-Syrian government forces advances in Aleppo - FDD's Long War Journal|website=FDD's Long War Journal}}</ref> However, their achievement was somewhat tarnished after it was learned that after the battle several of its members reportedly looted civilian property in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.southfront.org/do-syrian-soldiers-loot-towns-liberated-from-terrorists-photo/|title=Do Syrian Soldiers Loot Towns Liberated from Terrorists?

In early 2017 one of the Desert Hawks founders was arrested by other government forces after supposedly "interfering with a government convoy".<ref name="arabstoday.net"/>

In late June 2017 the unit deployed to the East Hama front but was withdrawn after only a few days due to unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://southfront.org/syrian-war-report-june-29-2017-desert-hakws-brigade-deploys-large-reinforcements-for-battle-against-isis/|title=Syrian War Report – June 29, 2017: Desert Hawks Brigade Deploys Large Reinforcements For Battle Against ISIS|date=29 June 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/desert-hawks-withdraw-forces-east-hama-offensive/|title=Desert Hawks withdraw forces from east Hama offensive|date=15 July 2017|publisher=}}</ref> In early July 2017, reports emerged that members of the unit had allegedly desecrated corpses of killed ISIL terrorists.<ref>https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2017/1-july-syrian-army-desert-hawks-pose-and-take-photos-with</ref>

==Portrayal in the media==

The Desert Hawks together with the Syrian Arab Army Tiger Forces were one of the most combat effective pro-government units.<ref name="almasdarnews.com1"/>
However, the units success on the battlefield was frequently overshadowed by the highly negative public perceptions of their founders (Mohamed Jaber and Ayman Jaber) who are portrayed as warlords and smugglers exploiting the war situation in Syria in order to increase their own personal wealth.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/assad-power-slips-in-syria-as-warlords-grow-more-powerful-a-1137475.html|title=Gangster's Paradise: Assad's Control Erodes as Warlords Gain Upper Hand - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}</ref>  Subsequently, the Desert Hawks were stigmatized as Jaber's own personal guard and only then a pro-government unit   
of possibly questionable long-term loyalty to the current Syrian government.<ref name="auto1"/> On the other hand, other pro-government units have a similar oligarch background, for example, the Syrian Arab Army Tiger Forces (which are highly praised in the pro-government media)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/tiger-forces-became-effective-fighting-force-syria/|title=How the Tiger Forces became the most effective fighting force in Syria|date=11 July 2016|publisher=}}</ref> are financed by Rami Makhlouf, current Syrian president Assads cousin and one of the wealthiest men in Syria.<ref name="smallwarsjournal.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://southfront.org/tiger-forces-history-and-capabilities-of-syrian-armys-elite-unite/|title=Tiger Forces: History And Capabilities Of Syrian Army's Elite Unite|date=19 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref>

==Disbandment==
On 2 August 2017, the Desert Hawks Brigade was disbanded, with Colonel Jaber returning to Russia, [[Ukraine]] or the disputed [[Crimea]] region to continue his pre-war employment. The soldiers will allegedly be spread out between the [[Qalamoun Shield Forces]], [[3rd Armoured Division (Syria)|3rd Armoured Division]], the 5th Corps and the [[Syrian Marines]] of 103rd Commando Brigade of the [[Republican Guard (Syria)|Republican Guard]] which is commanded by his brother, Colonel Aymen Jaber.<ref name="almasdarnews.com"/> A transfer to the closely linked Syrian Marines seemed unlikely since the personnel from this unit have also began transferring to other units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.almasdarnews.com/article/exclusive-900-syrian-marines-join-elite-military-shield-forces/|title=Exclusive: Over 900 Syrian Marines join elite military shield forces|date=23 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref>
