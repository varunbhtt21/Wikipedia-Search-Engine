Concern was the article fails [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:NFOOTBALL]] as well as [[WP:NCOLLATH]].  PROD contested by the author the following reason: ''Article meets WP:NCOLLATH because he has won a notable college soccer award. Just because it's a college soccer award and not a college basketball/football award does not make it non-notable.''  The fact that it's a college soccer award has nothing to do with this.  The reason is because it fails [[WP:NCOLLATH]] is because those awards are not national awards, those are awards within their respective conference. – [[User:Mikemor92|Michael]] ([[User talk:Mikemor92|talk]]) 04:45, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

I am also nominating the following articles for the same reason: – [[User:Mikemor92|Michael]] ([[User talk:Mikemor92|talk]]) 04:48, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete all''' – none of them, all of whom purportedly won local awards, meet COLLATH, which requires national awards. GNG is not met. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 05:16, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' all, as per above, fails, [[WP:NCOLLATH]]. --[[User:Fauzan|<font color="2F4F4F">  Fauzan</font>]]<sup style="margin-left:+0.5ex">[[User talk:Fauzan#top|<font color="BDB76B">✆ talk</font>]]</sup> <sub style="margin-left:-5.35ex">[[Special:EmailUser/Fauzan|<font color="BDB76B">✉ email</font>]]</sub> 07:21, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete all''' - fail [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:NFOOTBALL]]. [[User:GiantSnowman|Giant]][[User talk:GiantSnowman|Snowman]] 08:19, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Strong Keep''' – Sorry to ruin your deletion spree, but these articles meet [[WP:NCOLLATH]] [[User:Quidster4040|Quidster4040]] ([[User talk:Quidster4040|talk]]) 16:03, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
::No they don't. [[WP:NCOLLATH]] is met if they won a national award.  Which none of these guys have.  So they all fail. – [[User:Mikemor92|Michael]] ([[User talk:Mikemor92|talk]]) 19:26, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete all''' - none of them have played in a fully pro league or received significant coverage, meaning all these articles fail [[WP:NSPORT]] and [[WP:GNG]]. Additionally, none of them meet [[WP:COLLATH]] either. [[User:Sir Sputnik|Sir Sputnik]] ([[User talk:Sir Sputnik|talk]]) 21:50, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*''' Delete''' - Player has not played in [[WP:FPL|fully professional league]], nor played senior international football, so fails [[WP:NFOOTY|NFOOTY]]. Awards received not national so fails [[WP:NCOLLATH]]. No indication of any other achievements garnering significant reliable coverage to achieve [[WP:GNG|GNG]].

*'''Delete all''' They're all college soccer players who fail to meet [[WP:NCOLLATH]].  Conference honors are not the same as national awards.[[Special:Contributions/204.126.132.231|204.126.132.231]] ([[User talk:204.126.132.231|talk]]) 16:03, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
