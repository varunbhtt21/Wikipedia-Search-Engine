I've listed this article for peer review because I plan on nominating it as a good article. I originally planed to do this much sooner since I had expanded it, but chickened out and sort of left it alone. While I'm confident the article is expansive enough regarding the show's production and reception, the prose and summarizing of quotes may need some work, as is evident in the "Production" section.
