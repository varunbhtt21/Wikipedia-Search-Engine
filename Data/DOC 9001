Article about a footballer who fails [[WP:GNG]] and who has not played in a fully pro league. PROD challenged on the basis that the Azerbaijan League is fully pro, but there is no evidence to suggest that it is, and regardless, GNG is not met. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 05:11, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*''' Delete''' - Player has not played in [[WP:FPL|fully professional league]], nor played senior international football, so fails [[WP:NFOOTY|NFOOTY]]. Azerbaijan has been removed from the list recently as the sources provided for its FPL status did not explicitly sate it. No indication of any other achievements garnering significant reliable coverage to achieve [[WP:GNG|GNG]]. [[User:Fenix down|Fenix down]] ([[User talk:Fenix down|talk]]) 12:05, 30 April 2014 (UTC)
