'''''Kassengift''''' (Box-office poison) is the seventh studio album by German [[Pop music|pop]] duo [[Rosenstolz]], released in 2000 by [[Polydor Records]]. The album was the first Rosenstolz album to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the [[GfK Entertainment|German albums chart]] and includes "Amo Vitam", a song sung entirely in [[Latin language|Latin]] that reached the top 20 of the [[GfK Entertainment|German singles chart]].

== Composition ==
The title song of ''Kassengift'' is about the music business.<ref name="Berliner">Putz, Ulrike. [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/zehn-jahre-nach-der-bandgruendung-klingen-rosenstolz--wie-die-fans-sie-wollen--immer-gleich--ich-liebe-kitsch-und-hasse-ordnung-,10810590,9830984.html ""Ich liebe Kitsch und hasse Ordnung""] (in German). ''Berliner Zeitung''. 6 September 2000.</ref> In an interview, musician [[Peter Plate]] of Rosenstolz stated that the word ''Kassengift'' was taken from the biography of German actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], where it was used to describe the actress during her period of lack of commercial success ([[Marlene Dietrich#Box Office Poison|box-office poison]]). He added that the song reflected Rosenstolz's own experiences, with the band being ignored by the media despite achieving sell-out concerts and significant album sales.<ref name="taz">Tschernek, Michael. [http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/?id=archivseite&dig=2001/03/09/a0133 ""Medial gibt's uns nicht""] (in German). ''taz.de''. 9 March 2001.</ref> The song includes the lines "''Ich bin der Song, der nie gespielt wird / Ich bin das Video, das nicht läuft''" ("I am the song which is never played / I am the video which does not get shown").<ref name="Welt">Heier, Erik. [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article533667/Siegeszug-der-Schlampen.html "Siegeszug der Schlampen"] (in German). ''Die Welt''. 16 September 2000.</ref>

Other songs of the album are of a private nature. The song "Achterbahn" was written by Plate following a state of panic in his flat which caused him to shout "''Ich kann nicht mehr! Ich will nicht mehr!''" ("I can't go on any longer! I want to end it all!"). These words are sung at the start of the song.<ref>[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/rosenstolz-im-interview-wir-fuehren-ein-pop-leben/166080.html "Rosenstolz im Interview: "Wir führen ein Pop-Leben""] (in German). ''Der Tagesspiegel''. 14 September 2000.</ref> Another song, "Amo Vitam", initially contained the lines "''Ich liebe das Leben, ich liebe den Sex, doch warum bin ich einsam?''" ("I love life, I love sex, but why am I lonely?"). The lines, written by Plate, were translated into Latin for the final produced song by a friend with the help of his former Latin teacher.<ref name="Berliner" /> Latin was used because Plate felt that the language sounded very dramatic.<ref>[http://www.berliner-kurier.de/archiv/rosenstolz,8259702,7961858.html "Rosenstolz"] (in German). ''Berliner Kurier''. 17 August 2000.</ref>

The album also includes the cover song "Total Eclipse", which was originally sung by German singer [[Klaus Nomi]]. Plate and singer [[AnNa&nbsp;R.]] of Rosenstolz discovered that they were both fans of Nomi when they first met, and since the formation of their band, they had talked about recording a cover version of "Total Eclipse".<ref name="taz" />

== Release ==
''Kassengift'' was released on 4 September 2000 and re-released on 4 November 2002.<ref>[http://www.musicline.de/de/artist/Rosenstolz/22195/discography "Rosenstolz &ndash; Diskografie"] (in German). musicline.de. PHONONET GmbH.</ref> In addition, two songs from the album were released as singles in 2000: "Amo Vitam" and "Kinder der Nacht". They reached No.&nbsp;19 and No.&nbsp;63, respectively, in the German singles chart.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.de/song.asp?artist=Rosenstolz&title=Amo+vitam&cat=s&country=de "Single &ndash; Rosenstolz, Amo vitam"] (in German). charts.de.

[[GfK Entertainment]]. Retrieved 12 October 2014.</ref>

Two further songs from ''Kassengift'' were re-recorded in collaboration with guest singers: "Total Eclipse", featuring English singer [[Marc Almond]], and "Die schwarze Witwe", featuring German singer [[Nina Hagen]]. The songs were released together in 2001 as [[Total Eclipse/Die schwarze Witwe|a double single (two different editions released)]] and reached No.&nbsp;22 in the German singles chart.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.de/song.asp?artist=Rosenstolz+-+Marc+Almond+-+Nina+Hagen&title=Total+Eclipse&cat=s&country=de "Single &ndash; Rosenstolz - Marc Almond - Nina Hagen, Total Eclipse"] (in German). charts.de. [[GfK Entertainment]]. Retrieved 12 October 2014.</ref>

The collaboration with Almond occurred after he received a copy of ''Kassengift'' from a journalist. Enthusiastic about the album, Almond contacted Rosenstolz a few days later and it was decided that they should meet. Together, they re-recorded not only "Total Eclipse", but also "Amo Vitam", which appears on the Rosenstolz compilation album ''[[Alles Gute|Alles Gute &ndash; Die Goldedition]]'' (2001). For the other collaboration, Hagen was approached by Rosenstolz, who felt that "Die schwarze Witwe" was tailor-made for the singer.<ref name="Rhein">Köhnlein, Stephan.

Immediately following the release of ''Kassengift'', Rosenstolz went on a concert tour, which took place from 26 September 2000 to 25 November 2000. The first concert was held in [[Vienna]] and the second in [[Zurich]]. The concert tour then continued in Germany and included four concerts in [[Berlin]] in the Columbiahalle (Columbia Hall).<ref>Kosel, Felix.

== Reception ==
''Kassengift'' went straight to No.&nbsp;1 in the German albums chart and this coincided with music television stations [[MTV Germany|MTV]] and [[VIVA Germany|VIVA]] starting to regularly play Rosenstolz's music. This took AnNa&nbsp;R. and Plate by surprise, who remarked that they had spent six years trying to crack the music stations.<ref name="Welt" /> The accompanying concert tour was a sell-out,<ref name="Rhein" /> and in a review of one of the Berlin concerts, Felix Kosel of German music magazine ''bloom'' commented that the band's gay audience had become a more diverse audience.<ref>Kosel, Felix. [http://www.bloom.de/articles/article_000428_php4.htm "Rosenstolz-Live"] (in German). ''bloom''. 20 October 2000.</ref>

''Kassengift'' was positively received by German music magazine ''laut.de''. Finding elements of pop, trance and opera in the album, the magazine praised Rosenstolz for being unconventional and innovative.<ref>[http://www.laut.de/Rosenstolz/Alben/Kassengift-879 "Rosenstolz sind unkonventionell, innovativ und nicht mehr zu überhören."] (in German). ''laut.de''. 3 September 2000.</ref>
