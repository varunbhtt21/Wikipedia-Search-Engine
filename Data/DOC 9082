'''MetroBus''' is a [[bus rapid transit]] system in [[Bristol]], England. It is a joint project between [[Bristol City Council|Bristol]], [[North Somerset Council|North Somerset]] and [[South Gloucestershire Council|South Gloucestershire]] councils. The first route, service m3, began operations on 29 May 2018, followed by m2 on 3 September and m1 on 6 January 2019.

==Overview==
[[File:M2 Metrobus enters Ashton Avenue Bridge from south, 27 Dec 2018.jpg|thumb|Bristol (UK) m2 metrobus enters Ashton Avenue Bridge from south, 27 Dec 2018]]MetroBus is part of a package of transport infrastructure improvements in the [[West of England]] which have been designed to help unlock economic growth, tackle poor public transport links in South Bristol, long bus journey times and high car use in the [[North Fringe of Bristol|North Fringe]] of the city and [[M32 motorway]] corridor.

MetroBus vehicles have priority over other traffic at junctions and use a combination of segregated busways and bus lanes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bristoltemplequarter.com/key-projects/infrastructure/metrobus|title=MetroBus |publisher=BristolTempleQuarter Enterprise Zone |accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref> They are double-decker [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] bodied [[Scania N-series|Scania]] [[biogas]] buses with two doors, one for boarding and one for exiting, to shorten stop times.<ref name=Route1>[http://www.route-one.net/articles/Bus_routes/Bristol_CT_wins_Metrobus_contract Bristol CT wins MetroBus contract] ''Route One'' 11 April 2018</ref>

Three routes will be initially served by MetroBus:<ref name="all-you-need-to-know">{{Cite news|url=https://travelwest.info/metrobus/all-you-need-to-know|title=All you need to know about Bristol's MetroBus|last=|first=|date=|work=Travelwest|access-date=28 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=bp-20161010>{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/revealed-the-five-routes-for-the-new-200m-bristol-metrobus-network/story-29793957-detail/story.html |title=Revealed: The five routes for the new £200m Bristol MetroBus network |first=Ian |last=Onions |newspaper=Bristol Post |date=10 October 2016 |accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>

The m3 route will be extended at a later date from Emersons Green to [[Bristol Parkway railway station]], following works at the station to increase access for buses and other vehicles.<ref name=bp-20180424>{{cite news |url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/metrobus-parkway-buses-dont-fit-1494218 |title=Bristol Parkway has disappeared off the Metrobus map because the buses can't get to the station |last=Cork |first=Tristan |newspaper=Bristol Post |date=24 April 2018 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>

The South Bristol Link section, between Long Ashton park & ride and Hengrove Park, is not currently operated as no operator will run services without a subsidy.  It is anticipated that when a large development of new homes is built near the route, the service will become commercially viable.<ref name=bp-20180518>{{cite news |url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/forgotten-empty-metrobus-route-no-1576775 |title=The forgotten and empty Metrobus route no one wants to run |last=Cork |first=Tristan |newspaper=Bristol Post |date=18 May 2018 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|George Ferguson (politician)#Metrobus}}
The £200&nbsp;million project started in 2006, developed by the West of England Partnership, a partnership between [[South Gloucestershire Council|South Gloucestershire]], [[Bristol City Council|Bristol]] and [[North Somerset Council|North Somerset]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset Council|Bath and North East Somerset]] councils.<ref name="cut journey times">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28799884|title=Bristol Metrobus scheme 'could cut journey times by 75%'|publisher=BBC News Bristol|date=15 August 2014}}</ref> Three routes were originally proposed:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.travelwest.info/metrobus |title=Metrobus |publisher=TravelWest |date=15 August 2014 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref>
*[[Ashton Vale]] to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Temple Meads station]] (AVTM)
*[[North Fringe of Bristol|North Fringe]] (as far as the [[Cribbs Causeway]] retail area) to [[Hengrove]] (NFHP)
*South Bristol Link (SBL)

From its announcement, MetroBus (originally called 'BRT') proved controversial.  Responding to a campaign, described below, in 2014 incoming directly elected mayor [[George Ferguson (politician)|George Ferguson]] decided to change the route of the Ashton Vale to Temple Meads service. Instead of travelling along [[Bristol Harbour]] and over [[Prince Street Bridge]] it would now follow Cumberland Road and Redcliff Hill, calling near Temple Meads station and around the inner ring road before reaching the city centre.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-23518244 BBC News (2013) Change to Bristol bus 'rapid transit' route agreed.  July 31st]</ref>  This change would have important implications for the route and its potential patronage. As the city centre was projected to be the most frequent destination, journey times for most passengers were significantly lengthened.  As a result the revised economic appraisal in 2014 projected significantly lower passenger numbers than the original appraisal in 2011.<ref>Travelwest [https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/travelwest/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/annex-1-nfhp-value-for-money-website.pdf (2014) North Fringe to Hengrove Package Full Approval – Value for Money Appraisal]</ref>

An addition to the North Fringe package was proposed in 2015. The Cribbs Patchway MetroBus Extension (CPME) will provide a more direct route from [[Bristol Parkway railway station]] to Cribbs Causeway, via housing developments at [[Filton Airfield]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cribbs Patchway MetroBus Extension|url=http://travelwest.info/projects/cribbs-patchway-metrobus-extension|website=TravelWest|accessdate=18 July 2016}}</ref>

The scheme's promoters claimed in 2014 that it would reduce journey times by up to 75% between [[Bristol park & ride|Long Ashton park & ride]] and [[Hengrove Park]].<ref name="cut journey times" /> In 2015, services were expected to begin in 2017,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-33420106|title=Bristol Metrobus services 'reduced to three an hour'|date=7 July 2015|accessdate=12 May 2016|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> although this date subsequently slipped.

==Construction cost==
The total estimated cost of the scheme initially was £200&nbsp;million.<ref name=bbc-20150707>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-33420106 |title=Bristol Metrobus services 'reduced to three an hour' |work=BBC News |date=7 July 2015 |accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref> The Ashton Vale to Temple Meads route was £49.6&nbsp;million, of which the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) would contribute £34.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ashton Vale to Temple Meads: Funding |url=http://travelwest.info/metrobus/archive-papers/ashton-vale-temple-meads|work=Travelwest|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> DfT would contribute £27.6&nbsp;million, more than half of the total cost, to the South Bristol Link Road scheme which extends the [[A4174 road|A4174]] ring road, with [[Bristol City Council]] contributing £8.4&nbsp;million and [[North Somerset Council]] contributing £5.3&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southwestbusiness.co.uk/regions/bristol/special-report--what-the-south-bristol-link-road-will-do-for-business-30032016140104/|publisher=SouthWest Business|title=Special report: What the South Bristol Link road will do for business|date=31 March 2016|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> The cost of the North Fringe to Hengrove package was estimated to be £102&nbsp;million, with DfT contributing £51&nbsp;million, £30.5&nbsp;million from [[South Gloucestershire Council]] and £20.5&nbsp;million from Bristol City Council.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bradleystokejournal.co.uk/2015/03/19/north-fringe-hengrove-metrobus-scheme-granted-full-approval/|work=Bradley Stoke Journal|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=12 May 2016|title=North Fringe to Hengrove MetroBus Scheme granted full approval}}</ref>

==Objections==
MetroBus has faced opposition from environmental groups who claim a new bus-only junction over the M32 (North Fringe to Hengrove section) would mean the loss of 12 smallholdings, loss of long-held allotments, expansion into [[green belt]] land, and loss of Grade 1 soil and land at Feed Bristol, a community food growing project.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Emanuel|first1=Louis|title=Protesters angry as controversial plans for a MetroBus route for north Bristol narrowly approved|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/protesters-angry-controversial-plans-metrobus/story-22840071-detail/story.html|website=Bristol Post|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=28 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231045/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Protesters-angry-controversial-plans-MetroBus/story-22840071-detail/story.html|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MPs' concerns over Bristol Metrobus greenbelt plans|publisher=BBC News|date=7 July 2014|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-28198753}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bluefingeralliance.org.uk/blue-finger-explained/ Blue Finger explained] Blue Finger Alliance</ref>

The scheme proposes mitigation for loss of allotments, soils etc but the Report to the Development Control Committee for the meeting of 27 August 2014 states, "Despite the proposed off-site mitigation, the NFHP scheme would result in the loss of 1.79 hectares of [[Agricultural_Land_Classification|best and most versatile agricultural land]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Final section of Bristol fast bus project clears planning hurdle|publisher=Planning Resource|date=28 August 2014|url=http://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/1309859/final-section-bristol-fast-bus-project-clears-planning-hurdle}}</ref>

The 'Alliance to Rethink Metrobus' produced a 'Metrobust Green Capital 2015' calendar and a map showing planned destruction of green spaces across Bristol for the Metrobus scheme.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/armalliancetorethinkmetrobus/home Home] Alliance to Rethink Metrobus</ref>

The campaign to save the allotments was ultimately unsuccessful but an earlier campaign did succeed in changing the route of the Ashton Vale to Temple Meads Metrobus. This campaign focussed on a claim that buses would be routed in front of the M-Shed museum, damaging the environment of the waterfront.<ref name=petit>{{cite |url=http://www.hijackbristol.co.uk/board/the-forum/they-want-to-turn-the-waterside-into-a-bus-route-please-sign-petition!!/ |title= Hijack Bristol (2012) They want to turn the waterside into a bus route ... please sign petition!! }}</ref> In fact, as this video made in 2008 makes clear, the claim was inaccurate.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eERq26K5HG0 </ref> The buses would have run ''behind'' M-Shed, on what is now a road open to all traffic (albeit a no through road). The claim was repeated on many occasions by the media<ref name=bp-2>{{cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/MetroBus-revealed-Bristol-s-new-transport-likely/story-20348117-detail/story.html|title=MetroBus revealed: How Bristol's new transport system is likely to look|newspaper=Bristol Post|date=20 December 2013|accessdate=8 March 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140822171957/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/MetroBus-revealed-Bristol-s-new-transport-likely/story-20348117-detail/story.html|archivedate=22 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> helping to sway public opinion against Metrobus in the run-up to the [[Bristol mayoral election, 2012|Mayoral elections in 2012]]. This contributed to the decision of the mayor to change the route, as described above.

==Approval process==
All planning permissions for the MetroBus network have now been granted. The Ashton Vale to Temple Meads route was approved by the DfT in November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government approves Bristol 'rapid transit' metrobus scheme|publisher=BBC|date=6 November 2013| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-24835593}}</ref> The South Bristol Link part of the MetroBus scheme was approved in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Business welcomes approval for South Bristol Link road scheme|work=Bristol Post|date=20 January 2015|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Business-welcomes-approval-South-Bristol-Link/story-25893166-detail/story.html}}</ref>

==Construction==
As of April 2016, construction had begun on all three routes.

===Ashton Vale to Temple Meads (AVTM)===
Construction started in early 2015 on the Ashton Vale to Temple Meads route. Works for the Ashton Vale to Temple Meads MetroBus route include:<ref>[http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Work-Bristol-s-MetroBus-scheme-begin-just-weeks/story-25710840-detail/story.html Work on Bristol's MetroBus scheme to begin in just a few weeks] ''Bristol Post'' 15 December 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.balfourbeattycsuk.com/blogs/news/2015/01/balfour-beatty-awarded-£26m-bristol-‘metrobus’-scheme/#sthash.KSjskL7n.dpbs Balfour Beatty awarded £26m Bristol MetroBus scheme] Balfour Beatty 29 January 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-31088052 Bristol tree-top protest against Metrobus scheme] ''BBC News'' 2 February 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/12/activists-resist-eviction-bristol-treetops Eco-activists resist eviction from Bristol treetops] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 12 March 2015</ref>
*construction of a total of 1.2 miles of guided busway (not continuous) from [[Long Ashton]] to the [[Ashton Avenue Bridge]], together with a segregated path for cyclists and pedestrians,
*the refurbishment of Ashton Avenue Bridge,
*the construction of a new parallel bridge at [[Bathurst Basin]], and
*city centre works including new bus stops, upgrading of existing stops and installation of real time information displays.

===North Fringe to Hengrove (NFHP)===
Work began on the Stoke Gifford Transport Link (SGTL) and Bradley Stoke Way in August 2015 as part of the North Fringe to Hengrove Package. The work includes the construction of new roads, widening the carriageway, a bus only junction on the [[M32 motorway|M32]] and the creation of new bus lanes on the [[A4174 road|A4174]], Coldharbour Lane, Stoke Lane and SGTL.<ref>{{cite web |title=Metrobus North Fringe to Hengrove Package |url=http://community.alungriffiths.co.uk/works-in-your-area/metrobus-north-fringe-to-hengrove-package/ |publisher=Alun Griffiths |accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>

The widening of the A4174 required the replacement of the Church Lane bridge for pedestrians and horses, near [[Emersons Green]]. The concrete bridge was demolished in December 2015 and replaced with a steel [[truss bridge]] in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=A4174 ring road |url=http://travelwest.info/metrobus/metrobus-build/church-lane-bridge-a4174-ring-road|publisher=TravelWest|accessdate=18 July 2016}}</ref> Also in June 2016, the M32 was closed to allow the installation of a bus-only bridge.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Onions|first1=Ian|title=Bristol's M32 motorway to be closed to traffic during weekend in June|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/m32-closed-traffic-second-weekend-june/story-29288910-detail/story.html|website=Bristol Post|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=18 May 2016}}</ref>

===South Bristol Link (SBL)===
Work on this westward extension of the A4174 began in summer 2015 and involved the construction of:<ref>{{cite web|title=South Bristol Link |url=http://community.alungriffiths.co.uk/works-in-your-area/south-bristol-link/ |publisher=Alun Griffiths |accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>
*a new road with bus lanes from Highridge Common to the [[A370 road|A370]] Long Ashton Bypass,
*a new realigned road from Highridge Common to Hareclive Road,
*the new MetroBus route from Hengrove Park to Long Ashton Park & Ride, including a bus-only spur of about 700 metres connecting the new road to the park & ride site,
*a replacement railway bridge on the [[Bristol to Exeter Line]] (a branch from the [[Great Western Main Line]]).

The South Bristol Link Road was completed and opened to traffic in early January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=MetroBus Build |url=http://travelwest.info/metrobus/metrobus-build |publisher=Travelwest |accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=South Bristol Link Road opens to users |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-38628379 |publisher=BBC News |date=16 January 2017 |accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> The initial Metrobus network will not, however, run along the buslanes of the Link Road, although the road is used by services between the city centre and [[Bristol Airport]].

==Operators==
As of February 2017, an operator for MetroBus services had not been found. An operator should have been in place 12 months prior to commencement of services (planned for Spring 2017), but bus companies were reluctant to invest in new buses to meet the requirements for MetroBus, whilst having a cap on fares. They suggested that the services would not be viable on a commercial basis. MetroBus has said that public subsidy may be needed to attract an operator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public may have to help fund Metrobus as talks to find an operator stall|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/questions-raised-over-bristol-s-metrobus-scheme-as-operator-talks-stall/story-29650496-detail/story.html|website=Bristol Post|first=Michael|last=Ribbeck|date=24 August 2016|access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref>

In June 2017, it was announced that [[First West of England]] would run services on the first route to open – at that time expected to be the M2 from Long Ashton – and would not receive any public funding.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-40341911|title=First Bristol named as Metrobus operator|date=20 June 2017|access-date=31 July 2017|website=BBC News}}</ref> In April 2018, it was announced that the M1 route would be operated by [[HCT Group#|Bristol Community Transport]], under contract to First West of England, with the M2 and M3 services operated by First.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://travelwest.info/metrobus/bristol-community-transport-run-m1-route|title=Operators for first three routes now confirmed|last=|first=|date=9 April 2018|work=Travelwest|access-date=26 April 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=Route1/>

==Future expansion==
The [[West of England Combined Authority]]'s Joint Local Transport Plan has outlined the ambition for future expansion of the MetroBus network to link [[Bristol city centre]] to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] via [[Keynsham]], [[Clevedon]] via [[Nailsea]], [[Yate]], [[Thornbury, Gloucestershire|Thornbury]] and [[Avonmouth]]; along with an orbital service linking [[Emersons Green]] to South Bristol. A service in [[Weston-super-Mare]] is also proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/seven-proposed-new-metrobus-routes-2266154|title=The seven proposed new Metrobus routes|website=Bristol Post|date=28 November 2018|accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>
