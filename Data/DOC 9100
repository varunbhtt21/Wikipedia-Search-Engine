'''Seth Lewelling''' (1820&nbsp;â€“ February 21, 1896), alternatively spelled Luelling (including by Lewelling himself), was a pioneer orchardist from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]], best known for developing the [[Bing cherry]].<ref name=Cogswell>{{cite book |last= Cogswell, Jr. |first= Philip |title= Capitol Names: Individuals Woven Into Oregon's History |publisher = [[Oregon Historical Society]] |year= 1977 |location= Portland, Oregon |page=13}}</ref> Born in 1820 in [[South Carolina]]<ref name="enterprise-obit"/> as Seth Luelling, he used that spelling of his last name for part of his life but at some point changed it to Lewelling and favored that spelling for the last several years of his life.

His brother [[Henderson Luelling]] (who retained the original spelling of his family's name throughout his life) came to Oregon from [[Iowa]] in 1847, bringing fruit trees in his wagon.<ref name=Cogswell/> He established an orchard in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]], and Seth and their brother John came to Oregon and joined the business in 1847.<ref name=Cogswell/> Seth became the sole owner of the business in 1857 and developed many new varieties of cherries, rhubarb, grapes, and golden prunes.<ref name=Cogswell/> Among the cherries he developed were the [[Lincoln cherry|Lincoln]] and the [[Black Republican cherry|Black Republican]].<ref name=Cogswell/> As the names he gave to his cherries might indicate, Lewelling was also involved in the founding of the [[Oregon Republican Party]].<ref name=Cogswell/>  In 1875, he developed the Bing cherry.<ref name="enterprise-obit">{{cite news|title=A Noted Pioneer Gone|url=http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn00063700/1896-02-28/ed-1/seq-3/|newspaper=Oregon City Enterprise|date=February 21, 1896|page=3}}</ref>

The Lewellings played an important role in Oregon's movement for Initiative and Referendum.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/Hendrick_Initiative_Referendum The Initiative and Referendum and how Oregon got them, by [[Burton J. Hendrick]]]</ref> In 1892, [[William S. U'Ren]], then a young man, suffered a severe asthma attack, and called upon the Lewellings, who took him into their home and nursed him back to health. They had an abiding interest in political reform, and U'Ren found his life's calling through the discussions at their home; he went on to establish the initiative and referendum system, among other populist reforms.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Life and Death of Democracy
