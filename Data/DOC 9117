The '''2014–15 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team''' represented the [[University of Dayton]] during the [[2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]]. The Flyers, led by fourth year head coach [[Archie Miller (basketball)|Archie Miller]], played their home games at the [[University of Dayton Arena]] and were members of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. They finished the season 27–9, 13–5 in A-10 play to finish in a tie for second place. They advanced to the championship game of the [[2015 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament|A-10 Tournament]] where they lost to VCU. They received an at-large bid to the [[2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] where they defeated Boise State in the First Four and Providence in the second round before losing in the third round to Oklahoma.

When the Flyers were selected to play at home in the First Four, they became the first team since 1987 to play an NCAA Tournament game in their home arena. The NCAA made a rule in 1989 that no team could play a tournament game in their home arena. However, with UD Arena always hosting the First Four, Dayton is the only exception to the rule.<ref>http://buckeyextra.dispatch.com/content/stories/2015/03/18/dayton-wary-of-playing-first-four-home-game.html</ref>

==Season synopsis==
The Flyers entered the season with three players capable of playing as centers, but by the start of 2015, none of the three were available to the team. First, the NCAA declared incoming freshman Steve McElvene a "partial qualifier", rendering him ineligible for the entire 2014–15 season.  Then, in December 2014, starting center Devon Scott and intended backup Jalen Robinson were dismissed from the team after allegedly being caught committing theft in a campus dormitory. Two other players were sidelined by injuries. Junior college transfer Detwon Rogers was lost for the season to a knee injury, and graduate transfer Ryan Bass quit basketball on medical advice due to post-concussion symptoms.<ref name=Parrish>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/24959759/dayton-keeps-winning-even-with-a-uniquely-limited-and-short-roster |title=Dayton keeps winning even with a uniquely limited and short roster |first=Gary |last=Parrish |work=Eye on College Basketball |publisher=''[[CBSSports.com]]'' |date=January 13, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref>

These departures and injuries left Dayton with arguably the most limited roster, in both depth and physical size, in Division I. The Flyers played the bulk of their season with only six players who started the season on scholarships. In January 2015, Bobby Wehrli, who had begun the season as a [[Walk-on (sports)|walk-on]], was given a scholarship, but only for the spring of 2015.<ref name=Auerbach>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2015/02/27/dayton-coach-archie-miller-questions-and-answers/24111833/ |title=Coach's corner: Dayton's Archie Miller |first=Nicole |last=Auerbach |newspaper=''[[USA Today]]'' |date=February 27, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref> No one left on the active roster, whether on scholarship or not, was taller than 6'6" (1.98 m).<ref name=Parrish/><ref name=Auerbach/> CBS Sports journalist Gary Parrish had this to say about the Flyers' roster limitations (emphasis in original):<blockquote>"To put this into perspective, consider that [[2014–15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] has ''seven'' scholarship players taller than ''6-8'', and that UK's starting ''backcourt'' ([[Andrew Harrison (basketball)|Andrew Harrison]] and [[Aaron Harrison]]) is just as tall as Dayton's starting ''frontcourt'' (Dyshawn Pierre and Kendall Pollard)."<ref name=Parrish/></blockquote>

Despite these limitations, the Flyers remained in contention for the A10 title for most of the season, ultimately finishing second in the regular-season standings,<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.atlantic10.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=799991&SPID=136228&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=31600&ATCLID=209933810 |title=First-Year Davidson Claims Top Seed for Men’s Basketball Championship |publisher=Atlantic 10 Conference |date=March 7, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref> and advanced to the [[2015 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament|A10 Tournament]] final, losing there to [[2014–15 VCU Rams men's basketball team|VCU]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.atlantic10.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=799991&SPID=136228&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=31600&ATCLID=209962006 |title=VCU Claims First A-10 Men's Basketball Championship |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=Atlantic 10 Conference |date=March 15, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref>
