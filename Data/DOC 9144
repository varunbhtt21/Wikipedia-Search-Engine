| Description       = This is the front cover art for the book The Unconscious Before Freud. The book cover art copyright is believed to belong to the publisher or the cover artist.
| Source            = It is believed that the cover art can or could be obtained from the publisher.
| Portion           = The entire front cover. Because the image is a book cover, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image.
| Low_resolution    = The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original book cover. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable as artwork on pirate versions or other uses that would compete with the commercial purpose of the original artwork.
| Purpose           = Header. The image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary of the work for which it serves as cover art. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed at the beginning of the article or section discussing the work, to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Use for this purpose does not compete with the purposes of the original work, namely the book cover creator's ability to provide book cover design services and in turn marketing books to the public.
| Replaceability    = As a book cover, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the book would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary. Using a different image as a header would be misleading as to the identity of the work.
| Other_information = Use of the book cover in the article complies with Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Non-free content|non-free content policy]] and fair use under [[Fair use|United States copyright law]] as described above.
