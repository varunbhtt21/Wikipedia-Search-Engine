==The four-minute mile==
The historic four-minute mile event took place during a meet between [[British Amateur Athletics Association|British AAA]] and [[Oxford University]] at [[Roger Bannister running track|Iffley Road Track]] in [[Oxford]] and was watched by about 3,000 spectators. Bannister's time was 3 minutes 59.4 seconds and Hulatt recorded a time of 4 minutes and 16 seconds. Hulatt ran in the same AAA team as Bannister, Chris Chataway and [[Chris Brasher]] but Chataway and Brasher were pacing Bannister in order to help Bannister break the record.<ref name=BBCnews/> Hulatt was told before the race by Bannister to run his own race and he was not involved in the pacing.<ref name=BBCnews/> Hulatt was not interviewed after the race and he returned home with his brother<ref name=heritageDerby/> with a programme signed by Bannister, Chataway and Brasher.<ref name=BBCnews/>
 
Hulatt suffered an [[Achilles tendon]] injury in 1960, and in his later years he did some coaching, but only ran at the annual Tibshelf Horticultural Show. He died aged 59 and was buried in the grounds of St. John the Baptist Church, Tibshelf. On the fiftieth anniversary of his run, a one mile stretch of the [[Five Pits Trail]] was designed as the 'Tom Hulatt Mile'<ref name=dt/> identified by two marker stones, with inscribed plaques, in coal measures sandstone<!--what is this?--> donated by the [[National Trust]].<ref name=BBCnews>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27111860 How running has changed since the 4 minute mile by [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] at BBC News].
