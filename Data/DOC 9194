'''Thomas Turner Tate''' (1807–1888) was an English mathematical and scientific educator and writer. Largely self-taught, he has been described as "a remarkable pioneer of science and mathematics teaching".<ref name="Layton77">Layton, p. 77.</ref>

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Born at [[Alnwick]] on 28 February 1807, he was son of Ralph Tate, a builder; his mother's maiden name was Turner, and [[George Tate (topographer)|George Tate]] was his brother. Initially expected to take up his father's business, he studied under an architect in Edinburgh.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Tate, Thomas|volume=55}}</ref>

After his father's death, Tate changed direction from 1830. He lectured to local evening classes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Great Britain Privy Council Committee on Education|title=Minutes of the Committee of Council on Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBRNAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA32|year=1857|publisher=Clowes|page=32}}</ref> In 1835 he was the appointed lecturer on chemistry to the medical school in [[York]].<ref name="DNB"/> York Medical Society was founded in 1834; the Medical School in fact was founded formally in 1838, and then lasted for about three decades.<ref>{{cite book|author=Katherine A.

===Teacher training===
In 1840 Tate became master of the mathematical and scientific department at the [[Battersea]] teacher training college; this was a private venture founded in 1839–40 by [[James Kay-Shuttleworth]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gary McCulloch|author2=David Crook|title=The Routledge International Encyclopedia of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA337|date=26 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-85358-9|page=337}}</ref> Kay-Shuttleworth recruited Tate and two Scots, William Horne and Walter McLeod, to launch what was a new initiative in training, and textbook writing. Tate went on to write educational works on mathematics, mechanics, drawing, and natural science. His ''Principles of Geometry, Mensuration, Trigonometry, Land Surveying, and Levelling'' (London, 1848) was translated into Hindustani.<ref name="Layton77"/>

In 1849 Tate obtained a similar post at the [[Kneller Hall]] training college. Its foundation was an initiative of the principal [[Frederick Temple]], but the staff were few: [[Francis Turner Palgrave]] was vice-principal, Tate taught mathematics and science, and James Tilliard languages, geography and music.<ref>Hinchliff, p. 71.</ref> The mission was to instruct teachers for [[pauper]]s (i.e. those in [[workhouse]]s).<ref>{{cite book|author=Neil J.

With Temple, Tate worked to select chemical and electrical equipment for school science teaching, and a government grant was made available to subsidise its sale.<ref>{{cite book|author=College of Preceptors|title=The Educational Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SE8FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA248|year=1866|page=248}}</ref>

Tate was elected fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] on 14 March 1851.<ref name="DNB"/> During the 1850s his approach to teaching through the "science of common things" became fashionable: Tate's reaction was that he had been using it for two decades. He traced the pedagogic tradition in which he stood as Locke, Pestalozzi, the [[object lesson]], [[David Stow]] and [[Samuel Wilderspin]].<ref name="Layton122">Layton, pp. 122–3.</ref> He had taken advice from [[Henry Moseley (mathematician)|Henry Moseley]] in his days at Battersea, and through Kay-Shuttleworth was influenced by the ideas of [[Richard Dawes (educationalist)|Richard Dawes]]. The thinking was to tackle the needs of a working-class education.<ref>Layton, p. 82 and p. 111.</ref>

The college was closed down in 1856, and a pension was given to Tate.<ref name="DNB"/> The institution had run into problems on the political front, where the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Derby administration]] of the early 1850s disapproved, and also because it admitted some nonconformists as trainees.<ref>Hinchliff, pp. 49–50.</ref> [[John Bull (magazine)|''John Bull'']] had called it a "godless college" and complained of the cost in 1849.<ref>{{cite book|title=The English Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2B4RAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA110|year=1849|publisher=Francis and John Rivington|pages=110–}}</ref>

===Death===
Tate died at his residence, 51 Catherine Street, Liverpool, on 18 February 1888, and was buried at [[Highgate]], London.<ref name="DNB"/>

===Family===
Tate was twice married; his second wife Lavinia survived him. Three children were living at the–date of his death: of those [[Ralph Tate]] was his son by his first wife, Frances Hunter, and George Tate (1858–1933) the chemist was another son.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>A.

== Work ==
Tate was the author of numerous educational works on mathematics, mechanics, drawing, and natural science, all tending to promote intellectual methods of instruction. His 'Principles of Geometry, Mensuration, Trigonometry, Land Surveying, and Levelling' (London, 1848, 12mo) was translated into: Hindustani.

His 'Philosophy of Education' (London, 1854, 8vo) reached a third edition in 1860; it showed Tate's debts to [[Francis Bacon]], [[John Locke]], [[Johann Pestalozzi]] and [[faculty psychology]]; it is noted for its advocacy of the [[inductive method]].<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Edward J.

From 1853 to 1855, in company with James Tilleard, he edited the 'Educational Expositor,' a work designed to assist schoolmasters and teachers. In 1856 he began to publish 'Mathematics for Working Men,' London, 8vo, but only one part appeared.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite ODNB|id=26987|title=Tate, Thomas|first=Geoffrey|last=Howson}}</ref>

At York, Tate wrote a mathematical column for the ''York Courant''.In 1856 he began to publish ''Mathematics for Working Men'', London: only one part appeared.<ref name="DNB"/> In mathematical pedagogy, Tate favoured the teaching of [[estimation]] at an elementary level.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thompson, Ian|title=Issues in Teaching Numeracy in Primary Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqbSaXf0RKwC&pg=PA5|date=1 June 2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|isbn=978-0-335-24153-8|page=5}}</ref>

In experimental science and engineering, Tate contributed to the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', With [[William Fairbairn]], he was the author of memoirs in the ''[[Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', on the vapour-tension of [[superheated steam]], the strength of materials in relation to the construction of iron ships, the strength of glass tubes, and the elasticity of [[sulphuric acid]]. He was the inventor of a double-piston air-pump that was known by his name.<ref name="DNB"/>
