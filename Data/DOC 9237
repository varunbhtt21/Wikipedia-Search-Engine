Title : Bella Coola Valley
Text : The '''Bella Coola Valley''' is a relatively small but distinct region located in the [[British Columbia Coast|Central Coast region]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada, comprising the valley of the [[Bella Coola River]] and its tributaries.<ref>[http://www.bellacoola.ca/ Bella Coola Valley tourism association website]</ref>  The region is served by [[British Columbia provincial highway 20|BC Hwy 20]], which runs from Williams Lake to the town of Bella Coola at the head of [[North Bentinck Arm]], from where there is seasonal ferry service to [[Vancouver Island]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]].

The entire valley, and the regions surrounding North and South Bentinck Arm and [[Dean Channel|Dean]] and [[Burke Channel]]s, is the historical territory of the [[Nuxalk Nation]], who claim sovereignty over it as unsurrendered to the Crown.<ref>[http://nuxalk.net/html/sovereignty.htm "Sovereignty" page, Nuxalk Nation website]</ref>

The Bella Coola River, and so by default the Bella Coola Valley, forms the boundary between the [[Kitimat Ranges]] to the north and the [[Pacific Ranges]] to the south, which are two of the three major subdivisions of the [[Coast Mountains]], the other being the [[Boundary Ranges]] along the border with [[Alaska]].<ref>[http://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/25904.html BC Names/GeoBC entry "Kitimat Ranges"]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/PublicationsCatalogue/BulletinInformation/BulletinsAfter1940/Documents/Bull48-txt.pdf |title=S.
