The sixth series of '''''[[MasterChef Australia]]'''''  premiered on Monday, 5 May 2014 on [[Network Ten]].

This series was won by [[Brent Owens]] in the final against Laura Cassai on 28 July 2014. Coincidentally, Cassai and third-placed Emelia Jackson attended the same high school, [[Siena College (Camberwell)|Siena College]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Siena College Camberwell Newsletter|url=http://www.siena.vic.edu.au/_uploads/rsfil/00534.pdf|website=siena.vic.edu.au|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

==Changes==
In a reversal from the previous season, the audition and preliminary stages were again broadcast as part of the series, and the weekly theme format was dropped. Series 6 also introduced the "power apron", which granted its wearer a number of advantages and control across a series of challenges.
In elimination challenges and pressure tests, the contestant wore black aprons with their name in it. The same type of aprons were used by eliminated contestants in week 8 of 5th season of Masterchef Australia. In the previous seasons, the contestant who faced an elimination test or a pressure test wore a black apron without their name on it. 
In addition, the Immunity Challenges were expanded to have a preliminary round between three contestants before the winner moved on to cook for immunity against a professional chef. Kylie Kwong regularly appeared as a mentor during the Immunity Challenge episodes in addition to a recurring role as a guest judge.

==Contestants==

=== Top 24 ===
The full Top 24 were revealed on Tuesday, 6 May. At the first Top 24 challenge, it was revealed that Cecilia Vuong, who was recovering from brain surgery due to a skiing injury, had withdrawn from the competition based on medical advice. Georgia Hughes, who had been the last one eliminated in the Top 50 portion of the show, entered as her replacement. Vuong eventually competed for a second chance in the [[MasterChef Australia (series 8)|eighth series]] and made it to the top 24. She finished in 17th place.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cecilia Vuong out of MasterChef Australia's top 24 on medical advice|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/cecilia-vuong-out-of-masterchef-australias-top-24-on-medical-advice/story-fn8yvfst-1226909595629|date=7 May 2014}}</ref>

| '''Auditions Part 2''' - The eighteen second chance contestants compete in a two-round challenge for ten remaining spots in the Top 24. The first round was an Invention Test where contestants have 75 minutes to cook a dish from a choice of three core skills (filleting, butchering and baking). Jamie, Brendan, Scott, Brent, Kira, Renae and Nick delivered the best dishes, received an apron each and joined the Top 24. The five other contestants (whose dishes had technical issues that failed to impress the judges) will not compete in the second round and were eliminated. The six remaining contestants faced a Pressure Test to claim the last remaining spots in the Top 24. They have two hours to recreate George Calombaris' dessert "Lemon, Lime and Bitters". Steven's version of the dish highly impressed the judges during tasting, winning him an apron. Afterwards, the last two aprons were given to Sarah and Byron.

Georgia, Ben, Sarah, Tash and Nick were each chosen by the previous winners as the Top 5. It was Nick's salted hazelnut crumb, lemon curd and white chocolate mousse that won him the advantage for the Invention Test. The theme for this next challenge was to cook a dish from the past (over present and future) chosen by Nick with 90 minutes to cook. The top three dishes cooked by their makers will be saved from tomorrow's first elimination challenge. In the end, the judges save Laura, Sean and Jamie from elimination as the Top 3.

| '''Chinese Cuisine Elimination Challenge''' - The remaining contestants faced a three-round elimination challenge set by in-house mentor [[Kylie Kwong]] based on Chinese cuisine. The first round was to cook fried rice with different ingredients in the pantry that are not used in Chinese cooking in 30 minutes with the top twelve contestants will be safe from the next round. For the second round, each of the remaining contestants must name a Chinese ingredient. The first three people who guessed the ingredient incorrectly will compete in the final round. Deepali, Rachael and Brendan have 60 minutes to cook their Chinese dishes. They were able to use the ingredients that were guessed correctly in the second round.  Rachael's Szechuan Pepper and Coriander Crab with Chinese Broccoli was praised by the judges. Deepali served only three dumplings with less filling that had technical issues, despite praising the judges with its taste. Brendan, who had inexperience with Chinese cuisine, produced a dish with under-cooked pork loin that missed the mark on the theme of the challenge which left the judges' decision to eliminate him.

| '''Pressure Test: Shannon Bennett's Fillet of Beef''' – [[Shannon Bennett]] presents his Filet De Boeuf Et Pommes Souffle Au Jus Gras for Deepali, Nick, Jamie and Scott to recreate in one and a half hours. This pressure test struggled all of the contestants: Scott made mistakes during the challenge but his steak and pommes soufflées impressed the judges apart from the jus gras. Nick's steak was very rare and it wasn't cut correctly, after he repeatedly burnt himself in his cooking time. Deepali's steak was unevenly cooked and her pommes didn't rise. Jamie's pommes lack salt and his jus gras is too thick. In the end, the fact that her [[Hinduism in Australia|Indian religion]] forbids Deepali to either taste or cook a steak is proven to be her disadvantage, and that is enough to seal her elimination.

Two teams will get identical pantries to create their own menus and select pricing. The team that earns the most money, wins. After winning the Invention Test, Sarah earned the advantage of choosing her own team and a restaurant of choice as a team captain.

Tash, Emily, Laura, Rachael and Amy have the top dishes, however the other remaining home cooks were also declared safe after Nicole took a crucial risk of using a whole snapper for the first round, despite the judges' pleading.

The chef decided to cook a dish with fruit in one hour and Tracy have one hour and fifteen minutes to cook her dish from the chosen key ingredient. Tracy's pastry for her Lemon and Lime Curd Tart with Candied Orange Peel and Italian Meringue praise the judges but the meringue was over-whipped and the curd was runny, given a score of 20. Ollie's Seared Pork Loin and Summer Fruits with Pickled Beetroot and Prosciutto have notable flaws but his perfectly cooked pork scored 24 to win.

The Blue Team, led by Sarah and her vice-captain Tash, were assigned to cook dishes from Ezard while The Red Team, led by Jamie and his vice-captain Emelia, were assigned to Cutler & Co. The captain and vice captain went to the restaurants and had to memorise the directions of the recipes from the chef of each restaurant (Teage Ezard and Andrew McConnell of Cutler & Co). They then returned to the MasterChef kitchen to relay to their other team members instructions to be able to replicate the dishes in 90 minutes. During service, the Red Team's watercress puree for the entrée was bitter while the Blue Team's plum broth for the main course had an odd taste. In the dessert, both teams have technical issues with their dishes - the Red Team had issues of demoulding their panna cottas, missing out the caramel topping and there's error in their syrup while the Blue Team's honey jelly didn't set and their sorbets were melting but their cheesecake and crumb were well received in judging as the Blue Team wins while the Red Team were sent to elimination.

The first course was to create an edible dessert centerpiece with the use of carrots. For the second course, teams prepared their desserts with thyme as the key ingredient. The third course was to cook a dessert with ginger and the use of liquid nitrogen. In the final course, they prepared a hot blue cheese dessert. While both teams were praised each for their two courses, the combination of the Red Team's inconsistent presentation in their centerpiece and overuse of the salt in their thyme biscuits sent them to elimination as the Blue Team wins the challenge.

While Rachael's dish earned praises with her lobster and grilled mango, the conflicting flavours to her cheese soufflé on her dish meant she lost with the lowest score of 15 to Matt's 23.

| '''Pressure Test: Nick Palumbo's Choc Top Extraordinaire''' - Tracy decided to use her immunity pin and Renae steps in to the Pressure Test. She, Emelia and Sarah had to recreate four salted caramel soft serve gelati with Italian meringue covered in ganache, amaretti biscuits on a sugar cone by Nick Palumbo in two hours of cooking time and fifteen minutes to serve. At tasting, Renae impressed with her take of the dessert while both Sarah and Emelia's desserts were criticised for the subtle saltiness in their ice creams. When Renae was safe, it was down to the balance of Sarah and Emelia's gelati. Ultimately, the latter attained the hint of caramel flavour in her gelato to save herself and Sarah was eliminated for the second time in the competition.

Their Vietnamese tacos made it difficult for the customers and the judges to eat. The Red Team took too long to prepare their dishes. Their Japanese noodle soup earned reviews for the depth of flavour but it was criticised on its bland texture. With 10 minutes to go, the Yellow Team's Chinese pork and mushroom soup earned popularity to the customers which meant they quickly ran out. The Blue Team earned overall positive reviews on their two dishes. Two teams will be saved based on the highest number of votes from the customers to each team. The Blue Team earned 79 votes and The Yellow Team got 59 votes whereupon, the critical flaws in the dishes of the Green and Red Teams earned them the lowest votes each (Green's 51 and Red's 11), sending them to elimination.

| '''Cryptic Elimination Challenge''' - Ben, Brent, Renae and Tracy faced off in a challenge to re-create an unknown dish by head chef Dave Verheul of The Town Mouse. Unlike any other Pressure Test, there was no recipe provided and they don't get to either guess or know the characteristics of this dish. The contestants get to decipher the clues based on a food critic review by judge Matt Preston to recreate the dish with intuition. After two hours, the dish was Buttermilk poached pear with walnut, salted caramel, roast chocolate ganache & pear sorbet. All four struggled to recreate the dish: Brent's sorbet lacked freshness and flavour, Ben had less chocolate ganache while his caramel hardened, Renae missed the walnut crumble, and Tracy overcooked her pear. However, Ben and Brent manage to thrive the approach of the dish and were safe while it came down to Renae and Tracy whom they had issues of recreating the ganache. In the end, Renae failed to balance the sweetness in the dish and she was eliminated.

They will cook pub food dishes to be served to 120 guests at The Hotel Albion in [[Port Melbourne, Victoria]]. Each gets to pick one of the five different classic pub dishes: surf ‘n’ turf, parma, pasta, roast of the day and fish of the day. Amy, after winning the advantage, gets to pick the dish first and choose surf ‘n’ turf. Brent picked Parma, Laura choose the pasta, Emelia's pick was the roast and Jamie had the fish dish. Amy's Pork Belly with Seared Scallops beat Emelia's Roasted Spatchcock with Roasted Potatoes, Lentils and Madeira jus for the second win and the advantage. During the challenge, Laura struggled with the amount of pasta to be served to the customers as her Pappardelle with Mushroom Ragu was served with less pasta and lack of execution while Brent dropped his sides for the entrée and his Chicken Parmigiania with Fennel Salad did not impress the judges. Those missteps were enough to put them in the bottom two for the size inconsistencies in their dishes however, Laura's pasta skills in the dish was enough to salvage the error and Brent was sent to elimination in his eleventh time.

Amy's advantage is that she gets to pick one of the senses first. She choose sound but although she had the pick, Amy fall behind throughout the challenge as the concept of her Seafood Stew with Fresh Oyster and Bread Roll wasn't convincing to the judges while the fish was overcooked and wasn't handled with care. Laura's Citrus Cured Salmon with Beetroot Jelly and Coriander Oil, that was inspired with her choice: sight, delivered the dish of the day as she was sent to Finals Week. Despite the small errors in Jamie's Green Tea Cured Salmon with Compressed Apples and Green Strawberries (smell) and Emelia's Lemon Verbana Jelly with Pickled Apples, Confit Lemon Segments  and Mascarpone Ice Cream (touch), they also made it to the Finals.

| '''Elimination Challenge: Deception''' - Amy, Ben, Brent and Tracy faced off in the last elimination challenge before Finals Week. In honour of Heston, the theme of this challenge was about culinary deception. They had to create a dish that look like it but tasted something else to trick Heston and the judges in two hours. Ben's campfire sous vide beef dish and Brent's chocolate soil dessert earned high praise on both the presentations of their dishes. It came down between Amy and Tracy as both of their dishes missed the brief of the challenge: Amy, despite being motivated in this week's previous challenges, had problems with the presentation of her magic fruit salad dish and her cheesecake plums had issues on the texture while Tracy's crumble custard dish had less deceptive creativity although her flavours stood out to the judges. As a result, Amy was eliminated from the competition.

They must cook their dishes with the use of ingredients from the box chosen by their respective loved ones in 45 minutes. Three Contestants who cooked their best dishes will be safe from elimination in the second round. Brent, Emelia and Tracy were named the Top 3 while Ben, Jamie and Laura were declared the Bottom 3. They faced off in a two-hour Pressure Test where they had to survive elimination by replicating a difficult interpretation of a [[banana split]] created by returning pastry chefs: [[Darren Purchese]], Christy Tania and Nick Palumbo (each chef composed one of the elements of this dessert). Jamie manage to deliver the take of the dessert and he was safe. Ben's chocolate peanut sauce had split and it was greasy while his tuilles were too thin causing it to crumble and his banana parfait lack texture. Laura had issues with her banana gelato and her coconut foam lacked execution of the spices but the rest of her elements thrive in judging and she was safe, eliminating Ben from the competition.

The judges felt Brent overcomplicate his dish that missed the mark in the challenge and Tracy's plating of her dish was unorganized, having flawed elements and an unfinished plate. In terms of creativity in his dish, Brent was declared safe as Tracy was eliminated.

They will compete in a service challenge where they had to cook a main and a dessert in four hours to be served to 20 diners and the judges in the MasterChef Kitchen where only two will advance in the Grand Finals. All three fell behind during the prep time to prepare their dishes. Emelia made Glazed Beef Cheeks with Jerusalem Artichoke Puree, Brent cooked his Roasted Pork Belly with Apple and Celeriac Cream and Laura prepare her Smoked Quail with Chestnuts and Mushrooms. All of their mains received high praise from the judges on complexity. Both Emelia and Laura had issues with one of their elements for their desserts, forcing them to salvage it. Brent's Seasonal Apples with Pistachio and Fennel received praise on the complexity. While the judges liked Emelia's Whipped Chocolate Ganache with Mandarin Chantilly Curd and Fig Leaf Anglaise, her curd lacked acidity and freshness in the dish to balance the richness of her chocolate elements. Laura's Chestnut Forest also impressed the judges on the complexity. With both of their two dishes received overall praise, Brent and Laura advanced to the Finals. Therefore, the lack of acidity in her dessert meant Emelia was eliminated but was offered a pastry chef apprenticeship at The Press Club by George.

In round one, Brent and Laura get to make up their own Mystery Box by individually taking turns in choosing their ingredients. They got 60 minutes to cook their entrée dishes. Laura was praised with her grilled scampi with anchovy butter, pickled cabbage, roe and pear barley but her cabbage lacked finesse. Brent's textures of pearl barley with poached scampi, pickled cabbage and fresh chervil earned overall positive remarks on the complexity of his dish. Laura received 25 points while Brent got 9 points each from all of the judges to 27.

In round two, the grand finalists took charge at the chef's table to cook their main dishes to be served for their special guests: their families and friends in 90 minutes. Laura's butter poached lobster and cooked scallops with chestnuts and mushrooms delivered overall praise to the judges while Brent's modern take of a [[Lancashire hotpot]] also impress the judges but it was criticised for missing out the potato elements in his dish. Laura got 24 points (8 each from the judges) to a total of 49, overtaking Brent who scored 21 (7 points each) to 48 points total.

In the final round, Brent and Laura had to recreate [[Quay (restaurant)|Quay]] executive chef [[Peter Gilmore (chef)|Peter Gilmore's]] “Chocolate Ethereal” with three hours to cook and 20 minutes to assemble the dish. Throughout the challenge, Laura struggled in making the nougat element after reading the wrong recipe. She now falls behind when her tempered chocolate seized in her bench and failed to peel the hot caramel element off before the time limit expires. In judging, Brent managed to reinterpret Peter's dish during the round that thrived the judges and Peter on the textures and complexity. Laura's plate did not meet the brief in the presentation when she didn't chop the nougat and her dish lacked the tempered sheet elements. As a result, she got 8 points each from Gary, George and Matt and 7 from Peter with the overall score of 80 points. Brent got 8 points from Gary and 9 points each from George, Matt and Peter, finalizing to a score of 83 points.
