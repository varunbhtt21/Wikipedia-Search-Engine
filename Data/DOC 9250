The '''2014 Anzac Test''' was a [[Test match (rugby league)|rugby league test match]] played between [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] at [[Sydney Football Stadium|Allianz Stadium]] in [[Sydney]] on 2 May 2014. It was the 15th [[Anzac Test]] played between the two nations since the first was played under the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] banner in [[1997 Anzac Test|1997]]. It was also the first Test match played in Sydney since the [[2010 Rugby League Four Nations|2010 Four Nations]] tournament. A [[All Stars Match#2014|Women's All Stars Match]] which is the [[Women's rugby league]] version of the game was played as the main curtain raiser for the Test, which was won 24-0 by the Women's All Stars.<ref>https://www.nrl.com/womens-all-stars-too-strong-in-historic-clash/tabid/10874/newsid/78109/default.aspx</ref>

==Pre-game==
In the lead up to the test, Australia named an expected team, though [[Jarryd Hayne]], a revelation in the unfamiliar position of centre during the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013 World Cup]], was unavailable through injury and was replaced by [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury]]'s [[Josh Morris (rugby league)|Josh Morris]] who was playing along his twin brother, [[St George Illawarra Dragons|St George Illawarra]] winger [[Brett Morris|Brett]]. The twins were playing their fourth test alongside each other, and their first in Australia. [[Melbourne Storm|Melbourne]]'s incumbent Kangaroo halfback [[Cooper Cronk]] won a well publicised battle with [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]]'s [[Daly Cherry-Evans]] for the halfback role, though Cherry-Evans was chosen as a reserve being able to cover the halves, hooker or lock. Melbourne hooker [[Cameron Smith]] was playing in his 38th test for Australia and his 14th as captain. Coach [[Tim Sheens]] named experienced [[North Queensland Cowboys]] back [[Brent Tate]] as the squads 18th man. [[Brisbane Broncos]] utility player and fresh reserve [[Matt Gillett]] was the only player on debut for the Kangaroos, replacing injured Broncos team mate [[Sam Thaiday]].

New Zealand however were in trouble with a number of players missing from the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup Final|2013 World Cup Final]] loss to Australia in November. Not selected were the likes of [[Kevin Locke (rugby league)|Kevin Locke]] (languishing in the [[New Zealand Warriors]] [[NSW Cup]] side thanks to the presence of [[England national rugby league team|England]] fullback [[Sam Tomkins]] at the club), [[Manu Vatuvei]], [[Kieran Foran]], [[Jared Waerea-Hargreaves]], [[Isaac Luke]] and [[Sonny Bill Williams]]. While Foran and Luke were injured and Williams had made himself unavailable, the biggest shock were the omissions of powerhouse winger Vatuvei and [[Sydney Roosters]] premiership winning front rower Waerea-Hargreaves. The Kiwis featured five players on debut as Kearney publicly stated they were looking to the future. Playing their first test match for the Kiwis were Manly's [[Peta Hiku]] (fullback), [[New Zealand Warriors|Warriors]] [[Ben Henry]] and [[Siliva Havili]] (hooker and reserve), [[West Tigers]]' [[Martin Taupau]], and [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]]'s [[Isaac John]] who was playing for the Panthers NSW Cup affiliate the [[Windsor Wolves]] when selected. Although it was his debut for NZ, John had previous international experience having represented the [[Cook Islands national rugby league team|Cook Islands]] at the 2013 World Cup. Another debutante [[Kenny Bromwich]] was named as NZ's 18th man.

Due to the relative inexperience of the New Zealanders, and that the Kangaroos were aiming for their 16th straight test win to equal the record of the teams that won 16 straight from 1979-1983, the Australians were short priced odds to win their 14th Anzac Test since the first was held under the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] banner in [[1997 Anzac Test|1997]] (though as a SL game, the [[Australian Rugby League]] (ARL) did not count it as an official Australian test). Many critics felt the game would be an easy win for Australia and the Kiwis were given little chance of pulling off what would have been an upset win.
