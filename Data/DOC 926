The '''Macedonian Committee''' ({{lang-gr|Μακεδονικό Κομιτάτο}}, ''Makedoniko Komitato''), formally the '''Hellenic Macedonian Committee''' (Ελληνομακεδονικό Κομιτάτο, ''Ellinomakedoniko Komitato''), was a [[Greeks|Greek]] irredentist organization with the aim of liberating [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] (in the [[vilayets]] of [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Salonika Vilayet|Salonika]]). It formed in 1903 under the leadership of wealthy publisher [[Dimitrios Kalapothakis]]; its members included [[Ion Dragoumis]] and [[Pavlos Melas]].<ref>Konstantinos Vakalopoulos, Historia tou voreiou hellenismou, vol 2, 1990, pages 429-430</ref> The committee organized the sending of guerrilla fighters to Macedonia—the so-called ''[[Makedonomachoi]]''—during the [[Macedonian Struggle]] (1904–1908).

Following the establishment of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]], Greeks and Bulgarians were engaged in a propaganda struggle for the allegiance of the inhabitants of Macedonia. Following the abortive [[Ilinden Revolt]] in August 1903 by the Bulgarian-sponsored [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization | IMRO]], in 1903 the Macedonian Committee organized to preserve Greek interests in the region. The Bishop of [[Kastoria]], [[Germanos Karavangelis]], sent to Macedonia by the ambassador of Greece [[Nikolaos Mavrokordatos]] and the consul of Greece in [[Bitola|Monastiri]], [[Ion Dragoumis]], realised that it was time to act in a more efficient way and started organising Greek opposition. While Dragoumis concerned himself with the financial organisation of the efforts, the central figure in the military struggle was the capable [[Cretan]] officer [[Georgios Katechakis]].<ref>Bulgarian Historical Review, vol 31, 1-4, 2003, p 117 "Only a few days later -on November 1- Katehakis arrived in Macedonia as Melas' successor</ref> Bishop Germanos Karavangelis animated the Macedonian Greek population against the IMRO and formed committees to promote Greek national interests.

Taking advantage of the internal political and personal disputes in IMRO, Katechakis and Karavangelis initially succeeded in recruiting some IMRO members and in organizing guerrilla groups, which were later reinforced with people sent from Greece and thus mainly comprised ex-officers of the [[Hellenic Army]], volunteers brought from [[Crete]], from the [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] area of the Peloponnese, as well as [[Macedonian Greeks]], such as [[Evangelos Natsis]] from the village of Asprogia, Lazaros Apostolidis from [[Kastoria]], Captain Giaglis from [[Ierissos]], [[Konstantinos Christou|Konstantinos Kottas]] from [[Florina (regional unit)|Florina]] (former IMRO), [[Michael Sionidis]], Captain Ramnalis, Pantelis Papaioannou, Stefanos Papagalos from [[Veria]], Dimitrios Dalipis from [[Kastoria]], Pericles Drakos from [[Kavala]], Christos Dellios, Christos Argyrakos and many more.

The rebel fighters who fought for the Greek cause were known by the Greeks as '''Makedonomachoi''' ({{lang-gr|Μακεδονομάχοι}}; "Macedonian fighters").<ref name="BrownHamilakis2003">{{cite book|author1= Keith S.

On the other side, the fighters of IMRO and their activities appear in the book ''Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit: A Californian in the Balkan Wars'', written by [[Albert Sonnichsen]], an American volunteer in the IMRO during the Macedonian Struggle.
