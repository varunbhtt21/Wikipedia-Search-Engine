:''For the homonymous awards in West Australia, see [[West Australian Music Industry Awards]]''.

The '''MIA's''', in full '''Music Industry Awards''', are [[Flanders|Flemish]] music prizes that are awarded by the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] in collaboration with Music Centre Flanders. The prizes replace the [[Zamu Music Awards|ZAMU Award]]s, last awarded in 2006.

The abbreviation MIA is a wink to ''Mia'', a song by [[Gorki (band)|Gorki]].

== Voting procedure ==
Before the yearly show, the nominees are assigned by a broad media jury. (Music) journalists from both popular and specialized magazines, newspapers, radio and television participate at a preceding voting procedure in which each journalist kan indicate his/her favourite candidates per category. For each category the four candidates with the highest number of annotations receive a definitive nomination.
After the publication of the nominees, the broad public can bring out their votes for the majority of the categories. The winners of a limited number of categories are elected by professionals from the Flemish music sector. The Lifetime Achievement Award is chosen by the organizers of the MIA's.
