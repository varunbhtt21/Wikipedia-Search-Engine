==Mission==
The Society of Gilders is a non-profit [[educational organization]] devoted to the art and craft of gilding. The society's mission is to preserve traditional gilding skills and techniques, and to promote the highest standards in the practice of gilding.

==History==
A landmark event in the world of gilding took place at the [[Newark Museum]] in [[New Jersey]] during the winter of 1986. While attending a week-long gilding course hosted by the museum’s Arts Workshop, gilders met and exchanged gilding recipes, anecdotes, techniques and ethical concerns. The participants expressed a unanimous desire to extend this collaboration into an organization patterned after the ancient craftsmen’s guilds. Originally called the Guild of Gilders, the group changed their name to the Society of Gilders, welcoming fellow gilders and anyone interested in the art of gilding to join their ranks.

Today the Society of Gilders continues to grow, and the Regional Education Program continues to teach the art of gilding in many disciplines. Conferences have been held in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] (2000), [[Washington DC]] (2001, 2003, 2006 and 2008), and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] (2007 to 2013).
