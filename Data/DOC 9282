'''Peftjauawybast'''<ref name=boston>''[https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/kneeling-statuette-of-king-peftjauawybast-164372 Kneeling statuette of King Peftjauawybast]''. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</ref><ref name=K>Kitchen, op. cit., § 318-9</ref> or '''Peftjaubast''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian ruler ("king") of [[Herakleopolis Magna]] during the [[25th Dynasty]].

==Biography==
He was likely installed as governor of the town during the [[coregency]] of [[pharaoh]] [[Osorkon III]] and his son [[Takelot III]], in 754&nbsp;BCE. Some time after the death of Osorkon III, Peftjauawybast proclaimed himself king, adopting a [[royal titulary]] and starting to date monuments since his "coronation", which should have occurred in around 749&nbsp;BCE. It is possible that Takelot III permitted this behavior in exchange of his nominal loyalty. Peftjauawybast also married the princess Irbastudjanefu, a daughter of [[Rudamun]], himself brother and successor of Takelot III, thus binding himself to the [[23rd Dynasty]].<ref name=K/>

For this ruler two donation [[stele]]s are known,<ref>[[Cairo Museum|Cairo]] CG 45348; TN 11/9/21/4.</ref> both dated to his Year 10 (the highest ruling year known for him, although his presence on the ''Victory stele'' of [[Piye]] allows researchers to further expand his reign length), around 740&nbsp;BCE. The steles mention another wife, queen Tasheritenese, and two daughters, one of which, Pediamennebnesttawy,<ref>Kitchen, op. cit., Table 10</ref> was a ''Chantress of [[Amun]]''. Peftjauawybast is also attested on a golden statuette of the god [[Heryshaf]], found in Herakleopolis,<ref name=K/> and also depicted on a bronze kneeling statuette now in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] (inv.no. 1977.16).<ref name=boston/>

At the time of [[Piye]]'s campaign of conquest (729 BCE), [[Middle Egypt|Middle]] and [[Lower Egypt]] were contended by two factions: Piye and his allies/vassals, and the coalition led by the [[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|24th Dynasty]] pharaoh [[Tefnakht]]. Since Peftjauawybast was faithful to the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] king,<ref>Kitchen, op. cit., § 198</ref> Tefnakht's troops besieged Herakleopolis. Piye, however, was already marching to Lower Egypt and after capturing [[Hermopolis]] he came to help his vassal, who joyfully welcomed him.<ref>Kitchen, op. cit., § 325</ref>

Peftjauawybast appears on Piye's ''Victory stele'' unearthed at [[Jebel Barkal]], where he is depicted as one of the four "kings" submitted by the Kushite conqueror; the other were [[Osorkon IV]] of [[Tanis]], [[Iuput II]] of [[Leontopolis]] and [[Nimlot of Hermopolis]].<ref>Alan B. Lloyd (ed), ''A companion of Ancient Egypt'', vol. 1, Wiley-Blackwell 2010, p. 135.</ref>

His succession is obscure, since we have no records until the installation of [[Pediese of Herakleopolis|Pediese]] as governor of Herakleopolis in the early [[26th Dynasty]], several decades later.<ref>Kitchen, op. cit., § 108</ref>
