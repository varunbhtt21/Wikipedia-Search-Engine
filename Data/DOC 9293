The Pennsylvania Department of Education compared the SAT data of students in rural areas of Pennsylvania to students in urban areas. From 2003 to 2005, the average total SAT score for students in rural Pennsylvania was 992, while urban students averaged 1,006. During the same period, 28 percent of 11th and 12th graders in rural school districts took the exam, compared to 32 percent of urban students in the same grades. The average math and verbal scores were 495 and 497, respectively, for rural students, while urban test-takers averaged 499 and 507, respectively.

==AP Courses==
In 2013, Southern Columbia High School offered 5 [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses at a higher cost than regular courses. Students have the option of taking [[College Board]] approved courses and then taking the College Board's examination in the Spring. Students, who achieve a 3 or better on  the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Southern Columbia High School, less than 10 of the students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.<ref>PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Southern Columbia Area High School, December 2013</ref>

==Wellness policy==
Southern Columbia Area School Board established a district-wide Wellness Policy in 2006 - Policy 246.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scasd.us/do/Policy/246StudentWellness.pdf |title=Southern Columbia Area School Board Policy Manual |author=Southern Columbia Area School Board |date=June 19, 2006}}</ref> The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each public school district participating in a program authorized by the [[National School Lunch Act|Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act]] (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) "shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006." According to Southern Columbia's Plan, the Superintendent is required to annually report to the Board on the district’s compliance with law and policies related to student wellness.

The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/school_nutrition_incentive_program/7489 |title=Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the  School Nutrition Incentive, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education — Division of Food and Nutrition. |date=July 2008}}</ref> The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.

Southern Columbia Area High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch at school. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.<ref>USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012</ref> The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].<ref>Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009</ref>

In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and [[Vitamin D]].<ref>USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013</ref> In order to comply with the [[Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010]] all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/governance/legislation/Pricing_Equity_Facts.pdf |title=Food and Nutrition Service Equity in School Lunch Pricing Fact Sheet |author=United States Department of Agriculture |year=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922174202/http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/governance/legislation/Pricing_Equity_Facts.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-22 |df= }}</ref>  In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/9528/white-house-michelle-obama-lets-move-sugary-drinks-schools/ |title=White House Sets New Limits on Junk Food Ads in Schools |author=Denver Nicks |publisher=Time Magazine |date=February 25, 2014}}</ref>
