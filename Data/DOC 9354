*'''Keep''': An artist who has exhibited at the Venice Biennele and been reviewed in the New York Times. I have added various references to the article; one describes the subject as "one of Indonesia’s most radical artists", another as "Indonesia's most outstanding contemporary artist". This is sufficient for [[:WP:ARTIST]]. [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 12:27, 27 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Pretty obviously meets [[WP:GNG]] and [[WP:ARTIST]] with the New York Times review as well as inclusion in the Venice Biennial and the ''Global Feminisms'' exhibition.
