The '''Commonwealth Railways KA class''' was a class of {{whyte|2-8-0}} [[tender locomotive]]s of the [[Commonwealth Railways]], Australia. The class operated on the {{track gauge|sg}} [[Trans-Australian Railway]].

==History==
Between September 1918 and June 1920, [[Commonwealth Railways]] took delivery of 26 KA class freight locomotives built to the same design as the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]' [[New South Wales D53 class locomotive|TF class]] (later the D53 class). Six were built by [[Perry Engineering]], [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] and 20 by [[Walkers Limited]], [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]].<ref name=LOberg>{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=108}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comrails.com/cr_locos/r_ka.html#35 KA class] Chris's Commonwealth Railways Pages</ref> They were an upgraded version of the K class.

The Perry built locomotives received superheaters in 1943. Three were converted to burn oil during the [[1949 Australian coal strike|1949 coal strike]], but were converted back within months.<ref name=LOberg/>

Most survived until replaced by [[Commonwealth Railways GM class|GM class]] diesel locomotives with the last withdrawn in September 1952.<ref name=LOberg/>
