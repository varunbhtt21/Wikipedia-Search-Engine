'''''II''''' is the second album recorded by [[Seven Thorns]]. It was released on January 19, 2013 independently, and was later re-released on February 1, 2014 by the record label Sonic Revolution. Despite being the band's lead singer, Gustav Blide performed only backing vocals for the album as he was not yet ready to cover the lead singing duties at the time. Lead vocals are performed by Erik Blomkvist like on the band's previous album. 
The chorus melody of the song ''Justice'' is based on a Danish church psalm with music composed by C. Chr. Hoffmann in 1878.
