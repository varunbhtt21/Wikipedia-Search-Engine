Title : Askajamuk II
Text : '''Askajamuk II''' (died 8th-century) was the ruler of the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarezm]] from 712 to an unknown date. He was the relative and successor of [[Khusrau of Khwarezm|Khusrau]].

He was the son of king [[Azkajwar II]], who is probably identical with the Afrighid ruler Jigan or Chigan, who became a vassal of the [[Abbasids]] in 712. During the same year, an anti-Abbasid rebellion broke out in Khwarazm, which resulted in the death of Azkajwar II. Another Afrighid prince named Khusrau was shortly after put on the throne. However, the Abbasids then invaded Khwarazm and overthrew the latter and made Askajamuk II the new ruler of the kingdom. Askajamuk II was later succeeded by his son [[Sawashfan]].
