==Plot==
Upon watching the news about the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|miners' strike]], gay activist [[Mark Ashton]] realises that the police have stopped harassing the gay community because their attention is elsewhere. He spontaneously arranges a bucket collection for the miners during the [[Pride London|Gay Pride Parade in London]]. Encouraged by the success, he founds "[[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]]". Among its first members are 20-year old closeted student Joe Cooper and an older gay couple Gethin and Jonathan, whose bookshop they use as headquarters.

LGSM faces opposition from the mining community who do not wish to associate with them, as well as within the gay community who feel that the miners have mistreated them in the past. Frustrated by the lack of response, the activists instead decide to take their donations directly to a small mining village named [[Onllwyn]] in [[Wales]]. Dai Donovan, spokesperson for the miners in Onllwyn, comes to London to meet their new allies. Though he is startled by the revelation of what "L" and "G" stand for in their name, he expresses his gratitude in a short, eloquent speech at a gay bar and the cause takes off.

In Onllwyn, the Women's Support group led by [[Hefina Headon]] and Maureen Barry debate whether to invite LGSM to the village as a thank you; Hefina's camp favours gratitude from all camps, whilst Maureen's camp considers the gays abhorrent. First-time volunteer [[Siân James (politician)|Siân James]] speaks up fiercely in favour of inviting LGSM and is asked to join the committee. When LGSM arrives in Onllwyn, they are met with a frosty reception and Maureen leads a walkout after Mark's speech to the village. However, the next day Jonathan shares with Siân his knowledge of harassment laws and abuse of police power; the fiery Siân marches down to the police station to demand the release of illegally detained miners. Many grateful miners acknowledge LGSM's role in their release, relations begin to thaw and the two communities quickly become close. Finding herself on the outside, Maureen contacts a tabloid about the situation in Onllwyn. The resulting story humiliates The National Union of Miners, who call a vote on whether to accept LGSM's support.

Back in London, Mark declares that they will embrace the labels in the tabloid and throws an enormous concert at the [[Electric Ballroom]] headlined by [[Bronski Beat]], attended by Dai, Hefina and a number of the women from the village. Mark is badly shaken when he encounters a former lover who advises that he is terminal with AIDS. The festival "Pits and Perverts" raises thousands of pounds for Onllwyn, but the Union vote moves forward three hours without notice, and without Dai or Hefina, Maureen's camp succeeds in voting to refuse further help from LGSM. Disillusioned and haunted, Mark abandons LGSM. Gethin, who initially refused to participate due to his own experience coming out in a mining village, attempts to campaign alone and is violently assaulted and hospitalised. Joe is outed when his parents find photos from Onllwyn and he is kept away from the group.

In March 1985, the Miners' Strike is over. The miners of Onllwyn gather to go back into the mines. Joe sees the news and sneaks off to Onllwyn to show solidarity, where he encounters Mark. Mark confronts Joe about hiding his activism and homosexuality from his parents. When Siân drives Joe home in the LGSM donated van, humiliating his conservative family, Joe decides to leave home.

On the morning of the 1985 Gay Pride Parade, Mark returns to the group and apologises for abandoning the cause. He leads LGSM to the Parade, where they are joined by hundreds of miners in a show of solidarity. The closing scenes reveal that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] incorporated rights for gays and lesbians in their party programme under pressure from the National Union of Mineworkers, Siân was later elected to Parliament and that Mark Ashton died of AIDS two years later.

===Controversies===
In the UK the film received a [[15 (British Board of Film Classification)|15 certificate]] by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] for "occasional strong language" and two scenes of a sexual nature,<ref name="Independent ratings" /> one scene in a gay club where men are depicted "wearing 'bondage' clothing",<ref name="Independent ratings" /> and a comedic scene where some of the characters discover a pornographic magazine in a bedroom.<ref name="Independent ratings" /> The [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] gave the film an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]], the nearest US equivalent to the UK's 15 certificate. (This reflects common practice; the [[British Film Institute]] states that "most" 15 certificate films are R-rated in the US.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brooke|first1=Michael|title=The US Ratings System|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/594087/|website=BFI Screenonline|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>) ''[[The Independent]]'' published an article calling the MPAA's rating "draconian",<ref name="Independent ratings">{{cite news|last=Burrell|first=Ian|title=Pride: Are US film censors pandering to homophobia?|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=30 September 2014|accessdate=3 October 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/pride-are-censors-pandering-to-homophobia-9765935.html}}</ref> alleging that the R rating's higher age restriction ("no unaccompanied under-17s") was specifically applied due to gay content. ''The Independent''{{'}}s article formed the basis for a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article<ref name="Guardian ratings">{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=US censors accused of homophobia over restrictive Pride rating|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2 October 2014|accessdate=3 October 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/pride-us-censors-accused-of-homophobia}}</ref> which further compounded the issue by mistakenly stating that the MPAA had given the film an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X replaced by NC-17|NC-17 rating]]. This error was corrected a few days later.

In January 2015, it was reported that the cover of the US DVD release of the film makes no mention of the gay content. A standard description of "a London-based group of gay and lesbian activists" was reduced to "a group of London-based activists", and a lesbian and gay banner was removed from a photograph on the back cover.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30679455 BBC News: Gay banner removed from Pride DVD cover in US, 5 January 2015]</ref>

Geoffrey Macnab, of ''[[The Independent]]'', noted how ''Pride'' followed on from other British films such as ''[[The Full Monty]]'', ''[[Brassed Off]]'' and ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' as "a story set in a Britain whose industrial base is being shattered".<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|last=Macnab|first=Geoffrey|title=Pride, film review: Two tribes and plenty of nostalgia in this feelgood hit|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/pride-film-review-two-tribes-and-plenty-of-nostalgia-in-this-feelgood-hit-9727720.html}}</ref> Macnab, who gave the film a five-star review, praised the screenplay for combining "broad comedy with subtle observation" and noted that director [[Matthew Warchus]] "relishes visual contrasts and jarring juxtapositions" throughout the film.<ref name="Independent" /> Macnab's review stated that ''Pride'' retained its humour and accessibility without trivialising the issues addressed in the film.

[[Peter Bradshaw]], reviewing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', described the film as "impassioned and lovable".<ref name="Bradshaw">{{cite news|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Bradshaw|title=Pride review – when gay activists struck a deal with miners|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=11 September 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/pride-film-review-miners-strike-gay-people-1984}}</ref> Bradshaw praised performances of the cast, including [[Bill Nighy]]'s "taciturn shyness" in his portrayal as Cliff and the "dignified and intelligent performance" from [[Paddy Considine]] as Dai.<ref name="Bradshaw" /> [[Imelda Staunton]]'s performance as Hefina Headon, who died in October 2013,<ref name="South Wales Evening Post">{{cite news|last=Moses-Lloyd|first=Rachel|title=Screen star Imelda Staunton to immortalise miners' supporter, Hefina Headon, in film about strike|work=[[South Wales Evening Post]]|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=14 September 2014|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Screen-star-Imelda-Staunton-immortalise-miners/story-19950199-detail/story.html}}</ref> was met with positive reviews by critics. Geoffrey Macnab said Staunton's performance as the matriarchal Hefina was "part [[Mother Courage]] and part [[Hilda Ogden]]".<ref name="Independent" /> [[Ben Schnetzer]]'s performance as [[Mark Ashton]] drew positive reviews. Charlotte O'Sullivan, writing for the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', said: "Schnetzer is a New Yorker with an unpromising CV (he was one of the few good things about ''[[The Book Thief (film)|The Book Thief]]'') and he's fantastic here".<ref name="ES">{{cite news|last=O'Sullivan|first=Charlotte|title=Pride - film review: 'Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton escape national treasure status to show us something new'|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/film/pride--film-review-bill-nighy-and-imelda-staunton-escape-national-treasure-status-and-show-us-something-new-9728351.html}}</ref>

Paul Byrnes in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' described the film as "dry, surprising, compassionate, politically savvy, emotionally rewarding and stacked to the gills with great actors doing solid work".<ref name=Byrnes>{{cite news|last1=Byrnes|first1=Paul|title=Pride review: Gays add flair in feel-good miners-strike flick |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pride-review-gays-add-flair-in-feelgood-minersstrike-flick-20141029-11cy2s.html|accessdate=8 December 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=29 October 2014}}</ref>
