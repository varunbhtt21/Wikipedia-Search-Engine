'''''Detektor''''' is a Sweden-based [[trade magazine]] focusing on the [[security]] industry. The magazine has two editions: '''Detektor Scandinavia''', for Scandinavian countries and '''Detektor International''', for the international audience.

==History==
In 1990 the security publisher AR Media International AB was founded and launched ''Detektor''. At that time ''Detektor'' was published exclusively in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. In 1999, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] edition was established and one year later ''Detektor International'' was introduced with a target audience of the security market in [[Europe]], [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]. Shortly after that Detektor Sweden and Detektor Norway were merged into a single trilingual magazine called ''Detektor Scandinavia'' which also includes the [[Denmark|Danish]] market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armedia.se/en/aboutcompany_companyhistory.asp|title=Company history|work=armedia.se}}</ref>

By 2005 ''Detektor'' was the most well known and widely read printed security media in both [[Europe, Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and the [[Nordic countries]] according to a report by [[IMS Research]].<ref>McManus, James (2005). "Security Media Brand Awareness Survey 2005". IMS Research. s. 12-13</ref> Two years later Detektor's founder and [[editor-in-chief]] Lennart Alexandrie was awarded the [[Hans Wermdalens säkerhetsstipendium]], by the Swedish security trade association Swesec and the educational company Företagsuniversitetet, for the establishment of Detektor and the [[online publication]] ''SecurityWorldMarket.com'' (then called ''SecurityWorldHotel.com'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swesec.se.test.tyr.nonea.se/index.html?p=18&nid=26|title=Hans Wermdalens säkerhetsstipendium 2008|work=swesec.se|language=sv|access-date=2015-08-21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150709210819/http://www.swesec.se.test.tyr.nonea.se/index.html?p=18&nid=26|archive-date=2015-07-09|dead-url=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securityuser.com/se/news.asp?newsType=6&newsid=8073|title=Alexandrie och Alm fick Hans Wermdalens Säkerhetsstipendium|work=securityuser.com|language=sv}}</ref>
