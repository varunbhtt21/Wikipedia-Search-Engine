:({{Find sources|Lacostian view}})
This has remained an orphaned, unsourced stub of one sentence not explaining anything for nearly nine years. Short Google and Google Books searches come up with zero results not related to this article. With many works of [[Yves Lacoste]] not been translated into English and taking his generally huge influence on that field of study into account, I'd say there probably is something that might be dubbed a 'Lacostian approach to [[geopolitics]]', but still, to merit an article there would be the need to show that it couldn't be covered within the existing articles on Lacoste and geopolitics. Article had [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lacostian_view&oldid=150719376 been tagged for proposed deletion] in 2007, but the proposal was removed by the article's creator.

*'''Redirect''' to [[Yves Lacoste]] - since this subject is related to him, and this article is not developed. It would be hard to find anything on Lacostian view, if it exists. There's [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/geography-terminology-books-llc/1102444262?ean=9781157599449 this], but it looks like other books taken from a wiki, though it doesn't say so. - [[User:Sidelight12|Sidelight]][[Special:Contributions/Sidelight12|<span style="color:#008504">12</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Sidelight12|Talk]]</sup> 12:37, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' as suggested and [[WP:CHEAP]].  We have resorted to redirecting one stub to another when the main topic is notable, but not individual concepts. [[User:Bearian|Bearian]] ([[User talk:Bearian|talk]]) 14:58, 21 May 2014 (UTC)
