'''''Didier''''' is a French [[comedy film]] directed by [[Alain Chabat]], released in 1997. The director received a [[César Award for Best Debut]] in 1998.

== Plot ==
Jean-Pierre, a soccer agent, has agreed to keep Didier, the dog of friend and film journalist Annabelle. During the night, the [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] is transformed into a human, at least in appearance, but Didier is still a dog psychologically. Confronted by Richard, the boss of the soccer club that hires him, Jean-Pierre did not need another problem in addition to the ones from his famous soccer players, Fabrice and Baco, both injured only one week before a very important match against the [[Paris Saint-Germain]]. Didier is going to help him and replace the injured players. But the real mission of Didier is to reconcile Jean-Pierre and his girlfriend Maria.
