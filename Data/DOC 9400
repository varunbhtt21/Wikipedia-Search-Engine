Not notable blogger, searched for sources but found nothing, sources I found were removed - [[User:Mosfetfaser|Mosfetfaser]] ([[User talk:Mosfetfaser|talk]]) 18:40, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' -- fails [[WP:BIO]].  It works out, strangely, that the nomination is correct even though the person nominating it is the same person who just created it.  (Also despite the failure of logic: "I didn't find any sources, and I'm annoyed that the ones I've found are being deleted").

*'''Comment''' -- I was trying to help out User:Mosfetfaser with formatting the stub. Nuccitelli is pretty well-known in the climate blogosphere, but  I think it would be hard to make a good case for his wiki-notability. --[[User:Tillman|Pete Tillman]] ([[User talk:Tillman|talk]]) 19:02, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' -- Maybe you could help the contributor for a speedy deletion. Regards. --[[User:Why should I have a User Name?|Why should I have a User Name?]] ([[User talk:Why should I have a User Name?|talk]]) 19:04, 26 April 2014 (UTC)
