The band were signed to [[RCA Records]] in 1977, and released three singles between 1977 and 1978, the debut "Witchfire" hitting number 14 in the Dutch charts.<ref name=Witchfire_Top40>{{cite web|title=Witchfire Top 40 Hit|url=http://www.top40.nl/bardot/bardot-witchfire_18794#songtekst|website=Top40.nl|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=Witchfire_Top40_detail>{{cite web|title=Witchfire Chart Position 14|url=http://www.top40.nl/pdf/1978/tipparade-19780701.pdf|website=Top40.nl|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> During 1977 Bardot supported [[Bonnie Tyler]] and her band in concert, and on 2 August performed "Eagle Road" and "Rockin in Rhythm" on The Elaine Simmons TV Show in Scotland.

==The Heroes 1979–1981==
Formed in 1979, with Bradford and Mark Hankins on guitar and vocals, [[The Heroes (band)|The Heroes]] line-up was completed by Pete Lennon (lead guitar), Dave Powell (drums) and ex-Randy band-member Brian (Wally) Wallis on bass guitar. Their musical style combined pop / rock ballads and boogie.

Although primarily a recording group, they undertook a tour of Germany playing the Olympianhalle in Munich, the [[Top Ten Club]] in Hamburg and a show in Berlin. In this show, the truck carrying the group's instruments did not stop and continued into Poland, forcing the group to use the equipment belonging to the band they were touring with, [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]].

The Heroes signed with [[Polydor Records]] in 1979, and recorded an album of ten songs, ''Border Raiders''<ref name = "Heroes BR" /> also produced by [[Pip Williams]] in 1980, plus a single "Some Kind of Women" b/w "10% Will Do".
