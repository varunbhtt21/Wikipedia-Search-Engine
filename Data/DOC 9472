== Samtengang Central School at a glance ==
Samtengang Central School was initially established in 1962 as a [[Hindi]] medium community school and consisted of only a few temporary huts. The first Headmaster, appointed by the then Department of Education, was Mr. M.M.Joseph who managed the school along with two [[Dzongkha]] lopens (teachers). The oldest infrastructure, which is now a part of the primary school, was constructed in 1964.

In March 1998, the school was upgraded to a Lower Secondary with the construction of boarding facilities. Classes ranged from PP (pre-primary) to VIII. The same year, a new 12 unit building was constructed near the lake which is now referred to as the 'Old Block.'
The school upgraded to a Middle Secondary School in 2008, the same year as Bhutan's adoption of a democratic parliamentary system. Classes PP to 6 were allocated to a new location, now serving as [[Samtengang Primary School]]. Classes IX and X were subsequently added to the school, forming the current class range.

The school has students from [[Phobjikha]], [[Nobding]], [[Khotokha]], [[Kazhi Gewog]], [[Phangyul]], [[Gangteng Gewog]], [[Nyisho Gewog]], and other places. The school has a total area of approximately 20 acres.
Samtengang Central School (SCS) is located in [[Nyishog Gewog]], [[Wangduephodrang]] Dzongkhag, Bhutan.

Sitting atop a mountain plateau, [[Samtengang]] has an encompassing view of Wangdue town, Phung Yul, and Kazhi. The campus includes a beautiful lake that is home to various species of fish as well as avian wildlife.
