Non-notable web content. Was speedy'd twice before when created by {{U|Shifat2sadi}} -- this time, it got re-posted by another user and Shifat2sadi removed the CSD tag, so by the rules we need to go through AfD.

*'''Delete''' - This [[WP:PROMO]] stuff fails [[WP:GNG]]. It should be speedy deleted instead, as per CSD#G11 combined with CSD#A7.
