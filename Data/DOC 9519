Wilkinson was the landlord of a house named Rooksnest near Chesfield Park, on Weston Road, [[Stevenage]], rented between 1883 and 1893 by the author [[E. M. Forster]] and his mother Lily. They had to leave, unwillingly, when the Poyntz Stewarts, to whom the property had passed, wished it vacated.<ref name="Heath2008">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey M.
