'''Clonmoyle West''' is a [[townland]] within both the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] and catholic [[parish]] of [[Aghabullogue]], [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]]. It is 774.06 acres in size, situate east of [[Aghabullogue]] village, and north-west of [[Coachford]] village.

It is referred to as 'Clonmoile' in the Down Survey (Muskerry) map,<ref>{{cite web|title=Down Survey map 1656-8, (Barony of Muskery)|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Muskerry&c=Cork&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> and 'Clonmolye' with arable and course pasture land in the Down Survey (Parishes of Ahabollog and Aghinagh) map, with the terrier naming the proprietor as an Irish [[papist]], Cormack MacCallaghan Carthy of the 'denomination of Clonmoyle', consisting of three [[ploughland]]s and ''c''. 1521 acres considered 'entirely profitable'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Down Survey map 1656-8 (Ahabollog and Aghinagh)|url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Muskerry&c=Cork&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1&p=Ahabollog+and+Aghinagh|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> The present combined acreage of Clonmoyle West with the adjoining townland of [[Clonmoyle East]] is ''c''. 1530 acres.

The Ordnance Survey name book (''c''. 1840) describes the townland as situated in the east of [[Aghabullogue]] parish about seven miles east-north-east of [[Macroom]]. It was said to be the property of 'Chas (S) Oliver, Esqre', and of mixed quality, good and inferior, partially cultivated, and with much boggy land. Two 'Danish forts' ([[ringfort]]s) were located in the townland. Local placenames included the Dele[h]inagh River, Shanavough, [[Clonmoyle Racecourse]], [[Clonmoyle House West]] and [[Ballinadihy Bridge]]. The mid-nineteenth century Primary Land Valuation ([[Griffith's Valuation]]) indicates 'Silver Charles Oliver' as the immediate lessor of ''c''. 662 acres in Clonmoyle West, being approximately 86% of the entire townland area.

A number of interpretations of 'Clonmoyle' can be found. The Ordnance Survey name book (''c''. 1840) suggests an [[Irish language]] version of ''Cluain Maoile'' meaning 'meadow of the hornless cow'. O'Donoghue (1986) suggests an Irish version of ''Cluain Mhaoil'', meaning 'bare or bleak watershed', or possibly ''Cluain Maothaile'' meaning 'soft or spongy watershed'.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Donoghue, B.|title=Parish histories and place names of west Cork|year=1986|location=Kerryman Ltd.}}</ref>  O'Murchú (1991) suggests ''Cluain Mhaol'' as meaning 'the bare meadow'.<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Murchú, M.|title=Place names of the parish of Aghabullogue|journal=Coachford Record|date=Dec 1991|volume= 2}}</ref>  The Placenames Database of Ireland gives an Irish name of ''Cluain Maol Thiar'' to the townland, with cluain meaning 'meadow' or 'pasture', and maol meaning 'bare' or 'flat-topped hillock', .<ref>{{cite web|title=Placenames Database of Ireland|url=http://logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=clonmoyle+west&streets=yes|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

At the northern end of the townland is an area known as 'Shanavough'. The OS name book describes it as a sub-denomination of Clonmoyle West and 'situated in the north-west part of the townland ... about 50 chains ({{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}) north from Aghabologue Chapel'. An Irish version of ''Seana bhoth'', is given, meaning 'the old booth or tent'. O'Donoghue (1986) describes Shanavough as located in the northern end of the townland, and suggests an Irish version of ''Seana Mhacha'', meaning 'old enclosure or milking place'.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Donoghue, B.|title=Parish histories and place names of west Cork|year=1986|location=Kerryman Ltd.}}</ref>

Townlands vary greatly in size, being territorial divisions within parishes in Ireland. Extensively used for land surveys, censuses and polling systems since the seventeenth century, townlands have also been used as the basis for rural postal addresses. In County Cork, surveying and standardisation of townland names and boundaries by the [[Ordnance Survey]] during the mid-nineteenth century, resulted in some earlier townland names disappearing, due to amalgamation or division. The townlands resulting from such surveys were employed during the Primary Land Valuation ([[Griffith's Valuation]]), subsequent censuses, and continue in use today.
