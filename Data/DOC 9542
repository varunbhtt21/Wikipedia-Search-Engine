==Plot==
Carroll Baker plays a dual role in this film, two identical twins named Julie and Mary. While in Holland, Julie begins receiving threats from some mysterious men who attempt to kidnap her, and one of them menaces her while wearing a gorilla mask. They are confusing her with her twin sister Mary in London, who apparently stole a massive diamond from a Maheraja and even betrayed her own husband Craig who was in on the heist. A race car driver named Tony (George Hilton) saves Julie from being kidnapped and hides her out in an apartment owned by an old blind woman, who is later found murdered. Luciano Pigozzi plays an insurance investigator who is searching for the diamond.
