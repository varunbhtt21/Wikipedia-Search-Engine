Title : Template:WPPhysiology welcome
Text : ==Welcome to Wikipedia from the [[WP:Physiology|Physiology Wikiproject]]!==
'''Welcome to Wikipedia from [[WP:Physiology|Wikiproject Physiology]]'''! We're a group of editors who strive to improve the quality of physiology articles here on Wikipedia. One of our members has noticed that you are involved in editing physiology articles; it's great to have a new interested editor on board. In your wiki-voyages, a few things that may be relevant to editing wikipedia articles are:
[[File:Eye dilate-thumb 180px.gif|180px|thumbnail|left|[[Physiology]] gives us an understanding of how and why things in the field of [[WP:MED|medicine]] happen. Together, let us see the project through.]]
* '''Thanks for coming aboard!''' We always appreciate a new editor. Feel free to leave us a message at any time [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physiology|on the WikiProject Physiology talk page]]. If you are interested in joining the project yourself, there is a [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Physiology#Participants|participant list]] where you can sign up. Please leave a message on the talk page if you have any problems, suggestions, would like review of an article, need suggestions for articles to edit, or would like some collaboration when editing!
* You will make a '''big difference''' to the quality of information by adding '''[[WP:MEDRS|reliable sources]]'''. Sourcing physiology articles is essential and makes a big difference to the quality of articles. And, while you're at it, why not use a [[book]] to source information, which can source multiple articles at once!
* Physiology related articles are often large in scope, have many available sources, and a lot of research available. When editing, there's no need to work alone. Why not drop us a message '''[[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physiology|on our talk page]]''' for advice or interested collaborators?
* Lastly, why not try and strive to create a '''[[WP:GA|good article]]'''! The [[WP:GARC|good article criteria]] represent a degree of broadness, verifiability and readability that we hope all articles can one day meet or exceed.

Feel free to contact us [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physiology|on the WikiProject Physiology talk page]] if you have any problems, wish to join us, or are looking for collaborators on certain topics. I wish you all the best on your wiki-voyages!
