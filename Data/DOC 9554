A wealthy speedboat racer named Marco suffers a boat accident and must get brain surgery, after which he loses his memory and is cared for by his wife Monica, his business partner Tommy, and a young girl named Terry. Marco develops a relationship with Terry, which infuriates his wife. Murders begin occurring around the estate. Monica gets shot dead while fighting with Terry, and Terry talks Marco into disposing of Monica's body at sea. His partner Tommy and the gardener of the estate are both murdered next, then the gardener's mother. Later, Marco's dead wife Monica reappears from the dead, and Marco drives his car off a cliff in a panic. The whole thing appears to have been a plot between Monica and Marco's other partner (Burt) to get rid of Marco, but when Monica realizes that Terry and Burt are lovers, she shoots themn both dead. But Monica, now alone, becomes the prey of a stalking killer wearing black gloves.<ref>Luther-Smith,Adrian (1999). ''Blood and Black Lace: The Definitive Guide to Italian Sex and Horror Movies''.
