Aslam Azhar was born in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] as a son of a government servant during [[British Raj]]. He studied law at Cambridge University and later worked for the Burmah Oil Company. He was also interested in theater, and met his wife Nasreen Jan through a theater group.<ref name="dawn"/> Meanwhile, Pakistani government wanted to set up a television service in the country. The Japanese were given the contract to set up a pilot television station in Lahore. Aslam Azhar was asked to come to Lahore from Karachi and start the television station in Lahore. He convinced the renowned writers [[Ashfaq Ahmed]] and Anwar Sajjad to write for television. [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], his favorite poet, became his friend, too. Surrounded by legendary literary figures and great actors, musicians and singers, Aslam Azhar created an environment for great television in 1964. He said that, in those days, commitment counted. Those people were committed and devoted. It was a very cultured society. But over the years, like everywhere else in the world, Pakistan had become a consumer society and television plays a consumer product. He had a reputation of being honest to the core and respected by all at [[Pakistan Television]].<ref name="dawn"/>

In 2016, one of the major English-language Pakistani newspaper commented, "He was one of the founding fathers of Pakistan Television (PTV) &ndash; the title not merely an empty slogan. When the medium came to Pakistan in 1964, Azhar spearheaded its evolution, and did not make his exit before making PTV a dynamic broadcasting institution."<ref name=Dawn/>

Another Pakistani veteran bureaucrat [[Roedad Khan]] said, 'I called Aslam Azhar, who was general manager at the time, and said I don't know much about television but I want to learn. I learnt a lot from him. Before the 1970 elections, we decided to cover the elections live. Even though the technology wasn't advanced enough, and the engineers had no experience with it, we did it."<ref name=Dawn/>

"Leaders such as [[Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan]], [[Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rehman]], [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and others were given the opportunity to speak live." Roedad Khan said in his tribute to Aslam Azhar at the event.<ref name=Dawn/>
