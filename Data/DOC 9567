'''St. Mary's Church''' ({{lang-sv|Mariakyrkan}}) is a [[Lutheran]] church in [[Sigtuna]], not far from [[Stockholm]], Sweden. It belongs to the [[Archdiocese of Uppsala]]. 

==History==

The church was built by the [[Dominican order]] as their convent church, and construction began in the 1230s. The church was inaugurated in 1247, but was probably not finished until 1255, when [[Jarler]], [[Archbishop of Uppsala]],  was entombed in the church.<ref name=raa>{{cite web |url= http://kulturarvsdata.se/raa/bbr/html/21300000004645|title= Sigtuna kn, SIGTUNA 2:41 MARIAKYRKAN|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= Swedish National Heritage Board|language=Swedish|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

The Dominicans had tried to establish a presence in the city earlier, but had not succeeded.<ref name=visit>{{cite web |url= http://destinationsigtuna.se/sevardhet/mariakyrkan|title=Mariakyrkan|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= Visit Sigtuna|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>The church was built as part of a larger monastic complex. Of this convent nothing remains today; it was closed during the [[Swedish Reformation|Reformation]] and the bricks used as building materials, e.g. at [[Svartsjö Palace]] and [[Venngarn Castle]]. The church is the only medieval church in Sigtuna to have survived the Reformation; the city has an additional three medieval church ruins.<ref name=raa/>

During the 1280s, the church was expanded and partly remade. No major alterations were then made of the church until a renovation in 1904-05. The church was again renovated and upgrade between 1966-1971 under the direction of architects Bengt Romares  (1902–1968) and  Jerk Alton .

==Architecture==
It is a fine example of [[Brick Gothic]] architecture.
The church is built of [[brick]] in a transitional style, between [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. It is the earliest known brick church in the area around [[Lake Mälaren]]. The church is built as a [[hall church]] with two [[aisle]]s and a central [[nave (architecture)|nave]]. The church lacks an [[apse]] and to the east finishes in a straight wall. Internally, it was decorated with [[fresco]]s, some of which are medieval and some of which are reproductions from the 1904-05 renovation. Externally, the façade is decorated with [[blind arch]]es.<ref name=raa/>
