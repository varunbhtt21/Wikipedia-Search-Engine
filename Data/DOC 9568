==Plot==

A family goes to a British estate to hear the reading of a will and while there they are murdered one by one. An early victim is the butler, played by [[Ballard Berkeley]], whose character speaks in a very different voice to Berkeley's normal voice.

The murders are investigated by a Scotland Yard detective, played by [[Lance Percival]], and a local Police Sergeant, played by [[Gastone Moschin]], who is probably best known to English-speakers as the white-suited [[Don Fanucci]] from [[The Godfather Part II]].

The film was set and filmed on location at [[Somerleyton Hall]], both for interior and exterior shots. There are also several scenes at [[Somerleyton railway station]].
