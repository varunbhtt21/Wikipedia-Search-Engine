[[File:Descriptive Zoopraxography Athlete, Running Long Jump Animated 13.gif|250px|thumbnail|left|[[Physiology]] gives us an understanding of how and why things in the field of [[WP:MED|medicine]] happen. Together, let us jumpstart the project and get it going. Our energy is all it needs.]]
Based on the long-felt gap for categorization and improvement of [[WP:MED]] articles relating to the field of [[physiology]], the new [[WP:WikiProject Physiology|WikiProject Physiology]] has been created. '''WikiProject Physiology''' is still in its infancy and needs your help. On behalf of a group of editors striving to improve the quality of physiology articles here on Wikipedia, I would like to invite you to come on board and participate in the betterment of physiology related articles. Help us to jumpstart this WikiProject.
* Feel free to leave us a message at any time [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physiology|on the WikiProject Physiology talk page]].  If you are interested in joining the project yourself, there is a [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Physiology#Participants|participant list]] where you can sign up. Please leave a message on the talk page if you have any problems, suggestions, would like review of an article, need suggestions for articles to edit, or would like some collaboration when editing!
* You can tag the talk pages of relevant articles with '''<nowiki>{{WikiProject Physiology|class=|importance=}}</nowiki>''' with your assessment of the article class and importance. Please note that '''WP:Physiology''', '''WP:Physio''', '''WP:Phy''' can be used interchangeably.
* You will make a '''big difference''' to the quality of information by adding '''[[WP:MEDRS|reliable sources]]'''. Sourcing physiology articles is essential and makes a big difference to the quality of articles. And, while you're at it, why not use a [[book]] to source information, which can source multiple articles at once!
* We try and use a '''standard way of arranging the content''' in each article. '''[[:Wikipedia:MEDMOS#Physiology|That layout is here]].''' These headings let us have a standard way of presenting the information in anatomical articles, indicate what information may have been forgotten, and save angst when trying to decide how to organise an article. That said, this might not suit every article. If in doubt, '''[[WP:BRD|be bold]]'''!
* Why not try and strive to create a '''[[WP:GA|good article]]'''! Physiology related articles are often small in scope, have available sources, and only a limited amount of research available that is readily presentable!
* Your contributions to the WikiProject page, related categories and templates is also welcome.
* To invite other editors to this WikiProject, copy and past this template (with the signature):
** '''{{tlsx|WP Physiology–invite}}''' <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>
* To welcome new editors of physiology articles, copy and past this template (with the signature):
** '''{{tlsx|WP Physiology–welcome}}''' <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>
* You can feel free to contact us '''[[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physiology|on the WikiProject Physiology talk page]]''' if you have any problems, or wish to join us. You can also put your suggestions there and discuss the scope of participation.

Hoping for your cooperation!
