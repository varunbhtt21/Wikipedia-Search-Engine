== Synopsis ==   
Two pornography-peddling hippies from Italy (Richard and Ingrid) run out of material to sell, so they start taking "dirty pictures" of each other to add to their stock of smut. While on the run from the authorities in Sweden, the pair get invited to the home of a middle-aged woman named Barbara, the wife of a NATO colonel. She involves them first in sexual games, then later in a convoluted murder plot. It seems Barbara has murdered her husband and hidden the body in the trunk of her car, and she gets the idea to frame the two hippies for the crime.<ref>Luther-Smith,Adrian (1999).

''Blood and Black Lace: The Definitive Guide to Italian Sex and Horror Movies''. Stray Cat Publishing Ltd. p. 82</ref> Lead actor Ray Lovelock sings a song called "How Can You Live Your Life?" over the opening titles, accompanied by a [[sitar]]; a song that reoccurs throughout the film in different versions, supposedly with the purpose of trying to capture the "feel" of the [[1960s Counterculture|1960s hippie scene]].<ref>Luther-Smith,Adrian (1999).
