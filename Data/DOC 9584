==Plot==
A rich young man named Frank (Jean Sorel), who lives off his father, is shot in a parking garage and as he lays bleeding, he thinks back over recent past events in his life. While vacationing in Morocco with his beautiful 19-year-old girlfriend Lucia (Ewa Aulin), Frank became jealous of her interest in a young American traveler named Eddie (Sergio Doria). Frank later develops a fixation on the girl's pretty mother Nora (Lucia Bose) and forces her physically into having sex with him. Later he follows Nora back to Rome, where he becomes convinced that now she is having relations with the young American Eddie. He later finds Eddie murdered in Nora's apartment, and thinking that she killed him, he tries to protect her by disposing of the corpse. But then he finds out Nora wasn't even in Rome when the murder occurred! Frank has to find out who killed Eddie and if perhaps his girlfriend Lucia was involved.
