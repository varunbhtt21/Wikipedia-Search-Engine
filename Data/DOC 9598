==Biography==
He was born in [[Paris]] and entered the noviciate in 1734. Floquet taught grammar and the classics at [[Quimper]] and studied theology at the Jesuit [[Prytanée National Militaire|Collège de La Flèche]]. He came to Canada in 1744, where he taught at the [[Collège Saint-Charles-Garnier|Jesuit college]] in Quebec. Floquet spent two years as a missionary at [[Kahnawake]]<ref name="cdob"/> and took his vows as a priest in 1752.<ref name="american"/> He served as bursar for the college at [[Quebec City]] until 1757, when he became superior for the Jesuits at [[Montreal]].<ref name="cdob"/> Although the Jesuit order was suppressed by [[Pope Clement XIV]] in 1773, the order continued to operate in Canada.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WQCAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA163 |title=The Battle for the Fourteenth Colony: America's War of Liberation in Canada, 1774-1776 |page=163 |last=Anderson |first=Mark R |year=2013 |publisher=University Press of New England |isbn=978-1-61168-497-1}}</ref>

After Montreal was captured by the Americans in 1775, his interactions with the invading forces compromised him in the eyes of the British and of bishop [[Jean-Olivier Briand|Briand]]. Floquet allowed John Carroll, a Jesuit priest and the cousin of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Charles Carroll]], to perform mass in his church. He also had expressed opposition to the [[Quebec Act]], had given the sacraments to people who had joined the American forces and had dined with American Colonel [[Moses Hazen]]. After being placed under an [[interdict]] by the bishop, Floquet expressed regret for not following the Briand's instructions to remain loyal to the British cause.<ref name="american">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m-4OAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA63 |title=The American Catholic Historical Researches |pages=63–67 |volume=Volumes 2-5 |last2=Griffin |first2=William Leo Joseph |last=Griffin |first=Martin Ignatius Joseph |year=1885}}</ref>
