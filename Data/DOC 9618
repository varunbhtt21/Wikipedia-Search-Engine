The '''Commonwealth Railways C class''' was a class of {{whyte|4-6-0}} passenger locomotives built in 1938 by [[Walkers Limited]], [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], for the [[Commonwealth Railways]], Australia.

==History==
Following the extension of Commonwealth Railways' standard gauge line from [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]] to [[Port Pirie Junction railway station|Port Pirie]] in 1937, and with increasing loads being hauled on the [[Trans-Australian Railway]], an order was placed with [[Walkers Limited]], [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] for eight 4-6-0 passenger locomotives to the same design as the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]' [[New South Wales C36 class locomotive|C36 class]], but with higher capacity tenders.<ref name=LOberg>{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=164}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comrails.com/cr_locos/r_c.html#62 C class] Chris's Commonwealth Railways Pages</ref>

All were delivered between January and April 1938. The new locomotives were able to shave 10 hours off the journey time of the ''[[Trans Australian]]''. Four were converted to burn oil during the [[1949 Australian coal strike|1949 coal strike]], being converted back to coal burning after the strike ended.<ref name=LOberg/>

With the arrival of the [[Commonwealth Railways GM class|GM class]] diesels, the first was withdrawn in January 1952 and by early 1953 only two remained. The last was withdrawn in September 1957. The locomotives were scrapped, but the tenders were converted into water carriers for use on the Commonwealth Railways weed killer train, still being in use in the early 1980s.<ref name=LOberg/>
