'''''Amuck!''''' ({{lang-it|Alla ricerca del piacere|lit=In Pursuit of Pleasure}}) is an Italian [[giallo film|''giallo'' film]] directed by [[Silvio Amadio]].<ref name="archiv" />

== Plot ==
Greta, a beautiful blonde American, is the new secretary to Richard Stuart, a famous novelist who lives on an island with his sexy wife Eleanora. Sally, the former secretary, had disappeared without a trace. What Richard and Eleanora do not know is that Greta has a secret motive for taking the job: to find out what happened to her lost lover, Sally.<ref>http://www.cultaction.com/film-catalog/giallo/amuck-1972-dvd/</ref>

Greta learns that Sally was accidentally killed in the heat of passion during one of the kinky sex games the Stuarts hold in their mansion from time to time; a hulking man-brute named Rocco lost control and strangled the girl. The bizarre couple then kill their butler when he attempts to blackmail them over the incident. All that remains is for Greta to be disposed of, then the crimes will never be uncovered. Eleanora lures Sally into a three-way private orgy with Rocco and herself, in an attempt to get the easily excited Rocco to repeat his careless crime of passion, one last time.
