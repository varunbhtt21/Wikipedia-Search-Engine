The subject of this article is not [[WP:N|notable]] (notability is not inherited) and the article itself is a [[WP:IINFO|huge list of trivia]] and an instance of copyright violation of one source.

Wikiquote might accept this article, however. (Although copyright violation might still be a problem.) [[User:Codename Lisa|Codename Lisa]] ([[User talk:Codename Lisa|talk]]) 11:41, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete:''' Perhaps including one or two of those predetermined answers as a note within the [[Microsoft Cortana]] article would be just fine, but such a list just isn't good enough for having a separate article. &mdash;&nbsp;[[User:Dsimic|Dsimic]]&nbsp;([[User talk:Dsimic#nobold|talk]]&nbsp;|&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dsimic|contribs]]) 03:25, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete:''' But, consider making it a section on the [[Microsoft Cortana]] article. [[Special:Contributions/70.97.195.217|70.97.195.217]] ([[User talk:70.97.195.217|talk]]) 20:01, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Merge:''' This information would be great on the main Cortana article. [[User:EndlessCoffee54|EndlessCoffee54]] ([[User talk:EndlessCoffee54|talk]]) 03:49, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

* '''Delete:''' Copyright violations, no information could be merged apart from the first sentence and a few of the answers. [[User:UltraMario64|UltraMario64]] ([[User talk:UltraMario64|talk]]) 15:24, 12 May 2014 (UTC)
