He finished sixth at the [[2005 World Youth Championships in Athletics|2005 World Youth Championships]] and eleventh at the [[2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics|2006 World Junior Championships]].<ref name=bio>{{iaaf name|id=204037}}</ref> He also competed at the [[Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games â€“ Men's high jump|2006 Commonwealth Games]] without reaching the final. In 2006 he was the youngest male athlete on the Australian athletics team at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games

His personal best is 2.24 metres, first achieved in June 2007 in [[Gold Coast, Australia|Gold Coast]]. He later switched to horizontal jumps. In March 2011 he recorded 16.97 metres in [[Perth, Australia|Perth]] and 7.45 metres in [[Melbourne]].<ref name=bio/>

Kane Brigg is Australia's greatest all-round jumper as at the end of 2013. His combination of 2.24m (high jump), 16.97m (triple jump) and 7.58m (long jump - Sydney) was 3rd on the world all-time combination jumps list in 2011. His retirement at such a young age (26yo) is truly a great and tragic loss for the sport of athletics in Australia.
