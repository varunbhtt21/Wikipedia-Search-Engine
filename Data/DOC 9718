:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] fn2 doesn't look like a reliable source, but what's more, it doesn't support the material from the article. I suggest that fn1 be used in these two instances. According to fn1 it was 4 miles and not 5 to work each day. Also of interest is fn3 plumps for 5 miles. Article is new enough and long enough at over 2000 bytes of prose. "He was the Derbyshire and Northern Counties One Mile Champion in 1953 and 1954 and he also won the three mile race and the 3000 metres steeplechase." does not have an inline citation, although it appears to be supported by the "external reference". Is http://www.northwingfield.name a reliable source though? I couldn't find any details about turning (returning?) home with a brother, either. ALT1 hook is hooky and accurate, running on its anniversary is a good idea but these issues will need to be addressed first, and link four minute mile in the hook. Article creator has 4 credits, therefore QPQ not required. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 18:23, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks for the review. I have found a .gov.uk url for the tibshelf parish council site. (It was not a precise link before) (Parish Councils are the lowest rung of UK government and should be accurate for local based information). This site does say "five" miles... so I have stuck with that - although as you note there are different opinions. I have added a cite for the "One mile champion" as requested. I havn't used the "northwingfield.name" as a source but it does have some nice pictures so its an external link. I have also linked "four minute mile". I think that addresses your points.

:: [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]]I would agree, the issues have been adequately addressed. ALT1 is approved. Note to promoter: please save for requested date of 6 May. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration: inherit; -moz-text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration-color: #6A5ACD;">679</span>]]</font> 23:24, 1 May 2014 (UTC)</div></noinclude><!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
