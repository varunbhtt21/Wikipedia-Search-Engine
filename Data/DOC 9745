'''Harris Park Transport'''<ref name=ASIC>[https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/panelSearch.jspx?searchType=OrgAndBusNm&searchText=Harris+park+transport&searchTab=search&_adf.ctrl-state=qnh50l1rl_4 Harris Park Transport Co Pty Ltd] Australian Securities & Investments Commission</ref> was an Australian bus company operating services in the [[Hills District]] and [[Southern Sydney|Southern suburbs]] of [[Sydney]].

==History==
[[File:HPT Harris Park Depot.JPG|thumb|Former [[Harris Park]] depot]]
Harris Park Transport operated buses under a variety of trading names including Carlingford Bus Service, AJ Moore and Sutherland Bus Service.<ref name=harrispark>[http://fleetlists.busaustralia.com/nsw.php?search=HPT Harris Park Transport] Australian Bus Fleet Lists</ref> By the late 1990s, all had been consolidated under the Harris Park Transport and AJ Moore brands.

===Hills District===
Harris Park Transport was founded in 1931 when Jeff Moore entered a partnership with Harry Howell to operate route 165 from [[Northmead]] to [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] via [[Parramatta]]. In 1945, in partnership with GR Sinclair, Moore purchased route 82 Epping to [[Carlingford, New South Wales|Carlingford]].<ref name=HCVA>{{cite book|title=New South Wales Bus Operators and Fleet Listings|year=1993|publisher=Historic Commercial Vehicle Association|location=Sydney|page=57}}</ref>

In 1945 Moore formed Parramatta - Epping Bus Service and purchased route 101 [[Parramatta]] to [[Pennant Hills]]. Route 82 was sold to Ritcher Bros in December 1947, it would be bought back in December 1973.

In 1952 Parramatta - Epping Bus Service commenced operating route 90 Epping to Carlingford that was later extended to [[Beecroft, New South Wales|Beecroft]], [[North Rocks]] and Parramatta. In 1958 the business was renamed Harris Park Transport.<ref name=ASIC/>

Further purchases were the business of Watson & Hume in May 1964, Nicholson Bros' route 191 Beecroft to [[Dural]] in July 1982 and East Parramatta Bus Lines' route 3 Parramatta - East Parramatta loop in February 1984.<ref name=HCVA/> The latter was sold to [[North & Western Bus Lines]] in January 1994.<ref>"Ownership changes" ''Fleetline'' issue 225 April 1994 page 76</ref>

In December 1981, ''Red Arrow'' route 590 commenced between [[Blacktown]] and [[Macquarie Centre]] as a joint operation between [[Westbus]] and Harris Park's Carlingford Bus Service subsidiary. The route was renumbered 630 in September 1987. 

The Carlingford Bus Service brand didn't last long and was replaced by the Harris Park Transport name.

In June 1997 the other routes were reorganised and renumbered.<ref>"Timetable & service changes" ''Fleetline'' issue 250 September 1997 page 164</ref> At this point of time, routes in the Hills District that Harris Park Transport operated were:
*623: Parramatta - North Rocks - Beecroft
*624: Parramatta - Carlingford - Epping
*625: Parramatta - Carlingford - Pennant Hills
*626: Pennant Hills - Cherrybrook
*627: Parramatta - Carlingford - Cherrybrook
*628: Epping - North Carlingford
*629: Epping - North Rocks
*630: Blacktown - Macquarie Centre (jointly operated with [[Westbus]])

In mid 2002, Harris Park Transport commenced operating services under the CityBus Direct brand via the  [[M2 Hills Motorway|M2]]:
*620: [[Dural]] - [[Queen Victoria Building]]
*621: [[North Parramatta]] - Queen Victoria Building
*622: [[Oatlands, New South Wales|Oatlands]] - Queen Victoria Building

On 8 October 2004, routes 621 and 622 ceased, leaving route 620 as the only CityBus Direct route.<ref name=busroutes>[http://sydneybusroutes.com/images/PDFs/rtehist-reg-4-590-628.pdf Sydney Bus Region 4], Retrieved 21 July 2019</ref>

===Southern Sydney===
Meanwhile, in December 1946, Moore's son Archie, trading as AJ Moore, purchased routes 74 and 106 from [[Hurstville]] to [[Kyle Bay]] and [[Connells Point]]. In March 1950, route 146 [[Mortdale railway station|Mortdale station]] to [[Oatley, New South Wales|West Oatley]] was purchased followed in October 1951 by route 116 [[Hurstville railway station|Hurstville station]] to Oatley. Both operated under the Sandy Beach Bus Co name, which was named after a popular swimming spot in [[Oyster Bay, New South Wales|Oyster Bay]].<ref name="126-150">[http://www.sydneybusroutes.com/images/PDFs/rtehist%20126-150.pdf Sydney Bus Routes (1925) 126-150], Retrieved 28 April 2014</ref><ref>[https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/panelSearch.jspx?searchType=OrgAndBusNm&searchText=Sandy+Beach+Bus+Co+Pty+Ltd&searchTab=search&_adf.ctrl-state=1d5hupltt8_91 Sandy Beach Bus Co Pty Ltd] Australian Securities & Investments Commission</ref> In June 1957, route 116 was incorporated into route 146. In December 1987, route 146 was partly replaced by route 115, which was operated by Archie's son Trevor's Moore's Tours business.<ref>[http://fleetlists.busaustralia.com/nsw.php?info=MOO Moore's Tours] Australian Bus Fleet Lists</ref><ref name=AustralianBusJan15>"Moore to the Point" ''Australian Bus'' January 2015 pages 12-17</ref>
