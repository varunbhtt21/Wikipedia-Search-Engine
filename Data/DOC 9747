The '''Commonwealth Railways L class''' was a class of {{whyte|2-8-2}} freight locomotives built in 1951-1952 by [[Clyde Engineering]], [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]], for the [[Commonwealth Railways]], Australia.

==History==
In the late 1940s, the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] placed an order with [[Clyde Engineering]], [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] for fifty 2-8-2 locomotives. These were ordered as part of Australia's contribution to the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] rehabilitation of China. With the first locomotives under construction, China fell to the Communists and Australia's obligations ceased.<ref name=LOberg>{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=198}}</ref><ref name=Chris>[http://www.comrails.com/cr_locos/r_l.html#80 L class] Chris's Commonwealth Railways Pages</ref>

The government was able to renegotiate the contract, with only twenty built. Ten were taken by the [[Commonwealth Railways]], even though it already had diesel locomotives on order, with the other ten going to the [[South Australian Railways]] as the [[South Australian Railways 740 class|740 class]]. Some never entered service being placed on the scrap line at [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]]. All were officially withdrawn by May 1959. They were scrapped in the mid 1960s with the boilers sold overseas.<ref name=LOberg/><ref name=Chris/>

Some the tenders were converted into water carriers for use on the Commonwealth Railways weed killer train, still being in use in the early 1980s.<ref name=LOberg/>
