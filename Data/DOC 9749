The '''South Australian Railways 740 class''' was a class of 2-8-2 freight locomotives built by [[Clyde Engineering]], [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] for the [[South Australian Railways]] in 1951-1952.

==History==
In the late 1940s, the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] placed an order with [[Clyde Engineering]], [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] for fifty 2-8-2 locomotives. These were ordered as part of Australia's contribution to the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] rehabilitation of China. With the first locomotives under construction, China fell to the Communists and Australia's obligations ceased.<ref name=LOberg>{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=198}}</ref>

The government was able to renegotiate the contract, with only twenty built. Ten were taken by the [[Commonwealth Railways]] as the [[Commonwealth Railways L class|L class]], with the other ten going to the [[South Australian Railways]] as the 740 class after being converted for broad gauge operation. The 740 class remained in service until the early 1960s when replaced by diesels. The last was condemned in November 1965.<ref name=LOberg/>
