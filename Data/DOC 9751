Title : Problem of time
Text : {{short description|A conceptual conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics}}
{{expert needed|date=June 2015}}

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''problem of time''' is a conceptual conflict between [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] in that quantum mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and relative.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Quantum Gravity’s Time Problem | author=Wolchover, Natalie | date=December 1, 2016 | magazine=Quanta Magazine | url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-gravitys-time-problem-20161201/}}</ref> This problem raises the question of what [[time]] really is in a physical sense and whether it is truly a real, distinct phenomenon. It also involves the related question of why time seems to flow in a single direction, despite the fact that no known physical laws seem to require a single direction.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Newsflash: Time May Not Exist | author=Folger, Tim | date=June 12, 2007 | magazine=Discover | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/in-no-time}}</ref>

== Time in quantum mechanics ==
In [[classical mechanics]], a special status is assigned to time in the sense that it is treated as a classical background parameter, external to the system itself. This special role is seen in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. It is regarded as part of an a priori given classical background with a well defined value. In fact, the classical treatment of time is deeply intertwined with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, and, thus, with the conceptual foundations of quantum theory: all measurements of observables are made at certain instants of time and probabilities are only assigned to such measurements.

[[Special relativity]] has modified the notion of time. But from a fixed [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz]] observer's viewpoint time remains a distinguished, absolute, external, global parameter. The Newtonian notion of [[Time#Relativistic time versus Newtonian time|time]] essentially carries over to special relativistic systems, hidden in the [[spacetime]] structure.

== Overturning of absolute time in general relativity ==
Though classically [[spacetime]] appears to be an absolute background, [[general theory of relativity|general relativity]] reveals that spacetime is actually dynamical; gravity is a manifestation of spacetime geometry.  Matter reacts with spacetime: {{Quote|text=Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|author=[[John Archibald Wheeler]]|source=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam, p. 235<ref name="Wheeler2010">{{cite book|author=John Archibald Wheeler|title=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGFkK2tTXPsC|date=18 June 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-07948-7|page=235}}</ref>}}

Also, spacetime can interact with itself (e.g. gravitational waves). The dynamical nature of spacetime has a vast array of consequences.

{{confusing section|reason=vocabulary needs to be explained: diffeomorphism, Hamiltonian, [[Dirac observables]], perennials, partial observables.  Need to illustrate with example|date=September 2014}}
The dynamical nature of spacetime, via the [[hole argument]], implies that the theory is [[diffeomorphism]] invariant. The constraints are the imprint in the canonical theory of the diffeomorphism invariance of the four-dimensional theory. They also contain the dynamics of the theory, since the Hamiltonian identically vanishes. The quantum theory has no explicit dynamics; wavefunctions are annihilated by the constraints and Dirac observables commute with the constraints and hence are constants of motion. Kuchar introduces the idea of "perennials" and Rovelli the idea of "partial observables". The expectation is that in physical situations some of the variables of the theory will play the role of a "time" with respect to which other variables would evolve and define dynamics in a relational way. This runs into difficulties and is a version of the "problem of time" in the canonical quantization.<ref>K.

The quantum concept of time was invented by physicist [[Bryce DeWitt]] in the 1960s:<ref name="Deutsch2011">{{cite book|author=David Deutsch|title=The Fabric of Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7uFxViR19oC&pg=PT240|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-196961-9|page=240}}</ref>

In other words, time is an [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] phenomenon, which places all equal clock readings (of correctly prepared clocks - or of any objects usable as clocks) into the same history. This was first understood by physicist [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] and [[William Wootters]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite book|first = David|last =  Deutsch|title= The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform The World| page= 299|date = 2011|publisher = Penguin UK|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ex5xge75SR4C|isbn = 9780141969695}}</ref> They made a proposal to address the problem of time in systems like general relativity called conditional probabilities interpretation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Page|first1 = Don N.|last2 =  Wootters|first2 =  William K.|date = 15 June 1983|journal =  Phys.

They made a solution based on the quantum phenomenon of entanglement. Page and Wootters showed how [[quantum entanglement]] can be used to measure time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aron|first1=Jacob|title=Entangled toy universe shows time may be an illusion|url=https://www.newscientist.com//article/dn24473-entangled-toy-universe-shows-time-may-be-an-illusion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018065554/http://www.newscientist.com//article/dn24473-entangled-toy-universe-shows-time-may-be-an-illusion|archivedate=2016-10-18|date=October 25, 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) in Turin, Italy, Ekaterina Moreva, together with Giorgio Brida, Marco Gramegna, Vittorio Giovannetti, Lorenzo Maccone, and Marco Genovese performed the first experimental test of Page and Wootters' ideas. They confirmed that time is an emergent phenomenon for internal observers but absent for external observers of the universe just as the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]] predicts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quantum Experiment Shows How Time ‘Emerges’ from Entanglement|url=https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933|website=The Physics arXiv Blog|date=Oct 23, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603063357/https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933|archivedate=2017-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moreva|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Brida|first2=Giorgio|last3=Gramegna|first3=Marco|last4=Giovannetti|first4=Vittorio|last5=Maccone|first5=Lorenzo|last6=Genovese|first6=Marco|title=Time from quantum entanglement: An experimental illustration|journal=Physical Review A|date=20 May 2014|volume=89|issue=5|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.89.052122|arxiv=1310.4691|bibcode=2014PhRvA..89e2122M}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moreva|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Gramegna|first2=Marco|last3=Brida|first3=Giorgio|last4=Maccone|first4=Lorenzo|last5=Genovese|first5=Marco|title=Quantum time: Experimental multitime correlations|journal=Physical Review D|date=16 November 2017|volume=96 |issue=5|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.96.102005|arxiv=1710.00707|bibcode=2017PhRvD..96j2005M}}</ref>

Consistent discretizations approach developed by [[Jorge Pullin]] and [[Rodolfo Gambini]] have no constraints. These are lattice approximation techniques for quantum gravity. In the canonical approach if one discretizes the constraints and equations of motion, the resulting discrete equations are inconsistent: they cannot be solved simultaneously. To address this problem one uses a technique based on discretizing the action of the theory and working with the discrete equations of motion. These are automatically guaranteed to be consistent. Most of the hard conceptual questions of quantum gravity are related to the presence of constraints in the theory. Consistent discretized theories are free of these conceptual problems and can be straightforwardly quantized, providing a solution to the problem of time. It is a bit more subtle than this. Although without constraints and having "general evolution", the latter is only in terms of a discrete parameter that isn't physically accessible. The way out is addressed in a way similar to the Page–Wooters approach. The idea is to pick one of the physical variables to be a clock and asks relational questions. These ideas where the clock is also quantum mechanical have actually led to a new interpretation of quantum mechanics — the [[Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics#Other|Montevideo interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Pullin|first2=Jorge|title=The Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics: frequently asked questions|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=1 June 2009|volume=174|pages=012003|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/174/1/012003|arxiv=0905.4402}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Garc?a-Pintos|first2=Luis Pedro|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=An axiomatic formulation of the Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=November 2011|volume=42|issue=4|pages=256–263|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2011.10.002|arxiv=1002.4209|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9927/|bibcode=2011SHPMP..42..256G}}</ref> This new interpretation solves the problems of the use of environmental decoherence as a solution to the [[problem of measurement]] in quantum mechanics by invoking fundamental limitations, due to the quantum mechanical nature of clocks, in the process of measurement in quantum mechanics. These limitations are very natural in the context of generally covariant theories as quantum gravity where the clock must be taken as one of the degrees of freedom of the system itself. They have also put forward this fundamental decoherence as a way to resolve the [[black hole information paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Porto|first2=Rafael A.|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=No Black Hole Information Puzzle In A Relational Universe|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D|date=December 2004|volume=13|issue=10|pages=2315–2320|doi=10.1142/S0218271804006383|arxiv=hep-th/0405183|bibcode=2004IJMPD..13.2315G}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Porto|first2=Rafael A.|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=Realistic Clocks, Universal Decoherence, and the Black Hole Information Paradox|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=6 December 2004|volume=93|issue=24|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.240401|arxiv=hep-th/0406260|bibcode=2004PhRvL..93x0401G}}</ref> In certain circumstances, a matter field is used to de-parametrize the theory and introduce a physical Hamiltonian.

Reduced phase space quantization constraints are solved first then quantized. This approach was considered for some time to be impossible as it seems to require first finding the general solution to Einstein's equations. However, with use of ideas involved in Dittrich's approximation scheme (built on ideas of Rovelli) a way to explicitly implement, at least in principle, a reduced phase space quantization was made viable.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thiemann|first1=T|title=Reduced phase space quantization and Dirac observables|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=21 February 2006|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1163–1180|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/23/4/006|arxiv=gr-qc/0411031|bibcode=2006CQGra..23.1163T}}</ref>

One solution to the problem of time proposed by [[Lee Smolin]] is that there exists a "thick present" of events, in which two events in the present can be causally related to each other, but in contrast to the block universe view of time in which all time exists [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternally]].<ref>Smolin, L.

== The thermal time hypothesis ==
{{main|Thermal time hypothesis|thermodynamics}}

[[Generally covariant]] theories do not have a notion of a distinguished physical time with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.

A possible solution to this problem has been put forward by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Alain Connes]], both in the classical and quantum theory, and goes by the name of the thermal time hypothesis. It postulates that physical time flow is not an a priori given fundamental property of the theory, but is a macroscopic feature of thermodynamical origin.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Connes|first1=A|last2=Rovelli|first2=C|title=Von Neumann algebra automorphisms and time-thermodynamics relation in generally covariant quantum theories|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=1 December 1994|volume=11|issue=12|pages=2899–2917|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/12/007|url=http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/carlotime.pdf|arxiv=gr-qc/9406019|bibcode=1994CQGra..11.2899C}}</ref>
