== Judaism ==
Ajax is popularly seen as having "Jewish roots" and in the 1970s supporters of rival teams began taunting Ajax fans by calling them Jews. Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish) responded by embracing Ajax's "Jewish" identity: calling themselves "super Jews", chanting "Joden, Joden"" (Jews, Jews) at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the Star of David and the Israeli flag. This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture. At one point ringtones of "Hava Nagila", a Hebrew folk song, could be downloaded from the club's official website. Beginning in the 1980s, fans of Ajax's rivals escalated their antisemitic rhetoric, chanting slogans like "Hamas, Hamas/Jews to the gas" ("Hamas, hamas, joden aan het gas"), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving Nazi salutes, etc. The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games. In the 2000s the club began trying to persuade fans to drop their Jewish image, yet have achieved no success in this pursuit. Supporters, on and off the field, still employ imagery associated with Jewish history and the Israeli nation. [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[Yid Army]] use similar symbols.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DB153FF93BA15750C0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 Amsterdam Journal - A Dutch Soccer Riddle - Jewish Regalia Without Jews] ''NY Times''</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Understanding Football Hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Football Clubs|author=Spaaij, R.|year=2006|publisher=Vossiuspers UvA|isbn=9789056294458|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i21W_KN_iUMC}}</ref><ref name="ajax-usa">{{cite web|url=http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html|title=www.ajax-usa.com|publisher=ajax-usa.com|accessdate=2014-04-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113235308/http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html|archivedate=13 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
