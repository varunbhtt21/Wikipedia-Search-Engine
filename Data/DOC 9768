Already covered adequately in the main [[Bandy in the United States]] article.  No independent reliable sources to establish notability.  I had merged/redirected this into [[Bandy in the United States]] after a short discussion at [[Talk:List of bandy clubs in the United States]].  The merge was reverted.  Rather than start a revert war, I bring this to AfD to form a wider consensus. -- [[User:RoySmith|RoySmith]] [[User Talk:RoySmith|(talk)]] 12:31, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete''', there is only one source on the page and it is a primary source that just mentions it is part of the international federation which doesn't establish notability. I did a search of google for sources and could not find anything that would indicate that it has notability. I did not find any independent reliable sources. -[[User:Djsasso|DJSasso]] ([[User talk:Djsasso|talk]]) 12:04, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

::* None of those are reliable, independent secondary sources which establish notability.

*'''keep''', a national governing body for a sport is notable and the information is verified by reliable sources. [[User:Bandy guy|Bandy guy]] ([[User talk:Bandy guy|talk]]) 12:44, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::Is that a policy-based assertion or just your opinion? Being a national-level organisation wouldn't seem to be an inclusion criteria. Anything to suggest this passes [[WP:GNG]]?

:::GNG is about the souces, and they are reliable. A national governing body for a sport recognised by the IOC is not just any national-level organisation. [[User:Bandy guy|Bandy guy]] ([[User talk:Bandy guy|talk]]) 16:24, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::There is nothing about national governing bodies at [[Wikipedia:Notability (sports)]]. Do you think that they are generally not notable? Should we delete the ones linked from [[Football association]] if they are stubs? I think this should be discussed at a wider level. [[User:Bandy guy|Bandy guy]] ([[User talk:Bandy guy|talk]]) 16:48, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::::National sports organizations are not inherently notable. To use ice hockey for example many in the southern countries that are recognized by the IIHF have been deleted over the years. Just being an organization doesn't confer notability, articles need to be written about it. If you can find a few sources with in depth articles discussing/describing the organization then it would likely be notable. If you can't then it likely isn't. -[[User:Djsasso|DJSasso]] ([[User talk:Djsasso|talk]]) 16:58, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::*Could you give examples of national governing bodies for ice hockey which have been deleted?

::::::*To answer your earlier comment; no, [[WP:GNG]] is not ''just'' about reliable sources, it is about significant coverage in reliable sources. If you could provide instances of significant coverage in reliable sources we wouldn't be having this discussion. [[User: Stalwart111|'''Stalwart''']][[User talk:Stalwart111|'''<font color="green">111</font>''']] 22:02, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::::*I think you should direct that comment to Bandy guy, not to me. Anyway, as far as I can see, Wikipedia has articles about every full, associate and affiliate member of the IIHF and also about some non-members. (Some of these articles have less sources than this one.) So I don't know which organisations [[User:Djsasso|DJSasso]] refers to, when he writes that some of them have been deleted. <span style="font-family:serif">[[User:Bandy boy|Bandy boy]] ([[User talk:Bandy boy|talk]])</span> 22:13, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*Yes, perhaps I should have said ''the'' earlier comment, rather than ''your'' earlier comment. But the point remains the same. Using the inclusion of other organisations as justification for including this one is never a good idea. Each sport has a different organisational structure which might make some national bodies targets for significant coverage while others just busy themselves in the background with general administration. Some such organisations may manage all levels of a sport from grass-roots to international competition while others may exist to manage one competition or event. In the same way, some national organisations exist to manage highly publicised sports (NFL, NBA, NHL) while others exist to manage sports that might occasionally make it on to ESPN4 like darts and orienteering. A great many people are interested in what the [[National Football League]] (as an organisation) is doing and so there is plenty of coverage of the organisation itself. Less so the [[National Dart Association]]. The test here is [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:ORGDEPTH]], not some magic arbitrary "every national organisation is notable".

:::::::::*Noone has said that "every national organisation is notable", but that a national ''governing body'' for a sport may be notable. [[User:Djsasso|DJSasso]] is the one who wanted to make comparisons to national governing bodies for ice hockey, and then I think DJSasso should be able to show us some example of an IIHF member whose article has been deleted, because I can't find one. <span style="font-family:serif">[[User:Bandy boy|Bandy boy]] ([[User talk:Bandy boy|talk]])</span> 08:16, 8 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge''' to [[Bandy in the United States]]:  Bandy is barely recognized by the IoC (it was a demonstration sport in 1952 with Finland, Norway and Sweden participating, but that's it), and Americans haven't participated in Bandy in the Olympics.  Per [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/sports/olympics/29bandy.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&th&emc=th& this article]. "In the United States, perhaps 300 men, 50 women and 200 youngsters play bandy. All of them live in the Twin Cities, except for a handful from Duluth who drive down on weekends," so I don't see a strong claim for inherent notability. As the association doesn't appear to meet the [[WP:GNG|General Notability Guidelines]], I have to vote delete for now, with no prejudice against recreating the article if and when Bandy becomes recognized enough in the US for this association to meet [[WP:GNG]]. --[[User:Ahecht|Ahecht]] (<small>[[User_talk:Ahecht|<span style="color:#FFF;background:#00f;display:inline-block;line-height:1.1em;vertical-align:-0.3em;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><b>TALK<br />PAGE</b></span>]]</small>) 17:32, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
:*[[User:Ahecht|Ahecht]], what do you mean by "barely recognized"? A sport is recognized or it isn't, there's no in-between. Bandy is a recognized sport and the [[Federation of International Bandy]] is a member of the [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations]]. <span style="font-family:serif">[[User:Bandy boy|Bandy boy]] ([[User talk:Bandy boy|talk]])</span> 21:43, 7 May 2014 (UTC)
