The '''Commonwealth Railways K class''' was a class of 2-8-0 freight locomotives built in 1916 by [[North British Locomotive Company]], United Kingdom, for the [[Commonwealth Railways]], Australia.

==History==
In order to operate freight trains on the then under construction [[Trans-Australian Railway]], [[Commonwealth Railways]] ordered eight locomotives of the same design as the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]' [[New South Wales D50 class locomotive|T class]] (later the D50 class), but with higher capacity tenders.<ref name=LOberg>{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|pages=76â€“77}}</ref><ref name=Chris>[http://www.comrails.com/cr_locos/r_k.html#27 K class] Chris's Commonwealth Railways Pages</ref>

All were delivered between March and June 1916. Most had been withdrawn by the early 1950s with the last withdrawn in March 1952 after dieselisation.<ref name=LOberg/><ref name=Chris/>
