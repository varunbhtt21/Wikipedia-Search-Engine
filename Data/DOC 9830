The '''2007 1000 Guineas Stakes''' was a [[horse racing|horse race]] held at [[Newmarket Racecourse]] on Sunday 6 May 2007. It was the 194th running of the [[1000 Guineas]].

The winner was Michael Ryan's [[Finsceal Beo]], a [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] [[filly]] trained by [[Jim Bolger (racehorse trainer)|Jim Bolger]] at [[Coolcullen]] in [[County Carlow]] and ridden by [[Kevin Manning (jockey)|Kevin Manning]]. Finsceal Beo's victory was the first in the race for her owner, trainer and jockey.

==The contenders==
The race attracted an unusually large field of twenty-one runners, seventeen trained in the United Kingdom, three in Ireland and one in Sweden. The favourite was the Jim Bolger-trained Finsceal Beo who had been named [[Cartier Champion Two-year-old Filly|European Champion Two-year old Filly]] in 2006 when she had won the [[Rockfel Stakes]] in England and the [[Prix Marcel Boussac]] in France. The other Irish runners were Arch Swing the winner of the [[C. L. Weld Park Stakes]] and the [[Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes]], the [[Moyglare Stud Stakes]] winner Miss Beatrix, and the [[Aidan O'Brien]]-trained Theann. The best of the British-trained runners appeared to be the [[Cheveley Park Stakes]] winner [[Indian Ink (horse)|Indian Ink]] and [[Simply Perfect]], the winner of the [[May Hill Stakes]] and the [[Fillies' Mile]] and Scarlet Runner ([[Princess Margaret Stakes]], [[Nell Gwyn Stakes]]). Finsceal Beo headed the betting at odds of [[Fractional odds|5/4]] ahead of Indian Ink (17/2), Simply Perfect (9/1) and Arch Swing (10/1).<ref name="racingpost2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=425848&r_date=2007-05-06&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=1000 Guineas result |work=[[Racing Post]] |date=6 May 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

==The race==
Shortly after the start, the fillies split into two groups across the wide Newmarket straight, with the larger group racing up the stands side (the left of the course from the jockeys' viewpoint), with the smaller group running down the centre of the course. The 150/1 outsider Fantasy Parkes headed the stands side group from Scarlet Runner, Finsceal Beo and Treat, whilst the 250/1 shot Princess Valerina led the centre group from Arch Swing. The two groups merged after half a mile, by which point Scarlet Runner had taken the overall lead. A quarter of a mile from the finish, Scarlet Runner began to struggle and was overtaken by Finsceal Beo and Arch Swing, with Simply Perfect and Indian Ink making progress. In the closing stages, Finsceal Beo went clear and stayed on well to win by two and a half lengths from Arch Swing, with Simply Perfect one and a quarter lengths back in third. Treat finished fourth ahead of Indian Ink, who had failed to obtain a clear run a furlong from the finish.<ref name="racingpost2007"/>

Finsceal Beo's winning time was an "outstanding" 1:34.94. Her owner, Michael Ryan said "That was fantastic. We have a super filly and a super trainer. We'll drink every pub dry of [[Guinness]] between here and Stansted Airport tonight!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/38816/finsceal-beo-grabs-one-thousand-guineas-glory |title=Finsceal Beo Grabs One Thousand Guineas Glory |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date=6 May 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>
