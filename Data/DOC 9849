Article about a book that does not seem to be sufficiently notable. Fails [[WP:NBOOK]]. - [[user: MrX|Mr]][[user talk:MrX|X]] 12:53, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge''' to [[ Garrett P.I.]]. Individual book not notable. What about all the others in the series?[[User:TheLongTone|TheLongTone]] ([[User talk:TheLongTone|talk]]) 14:54, 27 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''I agree a merge sounds like the best-what are the other books of this franchise also? If there is a franchise page-that be great. [[User:Wgolf|Wgolf]] ([[User talk:Wgolf|talk]]) 20:37, 28 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Merge''' to Garrett, P.I. Maybe a case could be made for the first book in the series, ''[[Sweet Silver Blues]]'', but not the 14th. (Plus this one was really, really awful. I want a refund.) [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 22:15, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
