==Route==
The Dacheng-Chengdu Railway runs from Chengdu, the provincial capital in central Sichuan to Sanhui Township of [[Qu County]], [[Dazhou, Sichuan|Dazhou Municipality]] in eastern Sichuan.  The Dacheng Line forms an important link in China's national railway network, connecting the [[Baoji-Chengdu Railway|Baoji-Chengdu]] and [[Chengdu-Kunming Railway]]s in the west with the [[Suining−Chongqing Railway]] in the center and [[Xiangyang-Chongqing Railway]] in the east.  It is a major railway outlet for the Sichuan Basin, and a section of the [[Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu High-Speed Railway]].  High-speed train service between Chengdu and Chongqing run on the Dazhou−Chengdu and Suining−Chongqing Lines instead of the longer and older [[Chengdu–Chongqing Railway]].
 
==History==
