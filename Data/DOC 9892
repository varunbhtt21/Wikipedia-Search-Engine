'''Twitter diplomacy''', also "'''Twiplomacy'''" or "'''hashtag diplomacy'''", is the use of social network and microblogging website, [[Twitter]], by [[Head of state|heads of state]], leaders of [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)]], and their [[diplomat]]s to conduct [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] outreach and [[public diplomacy]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Keleman|first=Michele|title=Twitter Diplomacy: State Department 2.0|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/21/147207004/twitter-diplomacy-state-department-2-0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=21 February 2014}}</ref>

Twitter has taken on diverse and occasional roles in diplomatic communications, from cordial announcements of bi-lateral cooperation to terse exchanges and diplomatic jabs, as well as more casual posts.<ref name="nyt-scripted">{{Cite news

== Origins ==
The term '''twitplomacy''' was proposed in 2011, in a pioneer{{Peacock term|date=February 2017}} work focused on the study of diplomacy within the social networks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Treeintelligence|title=Twitplomacy|url=http://www.slideshare.net/treebranding/twitter-diplomacy-tree-branding|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref>{{better|date=February 2017}} This report purports to show how presidents use Twitter to keep diplomatic relationships with other presidents and political actors. However, the use of Twitter by world leaders and diplomats was on the rise as of April 2014{{cn|date=February 2017}}, but Twitter diplomacy was only one aspect of the growing trend{{cn|date=February 2017}} toward [[digital diplomacy]], also known as eDiplomacy or [[Facebook diplomacy]], by many world governments.{{or|date=February 2017}}

=== Twitter and diplomacy ===
[[File:Twitter activity of Michael McFaul.png|thumb|right|Twitter activity of [[Michael McFaul]]. Re-tweets are not included.]]
As of April 2014, an estimated 241 million active users had joined Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=About Twitter, Inc.|url=https://about.twitter.com/company|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Twitter also offers policymakers the possibility to hear the many perspectives of a worldwide audience.{{promotion-inline|date=February 2017}}

World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have begun using it to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.oup.com/2017/10/twitter-diplomacy-practices-foreign-policy/|title=How Twitter enhances conventional practices of diplomacy {{!}} OUPblog|date=2017-10-05|work=OUPblog|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}</ref> US Ambassador to Russia, [[Michael A. McFaul]] has been attributed {{by whom|date=February 2017}} as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian.<ref name="nyt-scripted" /> A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the [[United Nations]] had established government Twitter accounts.<ref name=twiplomacy>{{cite web|publisher=Twiplomacy.com|title=Twiplomacy Study 2013 – International Organisations|url=http://twiplomacy.com/blog/twiplomacy-study-2013/|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>  The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.<ref name=twiplomacy />

Commenting in a 2013 publication on the subject for the Geneva-based, non-profit Diplo, former Italian Foreign Minister [[Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata|Giulio Terzi]] said of social media, "Social media exposes foreign policymakers to global audiences while at the same time allowing governments to reach them instantly... Twitter has two big positive effects on foreign policy: it fosters a beneficial exchange of ideas between policymakers and civil society and enhances diplomats' ability to gather information and to anticipate, analyze, manage, and react to events."<ref>{{cite web|last=DiploFoundation|title=Twitter for Diplomats|url=http://issuu.com/diplo/docs/twitter_for_diplomats|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

=== Controversy ===

Confrontations via Twitter diplomacy are visible to a worldwide audience because of Twitter's global nature.{{synthesis-inline|date=February 2017}}

In April 2014, tensions between the US State Department and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] over the [[2014 Crimean crisis]] devolved into dueling tweets{{tone-inline|date=February 2017}}, with both ministries using the hashtag #UnitedforUkraine to convey opposite points of view.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ishaan|first=Tharoor|title=Russia hijacks U.S. State Department’s Ukraine hashtag|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/25/russia-hijacks-u-s-state-departments-ukraine-hashtag/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Foxnews.com|title=Obama's hashtag diplomacy with Russia sparks new criticism about weak foreign policy|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/26/obama-hashtag-diplomacy-with-russia-sparks-new-criticism-about-weak-foreign/|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=26 April 2014}}</ref>

Tweeting to a global audience also poses challenges to leaders and diplomats.  In early 2014, Iranian President [[Hassan Rouhani]] decided to delete a controversial tweet that received much media attention, though it was likely intended for his domestic audience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loguirato|first=Brett|title=Iran's President Deleted A Controversial Tweet|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hassan-rouhani-deletes-tweet-nuclear-deal-surrender-2014-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

== Use by governments and intergovernmental organizations ==

Twiplomacy's 2013 study provided new insight into the use of Twitter by governments.  Twitter registration by region includes:<ref name=twiplomacy />
* Africa: 71% of governments
* Asia:  75% of governments
* Europe: 100% of governments<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tutt, A.

* North America: 18 governments
* Oceania: 38% of governments

=== By heads of state and government ===

Former US President [[Barack Obama]] is credited as being the first head of state to establish a Twitter account, originally affiliated with his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], on March 5, 2007 as user number 813,286.<ref name=twiplomacy />  He was also the most followed head of state on Twitter.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miles|first=Tom|title=@tweeter-in-chief?

Other heads of state and government to pioneer the conduct of Twitter diplomacy include Mexican president [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], Belgian Prime Minister [[Elio Di Rupo]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tutt, A. (2013), E-Diplomacy Capacities within the EU-27: Small States and Social Media|url = http://www.grin.com/en/e-book/274032/e-diplomacy-capacities-within-the-eu-27-small-states-and-social-media|website = www.grin.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}</ref> and Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], all of whom joined Twitter in 2007.

Since his election in November 2016, US President [[Donald Trump]] has been actively [[Donald Trump on social media|engaged in]] Twitter diplomacy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCaskill|first1=Nolan|title=Clinton slams Trump's Twitter diplomacy: 'That doesn’t work'|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/02/hillary-clinton-mocks-trump-twitter-diplomacy-237884|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=2 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Rebecca Kheel|author2=Ellen Mitchell|title=Trump’s diplomacy-by-Twitter sets off firestorm|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/336659-trumps-diplomacy-by-twitter-sets-off-firestorm|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=6 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Apps|first1=Peter|title=Commentary: Trump’s brave new world of Twitter diplomacy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-twitter-commentary-idUSKBN13U2VX|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|issue=6 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Luis Gomez|title=Twitter diplomacy: how Trump is using social media to spur a crisis with Mexico|url=https://theconversation.com/twitter-diplomacy-how-trump-is-using-social-media-to-spur-a-crisis-with-mexico-71981|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=27 January 2017}}</ref>

=== By leaders of intergovernmental organizations ===

As of April 2014, the United Nations (UN) is the most followed intergovernmental organization,<ref>{{cite web|last=Twiplomacy|title=Twiplomacy 2013 - How International Organizations Tweet|url=http://twiplomacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Twiplomacy_organisations.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014}}</ref>  with its website showing over 2.56 million viewers in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=United Nations (UN) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/UN}}</ref>  Many of the UN's subordinate funds and agencies also attract large numbers of followers.  The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] achieved greater popularity than its parent organization, the UN, and is followed by over 2.69 million as of April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNICEF (UNICEF) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/UNICEF}}</ref>

=== By diplomats and diplomatic missions ===

Former Israeli ambassador to the United States, [[Michael Oren]], echoed the sentiment of many diplomats when responding to a May 2012 question about why he joined Twitter: "Today there are few alternatives as far-reachng and effective, with very wide audiences and young audiences, as Twitter. Twitter is another tool that enables me to communicate with other diplomats and journalists, while also allowing me to add a personal touch."<ref>{{cite web|last=Tracy|first=Marc|title=Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren Talks About Why He Joined Twitter|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/101023/ambassadororen-on-why-he-joined-twitter|publisher=The Tablet|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>

Foreign ministries have caught on, and some are making efforts to advertise their presence on Twitter.  The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], for example, published a consolidated [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/about/social-media-use list] of all UK missions on social media.

The United States State Department, one of the leaders in digital diplomacy, maintains an active presence on Twitter.  Although former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] encouraged American diplomats to tweet, she did not establish her personal handle until 2013, after she had already left office.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Ken|title=Hillary Clinton starts Tweeting|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22551202/hillary-clinton-joins-twitter|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=AP|date=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045917/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22551202/hillary-clinton-joins-twitter|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=}}</ref>   Current Secretary [[John Kerry]] re-activated his personal Twitter handle after one year on the job.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gearan|first=Anne|title=John Kerry unleashed on Twitter once again|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/04/john-kerry-unleashed-on-twitter-once-again/|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=4 February 2014}}</ref>   Former US ambassador to the Russian Federation, [[Michael McFaul]], pioneered the use of Twitter for American ambassadors with a steady stream of English/Russian tweets during his 2011–2014 tenure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Elder|first=Miriam|title=Michael McFaul, US ambassador to Moscow, victim of Kremlin 'Twitter war'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/michael-mcfaul-twitter-attack-russia|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Guardian|date=29 May 2012}}</ref><ref name="Lally">{{cite news|last=Lally|first=Kathy|title=U.S. ambassador in Moscow uses social media to bypass official line|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-ambassador-tweets-us-policy/2014/01/11/ac1fefea-7568-11e3-8b3f-b1666705ca3b_story.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=11 January 2014}}</ref>  An academic by trade and not a career diplomat, Ambassador McFaul's tweets were generally blunt and un-polished—uncommon characteristics in the diplomatic world—earning both frequent criticism from the Russian government and praise from his supporters.<ref name="Lally"/>
