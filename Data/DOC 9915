:*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Date, length and hook all OK. Picture licence fine. Not a self nom so no QPQ needed. Good to go (on something I knew well). <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.5em 0.5em 0.6em;"> '''[[User:The C of E|<font color="red">The C of E  </font><font color="blue"> God Save the Queen!</font>]]''' ([[User talk:The C of E|<font color="darkblue">talk</font>]])</span> 21:16, 30 April 2014 (UTC)

::*'''Note''': the "largest Paralympics" claim was not supported by a source in the article; I had to find and add a source myself. Especially when it's something you "know well", you need to check the hook sourcing. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 01:56, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
