'''St. Peter's Cathedral''' in [[Osnabrück]], [[Germany]] is the cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück]]. The cathedral is a late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building and dominates the city's [[skyline]].

== History, interior architecture, and equipment ==

The first version of St. Peter's Cathedral was built in the year 785, 15 years after the [[diocese]] was founded by [[Charlemagne]]. The [[Normans]] destroyed the church 100 years later, and the present version of the church developed only gradually after a fire around 1100.

The oldest parts of the present-day church are the Romanesque [[crossing tower]], the northern facade and the Romanesque-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] west facade.  The dome in the middle part of the three-[[aisle]]d [[nave]] is as high as the [[column|pillar]]s on which it rests.

The oldest pieces of equipment that have survived to this day are the [[baptismal font]] from 1220 and the [[triumphal cross]] from 1230. The broken [[rood screen]] from 1664 has also survived. Twelve statues received from the [[Münster]] sculptor [[Heinrich Brabender]] remain preserved to this day, including figures of the [[Christ]] and of the [[Apostles]], and also a smaller number of statues received from [[Eric of Saxe-Lauenburg (prince-bishop)|Duke Erich II of Saxe-Lauenburg]], [[Prince-Bishopric of Münster|Bishop of Münster]]. These are on display at the Diocesan Museum of Osnabrück.

Over the centuries, the cathedral changed in appearance - the interior primarily during the [[Baroque period]], to which the [[altar]]s, figures, and [[epitaph]]s bear testimony, and the exterior during the major restoration in 1882-1910 under [[Alexander Behnes]] through renovations and building of annexes. During the [[Second World War]] the cathedral roof with baroque domes and some church annexes were destroyed by [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]]. The cathedral has since been rebuilt and is still a major attraction for the Christians of the city and the diocese as well as people interested in [[art history]] from around the world. The Osnabrück Wheel, which on September 13, 1944 fell from the larger of the towers due to bombing, has been re-erected at the side of the cathedral.

The [[cloister]] is attached to the church at south of the nave. It has open pillar-[[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s on the remaining three sides. [[Capital (architecture)#Western Romanesque and Gothic capitals|Cushion capital]]s, which correspond to those in the former west [[choir]] of 1140, are present in the east wing. The [[barrel vault]] in the eastern part of the cloister features [[lunette]]s but no [[belt bow]]s; the vaults in the south and west wings are supported by belt bows and [[Ogival arch#Architecture|ogival arch]]es (built in the second quarter of the 13th century). During the Second World War the cloister, which had been walled towards the courtyard, served as an [[air raid shelter]].

== Bells ==

The [[belfry (architecture)|belfry]] in the southwest tower houses a [[Ring of bells|ring]] of six [[cast steel]] bells, one of the [[Bochumer Verein]]'s best works. The bells were built in the so-called experimental V7 shape, a minor octave shape cast. The 1951 cast steel bells of the [[Paderborn Cathedral]] also ring in the same disposition, and were considered the first major bells ringing in the then newly developed V7 shape.

== Organs ==

The cathedral has two organs: the main organ in the west, and a small choir organ in the north [[transept]] .

=== Main organ ===

The main organ was built in 2003 by the organ maker Kuhn AG of [[Männedorf]], [[Switzerland]]. It stands above the main portal under the west [[rose window]]. The [[Pipe organ#Console|console]] is "in" the organ, centered over the back wall of the organ, facing towards the altar.  It is electrically connected to a small tower organ chamber with four registers (cone chests), which is housed on the first floor of the large west tower. The organ chamber is swellable and has a sound-absorbing chamber.

=== Mutin-Cavaillé-Coll ===

The cathedral has an additional rare organ - on the north wall of the transept is a choir organ from the workshop of [[Charles Mutin|Mutin]]-[[Cavaillé-Coll]]. Built in 1898, the organ has 12 stops with three additional transmissions to the pedal. All the sounding pipes are swellable.
