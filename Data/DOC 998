<!-- Per MOS:BOLDTITLE and WP:SBE, neither the article's title nor related text appears in bold. -->On 22 April 2014, a freight train derailed near the Katongola Bridge<ref name=xinh/> in [[Haut-Lomami Province]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The train was carrying hundreds of illegal passengers at the time of the crash. As a result, 48 people were killed and over 160 injured.<ref name=sbs/>

==Background==
{{main|Rail transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The rail system of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is poorly maintained and has fallen into a state of disrepair after years of conflict within the country. Much of the system was built during the colonial period and received few upgrades since the end of Belgian rule in 1960 until a recent program financed by the [[World Bank]]. Employees of the [[Congo Railway|Congo Railway Company]] (SNCC), the country's public rail company, often sell illegal tickets to passengers to boost their income. Other people simply hop on trains as they travel to get around the country.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=alj/> Train crashes are fairly frequent as a result of the overloading and poor infrastructure.<ref name=sbs/> In 2007, more than 100 people were killed when a freight train derailed in [[Kasai Occidental]].<ref name=reuters>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/23/us-congodemocratic-crash-idUSBREA3M11420140423 |title=At least 50 killed in Congo train crash: sources |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=23 April 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2014 |archivedate=24 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424080337/https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/23/us-congodemocratic-crash-idUSBREA3M11420140423 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>

Between 10:00 and 11:00 local time (8:00–9:00 [[UTC]]) on 22 April 2014, a freight train derailed near [[Katongola]], about {{convert|65|km|mi}} north of [[Kamina]] in the [[Haut-Lomami Province]], Democratic Republic of the Congo.<ref name=sbs>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/04/25/dr-congo-train-crash-search-continues |author=AAP |title=DR Congo train crash Ssarch continues: Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo say they are still trying rescue people trapped in the mangled wreckage of a derailed train |agency=[[SBS World News]] |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |archivedate=26 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426020543/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/04/25/dr-congo-train-crash-search-continues |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=bbc/><ref name=alj/> The derailment included the train's two engines and 15 of 19 carriages.<ref name=sbs/><ref name=reuters/>

Although not a passenger train, it was carrying hundreds of passengers at the time of the crash.<ref name=bbc/> According to eyewitnesses, the train was filled with passengers both on the inside and on the roofs of the train cars.<ref name=sbs/> Although the crash occurred in the morning, rescuers did not arrive on scene until the early evening.<ref name=bbc/> Army medics and [[United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|MONUSCO]] personnel were aided by a heavy crane in their efforts to free people trapped under piles of debris.<ref name=sbs/> Initial reports said as many as 63 people had been killed in the accident, but the death toll was later revised to 48.<ref name=sbs/><ref name=bbc/> An additional 160 people were injured, 12 of them seriously.<ref name=sbs/>

==Cause==
The initial investigation suggested that the train was traveling at about {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h}}, which is above the {{convert|40|km/h|mi/h}} speed limit. The train was unable to slow sufficiently to get around a curve in the track and derailed.<ref name=bbc/> According to a government spokesman, the train apparently was speeding because of an engine failure.<ref name=alj>{{cite news|date=23 April 2014 |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/04/dozens-killed-dr-congo-train-crash-2014423153141961150.html |title=Scores killed in DR Congo train crash |agency=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=23 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archivedate=17 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817024810/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/04/dozens-killed-dr-congo-train-crash-2014423153141961150.html |df=dmy }}</ref>
