== History ==
Newspaper records show that a Port Adelaide cricket team existed in the early 1860s. The team competed briefly in the Adelaide Suburban Cricket Association before forming a local league, the Port Adelaide Cricket Association in 1882-83.

William Whitridge proposed Port Adelaide at the annual meeting of the SACA in September 1885 but the motion was defeated due to the lack of available grounds. They were admitted for season 1893-94, and in 1896 combined with the Australs to play as Port-Australs for one final season.

The club was officially formed at a meeting at the Friendly Societiesâ€™ Room in July 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacc.net.au/history|title=Port Adelaide Cricket Club|website=Port Adelaide Cricket Club|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref>
